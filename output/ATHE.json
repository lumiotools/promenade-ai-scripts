We remain steadfastly committed to developing new treatments for individuals living with neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n**2023 was a critical year for us and I am pleased to report that we hit all of our intended milestones.**\n\nWe have an extremely robust program evaluating neurodegenerative diseases with a current focus on Multiple System Atrophy, or MSA, a disease related to Parkinson’s. As a reminder, MSA is a rare and aggressive Parkinsonian disorder that rapidly progresses and causes profound disability. Although similar to Parkinson’s disease, affected individuals cannot adequately maintain their blood pressure or control bowel and bladder function – areas that drastically impair quality of life. The pathological hallmark of MSA is accumulation of the protein alpha-synuclein and neuron loss in multiple brain regions within the central nervous system. While some of the symptoms of MSA can be treated with available medications, currently there are no drugs that can slow disease progression and there is no cure.\n\n**We are looking to change the paradigm of treating MSA with our lead clinical development candidate ATH434, an orally administered agent discovered in house to target neurodegeneration.** ATH434 acts by _redistributing_ excess iron in the brain, _reducing_ the protein α-synuclein, and _rescuing_ neuronal function. Based on accumulated pre-clinical data and an understanding of how MSA develops and progresses, we believe ATH434 has excellent potential to treat MSA as well as Parkinson’s disease. Importantly, ATH434 has been granted Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) for the treatment of MSA by the U.S. FDA and the European Commission. ODD comes with many benefits including 7-10 years of market exclusivity, tax credits and fee reductions, as well as protocol assistance from each agency.\n\nOur primary Phase 2 clinical trial is a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study (ATH434-201) evaluating ATH434 in individuals with _early-stage_ MSA. I am very proud of our 201 study team for fulfilling our goals in 2023 by opening numerous clinical trial sites around the world and completing enrollment of all study participants in November 2023. **The ATH434-201 study is treating these participants for 12 months and, therefore, the study will complete in November 2024.** Once this portion of the trial is completed, we will then analyze the data and **report topline results in January 2025.**\n\nIn addition, during 2023 we also initiated a second, Phase 2 clinical trial (ATH434-202) in individuals with _more advanced_ MSA than in the 201 trial. A key aim of the 202 study is to assess the efficacy of ATH434 on objective biomarkers that measure target engagement and are relevant to the underlying pathology of MSA. While the 202 trial is also treating participants for 12-months, it has an open label design that will allow us to perform interim analyses of biomarker data while the study is ongoing, giving us a potential early indication of efficacy. **We expect to report preliminary six-month data from the initial patients enrolled in the ATH434-202 trial in the first half of this year.**\n\n**Our** **bioMUSE Natural History study also continues to generate invaluable data related to the understanding of MSA and its early presentation.** The insights gained from this study enabled us to refine the design of our ongoing Phase 2 studies, optimizing patient selection and analysis of key endpoints. Along with our academic partners at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in the U.S., we have delivered several data presentations at important neurology conferences during 2023.Important elements of the data included an enhanced understanding of MSA, new methods to diagnose and potentially treat the disease, and potential novel biomarkers for evaluating disease modifying treatments such as ATH434. We expect to report additional data from bioMUSE this year as well. \n\nIn December 2023, we presented promising new data on the effect of ATH434 in a Parkinson’s disease primate model. Personally, I am very excited about these findings because we have shown for the first time that ATH434 can reduce Parkinson’s symptoms in a higher order animal – the monkey. **Importantly, the improvements in motor skills and general functioning that parallel human parkinsonism were associated with reductions in iron in affected brain regions, validating the approach we are using in our ongoing clinical trials.**\n\nAs I have laid out above, **2024 will be a pivotal year for us.** The primate data in Parkinson’s disease has improved our ability to predict clinical outcomes and increases our overall confidence level in our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials in MSA. We are currently running two trials allowing us to study MSA populations of differing severity. Our ATH434-201 clinical trial will complete in November with topline data reported shortly thereafter. We will also be able to report preliminary data from our ATH434-202 trial in the first half of this year. And, we expect to make additional progress with bioMUSE and the advancement of ATH434 in Parkinson’s disease.\n\nThank you for your continued interest and support and we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress.\n\nDavid Stamler, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Alterity\n\n**About Alterity Therapeutics Limited**\n\nAlterity Therapeutics is a clinical stage biotechnology company dedicated to creating an alternate future for people living with neurodegenerative diseases.

These features were not observed with another iron binding agent approved for treating iron overload that was also investigated. The study was run under the direction of Dr. Daniel J. Kosman, Distinguished Professor of Biochemistry at the State University of New York at Buffalo.\n\nDavid Stamler, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Alterity, commented, “These exciting new data underscore the potential of ATH434 as a treatment for neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s disease and related disorders. We have long known that ATH434 is able to reduce labile iron which, when elevated, can drive oxidative stress. The demonstrated mitochondrial protection may reveal additional mechanisms that augment its ability to slow disease progression. We are grateful for the valued contributions from our collaborators in Dr. Kosman’s laboratory at SUNY-Buffalo.”\n\nThe study, authored by Dr. Danielle Bailey, investigated the efficacy of ATH434 and comparator agents as mitochondrial protectants using a menadione-induced model of oxidative stress in a neuronal cell line. A suite of in-solution assays detailed the mechanisms underlying ATH434’s direct antioxidant capacity. The poster presentation is attached and can be accessed on Alterity’s website under [The Science](https://alteritytherapeutics.com/the-science/) page.\n\n**About ATH434**\n\nAlterity’s lead candidate, ATH434, is an oral agent designed to inhibit the aggregation of pathological proteins implicated in neurodegeneration.

ATH434 successfully completed Phase 1 studies demonstrating the agent is well tolerated and achieved brain levels comparable to efficacious levels in animal models of MSA. ATH434 is currently being studied in two clinical trials: Study ATH434-201 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with early-stage MSA and Study ATH434-202 is an open-label Phase 2 Biomarker trial in patients with more advanced MSA.

Importantly, this Biomarker study gives us the opportunity to get an early indication of efficacy before the ATH434-201 Phase 2 study reads out. Individuals with more advanced MSA may also benefit from ATH434 and measuring key biomarkers will permit us to evaluate drug activity in this population. The data derived from the Biomarker study have the potential to accelerate the overall development program.”\n\n“An important element of our ATH434-201 trial is the use of wearable sensors to determine the impact of ATH434 on motor impairment and gait stability. During the quarter, data from the bioMUSE natural history study reinforced this measure by showing that wearable sensors can be used to assess disease progression that may not be captured by neurological examination,” concluded Dr. Stamler.\n\nThe Company’s cash position on 30 June 2023 was A$15.8M with operating cash outflows for the quarter of A$6.2M. The company anticipates the cash position will be boosted in the coming weeks with the receipt of the A$4.7M R&D Tax incentive for the 2022 fiscal year.\n\n## **Operational Activities**\n\n_ATH434–201 Phase 2 Clinical Trial_\n\nSubsequent to the quarter, on 26 July, Alterity announced that the independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) for the ATH434-201 Phase 2 study recommended the trial continue as planned. The DMC conducted a prespecified review of unblinded clinical data from an initial cohort of study participants. The DMC expressed no concerns about safety and recommended that the study continue without modification.\n\nThis randomized, double blind, placebo controlled clinical trial continues to progress with participants in both Australia and the United Kingdom now being treated. The trial is enrolling participants with early stage MSA at over 15 sites in three regions – Australia/New Zealand, the United States, and Europe. The trial is being well received by physicians across the board with feedback positive as they implement Alterity’s state of the art methods to diagnose and track the disease.\n\n_ATH434–202 Phase 2 Clinical Trial_\n\nAlterity initiated enrollment in a second Phase 2 trial of ATH434 during the quarter in participants with MSA. This open label, single arm study, entitled “A Biomarker Study of ATH434 in participants with MSA” (ATH434-202), allows Alterity to evaluate the effect of ATH434 on a MSA population more advanced than that being investigated in the randomized study. The design of the Biomarker study will allow the Company to perform interim analyses of biomarker data during conduct, with potential to provide early indications of efficacy before the randomized study reads out.\n\nThe key aim of the study is to assess the efficacy of ATH434 on objective biomarkers that measure target engagement and are relevant to the underlying pathology of disease. Clinical measures important in MSA will also be assessed.\n\n_Promising wearable sensor data from the bioMUSE Natural History Study_\n\nDuring the quarter, analysis from the Biomarkers of Progression in Multiple System Atrophy (bioMUSE) natural history study demonstrated that wearable sensors can quantify motor impairment in individuals with MSA that is not captured by neurological examination. This means that wearable sensors can be used to assess disease progression and inform clinical trials. These data were presented at the American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting. As a result of the study, Alterity has incorporated wearable sensor data into its Phase 2 clinical trial for ATH434 as one of its secondary endpoints to determine the effect of treatment on gait parameters.\n\nThe ongoing bioMUSE study will continue to provide vital information on early stage MSA, inform the selection of biomarkers suitable to evaluate target engagement and preliminary efficacy, and deliver clinical data to characterize disease progression in a population that mirrors those being studied in Alterity’s ATH434-201 trial.\n\n## **About Alterity Therapeutics Limited**\n\nAlterity Therapeutics is a clinical stage biotechnology company dedicated to creating an alternate future for people living with neurodegenerative diseases.

Alterity Therapeutics Limited\n(ASX: ATH, NASDAQ: ATHE) (“Alterity” or “the Company”), a biotechnology company dedicated to\ndeveloping disease modifying treatments for neurodegenerative diseases, releases its Appendix 4C\nQuarterly Cash Flow Report and update on company activities for the quarter ending 31st March\n2022 (Q3 FY22).\nThe Company’s cash position on 31 March 2022 was $32.6M with operating cash outflows of $3.4M.\nConsistent with the previous quarter, this was in line with company expectations and influenced\nprimarily by preparations for the commencement of the Phase 2 clinical trial for Alterity’s lead drug\ncandidate ATH434 in Multiple System Atrophy (MSA), a Parkinsonian disorder with no approved\ntherapy.\nAfter the close of the quarter, Alterity provided an important update to its clinical sites for the Phase\n2 trial with the United Kingdom Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)\naccepting Alterity’s clinical trial authorisation (CTA) request to conduct the trial. The company\nexpects to open its first clinical trial site for enrolment in New Zealand this quarter following\napproval in December 2021 by the New Zealand Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Authority\n(Medsafe). The global Phase 2 trial will also be expanded to the UK, other European countries,\nAustralia, and the United States.\nIn accordance with ASX Listing Rule 4.7C, payments made to related parties and their associates\nincluded in item 6.1 of the Appendix 4C incorporates directors’ fees, consulting fees, remuneration\nand superannuation at commercial rates.\nOperational Activities\nThe novel mechanism of action of ATH434 and its potential to treat the underlying pathology of\nmultiple Parkinsonian diseases continues to capture the attention of clinicians and scientists around\nthe world.\nIn January, the Journal of Parkinson’s Disease published ATH434 data in an animal model of MSA\nfrom a study conducted by David I. Finkelstein, Ph.D., Head of Parkinson’s Disease Laboratory at the\nFlorey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health and the University of Melbourne. This study\nindependently corroborated findings in a related study published last year.\nThe publication, entitled, “The Compound ATH434 Prevents Alpha-Synuclein Toxicity in a Murine\nModel of Multiple System Atrophy” reported the evaluation of the efficacy of ATH434 in genetically\naltered mice that develop manifestations of MSA. The investigation demonstrated that in the\nstudied brain region, ATH434 treatment reduced both the toxic oligomeric and aggregated forms\nof α-synuclein, a central nervous system protein important for normal function of nerve cells. At\nthe same time, ATH434 treatment reduced the cardinal pathology of MSA (glial cell inclusions),\nreduced brain iron, preserved neurons and improved motor performance.\nIn March, Alterity’s Chief Executive Officer David Stamler, M.D., was invited to speak at the Sachs\nAssociates 5th Annual Neuroscience Innovation Forum as part of a panel discussion on the scientific\nprogress of Parkinson’s disease and movement disorders.\nThe company continues to strengthen its intellectual property portfolio with the United States\nPatent and Trademark Office (USPTO) granting a new patent (No. 11,155,547) entitled “Compounds\nand Methods for Treating Diseases”, which covers more than 80 novel compounds and secures\nexclusivity for a new class of iron chaperones designed to redistribute the excess of iron implicated\nin many neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease.\nCorporate activity\nDuring the period, Non-Executive Directors Dr David Sinclair and Mr Tristan Edwards resigned from\nthe Board due to competing priorities and responsibilities within other organisations in which they\nare actively involved.\nCEO Dr Stamler continues to position the current and future opportunities for investors presenting\nat the HC Wainwright conference in January. The company was also selected to present at the 34th\nAnnual Roth Conference in March. Both investment banks are based in the US with their virtual\nconferences attracting investors from around the world.\nDr Stamler, CEO said: “2022 will be a transformational year for Alterity. We are growing awareness\nof our pipeline with clinicians, scientists, patient groups and investors as a potential solution to\ntreating the underlying disease of people suffering from Parkinsonian diseases. We remain highly\nfocussed on progressing towards the initiation of our first patient in the MSA Phase 2 clinical trial\nand then expanding the trial globally. We look forward to offering a potential treatment option to\nindividuals living with MSA.”\nAbout ATH434\nAlterity’s lead candidate, ATH434, is the first of a new generation of small molecules designed to\ninhibit the aggregation of pathological proteins implicated in neurodegeneration. ATH434 has been\nshown preclinically to reduce α-synuclein pathology and preserve nerve cells by restoring normal\niron balance in the brain. In this way, it has excellent potential to treat Parkinson’s disease as well\nas various forms of atypical Parkinsonism such as Multiple System Atrophy (MSA). ATH434 has\nsuccessfully completed a Phase 1 clinical trial demonstrating the agent is well tolerated, orally\nbioavailable, and achieved brain levels comparable to efficacious levels in animal models of MSA,\nwith the objective of restoring function in patients with MSA and other Parkinsonian disorders.\nATH434 has been granted Orphan designation for the treatment of MSA by the U.S. FDA and the\nEuropean Commission.\nAbout Multiple System Atrophy\nMultiple System Atrophy (MSA) is a rare, neurodegenerative disease characterized by a\ncombination of symptoms that affect both the autonomic nervous system and movement. The\nsymptoms reflect the progressive loss of function and death of different types of nerve cells in the\nbrain and spinal cord. It is a rapidly progressive disease and causes profound disability. MSA is a\nParkinsonian disorder characterized by motor impairment, autonomic instability that affects\ninvoluntary functions such as blood pressure maintenance and bladder control, and impaired\nbalance and/or coordination that predisposes to falls. A pathological hallmark of MSA is the\naccumulation of the protein α-synuclein within the support cells of the central nervous system and\nneuron loss in multiple brain regions. MSA affects approximately 15,000 individuals in the U.S., and\nwhile some of the symptoms of MSA can be treated with medications, currently there are no drugs\nthat are able to slow disease progression and there is no cure.1\n1 National Institute of Health: Neurological Disorders and Stroke, Multiple System Atrophy Fact Sheet\nAbout Alterity Therapeutics Limited\nAlterity Therapeutics is a clinical stage biotechnology company dedicated to creating an alternate\nfuture for people living with neurodegenerative diseases.

REASONSFORTHE OFFERAND USEOF PROCEEDS\nNot applicable.\nD. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk and uncertainty. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties\ndescribed below before investing in our securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we believe to be immaterial\nmay also adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of\noperations could be harmed. In that case, the daily price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. These risk\nfactors include:\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition\nWe have a history of operating losses since we began operations and expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future\nand may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe will need additional funding to complete our clinical trials and to operate our business; such funding may not be available or, if it is\navailable, such financing is likely to substantially dilute our existing shareholders.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nGovernment efforts to control the effect and spread of the COVID-19 virus have had and will have a disruptive effect on different aspects of\nour business.\n1\nWe rely on research institutions to conduct our clinical trials and we may not be able to secure and maintain research institutions to conduct\nour future trials; In addition to government efforts relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, the institutions that we work with have their own limits and\nprocedures that will influence or limit our ability to conduct research and development and the conduct of clinical trials.\nWe are faced with uncertainties related to our research.\nClinical trials as they relate to our business are expensive and time consuming and their outcome is uncertain.\nWe may experience delays in our clinical trials that could adversely affect our business and operations.\nWe may not be able to complete the development of our products candidates or develop other pharmaceutical products.\nWe may need to prioritise the development of our most promising candidates at the expense of the development of other products.\nOur research and development efforts will be seriously jeopardised if we are unable to retain key personnel and cultivate key academic and\nscientific collaborations.\nIf we are unable to successfully keep pace with technological change or with the advances of our competitors, our technology and products\nmay become obsolete or non-competitive.\nAcceptance of our products in the marketplace is uncertain and failure to achieve market acceptance will negatively impact our business and\noperations.\nWe have limited large scale manufacturing experience with our product candidates. Delays in manufacturing sufficient quantities of such\nmaterials to the required standards for pre-clinical and clinical trials may negatively impact our business and operations.\nThe failure to establish sales, marketing and distribution capability would materially impair our ability to successfully market and sell our\npharmaceutical products.\nIf healthcare insurers and other organisations do not pay for our products, or impose limits on reimbursement, our future business may\nsuffer.\nWe may be exposed to product liability claims, which could harm our business.\nBreaches of network or information technology security, natural disasters or terrorist attacks could have an adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nIf we do not obtain the necessary governmental approvals, we will be unable to commercialise our pharmaceutical products.\nWe will not be able to commercialise any current or future product candidates if we fail to adequately demonstrate their safety, efficacy and\nsuperiority over existing therapies.\nPositive results in previous clinical trials of product candidates may not be replicated in future clinical trials, which could result in\ndevelopment delays or a failure to obtain marketing approval.\nEven if approved, any product candidates that we or our subsidiaries may develop and market may be later withdrawn from the market or\nsubject to promotional limitations.\n2\nHealthcare reform measures and other statutory or regulatory changes could adversely affect our business.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nOur success depends upon our ability to protect our intellectual property and our proprietary technology, to operate without infringing the\nproprietary rights of third parties and to obtain marketing exclusivity for our products and technologies.\nWe may face difficulties in certain jurisdictions in protecting our intellectual property rights, which may diminish the value of our\nintellectual property rights in those jurisdictions.\nIntellectual property rights do not address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.\nChanges in patent laws or patent jurisprudence could diminish the value of our patents, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products\nor product candidates.\nConfidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and protect our other\nproprietary information.\nRisks Related to Our Compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002\nWe may fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of\n2002, which could adversely affect our operating results, investor confidence in our reported financial information, and the market price of our\nordinary shares and ADSs.\nMaterial weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures could negatively affect shareholder and customer confidence.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Securities\nOur stock price may be volatile and the trading markets for our securities is limited.\nOwnership interest in our company may be further diluted as a result of additional financings.\nThere is a substantial risk that we are a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, to some U.S. investors which will subject those\ninvestors to adverse tax rules\nWe do not anticipate paying dividends on our ordinary shares.\nCurrency fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our securities.\nIf we fail to maintain compliance with NASDAQ’s continued listing requirements, our shares may be delisted from the NASDAQ Capital\nMarket.\nRisks Related to Our Location in Australia\nIt may be difficult to enforce a judgment in the United States against us and our officers and directors or to assert U.S. securities laws claims\nin Australia or serve process on our officers and directors.\nAs a foreign private issuer whose shares are listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market, we may follow certain home country corporate\ngovernance practices instead of certain NASDAQ requirements.\n3\nWe currently do not have a majority of independent directors serving on our Board of Directors, which may afford less protection to our\nshareholders than if our Board of Directors had a majority of independent directors.\nAustralian takeovers laws may discourage takeover offers being made for us or may discourage the acquisition of large numbers of our\nordinary shares.\nOur Constitution and other Australian laws and regulations applicable to us may adversely affect our ability to take actions that could be\nbeneficial to our shareholders.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition\nWe have a history of operating losses since we began operations and expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable\nfuture and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe have not sufficiently advanced the development of any of our product candidates to market or generate revenues from their commercial\napplication and have incurred losses in every period since we began operations in 1997 and reported net losses of A$15,309,353, A$13,456,800 and\nA$12,337,830 during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019 respectively. As of June 30, 2021, our accumulated deficit was\nA$169,728,414. We expect to continue to incur additional operating losses over at least the next several years as we expand our research and\ndevelopment and pre-clinical activities and commence clinical trials of our product candidates that includes ATH434 for Parkinsonian diseases,\nPBT2 for alternative indications and the development of other compounds.\nOur actual cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned and will depend upon numerous factors, including:\n● the continued progress of our research and development programs;\n● the timing, scope, results and costs of nonclinical studies and clinical trials;\n● the cost, timing and outcome of regulatory submissions and approvals;\n● determinations as to the commercial potential of our product candidates;\n● our ability to successfully expand our contract manufacturing services;\n● our ability to establish and maintain collaborative arrangements; and\n● the status and timing of competitive developments.\nIf we fail to generate revenue and eventually become and remain profitable, or if we are unable to fund our continuing losses, our\nshareholders could lose all or part of their investments.\nWe will need additional funding to complete our clinical trials and to operate our business; such funding may not be available or, if\nit is available, such financing is likely to substantially dilute our existing shareholders.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2021 we raised A$35 million by means of a two tranche placement to institutions and other unrelated\nsophisticated, professional or exempt investors. In addition, we raised A$4,236,886 from the sale of our ordinary shares pursuant to our ‘At-the-\nmarket” (ATM) facility during the 2021 fiscal year and raised an additional A$17,176,040 since the end of the 2021 fiscal year. We will need to\nsecure additional financing in order to continue to meet our longer-term business objectives, including advancement of our research and development\nprograms and we may also require additional funds to pursue regulatory clearances, defend our intellectual property rights, establish commercial\nscale manufacturing facilities, develop marketing and sales capabilities and fund operating expenses. We intend to seek such additional funding\nthrough public or private financings and/or through licensing of our assets or strategic alliances or other arrangements with corporate partners.\n4\nUntil we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue to finance our cash requirements, which we may never achieve, we expect to\nfinance our cash needs primarily through public or private equity offerings, debt financings or through strategic alliances. We cannot be certain that\nadditional funding will be available on acceptable terms or at all. If we are not able to secure additional funding when needed, we may have to delay,\nreduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of our clinical trials, collaborative research or development programs or future commercialisation\ninitiatives. In addition, any additional funding that we do obtain will dilute the ownership held by our existing security holders. The amount of this\ndilution may be substantially increased if the trading price of our shares are lower at the time of any financing. Regardless, the economic dilution to\nshareholders will be significant if our stock price does not increase significantly, or if the effective price of any sale is below the price paid by a\nparticular shareholder. Any debt financing could involve substantial restrictions on activities and creditors could seek a pledge of some or all of our\nassets. We have not identified potential sources for the additional financing that we will require, and we do not have commitments from any third\nparties to provide any future financing. If we fail to obtain additional funding as needed, we may be forced to cease or scale back operations, and our\nresults, financial condition and stock price would be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe are a development stage company engaged in the development of pharmaceutical products and our success is uncertain.\nWe are a development stage company whose pharmaceutical products are designed to treat neurodegenerative diseases. We have not\nadvanced the development of any of our candidate products to market nor generated revenues from their commercial application. Our current or any\nfuture product candidates, if successfully developed, may not generate sufficient or sustainable revenues to enable us to be profitable.\nThe spread of COVID-19 and government efforts to control the effect and spread of the COVID-19 virus have had and will have a\ndisruptive effect on different aspects of our business.\nThe spread of COVID-19 has impacted the world economy and the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Jurisdictions in which\nwe conduct our business have variously imposed mandates and/or regulations or implemented measures to counter the spread of the COVID-19 virus\nto control the impact of the pandemic on public health and their respective economies.\nThese control measures collectively have changed over the course of the pandemic and are expected to continue to evolve in response to the\nchanging nature of the pandemic and its impact on public health and economic growth. Moreover, the emergence of variants of the COVID virus,\ncaused by mutations, has led to a resurgence in infections and prompted renewed uncertainty. We have been affected in a number of ways, such as\nthe way in which we operate our headquarters operations, interact with our scientists and their activities, and planning for and carrying out clinical\ntrials, all of which have experienced some short-term disruption and may suffer long-term changes in the way we will do business. Actions such as\ngovernment lock downs have slowed or, in some cases, temporarily stopped research and development activities and clinical trials. Various safety\nprotocols for personal interactions may hamper research and development activities. Since we are mostly focused on the activities related to research\nand development, we have not experienced the larger adverse economics of a slowed economy; however, we do expect that time lines for our\nresearch and development, clinical trials, regulatory approvals and bringing our products to market may cause our operational costs to be greater than\nanticipated in this current fiscal year and going forward. The financial effect will be that our development expenses may increase and we may have to\nobtain additional capital funding. Any required additional equity funding will be dilutive to the equity of our investors and debt financing will have\nrestrictive covenants that could adversely affect our business plans and operational objectives. Any further funding that we may need may not be\navailable or even if available it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us.\n5\nWe rely on research institutions to conduct our clinical trials and we may not be able to secure and maintain research institutions to\nconduct our future trials. In addition to government efforts relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, the institutions that we work with have\ntheir own limits and procedures that may influence or limit our ability to conduct research and development and the conduct of clinical\ntrials.\nOur reliance upon research institutions, including public and private hospitals and clinics, provides us with less control over the timing and\ncost of clinical trials, clinical study management personnel and the ability to recruit subjects. If we are unable to reach agreements with suitable\nresearch institutions on acceptable terms, or if any resulting agreement is terminated, we may be unable to secure, maintain or quickly replace the\nresearch institution with another qualified institution on acceptable terms.\nIn addition to the government mandates for controlling the many different health and economic effects of the COVID-19 virus and\npandemic, individual institutions with which we work, such as hospitals, laboratories and educational institutions have taken actions that have\ndisrupted the progress of our business plans and the operations of our business. Many educational institutions and laboratories curtailed or limited\naccess to their facilities since the pandemic began and; we expect that going forward there will continue to be strict limitations on access to these\ninstitutions and facilities for our researchers and research partners. Overall, changes in the way our development activities can be conducted will\nresult in delays in our conducting research activities, carrying out clinical trials and making regulatory submissions. As a consequence, we anticipate\nour costs will increase. In many respects, there is great uncertainty in the general effects resulting from the governmental and private response to the\npandemic, and only the passage of time will reveal its full effects.\nWe are faced with uncertainties related to our research.\nOur research programs are based on scientific hypotheses and experimental approaches that may not lead to desired results. In addition, the\ntimeframe for obtaining proof of principle and other results may be considerably longer than originally anticipated, or may not be possible given\ntime, resource, financial, strategic and collaborator scientific constraints. Success in one stage of testing is not necessarily an indication that a\nparticular program will succeed in later stages of testing and development. It is not possible to predict whether any of the candidate products designed\nfor these programs will prove to be safe, effective, and suitable for human use. Each candidate product will require additional research and\ndevelopment, scale-up, formulation and extensive clinical testing in humans. Unsatisfactory results obtained from any of these activities relating to a\nprogram may cause us to abandon our commitment to that program or product candidate being tested. The discovery of toxicities, lack of sufficient\nefficacy, unacceptable pharmacology, inability to increase scale of manufacture, market attractiveness, regulatory hurdles, competition, as well as\nother factors, may make our targets, lead therapies or product candidates unattractive for further development or unsuitable for human use, and we\nmay abandon our commitment to that program, target, or product candidate.\nClinical trials as they relate to our business are expensive and time consuming and their outcome is uncertain.\nIn order to obtain approvals to market a new drug product, we or our potential partners must demonstrate proof of safety and efficacy in\nhumans. To meet these requirements, we or our potential partners will have to conduct extensive non-clinical testing and “adequate and well-\ncontrolled” clinical trials. Conducting clinical trials is a lengthy, time-consuming and expensive process. The length of time may vary substantially\naccording to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of the product candidate, and often can be several years or more per trial. Even if we\nobtain positive results from such non-clinical or initial clinical trials, we may not achieve the same success in future trials. Clinical trials may not\ndemonstrate adequate safety or sufficient effectiveness to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals for product candidates employing our technology.\nThe failure of clinical trials to demonstrate safety and efficacy for a particular desired indication could harm development of that product candidate\nfor other indications as well as other product candidates.\n6\nWe expect to commence new clinical trials from time to time as our product development work continues. Any change in, or termination of,\nour clinical trials could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may experience delays in our clinical trials that could adversely affect our business and operations.\nWe do not know whether planned clinical trials will begin on time or whether we will complete any of our clinical trials on schedule or at\nall. Our ability to commence and complete clinical trials may be delayed by many factors, including:\n● government or regulatory delays, including delays in obtaining approvals from applicable hospital ethics committees and internal\nreview boards;\n● delays due to the measures for COVID-19 pandemic containment and conduct of business;\n● slower than expected patient enrollment;\n● our inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of our new proprietary compound or our other product candidates or matching\ncontrols;\n● unforeseen safety issues; or\n● lack of efficacy or unacceptable toxicity during the clinical trials or non-clinical studies.\nPatient enrollment is a function of, among other things, the nature of the clinical trial protocol, the existence of competing protocols, the size\nand longevity of the target patient population, and the availability of patients who comply with the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial. Delays in\nplanned patient enrollment may result in increased costs, delays or termination of the clinical trials. Moreover, we rely on third parties such as\nclinical research organisations to assist us in clinical trial management functions including; clinical trial database management, statistical analyses,\nsite management and monitoring. Any failure by these third parties to perform under their agreements with us may cause the trials to be delayed or\nresult in a failure to complete the trials.\nIf we experience delays in testing or approvals or if we need to perform more, larger or more complex clinical trials than planned, our\nproduct development costs will likely increase. Significant delays could adversely affect the commercial prospects of our product candidates and our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to complete the development of our products candidates or develop other pharmaceutical products.\nWe may not be able to progress with the development of our current or any future pharmaceutical product candidates to a stage that will\nattract a suitable collaborative partner for the development of any current or future pharmaceutical product candidates. The projects initially specified\nin connection with any such collaboration and any associated funding may change or be discontinued as a result of changing interests of either the\ncollaborator or us, and any such change may change the budget for the projects under the collaboration. Additionally, our research may not lead to\nthe discovery of additional product candidates, and any of our current and future product candidates may not be successfully developed, prove to be\nsafe and efficacious in clinical trials, meet applicable regulatory standards and receive regulatory approval, be capable of being produced in\ncommercial quantities at reasonable costs, or be successfully or profitably marketed, either by us or a collaborative partner. The products we develop\nmay not be able to penetrate the potential market for a particular therapy or indication or gain market acceptance among health care providers,\npatients and third-party payers. We cannot predict if or when the development of our current product candidates or any future product candidates will\nbe completed or commercialised, whether funded by us, as part of a collaboration or through a grant.\n7\nWe may need to prioritise the development of our most promising candidates at the expense of the development of other products.\nWe may need to prioritise the allocation of development resources and/or funds towards what we believe to be our most promising\ncandidate product or products. The nature of the drug development process is such that there is a constant availability of new information and data\nwhich could positively or adversely affect a product in development. We cannot predict how such new information and data may impact in the future\nthe prioritisation of the development of our current or future product candidates or that any of our products, regardless of its development stage or the\ninvestment of time and funds in its development, will continue to be funded or developed.\nOur research and development efforts will be seriously jeopardised if we are unable to retain key personnel and cultivate key\nacademic and scientific collaborations.\nOur future success depends to a large extent on the continued services of our senior management and key scientific personnel. We have\nentered into employment or consultancy agreements with these individuals. The loss of their services could negatively affect our business.\nCompetition among biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies for qualified employees is intense, including competition from larger companies\nwith greater resources, and we may not be able to continue to attract and retain qualified management, technical and scientific personnel critical to\nour success. Our success is highly dependent on our ability to develop and maintain important relationships with leading academic institutions and\nscientists who conduct research at our request or assist us in formulating our research and development strategies. These academic and scientific\ncollaborators are not our employees and may have commitments to, or consulting or advisory contracts with, other entities that may limit their\navailability to us. In addition, these collaborators may have arrangements with other companies to assist such companies in developing technologies\nthat may prove competitive to ours.\nIf we are unable to successfully keep pace with technological change or with the advances of our competitors, our technology and\nproducts may become obsolete or non-competitive.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are subject to rapid and significant technological change. Our competitors are numerous\nand include major pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology firms, universities and other research institutions. These competitors may develop\ntechnologies and products that are more effective than any that we are developing, or which would render our technology and products obsolete or\nnon-competitive. Many of these competitors have greater financial and technical resources and manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do.\nIn addition, many of our competitors have much more experience than we do in pre-clinical testing and human clinical trials of new or improved\ndrugs, as well as in obtaining regulatory approvals.\nWe know that competitors are developing or manufacturing various technologies or products for the treatment of diseases that we have\ntargeted for product development. Some of these competitive products use therapeutic approaches that compete directly with our product candidates.\nOur ability to further develop our products may be adversely affected if any of our competitors were to succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for\ntheir competitive products sooner than us.\nAcceptance of our products in the marketplace is uncertain, and failure to achieve market acceptance will negatively impact our\nbusiness and operations.\nOur current or future candidate products may not achieve market acceptance even if they are approved by regulatory authorities. The degree\nof market acceptance of such products will depend on a number of factors, including:\n● the receipt and timing of regulatory approvals for the uses that we are studying;\n● the establishment and demonstration to the medical community of the safety, clinical efficacy or cost-effectiveness of our product\ncandidates and their potential advantages over existing therapeutics and technologies; and\n● the pricing and reimbursement policies of governments and third-party payors.\n8\nPhysicians, patients, payors or the medical community in general may be unwilling to accept, use or recommend any of our products.\nWe lack the resources to manufacture any of our product candidates and rely on collaborators and third party contractors. Delays\nin manufacturing sufficient quantities of such materials to the required standards for pre-clinical and clinical trials may negatively impact\nour business and operations.\nWe lack the resources to manufacture any of our product candidates on a clinical or commercial scale and do not currently have, nor do we\nplan to acquire the infrastructure or capability internally to manufacture our clinical drug supplies for use in the conduct of our clinical trials. We rely\non collaborators and/or third parties for development, scale-up, formulation, optimisation, management of clinical trial and commercial scale\nmanufacturing and commercialisation. There are no assurances we can scale-up, formulate or manufacture any product candidate in sufficient\nquantities with acceptable specifications for the conduct of our clinical trials or for the regulatory agencies to grant approval of such product\ncandidate. We have not yet commercialized any products and have no commercial manufacturing experience. To be successful, our products must be\nproperly formulated, scalable, stable and safely manufactured in clinical trial and commercial quantities in compliance with good manufacturing\npractices (GMP) and other regulatory requirements and at acceptable costs. Should any of our suppliers or our collaborators be unable to supply or be\ndelayed in supplying us with sufficient supplies due to the COVID-19 pandemic or other causes, no assurance can be given that we will be able to\nfind alternative means of supply in a short period of time. Should such parties’ operations suffer a material adverse event, the manufacturing of our\nproducts would also be adversely affected. Furthermore, key raw materials could become scarce or unavailable. We may not be able to meet\nspecifications previously established for product candidates during scale-up and manufacturing.\nThere may be a limited number of third parties who can manufacture our products. Our reliance on third parties to manufacture our product\ncandidates will expose us and our partners to risks including the following, any of which could delay or prevent the commercialisation of our\nproducts, result in higher costs, or deprive us of potential product revenue:\n● Contract manufacturers can encounter difficulties in achieving the scale-up, optimisation, formulation, or volume production of a\ncompound as well as maintaining quality control with appropriate quality assurance. They may also experience shortages of qualified\npersonnel. Contract manufacturers are required to undergo a satisfactory GMP inspection prior to regulatory approval and are obliged to\noperate in accordance with FDA, International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of\nPharmaceuticals for Human Use (“ICH”), European and other nationally mandated GMP regulations and/or guidelines governing\nmanufacturing processes, stability testing, record keeping and quality standards. A failure of these contract manufacturers to follow\nGMP and to document their adherence to such practices or failure of an inspection by a regulatory agency may lead to significant delays\nin the availability of our product candidate materials for clinical study, leading to delays in our trials.\n● For each of our current product candidates we will initially rely on a limited number of contract manufacturers. Changing these or\nidentifying future manufacturers may be difficult. Changing manufacturers requires re-validation of the manufacturing processes and\nprocedures in accordance with FDA, ICH, European and other mandated GMP regulations and/or guidelines. Such re-validation may be\ncostly and time-consuming. It may be difficult or impossible for us to quickly find replacement manufacturers on acceptable terms, if at\nall.\n● Our contract manufacturers may not perform as agreed or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required\nto produce, store and distribute our products successfully.\n9\nThe failure to establish sales, marketing and distribution capability would materially impair our ability to successfully market and\nsell our pharmaceutical products.\nWe currently have no experience in marketing, sales or distribution of pharmaceutical products. If we develop any commercially marketable\npharmaceutical products and decide to perform our own sales and marketing activities, we will require additional management, will need to hire sales\nand marketing personnel and will require additional capital. Qualified personnel may not be available in adequate numbers or at a reasonable cost.\nFurther, our sales staff may not achieve success in their marketing efforts. Alternatively, we may be required to enter into marketing arrangements\nwith other parties who have established appropriate marketing, sales and distribution capabilities. We may not be able to enter into marketing\narrangements with any marketing partner, or if such arrangements are established, our marketing partners may not be able to commercialise our\nproducts successfully. Other companies offering similar or substitute products may have well-established and well-funded marketing and sales\noperations in place that will allow them to market their products more successfully. Failure to establish sufficient marketing capabilities would\nmaterially impair our ability to successfully market and sell our pharmaceutical products.\nIf healthcare insurers and other organisations do not pay for the products we hope to develop, or impose limits on reimbursement,\nour future business may suffer.\nThe drugs we hope to develop may be rejected by the marketplace due to many factors, including cost. The continuing efforts of\ngovernments, insurance companies, health maintenance organisations and other payors of healthcare costs to contain or reduce healthcare costs may\naffect our future revenues and profitability and those of our potential customers, suppliers and collaborative partners, as well as the availability of\ncapital. In Australia and certain foreign markets, the pricing or profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals is already subject to government control.\nWe expect initiatives for similar government control at both the state and federal level to continue in the United States and elsewhere. The adoption\nof any such legislative or regulatory proposals could adversely affect our business and prospects.\nOur ability to commercially exploit our products successfully will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for the cost of our\nproducts and related treatment will be available from government health administration authorities, private health coverage insurers and other\norganisations. Third-party payors, such as government and private health insurers, are increasingly challenging the price of medical products and\nservices. Uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products and in foreign markets, including the United\nStates. If third-party coverage is not available to patients for any of the products we develop, alone or with collaborators, the market acceptance of\nthese products may be reduced, which may adversely affect our future revenues and profitability. In addition, cost containment legislation and\nreductions in government insurance programs may result in lower prices for our products and could materially adversely affect our ability to operate\nprofitably.\nWe may be exposed to product liability claims, which could harm our business.\nThe testing, marketing and sale of human health care products also entails an inherent risk of product liability. We may incur substantial\nliabilities or be required to limit development or commercialisation of our candidate products if we cannot successfully defend ourselves against\nproduct liability claims. We have historically obtained no fault compensation insurance for our clinical trials and intend to obtain similar coverage for\nfuture clinical trials. Such coverage may not be available in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. This may result in our inability to pursue further\nclinical trials or to obtain adequate protection in the event of a successful claim. We may not be able to obtain product liability insurance in the event\nof the commercialisation of a candidate product or such insurance may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. Even if we have adequate\ninsurance coverage, product liability claims or recalls could result in negative publicity or force us to devote significant time, attention and financial\nresources to those matters.\n10\nBreaches of network or information technology security, natural disasters or terrorist attacks could have an adverse effect on our\nbusiness.\nCyber-attacks or other breaches of network or information technology (IT) security, natural disasters, terrorist acts or acts of war may cause\nequipment failures or disrupt our research and development operations. In particular, both unsuccessful and successful cyber-attacks on companies\nhave increased in frequency, scope and potential harm in recent years. Such an event may result in our inability, or the inability of our partners, to\noperate the research and development facilities, which even if the event is for a limited period of time, may result in significant expenses and/or\nsignificant damage to our experiments and trials. We have been subject, and will likely continue to be subject, to attempts to breach the security of\nour networks and IT infrastructure through cyber-attack, malware, computer viruses and other means of unauthorised access. However, to date, we\nhave not been subject to cyber-attacks or other cyber incidents which, individually or in the aggregate, resulted in a material impact to our operations\nor financial condition. While we maintain insurance coverage for some of these events, the potential liabilities associated with these events could\nexceed the insurance coverage we maintain. In addition, a failure to protect employee confidential data against breaches of network or IT security\ncould result in damage to our reputation. Any of these occurrences could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nIf we do not obtain the necessary governmental approvals, we will be unable to commercialise our pharmaceutical products.\nOur ongoing research and development activities are, and the production and marketing of our pharmaceutical product candidates derived\nfrom such activities will be, subject to regulation by numerous international regulatory authorities. Prior to marketing, any therapeutic product\ndeveloped must undergo rigorous pre-clinical testing and clinical trials and, to the extent that any of our pharmaceutical products under development\nare marketed abroad, by the relevant international regulatory authorities. For example, in Australia, principally the Therapeutics Goods\nAdministration, or TGA; the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in the United States; the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory\nAgency, or MHRA, in the United Kingdom; the Medical Products Agency, or MPA, in Sweden; and the European Medicines Agency, or EMA.\nThese processes can take many years and require the expenditure of substantial resources. Governmental authorities may not grant regulatory\napproval due to matters arising from pre-clinical animal toxicology, safety pharmacology, drug formulation and purity, insufficient efficacy, clinical\nside effects or patient risk profiles, or medical contraindications.\nFailure or delay in obtaining regulatory approvals would adversely affect the development and commercialisation of our pharmaceutical\nproduct candidates. We may not be able to obtain the clearances and approvals necessary for clinical testing or for manufacturing and marketing our\npharmaceutical product candidates.\nEven if regulatory authorities approve any of our product candidates, the manufacture, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, reporting,\ndistribution, advertising, promotion, marketing, sale, import and export of these drugs will be subject to strict and ongoing regulation. If we, our\npartners, our product candidates or the manufacturing facilities for our product candidates fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a\nregulatory agency may suspend any ongoing clinical trials; issue warning letters or untitled letters; suspend or withdraw regulatory approval; refuse\nto approve pending applications or supplements to applications; suspend or impose restrictions on operations; seize or detain products, prohibit the\nexport or import of products, or require us to initiate a product recall; seek other monetary or injunctive remedies; or impose civil or criminal\npenalties.\n11\nWe will not be able to commercialise any current or future product candidates if we fail to adequately demonstrate their safety,\nefficacy and superiority over existing therapies.\nBefore obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any of our pharmaceutical products, we must demonstrate through pre-\nclinical testing and clinical studies that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in humans for each target indication. Results from early\nclinical trials may not be predictive of results obtained in large-scale, later-stage clinical testing. Even though a candidate product shows promising\nresults in clinical trials, regulatory authorities may not grant the necessary approvals without sufficient safety and efficacy data.\nWe may not be able to undertake further clinical trials of our current and future product candidates as therapies for Parkinsonian disorders or\nother indications or to demonstrate the safety and efficacy or superiority of any of these product candidates over existing therapies or other therapies\nunder development, or enter into any collaborative arrangement to commercialise our current or future product candidates on terms acceptable to us,\nor at all. Clinical trial results that show insufficient safety and efficacy could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nPositive results in a clinical trial of a product candidate may not be replicated in future clinical trials, which could result in\ndevelopment delays or a failure to obtain marketing approval.\nPositive results in a clinical trial of a product candidate may not be predictive of similar results in future clinical trials. A number of\ncompanies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials even after achieving promising results in\nearly-stage development. Accordingly, the results from the completed pre-clinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates may not be\npredictive of the results we may obtain in later stage trials. Our clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or\nregulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials. Moreover, clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses,\nand many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in pre-clinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless\nfailed to obtain FDA or EMA approval for their products.\nEven if approved, any product candidates that we or our subsidiaries may develop and market may be later withdrawn from the\nmarket or subject to promotional limitations.\nWe may not be able to obtain the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the promotion of our product candidates if approved. We may\nalso be required to undertake post-marketing clinical trials. If the results of such post-marketing studies are not satisfactory or if adverse events or\nother safety issues arise after approval, the FDA or a comparable regulatory agency in another country may withdraw marketing authorisation or may\ncondition continued marketing on commitments from us or our subsidiaries that may be expensive or time consuming to complete. In addition, if we\nor others identify adverse side effects after any of our products are on the market, or if manufacturing problems occur, regulatory approval may be\nwithdrawn and reformulation of our or our subsidiaries’ products, additional clinical trials, changes in labeling of our or our subsidiaries’ products\nand additional marketing applications may be required. Any reformulation or labeling changes may limit the marketability of such products if\napproved.\nHealthcare reform measures and other statutory or regulatory changes could adversely affect our business.\nIn both the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the\nhealthcare system in ways that could impact our business. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and\nEducation Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “ACA”), enacted in March 2010, substantially changes the way healthcare is\nfinanced by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. With regard to pharmaceutical products,\namong other things, the ACA is expected to expand and increase industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid programs and make changes to\nthe coverage requirements under the Medicare D program. Legislative and regulatory proposals impacting upon the healthcare system are submitted\nregularly and the existing framework in force in various jurisdictions may not apply in the short to long term.\n12\nWe still cannot fully predict the impact of the ACA on our company as many of the ACA reforms require the promulgation of detailed\nregulations implementing the statutory provisions which has not yet been completed, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has publicly\nannounced that it is analyzing the ACA regulations and policies that have been issued to determine if changes should be made. In addition, although\nthe U.S. Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of most of the ACA, some states have stated their intentions to not implement certain\nsections of the ACA and some members of Congress are still working to repeal the ACA. These challenges add to the uncertainty of the changes\nenacted as part of the ACA. In addition, the current legal challenges to the ACA, as well as Congressional efforts to repeal the ACA, add to the\nuncertainty of the legislative changes enacted as part of the ACA.\nIf we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid program or other governmental pricing programs, we\ncould be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines which could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nPricing and rebate calculations vary among products and programs. The calculations are complex and will often be subject to interpretation\nby us, governmental or regulatory agencies and the courts. If we become aware that our reporting of pricing data for a prior quarter was incorrect, we\nwill be obligated to resubmit the corrected data. For the Medicaid drug rebate program, corrected data must be submitted for a period not to exceed\ntwelve quarters from the quarter in which the data originally were due. Such restatements and recalculations increase our costs for complying with\nthe laws and regulations governing the Medicaid drug rebate program and other governmental pricing programs.\nWe may be liable for errors associated with our submission of pricing data. If we are found to have knowingly submitted false pricing data\nto the Medicaid program, we may be liable for civil monetary penalties in the amount of up to U.S.$100,000 per item of false information. Our\nfailure to submit pricing data to the Medicaid program on a timely basis could result in a civil monetary penalty of U.S.$10,000 per day for each day\nthe information is late. Such failure also could be grounds to terminate our Medicaid drug rebate agreement, which is the agreement under which we\nmight participate in the Medicaid drug rebate program. In the event that our rebate agreement is terminated, federal payments may not be available\nunder Medicaid for our covered outpatient drugs. We cannot assure you that our submissions will not be found to be incomplete or incorrect.\nIf we obtain FDA approval for any of our product candidates and begin commercializing those products in the United States, our operations\nmay be directly or indirectly through our customers, subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the\nfederal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, and physician sunshine laws and regulations.\nThe pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are subject to extensive regulation, and from time to time legislative bodies and\ngovernmental agencies consider changes to such regulations that could have significant impact on industry participants. For example, in light of\ncertain highly-publicised safety issues regarding certain drugs that had received marketing approval, the U.S. Congress has considered various\nproposals regarding drug safety, including some which would require additional safety studies and monitoring and could make drug development\nmore costly. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare system reforms may prevent us from being able to generate\nrevenue, attain profitability, or commercialise our products. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from product\ncandidates that impact we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval and may affect our overall financial condition\nand ability to develop product candidates. In addition, it is possible that there will be further legislation or regulation that could harm our business,\nfinancial condition and several results of operations.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\nOur business operations may be subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations, including restrictions imposed by the U.S. Foreign Corrupt\nPractices Act (the “FCPA”). The FCPA and similar anti-corruption laws in other jurisdictions such as the U.K. Bribery Act generally prohibit\ncompanies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We\ncannot provide assurance that our internal controls and procedures will always protect us from criminal acts committed by our employees or third\nparties with whom we work. If we are found to be liable for violations of the FCPA or similar anti-corruption laws in international jurisdictions,\neither due to our own acts or out of inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others, we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties which\ncould have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n13\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nOur success depends upon our ability to protect our intellectual property and our proprietary technology, to operate without\ninfringing the proprietary rights of third parties and to obtain marketing exclusivity for our products and technologies.\nAny future success will depend in large part on whether we can:\n● obtain and maintain patents to protect our own product candidates and technologies;\n● obtain licenses to the patented technologies of third parties;\n● operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties; and\n● protect our trade secrets, know-how and other confidential information.\nPatent matters in biotechnology are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Accordingly, the availability and\nbreadth of claims allowed in biotechnology and pharmaceutical patents cannot be predicted. Any of the pending or future patent applications filed by\nus or on our behalf may not be approved, we may not develop additional proprietary products or processes that are patentable, or we may not be able\nto license any other patentable products or processes.\nOur products may be eligible for orphan designation for particular therapeutic indications that are of relatively low prevalence and for which\nthere is no effective treatment. Orphan drug designation affords market exclusivity post marketing authorisation for a product for a specified\ntherapeutic utility. The period of orphan protection is dependent on jurisdiction, for example, seven years in the United States and ten years in\nEurope. The opportunity to gain orphan drug designation depends on a variety of requirements specific to each marketing jurisdiction and can\ninclude; a showing of improved benefit relative to marketed products, that the mechanism of action of the product would provide plausible benefit\nand the nature of the unmet medical need within a therapeutic indication. It is uncertain if our products will be able to obtain orphan drug designation\nfor the appropriate indications and in the jurisdictions sought.\nThere is a risk that the U.S. Congress, for example, could amend laws to significantly shorten the exclusivity period. Once any regulatory\nperiod of exclusivity expires, depending on the status of our patent coverage and the nature of the product, we may not be able to prevent others from\nmarketing products that are similar to or interchangeable with our products, which would materially adversely affect us.\nOur commercial success will also depend, in part, on our ability to avoid infringement of patents issued to others. If a court determines that\nwe were infringing any third-party patents, we could be required to pay damages, alter our products or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain\nactivities. Licenses required under patents held by third parties may not be made available on terms acceptable to us or at all. To the extent that we\nare unable to obtain such licenses, we could be foreclosed from the development, export, manufacture or commercialisation of the product requiring\nsuch license or encounter delays in product introductions while we attempt to design around such patents, and any of these circumstances could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may have to resort to litigation to enforce any patents issued or licensed to us or to determine the scope and validity of third-party\nproprietary rights. We may have to defend the validity of our patents in order to protect or enforce our rights against a third party. Third parties may\nin the future assert against us infringement claims or claims that we have infringed a patent, copyright, trademark or other proprietary right belonging\nto them. Any infringement claim, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources and could\nnegatively affect our profitability. While defending our patents, the scope of the claim may be reduced in breadth and inventorship of the claimed\nsubject matter, and proprietary interests in the claimed subject matter may be altered or reduced. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the\ncosts of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater financial resources. Any such litigation,\nregardless of outcome, could be expensive and time consuming, and adverse determinations in any such proceedings could prevent us from\ndeveloping, manufacturing or commercialising our products and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n14\nThe patents for our product candidates have varying expiration dates and, if these patents expire, we may be subject to increased competition\nand we may not be able to recover our development costs or market any of our approved products profitably. In some of the larger potential market\nterritories, such as the United States and Europe, patent term extension or restoration may be available to compensate for time taken during aspects of\nthe product’s development and regulatory review or by procedural delays before the relevant patent office. However, such an extension may not be\ngranted, or if granted, the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded during any extension period may not be sufficient. In\naddition, even though some regulatory authorities may provide some other exclusivity for a product under their own laws and regulations, we may\nnot be able to qualify the product or obtain the exclusive time period. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension/restoration or some other\nexclusivity, we could be subject to increased competition and our opportunity to establish or maintain product revenue could be substantially reduced\nor eliminated. Furthermore, we may not have sufficient time to recover our development costs prior to the expiration of our U.S. and non-U.S.\npatents.\nWe may face difficulties in certain jurisdictions in protecting our intellectual property rights, which may diminish the value of our\nintellectual property rights in those jurisdictions.\nThe laws of some jurisdictions do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws in the United States and the\nEuropean Union, and many companies have encountered significant difficulties in protecting and defending such rights in such jurisdictions. If we or\nour collaboration partners encounter difficulties in protecting, or are otherwise precluded from effectively protecting, the intellectual property rights\nimportant for our business in such jurisdictions, the value of these rights may be diminished and we may face additional competition from others in\nthose jurisdictions.\nMany countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In addition,\nmany countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may\nhave limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of such patent. If we or any of our licensors is forced to grant a license to third\nparties with respect to any patents relevant to our business, our competitive position may be impaired and our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations may be adversely affected.\nIntellectual property rights do not address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations,\nand may not adequately permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative:\n● Others may be able to make products that are similar to ours but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own.\n● Others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or otherwise circumvent any of our technologies without\ninfringing our intellectual property rights.\n● We or any of our collaboration partners might not have been the first to conceive and reduce to practice the inventions covered by the\npatents or patent applications that we own, license or will own or license.\n● We or any of our collaboration partners might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of the patents or patent\napplications that we or they own or have obtained a license, or will own or will have obtained a license.\n● It is possible that our pending patent applications will not result in issued patents.\n● Issued patents that we own may not provide us with any competitive advantage, or may be held invalid or unenforceable, as a result of\nlegal challenges by our competitors.\n15\n● Our competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights, or in countries\nwhere research and development safe harbor laws exist, and then use the information learned from such activities to develop\ncompetitive products for sale in our major commercial markets.\n● The patents of third parties or pending or future applications of third parties, if issued, may have an adverse effect on our business.\n● Compulsory licensing provisions of certain governments to patented technologies that are deemed necessary for the government to\naccess.\nChanges in patent laws or patent jurisprudence could diminish the value of our patents, thereby impairing our ability to protect our\nproducts or product candidates.\nAs is the case with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property,\nparticularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the pharmaceutical industry involves both technological and legal complexity, it is costly,\ntime-consuming and inherently uncertain. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of\npatent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. Depending on decisions by the\nU.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in\nunpredictable ways that could weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the\nfuture. Similarly, the complexity and uncertainty of European patent laws has also increased in recent years. In addition, the European patent system\nis relatively stringent with regard to the type of amendments that are allowed during prosecution. These changes could limit our ability to obtain new\npatents in the future that may be important for our business.\nConfidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and protect our\nother proprietary information.\nWe consider proprietary trade secrets and/or confidential know-how and unpatented know-how to be important to our business. We may\nrely on trade secrets and/or confidential know-how to protect our technology, especially where patent protection is believed by us to be of limited\nvalue. However, trade secrets and/or confidential know-how can be difficult to maintain as confidential.\nTo protect this type of information against disclosure or appropriation by competitors, our policy is to require our employees, consultants,\ncontractors and advisors to enter into confidentiality agreements with us. However, current or former employees, consultants, contractors and\nadvisers may unintentionally or willfully disclose our confidential information to competitors, and confidentiality agreements may not provide an\nadequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Enforcing a claim that a third-party obtained illegally and is\nusing trade secrets and/or confidential know-how is expensive, time consuming and unpredictable. The enforceability of confidentiality agreements\nmay vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.\nFailure to obtain or maintain trade secrets and/or confidential know-how trade protection could adversely affect our competitive position.\nMoreover, our competitors may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and may even apply for patent protection in\nrespect of the same. If successful in obtaining such patent protection, our competitors could limit our use of our trade secrets and/or confidential\nknow-how.\nRisks Related to Our Compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002\nWe may fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act\nof 2002, which could adversely affect our operating results, investor confidence in our reported financial information, and the market price\nof our ordinary shares and ADSs.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 imposes certain duties on us and our executives and directors. To comply with this statute, we are required\nto document and test our internal control over financial reporting. Our efforts to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct of 2002, governing internal control and procedures for financial reporting, have resulted in increased general and administrative expenses and a\ndiversion of management time and attention, and we expect these efforts to require the continued commitment of significant resources. We may\nidentify material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our assessments of our internal control over financial reporting. Failure to maintain\neffective internal control over financial reporting could result in investigations or sanctions by regulatory authorities and could adversely affect our\noperating results, investor confidence in our reported financial information, and the market price of our ordinary shares and ADSs.\n16\nMaterial weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures could negatively affect shareholder and customer confidence.\nUnder Sarbanes-Oxley, we are required to assess the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Sarbanes-Oxley)\non an annual basis. If we were to conclude that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective, shareholder and customer confidence could\nbe negatively affected, which could have a material adverse impact on the market price of our ordinary shares and ADSs.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Securities\nOur stock price may be volatile and the. trading market for our securities is limited.\nThe market price for our securities, like that of the securities of other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, has fluctuated\nsubstantially and may continue to be highly volatile in the future. During the last two fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and subsequently until\nSeptember 2, 2021, the market price for our ordinary shares on the ASX has ranged from as low as A$0.012 to a high of A$0.410 and the market\nprice of our ADSs on the NASDAQ Capital Market has ranged from as low as U.S.$0.28 to a high of U.S.$5.15. The market price for our securities\nhas been affected by both broad market developments and announcements relating to actual or potential developments concerning products under\ndevelopment. We believe that the following factors, in addition to other risk factors described above and elsewhere in this annual report, will\ncontinue to significantly affect the market price of our ordinary shares:\n● the results of pre-clinical testing and clinical trials by us and our competitors;\n● developments concerning research and development, manufacturing, and marketing alliances or collaborations by us and our\ncompetitors;\n● announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by us and our competitors;\n● determinations regarding our patent applications, patents and those of others;\n● publicity regarding actual or potential results relating to medicinal products under development by us and our competitors;\n● proposed governmental regulations and developments in Australia, the U.S. and elsewhere;\n● litigation;\n● economic and other external factors; and\n● period-to-period fluctuations in our operating results.\nIn addition, stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations have especially affected the stock\nmarket price of many high technology and healthcare related companies, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and, in many cases,\nare unrelated to the operating performance of the particular companies. Market fluctuations, as well as general political and economic conditions,\nsuch as a recession, interest rate or currency rate fluctuations, could adversely affect the market price of our securities.\n17\nOwnership interest in our company may be further diluted as a result of additional financings.\nWe will likely seek to raise funds from time to time in public or private issuances of equity, and such financings may take place in the near\nfuture or over the longer term. In May 2011, we registered U.S.$50,000,000 of securities for public sale pursuant to our registration statement on\nForm F-3. In July 2011, we issued a prospectus under such registration statement providing for the sale of up to 50 million ordinary shares\nrepresented by 5 million ADSs pursuant to an “At-The-Market” facility. In August 2013 we issued a prospectus providing for the sale of up to\nU.S.$47,184,000 of our ordinary shares under an amended “At-The-Market” facility. On November 26, 2014, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to\nour At-The-Market Issuance Sales Agreement, to continue the at-the-market equity program under which we may from time to time sell up to an\nadditional aggregate of $50,000,000 of our ordinary shares represented by ADSs. From November 26, 2014 until June 30, 2015, we sold A$7.1\nmillion of additional ordinary shares under this program. On October 13, 2016, we entered into an At-Market Issuance Sales Agreement, for an at-\nmarket offering program under which we may from time to time sell up to an aggregate of U.S.$44,460,787 of our ordinary shares represented by\nADSs. On November 8, 2017 we entered into Amendment No. 1 to our At-Market Issuance Sales Agreement to continue the at-market offering\nprogram which we may from time to time sell up to an aggregate of $50,000,000 of our ordinary shares represented by ADSs. From July 1, 2018\nuntil July 1, 2020, we sold U.S.$5,124,764 of additional ordinary shares under this program. On December 16, 2020 we entered into Amendment No.\n2 to our At-Market Issuance Sales Agreement to continue the at-market offering program which we may from time to time sell up to an aggregate of\n$50,000,000 of our ordinary shares represented by ADSs. From February 10, 2021 to date, we sold U.S.$14,952,731 of additional ordinary shares\nunder this program. Since the inception of our At-The-Market” facility in 2011 and to date we sold an aggregate of 800,813,950 ordinary shares\nunder this facility and raised a total of A$73.9million (U.S.$62.6 million) in gross proceeds.\nWithout shareholder approval, we may not issue more than 25% of our outstanding ordinary shares in any twelve month period other than\nby a pro rata rights offering or a share purchase plan offer (of shares with a value at the issue price of up to A$15,000 per shareholder to a maximum\nof 30% of our outstanding shares) in each case to the then existing shareholders in accordance with the listing rules of the ASX. Sales of our ADSs\noffered through our “At-The-Market” facility and future equity offerings may result in substantial dilution to the interests of our current shareholders.\nThe sale of a substantial number of securities to investors, or anticipation of such sales, could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-\nrelated securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish to effect sales.\nThere is a substantial risk that we are a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, to some U.S. investors which will subject\nthose investors to adverse tax rules\nHolders of our ADSs who are U.S. residents face income tax risks. There is a substantial risk that we are a passive foreign investment\ncompany, commonly referred to as a PFIC to some U.S. investors, and a controlled foreign corporation, or CFC to other U.S. investors. Our\ntreatment as a PFIC could result in a reduction in the after-tax return to the holders of our ADSs and would likely cause a reduction in the value of\nsuch ADSs. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, we will be classified as a PFIC for any taxable year in which either (i) 75% or more of our gross\nincome is passive income, or (ii) at least 50% of the average value of all of our assets for the taxable year produce or are held for the production of\npassive income. For this purpose, cash is considered to be an asset that produces passive income. As a result of our substantial cash position and the\ndecline in the value of our stock, we believe that we became a PFIC during the taxable year ended June 30, 2005, and were classified as a PFIC\nduring each of the following fiscal years. We believe that we once again will be classified as a PFIC for the taxable year ended June 30, 2021 for\nsome U.S. investors. Highly complex rules will apply to U.S. holders owning ADSs. Accordingly, you are urged to consult your tax advisors\nregarding the application of such rules.\nWe do not anticipate paying dividends on our ordinary shares.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our ordinary shares and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future. The declaration\nof dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on various factors, including our operating results, financial\ncondition, future prospects and any other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. You should not rely on an investment in our company if\nyou require dividend income from your investment in our company. The success of your investment will likely depend entirely upon any future\nappreciation of the market price of our ordinary shares, which is uncertain and unpredictable. There is no guarantee that our ordinary shares will\nappreciate in value or even maintain the price at which you purchased your ordinary shares.\nCurrency fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our securities.\nOur ordinary shares are quoted in Australian dollars on the ASX and our ADSs trade on the NASDAQ Capital Market in U.S. dollars.\nMovements in the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate may adversely affect the U.S. dollar price of our ordinary shares. In the past year the\nAustralian dollar strengthened against the U.S. dollar. If the Australian dollar weakens against the U.S. dollar, this may negatively affect the U.S.\ndollar price of our ordinary shares, even if the price of our ordinary shares in Australian dollars decreases or remains unchanged. If the Australian\ndollar further strengthens against the U.S. dollar, the U.S. dollar price of the ordinary shares could increase, even if the price of our ordinary shares in\nAustralian dollars decreases or remains unchanged.\n18\nIf we fail to maintain compliance with NASDAQ’s continued listing requirements, our shares may be delisted from the NASDAQ\nCapital Market.\nOur ordinary shares are quoted on the ASX and our ADSs trade on the NASDAQ Capital Market. To continue to be listed on the NASDAQ\nCapital Market, we need to satisfy a number of conditions, including a minimum closing bid price per ADS of $1.00 for 30 consecutive business days\nand shareholders’ equity of at least $2.5 million.\nIf our closing bid price per ADS will fall under $1.00 and remain below $1.00 for 30 consecutive trading days, we may receive a notice of\nnoncompliance and should be provided at least 180 days to regain compliance. We could fail to meet this, or other NASDAQ continued listing\nrequirements and fail to cure such noncompliance, resulting in the delisting of our ADSs from NASDAQ. If we are delisted from NASDAQ, trading\nin our ADSs may be conducted on a market (in the United States) where an investor would likely find it significantly more difficult to dispose of, or\nto obtain accurate quotations as to the value of, our ordinary shares.\nRisks Related to Our Location in Australia\nIt may be difficult to enforce a judgment in the United States against us and our officers and directors or to assert U.S. securities\nlaws claims in Australia or serve process on our officers and directors.\nWe are incorporated in Australia. More than half of our executive officers and directors are non-residents of the United States. Therefore, it\nmay be difficult for an investor, or any other person or entity, to enforce a U.S. court judgment based upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S.\nfederal securities laws in an Australian court against us or any of those persons or to effect service of process upon these persons in the United States.\nAdditionally, it may be difficult for an investor, or any other person or entity, to enforce civil liabilities under U.S. federal securities laws in original\nactions instituted in Australia.\nAs a foreign private issuer whose shares are listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market, we may follow certain home country corporate\ngovernance practices instead of certain NASDAQ requirements.\nAs a foreign private issuer whose shares are listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market, we are permitted to follow certain home country\ncorporate governance practices instead of certain requirements of The NASDAQ Stock Market Rules, with regard to, among other things, the\ncomposition of the board of directors and its committees, director nomination process, compensation of officers and quorum at shareholders’\nmeetings. In addition, we may choose to follow Australian law instead of The NASDAQ Stock Market Rules that require that we obtain shareholder\napproval for certain dilutive events, such as for the establishment or amendment of certain equity based compensation plans, an issuance that will\nresult in a change of control of the company, certain transactions involving issuances of a 20% or more interest in the company and certain\nacquisitions of the stock or assets of another company. A foreign private issuer that elects to follow a home country practice instead of NASDAQ\nrequirements must submit to NASDAQ in advance a written statement from an independent counsel in such issuer’s home country certifying that the\nissuer’s practices are not prohibited by the home country’s laws. In addition, a foreign private issuer must disclose in its annual reports each such\nrequirement that it does not follow and describe the home country practice followed by the issuer instead of any such requirement. Accordingly, our\nshareholders may not be afforded the same protection as provided under NASDAQ’s corporate governance rules. As of the date of this report, we\nhave elected to follow home country practices instead of the following NASDAQ requirements:\n● the Rule related to Audit Committee Composition rule 5605(c)(2)(A)): we may have an audit committee composed of two members\ninstead of “at least three members”. We may not follow NASDAQ rules regarding independence of such members (as long as comply\nRule 10A-3(b)(1) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, subject to the exemptions provided in rule 10A-3(c)), and we may not\nhave a financially sophisticated member as defined.\n19\n● the Rule requiring maintaining a majority of independent directors (Rule 5605(b)(1))\n● the Rule requiring that our independent directors have regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present\n(Rule 56505(b)(2)\n● the Rule regarding independent director oversight of director nominations process for directors (Rule 5605(e)\n● the Rule regarding independent director oversight of executive officer compensation (Rule 5605(d)\n● the requirement to obtain shareholder approval for the establishment or amendment of certain equity based compensation plans (Rule\n5635(c), an issuance that will result in a change of control of the company (Rule 5635(b), certain transactions other than a public\noffering involving issuances of a 20% or more interest in the company (Rule 5635(d) and certain acquisitions of the stock or assets of\nanother company (Rule 5635(a)).\nWe currently do not have a majority of independent directors serving on our Board of Directors, which may afford less protection\nto our shareholders than if our Board of Directors had a majority of independent directors.\nAs of the date of this annual report, a majority of our directors did not satisfy the standards for independence as specified by the SEC and\nthe listing standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market pursuant to which we evaluate director independence. If our Board of Directors is not made up of a\nmajority of independent directors, there may be a lower level of oversight on executive management, and our Board of Directors may be influenced\nby the concerns, issues or objectives of management, including compensation and governance issues, to a greater extent than would occur with a\nmajority of independent directors. As a result, the composition of our Board of Directors may afford less protection to our shareholders than if our\nBoard of Directors were composed of a majority of independent directors.\nA lack of independent directors may also make it difficult to create board committees meeting the requirements of our board committee\ncharters and the NASDAQ Rules pursuant to which we evaluate director independence. Historically, we have strived to have an audit committee\ncomprised of at least three independent directors and other board committees comprised solely of independent directors. Currently, our audit\ncommittee has only two members, both of who are independent under the NASDAQ Rules and applicable SEC requirements. Due to the lack of\nindependent directors, it may be difficult to establish effective operating board committees comprised of independent members to oversee committee\nfunctions. This structure gives our executive officers additional control over certain corporate governance issues, including compensation matters and\naudit issues for internal control and reporting purposes, with more limited oversight of our executive officers’ decisions and activities.\nAustralian takeovers laws may discourage takeover offers being made for us or may discourage the acquisition of large numbers of\nour ordinary shares.\nWe are incorporated in Australia and are subject to the takeover’s laws of Australia. Among other things, we are subject to the Australian\nCorporations Act 2001, or the Corporations Act. Subject to a range of exceptions, the Corporations Act prohibits the acquisition of a direct or indirect\ninterest in our issued voting shares if the acquisition of that interest will lead to a person’s voting power in us increasing from 20% or below to more\nthan 20%, or increasing from a starting point that is above 20% and below 90%. Australian takeovers laws may discourage takeover offers being\nmade for us or may discourage the acquisition of large numbers of our ordinary shares. This may have the ancillary effect of entrenching our board of\ndirectors and may deprive or limit our shareholders’ strategic opportunities to sell their ordinary shares and may restrict the ability of our\nshareholders to obtain a premium from such transactions.\n20\nOur Constitution and other Australian laws and regulations applicable to us may adversely affect our ability to take actions that\ncould be beneficial to our shareholders.\nAs an Australian company we are subject to different corporate requirements than a corporation organized under the laws of the United\nStates. Our Constitution, as well as the Corporations Act, set forth various rights and obligations that are unique to us as an Australian company.\nThese requirements operate differently than from many U.S. companies and may limit or otherwise adversely affect our ability to take actions that\ncould be beneficial to our shareholders. For more information, you should carefully review the summary of these matters set forth under the section\nentitled, “Item 10.B - Additional Information - Memorandum and Articles of Association” as well as our Constitution.\nITEM 4.INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY\nA. HISTORYAND DEVELOPMENTOFTHE COMPANY\nOur legal and commercial name is Alterity Therapeutics Limited (formerly Prana Biotechnology Limited). We were incorporated under the\nlaws of the Commonwealth of Australia on November 11, 1997 and began limited operations shortly thereafter. On April 8, 2019, we changed our\nname to Alterity Therapeutics Limited. Our registered office is located at Level 3, 62 Lygon Street, Carlton, Victoria, 3053, Australia and our\ntelephone number is +-61-3-9824-5254. Our principal executive office is located at Level 3, 460 Bourke Street, Melbourne, VIC 3000, Australia and\nour telephone number is +-61-3-9349-4906. Our website address is www.alteritytherapeutics.com. The information in our website is not incorporated\nby reference into this annual report.\nAlterity is developing first-in-class therapies to treat neurodegenerative diseases. Our lead drug candidate, ATH434 (formerly PBT434), is\nthe first of a new generation of small molecules designed to block the accumulation and aggregation of α-synuclein. Alpha-synuclein, when\naggregated in the brain, is a pathological hallmark of Parkinsonian conditions and is considered an important biologic target for treating these\nneurodegenerative diseases.\nATH434 has demonstrated pre-clinical evidence as a potential treatment of MSA and produced encouraging results in its Phase 1 clinical\nprogram, which was completed last year. We are in the preparatory phase of planning for Phase 2 clinical trial.\nOther potential applications for our proprietary compounds include the treatment or amelioration of neurodegenerative disorders such as\ntauopathies, Motor Neuron disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (the human variant of Mad Cow disease), certain cancers, age-related macular\ndegeneration, or antibiotic resistance.\nOur technology is the outcome of many years of intense research from leading scientists in the area of neurodegenerative disorders and other\ndiseases. In July 2009, a patent claiming ’8-Hydroxyquinoline derivatives’ which claims our principal clinical drug asset, PBT2, as well as other\n8-Hydroxyquinoline compounds, was granted by the European Patent Office (EPO). Since the date of that grant, similar patents were granted in other\njurisdictions including in the United States, Japan, China, South Korea and Russia. These patents claim the composition of matter and the uses of\nsuch compounds for the treatment of neurological diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease and Huntington disease. The patents are due to expire in\nJuly 2023, except in the United States where the patent is due to expire in December 2025. In December 2011, claims for our key patent protecting\nour product candidate for Parkinson’s disease, PBT434 were granted in the United States. The patent is entitled ‘Neurologically Active Compounds’\nand covers the composition of matter and pharmaceutical compositions of selected families of 8-hydroxyquinazolinone compounds, including\nPBT434. It had also been granted in other jurisdictions including in Europe, China and Japan.\nOur technology has progressed to yield a diversified library of chemical compounds, which may yield future product candidates across\nvarious neurodegenerative and other indications.\nFuture clinical studies with PBT2 may depend on the either lifting the Partial Clinical Hold (PCH) which currently restricts drug exposure\nlevels and/or the possible development of PBT2 for new therapeutic indications. See “Item 4.B. – Information on the Company – Business Overview\n– Clinical Trials for Our Product Candidates”).\nSince inception, we have not been required to invest material amounts for capital expenditures since our development efforts have taken\nplace at research facilities operated by institutions with which we have relationships. In the three fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, our capital\nexpenditures have totaled A$34,238.\n21\nB. BUSINESS OVERVIEW\nAlterity’s Background\nMedical science has made a significant number of breakthroughs over the past century. The average life span in western cultures has\nsubstantially increased. The diseases associated with aging have, however, yet to be fully understood or effectively treated. It is now believed that a\nnumber of age-related diseases may be capable of being treated.\nThe protein believed to be involved in the toxicity associated with Alzheimer’s disease is beta amyloid. Very little was known about beta-\namyloid protein until 1984 when Professors Colin Masters, Konrad Beyreuther and the late Dr. George Glenner sequenced the chemistry of the\nprotein which has since become the dominant focus of Alzheimer’s disease research world-wide. In 1987, Professors Masters, Beyreuther and Rudi\nTanzi of Harvard Medical School discovered how beta-amyloid was produced and in 1994, Professor Ashley Bush of the Melbourne Dementia\nResearch Centre and formerly of Harvard Medical School discovered that the interaction between metals and beta-amyloid is associated with the\ntoxicity seen in Alzheimer’s disease, hopefully paving the way for the development of therapeutic drugs to treat the disease.\nOur technology has been developed over an extended period and continues to develop through the collaborative efforts of highly regarded\nscientists, both company employees as well as representatives of research institutions in this field. These institutions include:\n● The University of Melbourne, Department of Pathology\n● Massachusetts General Hospital\n● The Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health in Melbourne\n● University of California, San Francisco\n● The University of Pavia\n● Vanderbilt University\n● State University of New York at Buffalo\n● Stanford University\nWork conducted at the University of Melbourne and MGH demonstrated that clioquinol, codenamed PBT1, had potential efficacy for the\ntreatment of Alzheimer’s disease. Since completing our initial public offering and listing process of our ordinary shares on the ASX on March 28,\n2000, we historically concentrated our resources toward the pursuit of our disease targets and creation of a chemical library of proprietary molecules.\nOur research efforts led to the discovery of a novel compound, PBT2, a low molecular weight chemical entity that has demonstrated significant pre-\nclinical activity, and we currently have over 800 validated compounds from different chemical scaffolds in our chemical library. More recently, our\nresearch efforts have focused on identifying novel compounds that bind and redistribute labile iron that is increased in Parkinsonian diseases and\nthought to be implicated in their pathogenesis.\nOur chemistry program is undertaken within laboratories leased from The University of Melbourne’s Bio21 Molecular Science and\nBiotechnology Institute, which is a multidisciplinary research center that specializes in medical, agricultural and environmental biotechnology.\nAccommodating more than 500 research scientists, students and industry participants, the Bio21 Institute is one of the largest biotechnology research\ncenters in Australia.\n22\nCandidate product discovery and translational Biology Programs\nWe regard our intellectual property as a “platform technology” since we believe that it addresses the causes of a broad spectrum of\nneurodegenerative and age-related diseases based on the interrelationship of metals and proteins. Historically, the majority of our research efforts\nhave been directed at research into potential therapeutics for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington disease and Parkinsonian movement\ndisorders. Published data together with our initial findings have provided strong indications that the pathology for other certain age-related and\ndegenerative disorders may also be based on the inter-relationship between certain metals and proteins, and we believe that the platform technology\nmay also be applicable for certain cancers, age-related macular degeneration, Motor Neuron disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and other\nneurodegenerative diseases. To date, we have performed in vivo evaluations of our product candidates in a range of mouse animal models including\nmodels of Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington disease, Parkinsonian diseases, brain cancer and traumatic brain injury.\nProduct candidates are selected from our chemical library on the basis of rational drug design. Product candidates are designed to fulfill very\nspecific criteria such as oral bioavailability and ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, and demonstrate significant effectiveness in both nonclinical\nin vitro and in vivo testing.\nTo increase depth and breadth of our pipeline into new neurodegenerative indications, we have continued to develop our ‘two tier’\nTranslational Research program structure during the past year. The first tier encompasses core new chemical entity design, synthesis and\ncharacterization, the ‘discovery phase’ of the new entities as potential novel agents of interest based on their mechanism of action profile. Our\ndiscovery research has established Structure Activity Relationships (“SAR”) within chemical moieties that guide our chemists towards the design of\nnovel therapeutics. The discovery phase also includes preliminary bioavailability and metabolic characterization. The second tier comprises\n‘translational’ animal modeling programs to test and validate new candidates as potential development product candidates. To date, our chemical\nlibrary includes more than 800 novel compounds. Using SAR that has been developed over years of testing and validation by Alterity scientists, new\ncompounds are being generated that retain functionality across diverse and novel chemical scaffolds.\nOver the last few years, new compounds from several scaffolds were synthesised and began mechanistic profiling. The compounds are\ninitially screened for activity in biological systems relevant to the candidate diseases we are targeting. New screens are being investigated that will\nassess the ability of a compound to intercede in the steps thought to underly the pathogenesis of target diseases. Such steps include pathologic protein\naggregation and downstream activities such as oxidative stress and cell death. Promising candidates arising from the Translational Research program\nmay be progressed as back up compounds in Parkinsonian diseases and/or new indications in neurodegeneration including orphan diseases.\nAs a result of our candidate discovery program, in November 2020, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) Allowed and\nthen Granted in July 2021 a new composition of matter patent. The new patent is central to our next generation drug development portfolio focused\non neurodegenerative diseases. The patent, entitled “Imidazo [1,5-A] pyridine compounds and their Use” (No. 10,941,143), covers more than 150\nnovel pharmaceutical compositions that are designed to redistribute the labile iron implicated in Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease and other\nneurodegenerative conditions.\nIn August 2021, we secured a second, separate patent over a new class of iron chaperones, a technology capable of redistributing excess iron\nin the central nervous system. The structural backbone depicted in the patent provides the foundation for small molecule drug candidates with\npotential to cross the blood brain barrier and directly attack a source of neuropathology. The patent application, entitled “Compounds for and\nMethods of Treating Diseases” (No. 17/239,375) covers more than 80 novel compounds.\nParkinson’s Disease and Movement Disorders\nParkinson’s disease, another neurodegenerative disease of the aging population, causes a progressive slowing of movement, tremors and the\nloss of fine motor control due to the death of substantia nigra cells in the brain. These cells produce the neurotransmitter dopamine in the brain,\nwhich is required for normal motor control. Existing therapies, such as dopaminergic agents, may provide symptomatic relief, but do not address the\nunderlying cause of the disease. We believe that drug candidates in our library may affect the aggregation of the proteins implicated in the pathology\nof Parkinson’s disease and related movement disorders.\n23\nDuring 2005, we entered into a contractual arrangement with the Integrative Neuroscience Facility based at the Florey Institute of\nNeuroscience and Mental Health in Melbourne, or the Florey Institute, to assist in the efficacy evaluation of novel compounds in models relevant to\nParkinson’s disease, specifically the 6-hydroxydopamine mouse model and the MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) mouse model.\nThe toxins used in these two mouse models mimic the disease by causing impairment of the cells of the substantia nigra, the area of the brain\nprimarily affected in Parkinson’s disease, and subsequent loss of motor function. During 2009 and 2010, our lead Parkinson’s disease treatment\ncandidate emerged, ATH434, (formerly known as PBT434) based on significant improvement in motor function and coordination in both models. Of\nnote, ATH434 improved relevant indices when administered after toxins had destroyed significant amounts of substantia nigra tissue, indicating that\nthe compound can restore and maintain normal neuronal function. During 2011, further mechanistic characterisation work demonstrated that\nATH434 reduced the accumulation of the target protein in Parkinson’s disease, alpha-synuclein.\nIn August 2011, the New York-based Michael J. Fox Foundation awarded us a $206,000 grant entitled, ‘ATH434, a Novel Neuroprotective\nDrug For Parkinson’s Disease; Completion of Pre-Clinical Studies to Enable Human Clinical Trials.’ The research supported by this grant has\nincluded various nonclinical studies (safety pharmacology, general toxicology, genetic toxicology), the results of which allowed the compound to be\npositioned for Phase 1 clinical trials in healthy volunteers and larger scale animal toxicology studies that will enable clinical trials in applicable\nsubjects.\nIn November 2012, our scientists, Associate Professor Robert Cherny and Associate Professor David Finkelstein, Head of the Synaptic\nNeurobiology laboratory at the Florey Institute, received an NHMRC grant to study the benefits of ATH434 in a program entitled, “Identifying the\nmechanisms of action of a novel 8-hydroxyquinazolinone in models of Parkinson’s disease.” The program helped elucidate some of the innate\nmechanisms of action of ATH434.\nIn June 2013, our science was highlighted at the 17th Movement Disorders Congress of Parkinson’s Disease and Movement Disorders, in\nSydney, Australia. Professor Colin Masters, Director of The Mental Health Research Institute at the Florey Institute and Assoc. Professor David\nFinkelstein presented data showing that ATH434 prevented the aggregation of alpha synuclein, the protein target in Parkinson’s and other movement\ndisorders. The ability of ATH434 to reduce alpha-synuclein accumulation has highlighted the potential for ATH434 to treat other movement\ndisorders characterized by the over expression alpha-synuclein including the orphan disease Multiple System Atrophy, which is a rare form of\n“atypical parkinsonism”.\nMechanistic work has demonstrated that ATH434 reduces oxidative stress and inhibits the aggregation of toxic α-synuclein species. Part of\nthis investigation was supported by Parkinson’s UK grant of £150,000, awarded in 2013 to Leeds University in collaboration with Associate\nProfessors David Finkelstein and Robert Cherny of the Florey Institute. In 2017, Drs. Finkelstein, Cherny and colleagues published data indicating\nthat ATH434 prevented cell death in the substantia nigra in a dose-dependent manner. The data also demonstrated the therapeutic potential of\nATH434 to slow neurodegeneration with results in multiple Parkinson’s disease models, including a transgenic model of Parkinson’s disease (A53T)\nin which mice over-expressed the alpha-synuclein protein. In A53T mice, animals treated with ATH434 exhibited significantly increased numbers of\ns. nigra neurons and a significant reduction in insoluble α-synuclein and incidence of clasping behavior. These results showed that ATH434 lowered\nalpha-synuclein, preserved neurons and simultaneously improved motor performance. The paper was entitled, “The novel compound ATH434\nprevents iron mediated neurodegeneration and alpha-synuclein toxicity in multiple models of Parkinson’s disease” and was published in Acta\nNeuropathol Comm.\nIn February 2021, a second grant was awarded by the Michael J. Fox Foundation. The U.S.$495,000 funding is being used to evaluate the\npharmacologic profile of ATH434 in a primate model to determine the optimal doses of ATH434 in future Parkinson’s disease clinical trials.\nATH434 has also been profiled in mouse models of atypical Parkinsonian conditions, including orphan diseases such as Multiple System\nAtrophy (MSA) and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, a tauopathy. In an animal model of MSA, ATH434 prevents α-synuclein aggregation and\npreserves neurons in the substantia nigra and decreased the number of glial cell inclusions in the brains of treated animals. Glial cell inclusions are\nthe pathological hallmark of MSA and contain abundant aggregated α-synuclein that is associated with neurodegeneration. The pathologic benefits\nwere associated with improved motor function in treated animals.\n24\nA comprehensive nonclinical program to evaluate ATH434’s profile to support clinical development is ongoing. ATH434 had no relevant\noff-target binding activity in a broad panel of protein interactions. ATH434 did not have significant inhibitory activity of the hERG channel relevant\nto expected human plasma concentrations in a GLP study. ATH434 is subject to diverse metabolic pathways and is brain penetrant. ATH434 was\nwell-tolerated in safety pharmacology studies (GLP cardiovascular, respiratory and central safety pharmacology studies in rat). Long term toxicology\nand metabolism studies to support patient studies are nearing completion.\nAlzheimer’s disease\nPBT2, our product candidate for Alzheimer’s disease, is the result of rational drug design and was built “from the ground up” to fulfill very\nspecific criteria. It was designed so that it will be orally bioavailable and cross the blood-brain barrier and to have an improved safety and efficacy\nprofile compared to the prototype MPAC, PBT1. Phase I trials for PBT2 were completed by February 2006 in healthy young and aged volunteers and\ndemonstrated that the drug was well tolerated and suitable for Phase II clinical development.\nIn 2008, top line results for a Phase IIa clinical study in mild Alzheimer’s disease patients were announced, including the primary endpoints\nof safety and tolerability being met together with several secondary endpoints in biomarker and cognition endpoints also being met. In November\n2009, an erratum to the July 2008 edition of The Lancet Neurology journal was published that corrected the original results of the neuropsychological\ntest battery, or NTB, arising from the Phase IIa trial. The corrected results show that the overall executive function domain of the NTB, comprising\nfive cognitive tests, was significantly improved for those patients taking 250mg of PBT2 compared to patients on placebo.\nIn July 2008, the results of extensive pre-clinical research findings for PBT2 were published in the journal Neuron. The paper by Alterity\nscientist, Associate Professor Paul Adlard was entitled, “Rapid restoration of cognition in Alzheimer’s transgenic mice with 8-hydroxyquinoline\nanalogs is associated with decreased interstitial Aβ”. The key findings included the demonstration that PBT2 could rapidly improve cognition in\ntransgenic mice, prevent the formation of toxic soluble Abeta oligomers, lower the Abeta levels in the brain of transgenic mice and protect neurons\nfrom the toxic effect of Abeta at the synapses between neurons enabling improved neurotransmission. In March 2009, we published further data on\nthe impact of PBT2 on synapses in transgenic animal models. The findings demonstrated that PBT2 could prevent the loss of synapses in these\nAlzheimer’s disease animal models, indicating that PBT2 has a potent neuroprotective effect on neurons, consistent with the observation that PBT2\ncan improve cognitive performance in impaired transgenic animals.\nDuring 2009 and 2010, our scientists further examined the apparent link between aging and disease related defects due to metal imbalances\nin the brain. In February 2010, we reported in The Journal of Neuroscience on the loss of synaptic zinc uptake mechanisms in aged animal models\nand how this correlated with cognitive impairment. Our scientists also investigated the molecular basis for the neuroprotective qualities of PBT2 in\nanimal models of Alzheimer’s disease. They found that several important intracellular signaling pathways required for neuronal function were\nstimulated when animals were treated with PBT2. In March 2011, we reported in the scientific journal PLoS ONE that in the same Alzheimer’s\nanimal model where PBT2 is able to significantly improve cognition, it also caused changes in the brain anatomy. Specifically, it was observed that\nPBT2 treatment had significantly increased the numbers of spines on the branches (or dendrites) of neurons in the hippocampus, a memory centre\naffected in Alzheimer’s disease. Increasing the number of spines permits many more neurons to interconnect with any particular neuron thereby\nincreasing the brain’s capacity to carry out learning and memory functions. These findings provide an insight into how PBT2 helps preserve and\nprotect neurons in Alzheimer’s disease and also in animal models of Huntington disease.\nIn March 2011, we announced that the New York-based Alzheimer’s Drug Discovery Foundation would make a $700,000 project-based\ninvestment towards a Phase II imaging biomarker study in 40 patients with prodromal or mild Alzheimer’s disease. In March 2014, top line results\nfor the study were announced. The study entailed the use of an amyloid imaging ligand to detect changes in brain beta-amyloid burden after 52 weeks\ntreatment with PBT2 or placebo. For more information, see Item 4.B. “Information on the Company - Business Overview - Clinical Trials for Our\nProduct Candidates.”\n25\nIn September 2011, new data was published on how the ability of PBT2 to transport and deliver zinc and copper in the brain contributes to\nmechanisms related to its anti-toxic effects of Alzheimer’s disease, including inhibition of beta-amyloid aggregation and promotion of the activation\nof GSK3 protein, an important brain protein suggested to be involved in Alzheimer disease. In addition, one of our research scientists, Associate\nProfessor Paul Adlard, received an Australian National Health and Medical Research Council, or NHMRC, grant to study the benefits of PBT2 and\nother compounds in age-related cognitive impairment in a program entitled, “The role of metals in healthy brain aging: identification of novel\ncompounds to prevent age-related cognitive decline.” The grant provided an opportunity to explore the importance of metal distribution imbalances\nin the brain to both cognitive deficits with aging and Alzheimer disease. Also in October 2011, our scientist and co-inventor of PBT2, Associate\nProfessor Kevin Barnham, was awarded a NMHRC grant to explore how PBT2’s copper binding and transport activity can inhibit brain\nexcitotoxicity, which is the overstimulation of certain chemical neurotransmitter receptors on neurons (NMDA receptors). Excitotoxicity is a\ncommon feature in the brains of patients affected by neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and Huntington disease. In March\n2012, our Chief Scientific Advisor, Professor Rudolph E. Tanzi, published an important body of work on the role of brain metals in the etiology of\nAlzheimer’s disease, supporting Alterity’s therapeutic strategy. The paper was entitled, ‘The Zinc Dyshomeostasis Hypothesis of Alzheimer’s\ndisease’ published in PLoS ONE in March 2012.\nIn March 2013, Associate Professor Paul Adlard, presented a paper entitled, “Metal Chaperones are novel therapeutic agents for tauopathy.”\nThe findings presented exemplified that the ability of PBT2 to intercede in aberrant metal and target protein interactions and to correct abnormal\nmetal distribution in the brain resulted in PBT2 being able to prevent the formation of ‘tangle like’ inclusions in neurons in a mouse model. Tau\ntangles are known to cause neuronal death. This work builds upon the knowledge that PBT2 can prevent the metal mediated toxic gain of function of\ntarget proteins such as Abeta and tau to form harmful aggregates in the brain. The data was generated in transgenic mouse model of tauopathy and\ndemonstrated a significant decrease in tau tangle formation, a significant increase in cortical and hippocampal neurons and significant increase in\ncognitive performance as measured by the Y-maze.\nIn October 2013, Associate Professor Adlard also published a paper on the ability of PBT2 to restore learning and memory in aged mice.\nHis paper, entitled “A Novel Approach To Rapidly Prevent Age-Related Cognitive Decline” and published in the journal Aging Cell, demonstrated\nthat PBT2 could restore the cognition of aged mice to that of young, cognitively normal mice. Age-related cognitive decline is associated with\nmeasurable structural and biochemical changes in the brain, which Alterity scientists have shown to be significantly improved by PBT2\nadministration. Importantly, it has been shown that PBT2 increased expression of markers of neurogenesis and increased synaptic density which in\nturn, correlated with improved performance on memory tasks.\nThe underlying mechanisms of action of PBT2 work to prevent metal mediated neurodegenerative processes including oxidative stress,\nformation of toxic amyloid oligomers and compromised neuronal and synaptic function leading to cognitive impairment. In Alzheimer’s disease,\nbeta-amyloid aggregates in the synaptic cleft have been associated with impaired synaptic transmission as evidenced by reduced Long Term\nPotentiation experiments (LTP) in mice. Alterity scientists have published that PBT2 is able to inhibit the beta-amyloid induced inhibition of LTP,\nthus restoring synaptic capability and cognitive function. In February 2015, a new mechanism of action of PBT2 was published in Neurobiology of\nDisease which demonstrated the ability of PBT2 to protect against glutamate-induced (synaptic) excitotoxicity in a metal dependent manner. The\npaper was entitled, “PBT2 inhibits glutamate-induced excitotoxicity in neurons through metal-mediated preconditioning”. The over excitation of\nNMDA receptors in glutamatergic neurons leads to mitochondrial damage and cell death and has been postulated as one of the pathological events in\nAlzheimer’s disease and Huntington disease. Further elucidation of the protective role of PBT2 is required, however it appears that the zinc\nionophore property of PBT2 works to increase intracellular zinc in the post synaptic terminal, triggering the release of calcium which in turn, leads to\nneuroprotective pathways being activated inside the neuron that prevent excitotoxicity. Over recent years, the ability of PBT2 to reduce the\nphosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein ‘tau” has been demonstrated in new in vitro screening assays and modelled in transgenic mice.\nPhosphorylated tau is deposited in cells as fibrillar aggregates in numerous neurodegenerative diseases, notably Alzheimer’s disease and also\nHuntington disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. The functions of tau are regulated by site-specific phosphorylation events, which are\ndysregulated in the disease state, resulting in tau dysfunction and mislocalization. This can lead to aggregation, neuronal dysfunction and death.\nUnpublished data show that PBT2 can reduce tau phosphorylation and improve cognitive function in a transgenic tau mouse model.\n26\nHuntington disease\nHuntington disease is a crippling genetic neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system caused by a mutation in a gene which\nencodes the huntingtin protein. The disease results in progressive deterioration of physical, cognitive and emotional abilities that lead to severe\nincapacitation and eventually death, generally 15-25 years after the onset of the disease. Huntington disease primarily affects adults, usually between\nthe ages of 30 and 50.\nUS-based researchers have presented the effects of clioquinol in an animal model of Huntington disease, showing evidence of improved\nbehavior, motor skills and inhibition of the abnormal form of the Huntingtin protein. Based on these findings, we have tested several proprietary\ncompounds in collaboration with researchers based at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center and the Department of Neurology, University of\nCalifornia, San Francisco, under a collaborative research agreement. PBT2 has shown good efficacy in the R6/2 mouse model of Huntington disease.\nIn late July 2008, we received the findings from a report commissioned by us from US-based clinical researchers on the suitability of PBT2\nfor Huntington disease. The report detailed the relevance of animal modeling experiments done with PBT2, its demonstrated mode of action in the\nbrains of Huntington disease model mice and its promising safety and efficacy findings in the earlier Alzheimer’s disease Phase IIa study with PBT2.\nThe report recommended that we proceed to clinical trials in Huntington disease research participants.\nIn July 2010, we presented data emerging from our research and development that the neuroprotective qualities of our product candidate\nPBT2 indicated that it may have clinical application in Huntington disease patients in addition to Alzheimer’s disease. At the International\nConference on Alzheimer’s disease in Hawaii, Associate Professor Robert Cherny described how PBT2 prolonged survival, increased motor strength\nand delayed involuntary limb clenching that otherwise presents in the transgenic mouse model of Huntington disease. In addition, PBT2 appears to\nprevent the aggregation of the hallmark toxic mutant huntingtin protein. Examination of the brains of transgenic mice revealed that PBT2 had a\nsignificant impact on preventing the degeneration of neurons, providing further evidence of the neuroprotective attributes of PBT2 that had been\nreported earlier in our work on Alzheimer’s disease.\nIn December 2010, our management assembled a team to develop a Phase IIa clinical trial protocol for the treatment of Huntington disease\nwith PBT2. The Company comprised leading clinical researchers from Australia and the United States, including members from the Huntington\nStudy Group based in the United States and Australia. The team designed a six month Phase IIa clinical trial testing PBT2, or the Reach2HD Trial,\nwhich included a randomized, double blind placebo controlled study of patients with early to mid-stage Huntington disease. For additional details\nregarding the clinical trial in Huntington disease with PBT2, see Item 4.B. “Information on the Company - Business Overview - Clinical Trials for\nOur Product Candidates.”\nIn December 2012, we announced the publication of the paper entitled, “PBT2 extends lifespan, reduces striatal atrophy and improves motor\nperformance in a transgenic mouse model of Huntington disease” in the Journal of Huntington disease. This paper describes how PBT2 significantly\nimproved functional performance of the mice in the R6/2 model as a consequence of the neuroprotective properties of PBT2 by regulating certain\nmetal mediated events in the brain.\nAs described in the preceding section, ‘Platform Technology, Discovery and Translational Research Programs – Alzheimer’s disease’, in\nOctober 2013 Alterity scientist Associate Professor Paul Adlard published a paper in the journal Aging Cell, demonstrating that PBT2 could restore\nthe cognition of aged mice to that of young, cognitively normal mice. Age-related cognitive decline is associated with measurable structural and\nbiochemical changes in the brain, which Alterity scientists have shown to be significantly improved by PBT2 administration. In particular, this\nrestoration of cognitive function was accompanied by an increase in underlying hippocampal neurons, synaptic density and neuronal proliferation\nmarkers around the lateral ventricles, a region susceptible to atrophy in Huntington disease.\n27\nImportant support for the role of copper in the disease process in Huntington disease came from Tsinghua University in China (Xiao et al\nPNAS 2013). Using a Drosophila model of Huntington disease, bearing an expanded polyQ Htt gene, workers showed that altered expression of\ngenes involved in copper metabolism significantly modulates disease progression. Intervention in dietary copper levels also modified Huntington\ndisease phenotypes in the fly and copper reduction decreased the level of oligomerized and aggregated Htt protein. Critically, substitution of two\npotential copper-binding residues of Htt, Met8 and His82, completely dissociated the copper-intensifying toxicity of Htt exon1-polyQ. The authors\nspecifically identified copper binding compounds as an ideal therapy for Huntington disease. As mentioned above, in relation to our Alzheimer’s\ndisease research, the finding that PBT2 can positively reduce the phosphorylation of tau, supports the emerging profile of PBT2 as a compound with\nneuroprotective characteristics to support neuronal health and function with potential application in Huntington disease.\nIn 2015, Alterity scientist Associate Professor Kevin Barnham and colleagues published on the ability of PBT2, through its ionophore\nproperties, to inhibit the over-excitation of the glutamate neuronal transmission pathway that can lead to neuronal death in the paper entitled, “PBT2\ninhibits glutamate-induced excitotoxicity in neurons through metal-mediated preconditioning” in the journal, Neurobiology of Disease. Such\nexcitotoxicity is implicated in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer disease and Huntington disease.\nNon-neurodegenerative applications\nAntibiotic Resistance\nIn December 2020, Alterity was granted a licence by UniQuest, the commercialisation company of The University of Queensland (UQ), to\nnovel zinc ionophore technology to combat antimicrobial resistance in superbugs. Under the licence, Alterity has secured the worldwide exclusive\nright to patented technology to develop and commercialise therapies that re-sensitise bacteria to antibiotics. The licensed technology combines\nAlterity’s PBT2 and other zinc ionophores with commonly used antibiotics to treat infections caused by multidrug resistant bacteria. A published\narticle in the high-impact journal Science Translational Medicine, showed that PBT2 could reverse antibiotic resistance to critical superbugs and\ndemonstrate efficacy in an animal model of sepsis.\nClinical Trials for Our Product Candidates\nATH434\nIn July 2019 we announced the completion of clinical trial evaluating the safety and pharmacokinetics of ATH434 in healthy volunteers.\nThe Phase 1 study, conducted in Australia, recruited 70 adult volunteers and ten elderly volunteers with the key goals of assessing the safety,\ntolerability and drug disposition within the body (pharmacokinetics) of ATH434 after single and multiple oral dose administration.\nThe volunteers in the single ascending dose phase of the study, made up of four individual dose levels in ascending order, received a single\noral dose of ATH434 and a blood sampling over the next 72 hours. In the multiple ascending dose phase of the study, volunteers received eight days\ndosing with ATH434, administered as three successively higher dose levels, with intensive blood sampling for pharmacokinetics on days 1 and 8. At\nthe two highest multiple dose levels, cerebrospinal fluid was collected at steady state to determine drug penetration to the site of action in the brain.\nOlder adult (≥65 years) received the highest dose level for 8 days as well.\nThe study was successfully completed with systemic exposure to the drug comparable between elderly and healthy volunteers. ATH434 was\nfound to be safe and well tolerated. Adverse event rates were found to be comparable with placebo and no subject experienced a serious adverse\nevent or an adverse event that led to discontinuation of the study drug.\n28\nThe clinical data were presented at the American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting in in May 2020. The presentation was based on an\nabstract entitled A phase 1 Study of ATH434, a Novel Small Molecule Inhibitor of Į-synuclein Aggregation, in Adult and Older Adult Volunteers\npublished in the journal Neurology. In September 2019, the Company presented a poster titled: A First in Human Study of ATH434, a Novel Small\nMolecule Inhibitor of Į-Synuclein Aggregation at the 2019 International Congress of Parkinson’s Disease and Movement Disorders (MDS Congress)\nin Nice, France. The poster presented findings from the completed Phase 1 trial of ATH434.\nWe are focusing on the treatment of Parkinsonian disorders, a group of neurodegenerative disorders which have Parkinsonism as a feature.\nParkinsonism is a general term for slowed movement, stiffness and tremor, and occurs in idiopathic Parkinson disease and atypical forms such as\nMultiple system atrophy (MSA), Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, among others. The atypical forms of Parkinsonism have a limited response to\navailable drugs for treating symptoms of Parkinson disease and prominent non-motor symptoms. Alterity’s lead indication for ATH434 is MSA, a\nhighly debilitating disease with no approved treatments.\nMSA is a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disorder leading to severe disability and impairment in quality of life. It is a sporadic\ndisease (not inherited) and typically presents in 50s to 60s. It is an Orphan disease with a prevalence of approximately 5 per 100,000 in the US. In\naddition to Parkinsonism as described above, affected individuals experience symptoms of autonomic failure such as orthostatic hypotension, bladder\ndysfunction, erectile dysfunction and constipation as well as cerebellar impairments such as impaired gait and difficulty speaking and swallowing.\nWe applied to the FDA for Orphan Drug designation for the proposed use of ATH434 for the treatment of MSA, and the designation was\ngranted in January 2019. Orphan designation entitles Alterity to seven years of market exclusivity for the use of ATH434 in the treatment of MSA\nand qualifies the sponsor of the drug for various development incentives of the Orphan Drug Act, including tax credits for qualified clinical testing.\nIn January 2020 we announced that the European Commission (EC) granted Orphan Drug designation to ATH434, which entitles Alterity to\nten years of market exclusivity in the European Union for the use of ATH434 in the treatment of MSA and other benefits including assistance in\ndeveloping clinical protocols, reduced fees and access to EU-funded research grants.\nIn June 2020 we announced that we had received guidance from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in relation to the\ndevelopment pathway for ATH434 following the successful completion of its Phase 1 clinical trial. The pre-IND (Investigational New Drug) meeting\nwas to obtain input on the clinical development plan for ATH434, including feedback on the Phase 2 study design.\nWe reached agreement with the FDA on the non-clinical investigations required to support the Phase 2 study. In addition, the FDA agreed\nto key aspects of the Phase 2 study design including the proposed patient population, safety monitoring plan and strategy for evaluating drug\nexposure during the study.\nAs there are currently no approved treatments for MSA and, therefore, no regulatory precedent regarding accepted efficacy endpoints, we\nagreed to work together with the FDA to develop an endpoint that is best suited for the MSA patients to be studied. The FDA has also encouraged us\nto utilise data from a natural history study planned for the US.\nIn parallel with the US strategy, we are also pursuing a regulatory pathway in Europe and Australia. Given the uncertainty of study conduct\nand recruitment in the COVID-19 era, and with the need to target sites that are minimally impacted, it is prudent to be flexible in identifying and\nrecruiting sites around the world and maintaining optionality. Planning is underway to meet with European authorities. In June 2021, we received\nguidance from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) regarding key aspects of our Phase 2 clinical trial for investigational drug ATH434 in the\ntreatment of MSA planned to commence in the second half of 2021.\nIn October 2020, we commenced enrolling patients with MSA in our natural history study referred to as bioMUSE. The study is being\nconducted in collaboration with Vanderbilt University Medical Center in the US under the direction of Daniel Claassen, MD, Associate Professor of\nNeurology and Principal Investigator. Natural history studies are important for characterizing disease progression in selected patient populations. The\nstudy is providing vital information on early stage MSA patients to optimize the design of our Phase 2 study. The study will also inform the selection\nof biomarkers suitable to evaluate target engagement and preliminary efficacy.\n29\nWe have continued to build on our body of scientific evidence for ATH434 drug, with the presentation of pre-clinical evidence of ATH434\ntreatment for MSA at the International Congress of Parkinson’s Disease and Movement Disorders at Hong Kong in October 2018. The pre-clinical\ndata demonstrated that ATH434 prevented α-synuclein aggregation, preserved neurons, decreased the number of glial cell inclusions and reduced\nmotor impairment in an animal model of MSA. These findings are consistent with previous Parkinsonian disease animal models that have undergone\nATH434 treatment.\nIn August 2020, we announced that new clinical and experimental pharmacology data has been selected for presentation at the 2020\nInternational Congress of Parkinson’s Disease and Movement Disorders (MDS 2020) and the American Neurological Association’s 2020 Annual\nMeeting (ANA 2020). The new data were generated from an experiment testing ATH434 in an animal model of MSA in the laboratory of Dr. Nadia\nStefanova, Professor of Translational Neurodegeneration Research at the Medical University of Innsbruck. It independently confirmed and extended\nprevious findings demonstrating that ATH434 reduces α-synuclein pathology, preserves neurons, and improves motor performance. The new cardiac\nsafety data presented was based on the evaluating electrical activity in the heart as measured by the QT interval. The data reinforces previous safety\nfindings from the Phase 1 clinical study that ATH434 was generally well tolerated at all doses and had an adverse event profile comparable to\nplacebo in adult and older adult volunteers. The data indicate that there is no evidence of cardiac liability at clinically tested doses.\nIn February 2021 further data from the Phase 1 clinical study was presented at the 7th International Congress of Multiple System Atrophy.\nWe presented detailed data on blood pressure with change in body position which demonstrated that ATH434 does not lower blood pressure when\nsubjects move to the standing position. This is an important safety finding considering impaired blood pressure is a cardinal problem in MSA, thus\nextending the cardiac and overall safety profile previously presented.\nIn April 2021, we gave an oral presentation of expanded animal data to support the commercialisation of ATH434 at the American\nAcademy of Neurology virtual annual meeting. The presentation titled ATH434 Preserves Dopaminergic Neurons, Reduces Į-synuclein\nOligomerization, and Improves Motor Function in a Transgenic Murine Multiple System Atrophy Model further strengthened the evidence that\nATH434 is neuroprotective in brain regions implicated in Parkinsonian disorders. The results from the presentation were published in Movement\nDisorders (doi: 10.1002/mds.28714), the official journal of the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society subsequent to the end of the\nreporting period. The data, from an animal model of MSA, independently confirm and extend previous findings demonstrating that ATH434 reduces\nα-synuclein pathology, preserves neurons, and improves motor function. The new data indicate that ATH434 preserves neurons not only in the\nsubstantia nigra, a main area of pathology in Parkinson’s disease, but also in the striatum, a region of the brain that integrates information from the\ncortex and substantia nigra to achieve fine motor control. Impaired motor performance is a cardinal symptom of Parkinsonian disorders.\nPBT2\nIn November 2005, we successfully completed the first Phase I trial for PBT2, a double blind, placebo-controlled single dose escalation\nstudy, conducted on 55 healthy male volunteers between the ages of 18 and 50, which was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and\npharmacokinetics of PBT2. Data from the study showed that PBT2 was well tolerated with little difference in the incidence of adverse events\nbetween those receiving PBT2 and those receiving the placebo. Additionally, the pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated that the drug exposure\nincreased/decreased predictably and in a linear manner, both of which are desirable characteristics for a central nervous system drug.\n30\nIn February 2006, we completed the second Phase I safety clinical trial for PBT2. This trial was a multi-dose escalation trial of PBT2\nconducted in elderly, healthy male and female volunteers completed in December 2005. Volunteers were dosed at a selected dose for seven days; the\ndose range was from 200mg to 800mg per day. Both Phase I trials demonstrated that PBT2 was well tolerated and suitable for progression to Phase II\ntrials in patients with Alzheimer’s disease.\nIn February 2008, we reported the top line results of our three month double-blind, placebo-controlled safety and tolerability Phase IIa study\nof PBT2 in 80 elderly male and female patients with mild forms of Alzheimer’s disease. We announced that the trial primary endpoints of safety and\ntolerability were met and we also announced that with respect to the secondary endpoints, namely biomarker, cognition and behavioral changes,\nseveral significant and promising changes were observed. Specifically, that in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), PBT2 treatment at a 250mg dose\nresulted in a significant decrease in the target Abeta 42 protein. In addition, at the 250mg dose, while no significant effect was observed with the\nADAS-cog, two of the five NTB tests for improvement in executive function were significantly improved. In July 2008, the results of the Phase IIa\ntrial were published in The Lancet Neurology journal.\nIn November 2009, an erratum to the July 2008 edition of The Lancet Neurology journal was published that corrected the original results of\nthe NTB cognitive findings arising from the Phase IIa trial. The corrected results show that in addition to the two measures of executive cognitive\nfunction found to be significantly improved, the overall executive function domain of the NTB, comprising five cognitive tests, was significantly\nimproved for those patients taking 250mg of PBT2 compared to patients on placebo. In April 2010, we published an analysis of the responses of\nindividual patients treated with PBT2 in the Phase IIa clinical trial in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease. The analysis demonstrated that there was a\nsignificant probability that any patient that showed cognitive executive function improvement in the trial was being treated with 250mg of PBT2.\nMoreover, 81% of patients on the 250mg dose of PBT2 responded better on the executive function of the NTB score than the best performing patient\non placebo. Improvement in ADAS-cog, a measure of memory and cognition, was observed with patients treated with 250mg of PBT2, almost\nreaching statistical significance by 12 weeks of the Phase IIa trial. The corrected cognitive data from the Phase IIa trial together with the additional\nanalysis provides strong evidence of the ability of PBT2 to improve cognitive executive function as measured by the NTB.\nAlso in November 2009, we presented our pre-clinical and clinical information package on PBT2 to the FDA in accordance with the Pre-\nInvestigational New Drug, or IND, Consultation Program. The meeting provided useful guidance on possible steps to take to open an IND\nApplication with the FDA to undertake clinical trials in the United States in Alzheimer’s disease or Huntington disease. The meeting provided us\nwith important information to help form our regulatory strategy for the development of PBT2 in these neurological indications.\nIn November 2011, we announced the approval from the Austin Health Research Ethics Committee based at the Austin Hospital in\nMelbourne, to commence a 12 month Phase II imaging trial with PBT2 in patients with prodromal or mild Alzheimer disease. The study was\nsupported in part by a grant of U.S.$700,000 from the New York based Alzheimer’s Drug Discovery Foundation, or ADDF. The trial entailed forty\npatients treated for twelve months with either 250mg PBT2 or a placebo. The trial was designed to investigate the effect of PBT2 on a patient’s beta\namyloid burden in the brain as measured by Positron Emission Tomography imaging (PET), secondary endpoints included brain metabolic activity as\nmeasured by F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose, FDG - PET and brain volume by Magnetic Resonance Imaging, or MRI, and safety. No significant changes\nin the primary endpoint comparing beta amyloid burden as measured using the imaging agent, Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) in the 27 patients treated\nwith 250mg PBT2 compared to the 15 patients on placebo. Confounding interpretation of the result was the observed overall decline in amyloid\nburden in the placebo group. No improvement was observed for the secondary endpoints including brain metabolic activity, cognitive and functional\nmeasures. However, for patients treated with PBT2 there was a trend towards preserving brain volume in the hippocampus compared to those\npatients on placebo. A key secondary endpoint was the safety profile of PBT2 after 52 weeks treatment – the longest duration of PBT2 exposure to\ndate in a clinical trial. The adverse event profile of the treatment versus placebo group was equivalent and 40 of the 42 enrolled participants\ncompleted the 52 week trial. Participants were provided the option to continue treatment on PBT2 for a further 52 weeks in an open label study, the\n‘IMAGINE Extension study’ and thirty three participants elected to do so with twenty-seven participants completing the IMAGINE Extension study.\nThe independent Data Safety Monitoring Board did not identify any safety concerns related to PBT2 over the combined two year period of the\nIMAGINE and IMAGINE Extension studies. Unpublished analysis of the IMAGINE Extension data does not distinguish between 12 and 24 months\nof exposure to PBT2 on any of the measured trial outcomes. However, exploratory post-hoc information from the Extension phase suggest that for\nthe cohort of 27 trial participants that completed all 24 months (11 of the 15 participants that started IMAGINE on placebo together with 16 of the 25\nparticipants that remained on PBT2 for 24 months), the amyloid levels decreased in this cohort compared to an historical control group from the\nAustralian Imaging Biomarker and Lifestyle (AIBL) study.\n31\nIn late 2012 we finalized the enrolment to a Phase II trial to test PBT2 in patients with Huntington disease over six months. The trial, known\nas “Reach2HD”, was undertaken under an open IND application through the FDA and was conducted in clinical sites across the United States and\nAustralia. The Phase IIa trial design entailed a double blind placebo controlled study of 109 patients with early to mid-stage Huntington disease. The\nprimary objective for the trial was safety and tolerability of PBT2 in this Huntington disease patient population. Secondary endpoints included the\neffect of PBT2 on cognition, behaviour, functional capacity, motor effects. In addition, a small (n=6) exploratory arm of the study, was undertaken\nunder the guidance of the co-Principal Investigator of the study, Professor Diana Rosas, using MRI brain imaging to undertake iron mapping and\nvolumetric assessment in a patient’s brain. Professor Rosas has published that iron and other metals change in concentration and distribution in the\nbrain with increasing severity of the condition. This study was the first clinical trial with PBT2 in this patient population and the results were reported\nin February 2014. The primary objective of the study was achieved with PBT2 being demonstrated as safe and well tolerated in this first study of\nPBT2 in Huntington disease.\nCognition was pre-specified as the primary efficacy endpoint and was assessed using three Composite z-scores selected from individual\ntests; Category Fluency, Trail Making Test Part B, Map Search, Symbol Digit Modalities and Stroop Word Reading. The Main Cognition Composite\n– comprised of all five tests was not improved with treatment over the six months, nor was the Exploratory Cognition Composite – comprised of all\nfive tests in addition to the Speeded Tapping Test. However, the Executive Function Composite, comprised of the Trail Making Test Part B and\nCategory Fluency Test was significantly improved at 12 weeks (p=0.005) and trended towards improvement at 26 weeks (p=0.069). In the early stage\nHuntington disease patients, there was a significant improvement in the Executive Function composite (p=0.038). Of particular note, the Trail\nMaking Test Part B of itself was significantly improved at 12 weeks (p=0.001) and at 26 weeks (p=0.042).\nThere were no significant findings in the other secondary endpoints although there was a small but positive signal in the Total Functional\nCapacity score. Interestingly, while the MRI did not detect changes in brain iron distribution in the study, the rate of brain cortical tissue thinning was\ngreater in the placebo group compared to the two combined PBT2 treatment groups (100mg and 250mg).\nIn September 2014, we announced that PBT2 had been granted Orphan Drug designation in the treatment of Huntington disease by the\nFDA. Orphan Drug designation confers a number of incentives to drug developers including increased facilitation of communication with regulators\nto achieve concurrence on the development of the Orphan drug towards market approval. To achieve Orphan Drug designation, it must be established\nthat the disease indication is of relatively low prevalence, that there is no existing comparable treatment option for patients and that the drug offers a\nplausible treatment. In June 2015, the European Commission approved Orphan Drug designation for PBT2 for the treatment of Huntington disease,\nstating that we have shown that PBT2 might be of significant benefit for patients with Huntington disease. The approval was based on the\nrecommendation of a positive opinion from the EMA Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products.\nDuring 2015 and 2016, three new PBT2 Phase 1 trials were successfully completed. The data from these trials have provided further safety,\npharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information on PBT2 and will assist in the design of Phase 3 protocols for PBT2. These Phase 1 studies\ncomprised:\n● A drug to drug interaction study, ‘PBT2-104’. Based on in vitro metabolism studies indicating that PBT2 is both a substrate for, and an\ninhibitor of, CYP1A2, this study was designed to investigate the potential for drug to drug interactions in healthy volunteers when\nPBT2 is concurrently administered with other agents metabolized by this CYP450 isozyme.\n32\n● A food interaction Study, PBT2-103’. Healthy volunteers were randomized into 2 dosing groups; one which was administered 250mg\nPBT2 after a 12 hour fast, the other which was administered 250mg PBT2 after a prescribed FDA meal. Blood samples were taken over\nmultiple time points over 24 hours to determine the pharmacokinetic profile of PBT2 and its metabolites.\n● Evaluation of the three pharmacokinetic parameters, absorption, metabolism and excretion (ADME) of [C]-PBT2 and to estimate the\nAbsolute Bioavailability of PBT2 in healthy volunteers, ‘PBT2-102’ to understand the passage of the drug in humans after\nadministration.\nNotwithstanding the clinical safety demonstrated to date with PBT2 in our Phase II programs in Alzheimer’s disease and Huntington\ndisease, in February 2015 we reported that the FDA had placed PBT2 on Partial Clinical Hold, or PCH, based on particular nonclinical\nneurotoxicology findings in a dog study. These dog findings limit the dose of PBT2 that we can use in future trials. With the assistance of third party\nspecialist pharmacometricians, clinical safety physicians and clinical pharmacologists, we have undertaken extensive safety analyses to characterize\nthe behavior of PBT2 drug exposure in the dog and human and how this translates to the comparative safety profile in the dog relative to humans.\nBased on the emerging strong safety profile for PBT2, we have prepared a robust safety monitoring plan for future trials in Huntington disease. These\nplans, the pharmacological evidence and a Phase 3 protocol were submitted to the FDA in 2016 as part of our response to the PCH and to the\nSwedish Medical Products Agency (MPA) and the United Kingdom’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) for non-\nbinding scientific advice. The collective response from the FDA and advice from the European regulators was that more characterization of the\nnature of the dog neurotoxicity findings and its reversibility would be required to support the future development of PBT2 in Huntington disease.\nPatents and Licenses\nPatent Matters\nPatent matters in biotechnology are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Accordingly, the availability and\nbreadth of claims allowed in biotechnology and pharmaceutical patents cannot be predicted. Statutory differences in patentable subject matter may\nlimit the protection we can obtain on some or all of our inventions outside Australia or prevent us from obtaining patent protection outside Australia,\neither of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, methods of treating humans are not\npatentable in many countries outside Australia and the United States. Moreover, since patent applications are not published until at least 18 months\nfrom their first filing date and the publication of discoveries in the scientific literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that\nwe or any of our licensors were the first creator of inventions covered by pending patent applications or that we or our licensors were the first to file\npatent applications for such inventions. Additionally, the grant and enforceability of a patent is dependent on a number of factors that may vary\nbetween jurisdictions. These factors may include the novelty of the invention, the requirement that the invention not be obvious in the light of prior\nart (including prior use or publication of the invention), the utility of the invention, and the extent to which the patent clearly describes the best\nmethod of working the invention.\nWhile we intend to seek patent protection for our therapeutic candidate products and technologies, we cannot be certain that any of the\npending or future patent applications filed by us or on our behalf will be approved, or that we will develop additional proprietary products or\nprocesses that are patentable or that we will be able to license any other patentable products or processes. We also cannot be certain that others will\nnot independently develop similar products or processes, duplicate any of the products or processes developed or being developed by us or licensed\nto us, or design around the patents owned or licensed by us, or that any patents owned or licensed by us will provide us with competitive advantages.\nFurthermore, we cannot be certain that patents held by third parties will not prevent the commercialisation of products incorporating the technology\ndeveloped by us or licensed to us, or that third parties will not challenge or seek to narrow, invalidate or circumvent any of the issued, pending or\nfuture patents owned or licensed by us.\n33\nOur commercial success will also depend, in part, on our ability to avoid infringement of patents issued to others. If a court of competent\njurisdiction determines that we were infringing any third party patents, we could be required to pay damages, alter our products or processes, obtain\nlicenses or cease certain activities. We cannot be certain that the licenses required under patents held by third parties would be made available on\nterms acceptable to us or at all. To the extent that we are unable to obtain such licenses, we could be foreclosed from the development, export,\nmanufacture or commercialisation of the product requiring such license or encounter delays in product introductions while we attempt to design\naround such patents, and any of these circumstances could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may have to resort to litigation to enforce any patents issued or licensed to us or to determine the scope and validity of third party\nproprietary rights. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of effort by us. We may have to participate in opposition proceedings\nbefore the Australian Patent and Trademark Office or another foreign patent office, or in interference proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and\nTrademark Office, to determine the priority of invention for patent applications filed by competitors. Any such litigation, interference or opposition\nproceeding, regardless of outcome, could be expensive and time consuming, and adverse determinations in any such proceedings could prevent us\nfrom developing, manufacturing or commercializing our products and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nIn addition to patent protection, we rely on unpatented trade secrets, know-how and other confidential information as well as proprietary\ntechnological innovation and expertise. Although we have taken steps to protect our trade secrets and unpatented know-how, including entering into\nconfidentiality agreements with third parties, and confidential information and inventions agreements with employees, consultants and advisers, third\nparties may still obtain this information or come upon this same or similar information independently.\nPatent Portfolio\nSince June 30, 2020 we have continued to advance our patent portfolio.\nThe Company’s previously reported March 2019 provisional patent application, that exemplifies in excess of 150 novel compounds all of\nwhich modulate biological iron for the treatment of Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s and other neurological diseases and titled “Compounds for and\nMethods of Treating Diseases”, matured on 13 March 2020 to a PCT application, No. PCT/AU2020/050235.\nContemporaneously with filing the PCT application on March 13, 2020, we also filed United States complete application, application No.\n17/239,375, deriving from the same provisional application, under track 1, which is the United States procedure for expedited review of patent\napplications. The Company announced allowance of the United States application on November 16, 2020 and announced its grant on July 1, 2021. In\nsecuring the patent grant, no prior art was cited against the application.\nOn June 18, 2020 we filed another provisional application to register a patent that claims another 80 novel compounds, also that modulate\nbiological iron and also titled “Compounds for and Methods of Treating Diseases”. This application matured to a an PCT application No.\nPCT/AU2021/050633 on June 18, 2021. Similarly to the first mentioned patent application, contemporaneously with filing the PCT application on\nApril 23, 2021, we also filed United States complete application, application No. 16/818,641, deriving from the same provisional application, under\ntrack 1. We announced allowance of the United States application on August 4, 2021 and in securing the allowance, no prior art was cited against the\napplication.\nSubsequent to the end of the period, on August 27, 2021 we filed a PCT application No. PCT/AU2021,050,986 to register a patent that\nclaims an additional 150 novel compounds all of which modulate biological Zinc for the treatment of neurological, cancer, viral and other infectious\ndiseases and titled “Compounds for and Methods of Treating Diseases”.\nIn the past 12 months we have advanced those of our patent families that are pending registration and that align with our development\nprograms.\n34\nPatent Status Invention\n“8-Hydroxyquinoline Derivatives” Patents in Europe, the USA, New Zealand, Canada, The invention is directed to chemical scaffolds\nFiled: July 16, 2003 Japan, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Australia, of the 8-Hydroxyquinoline compounds class\nIsrael, China, Mexico and South Africa have been and their utility in the treatment of neurological\nGranted.

We believe that we will face competition in differing levels of intensity in all of the\nareas in which we are conducting research. ATH434, if approved for the treatment of MSA, may compete in a highly competitive market. Our\ncompetitors, which are located worldwide, are numerous and include, among others, major pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology firms,\nuniversities and other research institutions. These competitors may develop technologies and products that are more effective than any that we are\ndeveloping, or which would render our technology and products obsolete or non-competitive. Many of these competitors have greater financial,\nresearch and screening capabilities, technical resources and manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do. In addition, many of our\ncompetitors may have more experience than we do in non-clinical and human clinical trials of new or improved drugs, as well as in obtaining FDA,\nEMA, TGA and other regulatory approvals. We cannot provide assurance that we can compete effectively with these other competitor companies.\nThere are currently no approved drugs for the treatment of Multiple System Atrophy (MSA). If we are able to successfully develop ATH434\nand gain approval for the treatment of MSA, we may compete with the following drug candidates which are in development:\n● BHV-3241 (Formerly AZD-3241). This product is being developed by Biohaven, who licensed it from AstraZeneca after a negative\nPhase 2 study in MSA. It is thought to act by inhibiting the enzyme myeloperoxidase. A Phase 3 study is ongoing.\n● Anle138b. This product is being developed by Modag, GmBH and is thought to act by dissolving aggregated forms of the alpha-\nsynuclein protein. They have recently completed a Phase 1 study.\n● BIIB101. This product is being developed by Biogen and is thought to act by interfering with the synthesis of the alpha-synuclein\nprotein. The product is administered by direct injection into cerebrospinal fluid. A phase 1 study is ongoing.\n● Lu AF82422. This product is being developed by Lundbeck and is thought to act by interfering with the extracellular spread of the\nalpha-synuclein protein. It is in Phase 1 development.\nRegulatory Considerations\nOur ongoing research and development activities are, and the production and marketing of our pharmaceutical product candidates derived\nfrom those activities will be, subject to regulation by human research ethics committees and institutional research boards, as well as numerous\ngovernmental authorities in Australia, principally the TGA, the FDA in the United States, the MHRA in the United Kingdom and the EMA in\nEurope. Prior to marketing, any therapeutic product developed must undergo rigorous pre-clinical testing and clinical trials, as well as an extensive\nregulatory approval process mandated by the TGA and, to the extent that any of our pharmaceutical products under development are marketed\nabroad, by foreign regulatory agencies, including the FDA, EMA and MHRA.\nClinical trials can take many years to complete and require the expenditure of substantial resources. The length of time varies substantially\naccording to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of the product candidate. We cannot make any assurances that once clinical trials are\ncompleted by us or a collaborative partner, we will be able to submit as scheduled a marketing approval request to the applicable governmental\nregulatory authority, or that such request and application will be reviewed and cleared by such governmental authority in a timely manner, or at all.\nAlthough we intend to make use of fast-track and abbreviated regulatory approval programs when possible and commercially appropriate, we cannot\nbe certain that we will be able to obtain the clearances and approvals necessary for clinical testing or for manufacturing and marketing our\npharmaceutical products candidates. Delays in obtaining regulatory approvals could adversely affect the development and commercialisation of our\npharmaceutical product candidates and could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n36\nDuring the course of clinical trials and non-clinical studies, including toxicology studies, product candidates may exhibit unforeseen and\nunacceptable drug-related toxicities or side effects. If any unacceptable toxicities or side effects were to occur, we may, or regulatory authorities may\nrequire us to, interrupt, limit, delay or abort the development of our potential products. In addition, unacceptable toxicities could ultimately prevent\nthe clearance of our product candidates by human research ethics committees, institutional research boards, the TGA, EMA, FDA or other regulatory\nauthority for any or all targeted indications. Even after being cleared by a regulatory authority, any of our products may later be shown to be unsafe\nor not to have its purported effect, thereby preventing widespread use or requiring withdrawal from the market. We cannot make any assurances that\nPBT2, ATH434 or any other product candidates will be safe or effective when administered to patients.\nManufacturing and Raw Materials\nThe manufacture of pharmaceutical products is complex and requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the\ndevelopment of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. We and our contract manufacturers must comply with GMP regulations\nand guidelines. Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products often encounter difficulties in production, particularly in scaling up and validating initial\nproduction. These problems include difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, including stability of the product, quality assurance\ntesting, operator error, shortages of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with strictly enforced federal, state and foreign regulations. We cannot\nmake any assurances that we will be able to manufacture sufficient quantities of product candidate in a cost-effective or timely manner. Any delays in\nproduction would delay our nonclinical and human clinical trials, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of\noperations. We also cannot make any assurances that we will be able to enter into collaborative or contracting arrangements on acceptable terms with\nthird party manufacturers that will meet our requirements for quality, quantity and timeliness.\nWe expect that we will be required to design and develop new synthetic pathways and formulations for manufacturing most, if not all, of the\nproducts that we currently intend to develop or may develop in the future. We cannot predict the success of such efforts, the purity of the products\nthat may be obtained or the nature of the impurities that may result from such efforts. If we are not able to obtain a suitable formulation or an\nacceptable purity for any product candidate or an acceptable product specification, nonclinical and clinical trials would be delayed, which could\nadversely affect the priority of the development of our product candidates, our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot\nguarantee that it will be possible to scale up new synthetic processes or make the necessary validated process improvements to provide sufficient\nquantities of drug substance for clinical drug trials, which could indefinitely delay the initiation of clinical trials utilizing drug substance. We also\ncannot guarantee that the drug substance will be suitable for high throughput drug product manufacturing. This may adversely impact the cost of\ngoods or feasibility of market scale manufacture.\nC.

These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and\nuncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements, including those risk\nfactors contained in Item 3.D. of this annual report. You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated\nfinancial statements and the notes thereto included in this annual report.\nA. OPERATING RESULTS\nBackground\nWe were incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Australia on November 11, 1997. The principal listing of our ordinary shares\nand listed options to purchase our ordinary shares is on the ASX. From September 5, 2002 until April 8, 2019, our ADSs traded on the NASDAQ\nCapital Market under the symbol “PRAN.” On April 8, 2019 we changed our name to Alterity Therapeutics Limited and our ADSs have traded under\nthe symbol “ATHE” and our ordinary shares have traded under the symbol “ATH” since that date.\nOur consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report comply with IFRS as issued by IASB. In this annual report, all\nreferences to “U.S. dollars” or “U.S.$” are to the currency of the United States, and all references to “Australian dollars” or “A$” are to the currency\nof Australia. All of our revenues are generated in Australian dollars, except for interest earned on foreign currency bank accounts, and the majority of\nour expenses are incurred in Australian dollars.\nOverview\nWe are a development stage enterprise at an early to mid-stage in the development of our pharmaceutical products that are designed to treat\nthe underlying causes of neurodegeneration of the brain. We have incurred net losses since inception and expect to incur substantial and increasing\nlosses for the next several years as we expand our research and development activities and move our product candidates into later stages of\ndevelopment. All of our product candidates are in discovery phase or early and mid-stage of development and we face the risks of failure inherent in\ndeveloping drugs based on new technologies. The process of carrying out the development of our products to later stages of development may require\nsignificant additional research and development expenditures, including nonclinical testing and clinical trials, as well as for obtaining regulatory\napproval. To date, we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities, proceeds from the exercise of options, government\ngrants, licensing and research collaborations and interest income.\nSince completing our initial public offering and listing process on the ASX on March 28, 2000, we have concentrated our resources toward\nthe pursuit of our disease targets. We have completed four Phase I studies of PBT2 and a Phase IIa clinical trial for PBT2 in patients with\nAlzheimer’s disease. We have completed the “IMAGINE” Phase II biomarker imaging trial in Alzheimer’s disease and a fifty-two week open label\nIMAGINE Extension study and the “Reach2HD” Phase IIa trial in Huntington disease. In 2019, we completed a Phase I clinical trial of ATH434\n(formerly PBT434) in healthy volunteers. For details regarding clinical trials for our lead compounds, see Item 4.B. “Information on the Company -\nBusiness Overview - Clinical Trials for Our Product Candidates.”\n38\nSignificant Costs and Expenses\nResearch and development expenses. Our research and development expenses consist primarily of expenses for contracted research and\ndevelopment activities conducted by third parties on our behalf. Research and development expenses also include costs associated with the\nacquisition, development of patents and salaries and fees paid to employees and consultants involved in research and development activities.\nGeneral and administration expenses. Our general and administration expenses consist of (i) personnel expenses such as directors’ fees,\nsalaries and benefits paid to employees and officers and equity-based payments awarded to directors, officers and employees; (ii) auditor and\naccounting expenses which are fees paid to our auditors for services related to annual reports and interim reports filed or submitted in Australia and\nthe United States and fees paid to other accounting firms in respect of tax and other accounting advice; (iii) public relations and marketing expenses\nwhich are fees paid to outside consultants for services related to ASX and NASDAQ announcements and presentations; (iv) depreciation expenses;\nand (v) other administrative and office expenses.\nIntellectual property expenses. Our intellectual property expenses consist of fees paid to our outside counsel for legal fees associated with\npatent applications and for the defense of patents.\nOther gains and losses. Other gains and losses consist of foreign exchange gain (loss) which are the net unrealized gain or loss on cash\nbalances and trade and other payables held in foreign currencies (primarily U.S. dollars, British Pounds and Euros) as well as net realized gains and\nlosses on foreign currency transactions.\nCOVID-19\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. SARS-CoV2 is the causative\nagent of COVID-19. While initially the outbreak was largely concentrated in China and caused significant disruptions to its economy, it has now\nspread globally.\nThe jurisdictions in which we conduct our business have variously imposed mandates and/or regulations or implemented measures to\ncounter the spread of SARS-CoV2 (the COVID-19 virus) to control the impact of the pandemic on public health and their respective economies.\nThese control measures collectively have changed over the course of the pandemic and are expected to continue to evolve in response to the\nchanging nature of the pandemic and its impact on public health and economic growth. Moreover, the emergence of variants of the COVID-19 virus,\ncaused by mutations, has led to a resurgence in infections and prompted renewed uncertainty. We have been affected in a number of ways, such as\nthe way in which we operate our headquarters operations, our interaction with our scientists and their activities, and planning for and carrying out\nclinical trials, all of which have experienced some short-term disruption and may suffer long-term changes in the way we will do business. Actions\nsuch as government lock downs have slowed or, in some cases, temporarily stopped research and development activities and clinical trials. Various\nsafety protocols for personal interactions may hamper research and development activities.\nIn addition to the government mandates for controlling the many different health and economic effects of the COVID-19 virus and\npandemic, individual institutions with which we work, such as hospitals, laboratories and educational institutions have taken actions that will disrupt\nthe progress of our business plans for the Company and our individual subsidiaries. Most educational institutions and many laboratories curtailed or\nlimited access to their facilities since the pandemic started in 2020 and are still working out how they will operate going forward; in the context of\nresurgent infections due to viral variants. We are expecting that going forward there will be unpredictable limitations on access to these institutions\nand facilities for our researchers and research partners. Overall, changes in the way our development activities can be conducted may result in delays\nin our conducting research activities, carrying out clinical trials and making regulatory submissions. The financial effect will be that our development\nexpenses may increase and we may have to obtain additional capital funding. Any required additional equity funding will be dilutive to the equity of\nour current investors and debt financing will have restrictive covenants that could adversely affect our business plans and operational objectives. Any\nfurther funding that we may need may not be available or even if available it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us.\n39\nResults of Operations\nYear ended June 30, 2021 compared to year ended June 30, 2020\nInterest income\nInterest income increased to A$20,676 for the year ended June 30, 2021 from A$17,117 for the year ended June 30, 2020, an increase of\nA$3,559, or 20.8%. The increase in interest income is primarily attributable to the higher Australian dollar cash balances during the current fiscal\nyear.\nOther Income\nWe have recognised a receivable and other income of A$4,126,364 for the R&D Tax Incentive refundable cash offset in relation to eligible\nexpenditure for the year ended June 30, 2021, on which we are entitled to a 43.5% refundable offset under an Australian R&D tax incentive scheme\nthat was introduced on July 1, 2019. In the prior period, we applied to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) for a determination regarding our\neligibility to receive the R&D Tax Incentive as a refundable cash offset. The ATO did not provide a positive determination relating to the receipt of\nthe tax incentive as a refundable cash offset under the applicable regulations. Accordingly, we did not recognize a receivable and other income of\nA$3,363,433 relating to eligible expenditure for the year ended June 30, 2020. The income tax return for the year ended June 30, 2020 has since been\nlodged and the R&D Tax Incentive assessed as a non-refundable cash offset. We are considering our options, including appealing this assessment.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2021, we are eligible to receive the refundable tax offset, so a Commissioner’s Discretion pursuant to subsection 328-126\n(6) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 was not required and the management has assessed activities and expenditures that are likely to be\neligible under the incentive scheme and therefore recorded A$4,126,364 in other income.\nWe had other income of A$145,626 for the year ended June 30, 2021 relating to government assistance received during the year, from the\nAustralian Governments (at both federal and state level), in response to the economic and financial challenges in the current economy due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic.\nWe were awarded a U.S.$495,000 grant from the Michael J Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research during the year ended June 30, 2021,\nto carry out a research programme and we recognised A$213,235 as other income.\nResearch and development expenses\nOur research and development expenses increased to A$12,283,848 for the year ended June 30, 2021 from A$10,098,439 for the year ended\nJune 30, 2020, an increase of A$2,185,409, or 21.6%. The increase is attributable to the increase in activity in relation to preparation for the Phase 2\nstudy of our lead product candidate ATH434.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased to A$6,937,842 for the year ended June 30, 2021 from A$3,446,139 for the year ended June\n30, 2020, an increase of A$3,491,703, or 101.3%. The increase is attributable to share based payment expense relating to the issue of options to key\nmanagement during the period, termination payments and increased consultants’ fees.\nIntellectual property expenses\nIntellectual property expenses, which include patent portfolio costs and intellectual property related legal costs, increased to A$360,026 for\nthe year ended June 30, 2021 from A$352,922 for the year ended June 30, 2020, an increase of A$7,104, or 2.01%.\n40\nForeign exchange gain (loss)\nWe recorded a foreign exchange loss of A$297,111 for the year ended June 30, 2021 compared to a foreign exchange gain of A$333,055 for\nthe year ended June 30, 2020. Foreign exchange gain (loss) reflects the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on cash that we hold in\nU.S. dollars, British Pounds and Euros. In the 2021 fiscal year, the Australian dollar appreciated against the U.S. dollar, which had a favorable impact\non the Australian dollar value of our cash held in U.S. dollars. In the 2020 fiscal year, the Australian dollar depreciated against the U.S. dollar, which\nhad a favorable impact on the Australian dollar value of our cash held in U.S. dollars. In the 2021 fiscal year, we incurred a foreign exchange loss of\nA$426,782 attributable to the cash balances that we held in U.S. dollars, and a foreign exchange gain of A$129,671 attributable to foreign currency\ntransactions. In the 2020 fiscal year, we incurred a foreign exchange gain of A$262,977 attributable to the cash balances that we held in U.S. dollars,\nand a foreign exchange gain of A$70,078 attributable to foreign currency transactions.\nFor a comparison of our results of operations between year ended June 30, 2020 and year ended June 2019, see Item 5.A. “Results of\nOperations” of our annual report on Form 20-F as filed on September 15, 2020.\nInflation and Seasonality\nManagement believes inflation has not had a material impact on our company’s operations or financial condition and that our operations are\nnot currently subject to seasonal influences.\nConditions in Australia\nWe are incorporated under the laws of, and our principal offices and research and development facilities are located in, the Commonwealth\nof Australia. Therefore, we are directly affected by political and economic conditions in Australia. See Item 3.D. “Key Information – Risk Factors –\nRisks Relating to Our Location in Australia” for a description of factors that could materially affect our operations.\nRecently Issued International Accounting Standards and Pronouncements\nNew and amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued and effective\nWe have adopted all of the new or amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards\nBoard ‘IASB’ that are mandatory for the current reporting period.\nThe adoption of these standards has not had any impact on the disclosures or amounts reported in these financial statements.\nAustralian Disclosure Requirements\nDividends\nNo dividends have been paid during the financial year (2020: nil). The Directors do not recommend the payment of a dividend in respect of\nthe current financial year (2020: nil).\nSignificant changes in the state of affairs\nThere have been no significant changes in the state of affairs of the Group during the year.\nEvents since the end of the financial year\nAs announced on July 2, 2021, we issued 322,857,900 shares at $0.0532 per share raising A$17 million through the use of our “At-The-\nMarket” (ATM) facility to fund working capital and continue our research and development activities.\n41\nNo other matters or circumstances, other than those disclosed in note 17 of the consolidated financial statements, have arisen since June 30,\n2021 that have significantly affected the Group’s operations, results or state of affairs, or may do so in future years.\nLikely developments and expected results of operations\nThe likely developments in our operations, to the extent that such matters can be commented upon, are covered in Item 5A of this report.\nEnvironmental regulation\nWe are involved in scientific research and development, and the activities do not create any significant environmental impact to any material\nextent. Our scientific research activities are in full compliance with all prescribed environmental regulations.\nB. LIQUIDITYAND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe are a development stage company, have had no sales income to date and as of June 30, 2021, our accumulated deficit totaled\nA$169,728,414. We had A$28,115,516 of cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2021, compared to A$9,196,892 as of June 30, 2020.\nFrom inception until our initial public offering in March 2000 we financed our operations primarily through borrowings from two of our\nthen directors, which were repaid from the proceeds of such offering. Since our initial public offering, we have financed our operations primarily\nthrough sales of equity securities, proceeds from the exercise of options, government grants, licensing and research collaborations and interest earned\non investments. During the period from 2001 to 2006, we were awarded government grants in the aggregate amount of A$3.3 million.\nIn September 2009, we raised A$6.0 million before costs in a private placement to one of our institutional shareholders in the United States\nof 30 million ordinary shares (equivalent to 500,000 ADSs on a post reverse ratio basis) at a price of A$0.20 per share (A$12 per ADS on a post\nreverse ratio basis)). We also agreed to grant the investor, subject to shareholder approval, options to purchase 10 million ordinary shares (equivalent\nto one million ADSs) at an exercise price of A$0.30 per share (A$18 per ADS on a post reverse ratio basis)) that would expire four years after the\ndate of the issuance of the shares in the September 2013 private placement. We also issued to the investor, based on an agreed upon formula, an\nadditional 750,000 ordinary shares pursuant to the approval of our shareholders obtained in November 2009.\nIn July 2010, we raised A$1.15 million before costs in a private placement of 7.065 million of our ordinary shares (equivalent to 117,750\nADSs on a post reverse ratio basis)) to Quintiles, at a price of A$0.1624 per ordinary share\nOn February 21, 2011, the ADDF awarded us a grant of U.S.$700,000, to be provided in two equal instalments over two years. The purpose\nof the grant was to support a Phase II imaging trial with PBT2 to investigate the effect of PBT2 on the deposition of beta-amyloid in the brains of\npatients with mild Alzheimer’s disease The ADDF is based in New York and functions on a venture philanthropy model. We issued a convertible\npromissory note to the ADDF in the principal amount of the grant and a five-year warrant to purchase 612,397 ordinary shares of our company at a\nprice per share of A$0.17, being the closing pricing of our ordinary shares on the ASX on the date of our agreement with ADDF.

The note was repaid in full.\n42\nIn March 2011, we completed a private placement of our securities to institutional investors for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately\nA$6.12 million. Under the terms of the offering, we sold an aggregate of approximately 27.2 million ordinary shares (equivalent to 453,333ADSs) at\na price of A$0.225 per share (A$13.5 per ADS on a post reverse ratio basis). We also granted to the investors options to purchase up to an aggregate\nof approximately 6.8 million ordinary shares (equivalent to 113,333 ADSs) at an exercise price of A$0.225 per share (A$13.2 per ADS on a post\nreverse ratio basis) that expired .\nIn June 2011, we completed a private placement of 5.69 million of our ordinary shares to institutional investors and Quintiles Limited, at a\nprice of A$0.225 per share, for aggregate gross process of approximately A$1.28 million We also granted the investors options to purchase 1.42\nmillion ordinary shares at an exercise price of A$0.225 per share that expired on March 24, 2015.\nIn July 2011, we entered into an At-The-Market Issuance Sales Agreement with a U.S. broker and issued 2,785,221 million ADSs on a post\nreverse ratio basis under the At-The-Market Issuance Sales Agreement for gross proceeds of A$39.4 million. On November 26, 2014 we entered into\nan Amendment to the At-The-Market Issuance Sales Agreement to continue the at-the-market equity program. We sold 749,242 of our ADSs on a\npost reverse ratio basis for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately A$7.11 million through this facility.\nIn October 2012, we raised approximately A$6.0 million through a private placement of 32.5 million ordinary shares (equivalent to 0.54\nmillion ADSs on a post reverse ratio basis) at a price of A$0.185 per ordinary share. The capital was raised in order to support our two ongoing Phase\nII clinical trials, the IMAGINE trial and Reach2HD trial.\nIn March 2013, we completed a private placement of 36.0 million ordinary shares to Australian institutions and high net worth investors, at\na price of A$0.195 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately A$7 million.\nOn October 13, 2016, we entered into an At-The-Market Issuance Sales Agreement with FBR Capital Markets & Co. and Jones Trading\nInstitutional Services LLC, which was amended on November 8, 2017 and December 16, 2020. We have raised US$ 20,077,495 under this program.\nOn December 28, 2018, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with Life Biosciences whereby Life Biosciences agreed to invest\nUS$7.5 million in our company. Following shareholder approval, this investment was completed on April 8, 2019 with the issuance of 269,905,533\nordinary shares at an issue price of A$0.039 per share and 539,811,066 warrants each with an exercise price of A$0.045 per share and expiring on\nDecember 19, 2019. These warrants expired, unexercised.\nIn October 2020, we received commitments for a capital raising of A$35 million by means of a two tranche placement to Australian and\ninternational institutions and other unrelated sophisticated, professional or exempt investors. The placement was fully subscribed and was conducted\nat A$0.037 per share. For every share allocated in tranche two of the placement, one option was issued. The option has an exercise price of A$0.07\nper share and an expiry date of three years post allotment. The first tranche was completed on October 23, 2020 with A$10 million received. The\nsecond tranche was completed on November 4, 2020 following approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held on November 18, 2020.\nWe received the remaining A$25 million at the same time. A total of 945,945,946 shares and 674,694,939 free-attaching options were issued across\nboth tranches.\nAs of June 30, 2021, we had a total of 835.2 million unlisted, unexercised options outstanding.

Capital\nexpenditures for equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of 3 to 20 years, with a net balance as of June 30,\n2021 of A$ 31,313. We currently do not have significant capital spending requirements, but we expect to continue to engage in capital spending\nconsistent with anticipated growth in our operations and personnel.\n43\nWe believe the Australian Government tax incentive scheme relating to eligible research and development activities, introduced on July 1,\n2011, will provide us with significant benefits in future years. Such eligible R&D activities include but are not limited to:\n● Core activities, which are experimental activities whose outcome cannot be known or determined in advance, but can only be\ndetermined by applying a systematic progression of work;\n● Core activities conducted for the purpose of generating new knowledge (including new knowledge in the form of new or improved\nprocesses and materials); or\n● Supporting activities that are directly related and designed to support the above).\nUnder the research and development tax incentive scheme, entities with an aggregated turnover for the income year of less than A$20\nmillion will be entitled to a 43.5% refundable tax incentive. In the year ended June 30. 2021, we recorded A$4.1 million in other income with respect\nto funds we will receive in relation to the 2021 financial year under the research and development tax incentive scheme.\nWe have incurred recurring losses since inception, including an operating loss of A$15.3 million and A$13.5 million for the years ended\nJune 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and an operating cash outflow of A$17.3 million and A$9.4 million, respectively. We expect to continue\nincurring losses for the foreseeable future and will need to raise additional capital to continue the development of our planned research and\ndevelopment programs. Our cash and cash equivalents on hand as of June 30, 2021 of A$28.1 million. During the financial year we raised A$35\nmillion by means of a two tranche placement to institutions and other unrelated sophisticated, professional or exempt investors. Subsequent to June\n30, 2021 our cash has increased by a further A$17 million raised from the sale of our ordinary shares pursuant to our ‘At-The-Market” (ATM)\nfacility. Furthermore, we have recorded a Trade and Other Receivable as at June 30, 2021 of A$4.1 million from the Australian Taxation Office in\nrespect of our 2021 Research and Development Tax Incentive claim. On this basis, we believe we have sufficient funds to meet our forecast cash\noutflows for all planned research activities, including preparation for and commencement of the ATH434 Phase 2 clinical study and working capital\nfor at least twelve months from the date of this report. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a\ngoing concern, which contemplates the realization of our assets and the satisfaction of our liabilities in the normal course of business.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented:\nYear ended June 30,\n2021 2020 2019\n(A$)\nNet cash (used) in operating activities (17,330,069) (9,431,122) (13,954,818)\nNet cash used in investing activities (10,472) (16,744) (7,022)\nNet cash generated from(used) in financing activities 36,685,947 3,981,877 12,722,309\nNet increase(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 19,345,406 (5,465,989) (1,239,531)\nCash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 9,196,892 14,399,904 15,235,556\nExchange rate adjustments on cash held in foreign currencies (426,782) 262,977 403,879\nCash and cash equivalents at end of period 28,115,516 9,196,892 14,399,904\n44\nNet cash used in operating activities was A$17,330,069, A$9,431,122 and A$13,954,818 during the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and\n2019, respectively.

RESEARCHAND DEVELOPMENT, PATENTSAND LICENSES\nIn recent years, we have continued our practice of building valuable research collaborations with institutes based in Australia, the United\nStates and other countries to enable us to investigate a variety of therapeutic indications including Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington disease,\nParkinsonian movement disorders and selected cancers. These collaborative arrangements ensure that we work with well-respected laboratories with\nspecific expertise in screening and animal modelling of relevance to the particular indication, without incurring ongoing administrative and personnel\ncosts. We maintain in-house patent counsel and research and development project expertise to coordinate these research collaborations.\nOur research and development expenses consist primarily of expenses for contracted research and development activities conducted by third\nparties on our behalf, including personnel, testing facilities and other payments in accordance with our research and clinical agreements. Research\nand development expenses also include costs associated with the acquisition and development of patents. Due to the numerous variables and the\nuncertain nature of the development of a clinical compound, including obtaining regulatory approvals, we are not able to reasonably estimate the\nnature, timing and costs of the future expenditures necessary to complete our research and development projects, the anticipated completion dates of\neach project and when material net cash flows from our research and development programs will commence.\n45\nWhen a product candidate is identified as suitable for clinical development, we establish a project team to coordinate all non-clinical and\nclinical development and manufacturing activities. Typically, we engage a clinical research organization to manage patient enrollment, data\nmanagement, clinical site coordination and statistical analysis, as is the case with the development of our lead compound ATH434 through Phase1\nand 2 development. We manage our manufacturing campaigns through clinical manufacturing organisations for quality assurance and GMP\ncompliance. All clinical, non-clinical, clinical development and manufacturing of our compounds is performed in compliance with the appropriate\ngoverning authorities, regulators and standards (for example, the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for\nRegistration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use).\nOur technology does not currently require the licensing of enabling technology licenses or freedom to operate licenses. Our product\ncandidates are designed and synthesised by our employees and the intellectual property of such product candidates is owned by us.\nD. TREND INFORMATION\nWe are a development stage company and while we believe that our technology will offer novel therapeutic strategies into an expanding\nmarket, we cannot predict with any degree of accuracy the outcome of our research or commercialisation efforts.\nWe have not commercialised any products to date. Accordingly, any trends within the markets in which we operate are expected to have\nmore direct impact on our business in the event that we are successful in commercialising our product candidates, including ATH434, PBT2 and new\ncandidate products.\nWe will need substantial additional funding in order to complete the development, testing and commercialisation of our product candidates.\nThe commitment to these projects will require additional external funding, at least until we are able to generate sufficient cash flow from sale of one\nor more of our products to support our continued operations. If adequate funding is not available, we may be required to delay, scale back or\neliminate certain aspects of our operations or attempt to obtain funds through unfavorable arrangements with partners or others that may force us to\nrelinquish rights to certain of our technologies, products or potential markets or that could impose onerous financial or other terms. Management is\ncontinuing its efforts to obtain additional funds so that we can meet our obligations and sustain operations.\nE. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nWe are not a party to any material off-balance sheet arrangements. In addition, we have no unconsolidated special purpose financing or\npartnership entities that are likely to create material contingent obligations.\nITEM 6.

BOARD PRACTICES\nIntroduction\nOur Board of Directors is elected by and accountable to our shareholders. Our Board of Directors’ responsibilities are divided into operating\nactivities, financial and capital markets activities and scientific activities. The Chairman of our Board of Directors, currently Mr. Geoffrey Kempler,\nis responsible for the management of the Board of Directors and its functions.\n57\nElection of Directors\nDirectors are elected at our annual general meeting of shareholders. Under our Constitution, the term of office of our directors are staggered,\nsuch that at every annual general meeting of shareholders one-third, rounded down to the nearest whole number, of the directors, except a Managing\nDirector, must retire from office and may offer himself/herself for re-election. No director, except a Managing Director, shall retain office for a\nperiod in excess of three years without submitting for re-election. Our Board of Directors has the power to appoint any person to be a director, either\nto fill a vacancy or as an additional director (provided that the total number of directors does not exceed the maximum allowed by law), and any\ndirector so appointed may hold office only until the next annual general meeting when he or she shall be eligible for election. Messrs. Geoffrey\nKempler, Tristan Edwards and Dr David Sinclair must retire and may stand for re-election at our 2021 annual general meeting of shareholders.\nNon-Executive and Independent Directors\nAustralian law does not require a company to appoint a certain number of independent directors to its board of directors or audit committee.\nUnder the rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market, a majority of our Board of Directors must qualify as independent directors within the\nmeaning of the rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market, each of whom satisfies the respective “independence” requirements of the NASDAQ Stock\nMarket Rules and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our Board of Directors has determined that each of Messrs. Peter Marks and Brian\nMeltzer qualifies as an independent director under the NASDAQ Stock Market and the Securities and Exchange Commission. As a foreign private\nissuer whose shares are listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market, we are permitted to follow certain home country corporate governance practices\ninstead of certain requirements of The NASDAQ Stock Market Rules. This includes NASDAQ rule 5605(b)(1) requiring a majority of independent\ndirectors.\nCommittees of the Board of Directors\nOur Board of Directors has established the following committees:\nAudit Committee. The NASDAQ Stock Market rules require us to establish an audit committee comprised of at least three members, each of\nwhom is financially literate and satisfies the respective “independence” requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission and NASDAQ and\none of whom has accounting or related financial management expertise at senior levels within a company. As a foreign private issuer whose shares\nare listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market, we are permitted to follow certain home country corporate governance practices instead of certain\nrequirements of The NASDAQ Stock Market Rules. This includes the Rule related to Audit Committee Composition rule 5605(c)(2)(A)): we may\nhave an audit committee composed of two members instead of “at least three members”.\nOur Audit Committee assists our Board of Directors in overseeing the accounting and financial reporting processes of our company and\naudits of our financial statements, including the integrity of our financial statements, compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, our\nindependent public accountants’ qualifications and independence, the performance of our internal audit function and independent public accountants,\nand such other duties as may be directed by our Board of Directors. The Audit Committee is also required to assess risk management. The audit\ncommittee meets at least four times per year.\nOur Audit Committee currently consists of two board members, each of whom satisfies the “independence” requirements of the Securities\nand Exchange Commission and the NASDAQ Market Rules. Our Audit Committee is currently composed of Messrs. Marks and Meltzer. Our Board\nof Directors has determined that Mr. Meltzer meets the definition of an audit committee financial expert, as defined by rules of the Securities and\nExchange Commission.\n58\nRemuneration Committee. Our Board of Directors has established a Remuneration Committee, which is comprised solely of independent\ndirectors, within the meaning of the NASDAQ Stock Market Rules. The Remuneration Committee is responsible for reviewing the salary, incentives\nand other benefits of our executive officers and to make recommendations on such matters for approval by our Board of Directors. The Remuneration\nCommittee is also responsible for overseeing and advising our Board of Directors with regard to the adoption of policies that govern our\ncompensation programs, including share and ADS option and employee benefit plans. Additionally, the Remuneration Committee administers our\nshare and ADS option plans and any other employee benefit plans through a sub-committee that it established for this purpose (see Share Plan\nCommittee below). Messrs. Marks and Meltzer are the current members of the Remuneration Committee, each of whom qualifies as an “independent\ndirector” within the meaning of the NASDAQ Stock Market Rules.\nShare Plan Committee. Our Remuneration Committee has established a sub-committee, the Share Plan Committee, which administers our\nshare and ADS option plans. Messrs. Marks and Meltzer are the current members of the Share Plan Committee, each of whom qualifies as an\n“independent director” within the meaning of the NASDAQ Stock Market Rules.\nDirectors’ Service Contracts\nExcept for the agreement with Mr. Kempler in connection with his employment as our Chief Executive Officer until January 2021 as\ndescribed above, there are no arrangements or understandings between us and any of our subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any of our directors, on\nthe other hand, providing for benefits upon termination of their employment or service as directors of our company or any of our subsidiaries.\nIndemnification of Directors and Officers\nOur Constitution provides that, subject to the Australian Corporations Act, every director, secretary, manager or officer of our company or\nany person employed by our company as auditor shall be indemnified out of our funds against all liability incurred by such person as a director or\nofficer in defending proceedings, whether civil or criminal, in which judgment is given in the persons favor or in which the person is acquitted in\nconnection with any application under the Australian Corporations Act in which relief is granted to the person by a Court.\nUnder our Constitution no director, auditor or other officer shall be liable for (i) any acts, receipts, neglect or defaults of any other director\nor officer for joining in any receipt or other act for conformity; (ii) any loss or expense that may happen to us through the inefficiency or deficiency\nof title to any property acquired by order of the directors or on our behalf; (iii) the inefficiency or deficiency of any security in or upon which any of\nour monies shall be invested; (iv) any loss or damage arising from bankruptcy, insolvency or tortuous act of any person with whom any monies,\nsecurities or effects shall be deposited; (v) any loss occasioned by any error of judgment, omission, default or oversight on the persons part; or (vi)\nany other loss damage or misfortune whatsoever which shall happen in relation to those things unless the same shall happen through the persons own\nnegligence, default, breach or duty, breach of trust or dishonesty.\nIn addition, our Constitution provides that to the extent permitted by law, we may pay, or agree to pay, a premium in respect of a contract\ninsuring a person who is or has been an officer of our company or one of our subsidiaries against a liability:\n● incurred by the person in his or her capacity as an officer of our company or a subsidiary of our company provided that the liability does\nnot arise out of a conduct involving a willful breach of duty in relation to our company or a subsidiary of our company; or\n● for costs and expenses incurred by that person defending proceedings, whatever their outcome.\nWe maintain a directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy. We have established a policy for the indemnification of our directors and\nofficers against certain liabilities incurred as a director or officer, including costs and expenses associated in successfully defending legal\nproceedings.\n59\nD. EMPLOYEES\nWe consider our employees the most valuable asset of our company. We offer competitive compensation and comprehensive benefits to\nattract and retain our employees. We believe that an engaged workforce is key to maintaining our ability to innovate.\nWe are committed to providing a safe work environment for our employees in compliance with applicable regulations. We have taken\nnecessary precautions in response to the recent COVID-19 outbreak, including offering employees flexibility to work from home and mandatory\nsocial distancing requirements in the workplace.\nAs of June 30, 2021, we had 11 employees. Of such employees, eight persons are employed in research and development and three persons\nin management and administration.

In November 2018 we adopted an updated ADS plan with substantially\nthe same terms as the 2004 ADS Plan for a new ten-year term. For the description below, the 2004 ASX Plan and 2018 ADS Plan are referred to\ntogether as the Stock Option Plans. Under the 2004 ASX Plan we may issue ordinary shares and under the 2018 ADS Plan we may issue ADSs. We\nwere initially authorized to issue under the Stock Option Plans up to an aggregate 12,000,000 ordinary shares or ADSs representing 12,000,000\nordinary shares. Pursuant to subsequent shareholder approvals, the most recent of which was in November 2020, we are entitled to issue up to an\naggregate 200,000,000 ordinary shares (or ADSs representing 200,000,000 ordinary shares) under the Stock Option Plans. Any increase in such\nmaximum number of ordinary shares or ADSs issuable under the Stock Option Plans is subject to shareholder approval.\n2004 ASX Plan. The purpose of the 2004 ASX Plan is to promote the interest of our company and the interest of the employees, directors\nand consultants of our company and its subsidiaries. Under the 2004 ASX Plan, we may issue to employees, directors and consultants of our\ncompany and its subsidiaries, from time to time, ordinary shares, either by issuance of ordinary shares or under options to purchase ordinary shares\ngranted under the 2004 ASX Plan.\nThe 2004 ASX Plan is administered by the Share Plan Committee, a sub-committee of the Remuneration Committee. For the purpose of the\ndisclosure below, the term “Remuneration Committee” shall refer to the Remuneration Committee or Share Plan Committee, as applicable. Subject to\nBoard approval where required by applicable law, the Remuneration Committee has the authority, in its sole discretion, to grant options under the\n2004 ASX Plan, to interpret the provisions of the 2004 ASX Plan and to prescribe, amend, and rescind rules and regulations relating to the 2004 ASX\nPlan or any issue or grant thereunder as it may deem necessary or advisable, subject to any other approval if required by applicable law. All decisions\nmade by the Remuneration Committee pursuant to the provisions of the 2004 ASX Plan will be final, conclusive and binding on all persons.\nThe number of shares issued or options granted, the exercise price and option term or options granted, the vesting schedule and escrow\nperiods of shares issued and options granted, under the 2004 ASX Plan are determined by the Remuneration Committee, in accordance with the\nprovisions of the ASX Plan, and specified in an offer document from our company and accepted by the eligible person, subject to the terms of the\n2004 ASX Plan. Options granted under the 2004 ASX Plan will be unlisted and exercisable at an exercise price equal to less than market value of an\nordinary share on the ASX at the date of grant, or such other exercise price that the Remuneration Committee determines to be appropriate under the\ncircumstances. The term of an option granted under the 2004 ASX Plan will be determined by the Remuneration Committee; however, no option will\nbe exercisable after the expiration of ten years from the date of its grant. Except as otherwise provided in the 2004 ASX Plan or determined by the\nRemuneration Committee and set forth in an offer document, the issuance of shares and exercise of options granted under the 2004 ASX Plan will\neither (i) be subject to an escrow, under which such shares or options cannot be disposed of or exercised, respectively, within six months from the\ndate of issue or grant (or 12 months if issued or granted to a director); or (ii) will vest over a four year period in four equal installments, 25% at the\nend of each year from the date of grant. Shares issued and options granted under the 2004 ASX Plan may be subject to other performance criteria and\nhurdles, as determined by the Remuneration Committee.\n2018 ADS Plan. The purpose of the 2018 ADS Plan is to promote the interests of our company and non-Australian based employees,\nofficers, consultants, independent contractors and directors. Options granted under the 2018 ADS Plan may be incentive stock options, as provided in\nSection 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, or non-qualified stock options. Incentive stock options may only be\ngranted to employees of our company and its subsidiaries (including, without limitation, officers and directors who are also employees of our\ncompany and its subsidiaries) and may not be granted to any owner of 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of our\ncompany and subsidiaries, or a 10% Holder. To the extent that the aggregate fair market value, determined on the date that an option is granted, of\nADSs, with respect to which incentive stock options are exercisable for the first time by an optionee during any calendar year exceeds U.S.$100,000,\nsuch option shall be treated as a non-qualified stock option.\n62\nUnder the 2018 ADS Plan, we may grant to employees, officers, consultants, independent contractors and directors of our company or any\nof its subsidiaries, from time to time, options to purchase ADSs representing our ordinary shares. ADSs that are forfeited under the terms of the 2018\nADS Plan and ADSs that are the subject to options that expire unexercised or which are otherwise surrendered by an optionee without receiving any\npayment or other benefit with respect to such option may again become available for new option grants under the 2018 ADS Plan.\nThe 2018 ADS Plan is administered by our Share Plan Committee. Subject to Board approval where required by applicable law, the\nRemuneration Committee has authority, in its sole discretion, to grant options under the 2018 ADS Plan, to interpret the provisions of the 2018 ADS\nPlan and to prescribe, amend, and rescind rules and regulations relating to the 2018 ADS Plan or any options granted thereunder as it may deem\nnecessary or advisable, subject to any other approval if required by applicable law. All decisions made by the Remuneration Committee pursuant to\nthe provisions of the 2018 ADS Plan shall be final, conclusive and binding on all persons.\nThe type of option (incentive stock option or non-qualified stock option), exercise price, option term and vesting schedule of options granted\nunder the 2018 ADS Plan are determined by the Remuneration Committee, in accordance with the provisions of the ADS Plan, and specified in an\noption agreement by and between our company and the optionee, subject to the terms of the 2018 ADS Plan. The exercise price per each ADS will be\ndetermined by the Remuneration Committee at the time any option is granted, however the exercise price of an incentive stock option will not be less\nthan 100% of the fair market value of such ADS on the date of the grant and the price of an incentive stock option granted to a 10% Holder will not\nbe less than 110% of the fair market value of such ADS on the date of the grant. Options granted under the 2018 ADS Plan will not be exercisable\nafter the expiration of ten years from the date of grant, and in the case of an incentive stock option granted to a 10% Holder, the term of the option\nwill be five years from the date of grant or such shorter term as may be provided in the option agreement. The options will vest over a four-year\nperiod in four equal installments, 25% at the end of each year from the date of grant, unless otherwise provided by the Remuneration Committee in\nan option agreement.\nOptions granted under the 2018 ADS Plan are not assignable or transferable by the grantee, other than by will or the laws of descent and\ndistribution, and may be exercised during the lifetime of the grantee only by the grantee or his guardian or legal representative.\nA summary of the status of the Stock Option Plans as of June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, and changes during the years ended on those dates,\nis presented below:\nAs of June 30,\n2021 2020 2019\nWeighted Weighted Weighted\naverage average average\nexercise exercise exercise\nNumber price (A$) Number price (A$) Number price (A$)\nOptions outstanding at the beginning of the year 21,550,000 $ 0.10 25,300,000 $ 0.12 25,216,490 $ 0.19\nGranted 140,392,720 $ 0.05 - - 2,450,000 $ 0.10\nExercised\nExpired/forfeited (1,400,00) $ 0.11 (3,750,000) $ 0.25 (2,366,490) $ 0.87\nLapsed - - - - - -\nOptions outstanding at the end of the year 160,542,720 $ 0.06 21,550,000 $ 0.10 25,300,000 $ 0.12\nOptions exercisable at the end of the year 69,150,000 $ 0.09 21,550,000 $ 0.10 25,300,000 $ 0.12\n63\nAustralian Disclosure Requirements\nIndemnifying directors and officers\nDuring the financial year, we maintained an insurance policy to indemnify all current Directors and Officers against certain liabilities\nincurred as a Director or Officer, including costs and expenses associated in successfully defending legal proceedings.

MATERIAL CONTRACTS\nOn December 1, 2000, we entered into a research funding and intellectual property assignment agreement with The University of\nMelbourne, under which The University of Melbourne agreed to conduct certain research projects on our behalf. Such projects include structure-\nbased drug design involving the design of various metal-based compounds as potential diagnostics and therapeutics, drug screening and development\ninvolving the characterization of our compounds in vitro and in vivo models of neurodegenerative disorders, and cell-based drug discovery involving\nthe screening and assessment of our compounds in cell-based systems to measure toxicity and cellular dysfunction and to develop new screens for\nour company. In consideration of such services, we agreed to pay The University of Melbourne a sum of A$591,000 (inclusive of goods and services\ntax). In consideration for the assignment of rights to intellectual property developed by the University of Melbourne during the research period, we\nagreed to pay to the University of Melbourne royalties equal to 1.5% of the net invoice price of all products incorporating such intellectual property\nsold by us or on our behalf, or, the lesser of 1.5% of the net invoice price of such products sold by a licensee or assignee and 10% of gross revenues\nreceived from licensees or assignees relating to the exploitation of such intellectual property. The parties extended the term of this agreement by\nentering into consecutive agreements on December 1, 2003, December 1, 2006 and December 1, 2009. The recent research funding and intellectual\nproperty assignment agreement is deemed to have commenced as of the expiration date of the previous agreement on December 1, 2009 and expired\non December 1, 2012. The parties entered into a new research funding and intellectual property assignment agreement with the same key terms which\nexpired on December 31, 2013. The University of Melbourne subcontracted substantial parts of the research to the Florey Institute of Neuroscience\nand Mental Health. Following the novation of the agreements with the Florey Institute on November 7, 2014, we entered into a sixth research funding\nand intellectual property assignment agreement. This agreement is ongoing.\n68\nOn October 13, 2016, we entered into an At-The-Market Issuance Sales Agreement with FBR Capital Markets & Co. and Jones Trading\nInstitutional Services LLC (collectively, the “Agents”) under which we could sell up to an aggregate of U.S.$44,460,787 of ordinary shares\nrepresented by ADSs. We agreed to pay the Agents commission equal to 3% of the gross proceeds of the sales price of all ADSs sold through them as\nsales agent under the sales agreement. The offering of our ADSs pursuant to the sales agreement will terminate on the earliest of (1) the sale of all of\nthe ordinary shares subject to the sales agreement, or (2) termination of the sales agreement by us or the agent. We and the agent may terminate the\nsales agreement at any time in our sole discretion upon five days prior notice. The agent may terminate the sales agreement at any time in certain\ncircumstances, including the occurrence of a material adverse change that, in the sales agent’s judgment, may make it impracticable or inadvisable to\nmarket or sell our ADSs or a suspension or limitation of trading of our ADSs on The NASDAQ Capital Market.\nOn November 8, 2017, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to our At-The-Market Issuance Sales Agreement dated October 13, 2016, to\ncontinue the At-The-Market equity program under which we from time to time may sell up to an aggregate of U.S.$50,000,000 of ordinary shares\nrepresented by ADSs. On December 22, 2020 we entered into Amendment No. 2 to continue the at-the-market equity program under which we from\ntime to time may sell up to an aggregate of U.S.$50,000,000 of ordinary shares represented by ADSs. As of June 30, 2021, we issued a total amount\nof 5.2 million ADSs under this At-The-Market Issuance Sales Agreement for gross proceeds of A$10.25 million (U.S.$7.05 million).\nOn December 28, 2018 we entered into a securities purchase agreement with Life Biosciences whereby Life Biosciences agreed to invest an\ninitial U.S.$7.5 million in our company. Following shareholder approval, this investment was completed on April 8, 2019 with the issue of\n269,905,533 fully paid ordinary shares at an issue price of A$0.039 per share and 539,811,066 warrants, each with an exercise price of A$0.045 per\nshare and expiring on December 19, 2019. These warrants expired, unexercised. Pursuant to our agreement with Life Biosciences we agreed to\nregister for resale the ordinary shares issued to them and such ordinary issued upon exercise of the warrants. We agreed to keep the registration\nstatement effective until the earlier of (i) such time as all of the shares covered by this prospectus have been disposed of pursuant to and in\naccordance with the registration statement or (ii) the date on which all of the shares may be sold without restriction pursuant to Rule 144 of the\nSecurities Act.\nD. EXCHANGE CONTROLS\nAustralia has largely abolished exchange controls on investment transactions. The Australian dollar is freely convertible into U.S. dollars. In\naddition, there are currently no specific rules or limitations regarding the export from Australia of profits, dividends, capital, or similar funds\nbelonging to foreign investors, except that certain payments to non-residents must be reported to the Australian Cash Transaction Reports Agency,\nwhich monitors such transactions, and amounts on account of potential Australian tax liabilities may be required to be withheld unless a relevant\ntaxation treaty can be shown to apply.\nThe Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975\nUnder Australian law, in certain circumstances foreign persons are prohibited from acquiring more than a limited percentage of the shares in\nan Australian company without notification to or approval from the Australian Treasurer. These limitations are set forth in the Australian Foreign\nAcquisitions and Takeovers Act, or the Takeovers Act.\n69\nUnder the Takeovers Act, as currently in effect, any foreign person, together with associates, is prohibited from acquiring 15% or more of\nthe shares in any company having total assets exceeding A$266 million or more. In addition, a foreign person may not acquire shares in a company\nhaving total assets of A$266 million or more if, as a result of that acquisition, the total holdings of all foreign persons and their associates will exceed\n40% in aggregate without the approval of the Australian Treasurer. However, for “U.S. Investors” and investors from certain other countries, a\nthreshold of A$1,154 million applies (except in certain circumstances) to each of the previous acquisitions. A “U.S. Investor” is defined by the\nTakeovers Act as a U.S. national or a U.S. enterprise.\nIf the necessary approvals are not obtained, the Treasurer may make an order requiring the acquirer to dispose of the shares it has acquired\nwithin a specified period of time. Under the current Australian foreign investment policy, however, it is unlikely that the Treasurer would make such\nan order where the level of foreign ownership exceeds 40% in the ordinary course of trading, unless the Treasurer finds that the acquisition is\ncontrary to the national interest. The same rule applies if the total holdings of all foreign persons and their associates already exceeds 40% and a\nforeign person (or its associate) acquires any further shares, including in the course of trading in the secondary market of the ADSs. At present, we do\nnot have total assets of A$266 million.\nIf the level of foreign ownership exceeds 40% at any time, we would be considered a foreign person under the Takeovers Act. In such event,\nwe would be required to obtain the approval of the Treasurer for our company, together with our associates, to acquire (i) more than 15% of an\nAustralian company or business with assets totaling over A$252 million; or (ii) any direct or indirect ownership interest in Australian residential real\nestate.\nThe percentage of foreign ownership in our company would also be included in determining the foreign ownership of any Australian\ncompany or business in which it may choose to invest. Since we have no current plans for any such acquisitions and do not own any property, any\nsuch approvals required to be obtained by us as a foreign person under the Takeovers Act will not affect our current or future ownership or lease of\nproperty in Australia.\nOur Constitution does not contain any additional limitations on a non-resident’s right to hold or vote our securities.\nAustralian law requires the transfer of shares in our company to be made in writing. No stamp duty will be payable in Australia on the\ntransfer of ADSs.\nE. TAXATION\nThe following is a discussion of Australian and U.S. tax consequences material to our shareholders. To the extent that the discussion is\nbased on tax legislation which has not been subject to judicial or administrative interpretation, the views expressed in the discussion might not be\naccepted by the tax authorities in question or by court. The discussion is not intended, and should not be construed, as legal or professional tax advice\nand does not exhaust all possible tax considerations.\nHolders of our ADSs should consult their own tax advisors as to the United States, Australian or other tax consequences of the purchase,\nownership and disposition of ADSs, including, in particular, the effect of any foreign, state or local taxes.\nAUSTRALIAN TAX CONSEQUENCES\nIn this section we discuss the material Australian tax considerations that apply to non-Australian tax residents with respect to the acquisition,\nownership and disposal of the absolute beneficial ownership of ADSs, which are evidenced by ADRs. This discussion is based upon existing\nAustralian tax law as of the date of this annual report, which is subject to change, possibly retrospectively. This discussion does not address all\naspects of Australian income tax law which may be important to particular investors in light of their individual investment circumstances, such as\nADSs or shares held by investors subject to special tax rules (for example, financial institutions, insurance companies or tax exempt organisations).\nIn addition, this summary does not discuss any foreign or state tax considerations, other than stamp duty. Prospective investors are urged to consult\ntheir tax advisors regarding the Australian and foreign income and other tax considerations of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the ADSs\nor shares.\n70\nNature of ADSs for Australian Taxation Purposes\nHolders of our ADSs are treated as the owners of the underlying ordinary shares for Australian income tax and capital gains tax purposes.\nTherefore, dividends paid on the underlying ordinary shares will be treated for Australian tax purposes as if they were paid directly to the owners of\nADSs, and the disposal of ADSs will be treated for Australian tax purposes as the disposal of the underlying ordinary shares. In the following\nanalysis we discuss the application of the Australian income tax and capital gains tax rules to non-Australian resident holders of ADSs.\nTaxation of Dividends\nAustralia operates a dividend imputation system under which dividends may be declared to be ‘franked’ to the extent of tax paid on\ncompany profits. Fully franked dividends are not subject to dividend withholding tax. Dividends that are not franked or are partly franked and are\npaid to non-Australian resident shareholders are subject to dividend withholding tax, but only to the extent the dividends are not franked.\nUnfranked dividends paid to a non-resident shareholder are subject to withholding tax at 30%, unless the shareholder is a resident of a\ncountry with which Australia has a double taxation agreement. In accordance with the provisions of the Double Taxation Convention between\nAustralia and the United States., the maximum rate of Australian tax on unfranked dividends to which a resident of the United States is beneficially\nentitled is 15%, where the U.S. resident holds less than 10% of the voting rights in our company, or 5% where the U.S. resident holds 10% or more of\nthe voting rights in our company. The Double Taxation Convention between Australia and the United States does not apply to limit the tax rate on\ndividends where the ADSs are effectively connected to a permanent establishment or a fixed base carried on by the owner of the ADSs in Australia\nthrough which the shareholder carries on business or provides independent personal services, respectively.\nTax on Sales or other Dispositions of Shares - Capital Gains Tax\nAustralian capital gains derived by non-Australian residents in respect of the disposal of capital assets that are not taxable Australian\nproperty will be disregarded. Non-Australian resident shareholders will not be subject to Australian capital gains tax on the capital gain made on a\ndisposal of our shares, unless they, together with associates, hold 10% or more of our issued capital, tested either at the time of disposal or over any\ncontinuous 12 month period in the 24 months prior to disposal, and the value of our shares at the time of disposal are wholly or principally\nattributable to Australian real property assets.\nAustralian capital gains tax applies to net capital gains at a taxpayer’s marginal tax rate. Previously, certain shareholders, such as individuals\nwere entitled to a discount of 50% for capital gains on shares held for greater than 12 months. However, as part of the 2012-2013 Federal Budget\nmeasures, the Australian Government announced changes to the application of the CGT discount for foreign resident individuals on taxable\nAustralian assets, including shares. These changes became effective on June 29, 2013.\nThe effect of the change is to:\n● Retain access to the full CGT discount for discount capital gains of foreign resident individuals in respect of the increase in the value of\na CGT asset that occurred before May 9, 2013; and\n● Remove the CGT discount for discount capital gains for foreign resident individuals that arise after May 8, 2013.\nForeign residents will still have access to a discount on discount capital gains accrued prior to May 8, 2013 provided they choose to obtain a\nmarket valuation for their assets as of that date.\nNet capital gains are calculated after reduction for capital losses, which may only be offset against capital gains.\nTax on Sales or other Dispositions of Shares - Shareholders Holding Shares on Revenue Account\nSome non-Australian resident shareholders may hold shares on revenue rather than on capital account, for example, share traders. These\nshareholders may have the gains made on the sale or other disposal of the shares included in their assessable income under the ordinary income\nprovisions of the income tax law, if the gains are sourced in Australia.\n71\nNon-Australian resident shareholders assessable under these ordinary income provisions in respect of gains made on shares held on revenue\naccount would be assessed for such gains at the Australian tax rates for non-Australian residents, which start at a marginal rate of 32.5% for non-\nAustralian resident individuals. Some relief from the Australian income tax may be available to such non-Australian resident shareholders under the\nDouble Taxation Convention between the United States and Australia, for example, because the shareholder does not have a permanent establishment\nin Australia.\nTo the extent an amount would be included in a non-Australian resident shareholder’s assessable income under both the capital gains tax\nprovisions and the ordinary income provisions, the capital gain amount would generally be reduced, so that the shareholder would not be subject to\ndouble tax on any part of the income gain or capital gain.\nDual Residency\nIf a shareholder were a resident of both Australia and the United States under those countries’ domestic taxation laws, that shareholder may\nbe subject to tax as an Australian resident. If, however, the shareholder is determined to be a U.S. resident for the purposes of the Double Taxation\nConvention between the United States and Australia, the Australian tax applicable would be limited by the Double Taxation Convention.\nShareholders should obtain specialist taxation advice in these circumstances.\nStamp Duty\nA transfer of shares of a company listed on the ASX is not subject to Australian stamp duty except in some circumstances where one person,\nor associated persons, acquires 90% or more of the shares.\nAustralian Death Duty\nAustralia does not have estate or death duties. No capital gains tax liability is realised upon the inheritance of a deceased person’s shares.\nThe disposal of inherited shares by beneficiaries, may, however, give rise to a capital gains tax liability.\nGoods and Services Tax\nThe issue or transfer of shares will not incur Australian goods and services.\nUNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES\nThe following is a summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences that generally apply to U.S. Holders (as defined\nbelow) who hold ADSs as capital assets. This summary is based on the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, Treasury\nregulations promulgated thereunder, judicial and administrative interpretations thereof, and the bilateral taxation convention between Australia and\nthe United States, or the Tax Treaty, all as in effect on the date hereof and all of which are subject to change either prospectively or retroactively.\nThis summary does not discuss all the tax consequences that may be relevant to an investment in ADSs by a U.S. Holder in light of such holder’s\nparticular circumstances or to U.S. Holders subject to special rules, including broker-dealers, financial institutions, certain insurance companies,\ninvestors liable for alternative minimum tax, tax-exempt organisations, regulated investment companies, non-resident aliens of the U.S. or taxpayers\nwhose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, persons who hold the ADSs through partnerships or other pass-through entities, persons who\nacquired their ADSs through the exercise or cancellation of any employee stock options or otherwise as compensation for their services, investors\nthat actually or constructively own 10% or more of our shares by vote or value, investors holding ADSs as part of a straddle or appreciated financial\nposition or as part of a hedging or conversion transaction , and persons required to accelerate the recognition of any item of income with respect to\nthe ADSs as a result of such income being recognized on an applicable financial statement.\nIf a partnership or an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes owns ADSs, the U.S. federal income tax treatment\nof a partner in such a partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. A partnership that owns\nADSs and the partners in such partnership should consult their own tax advisors about the U.S. federal income tax consequences of holding and\ndisposing of ADSs.\n72\nThis summary does not address the effect of any U.S. federal taxation other than U.S. federal income taxation. In addition, this summary\ndoes not include any discussion of U.S. federal estate and gift tax, state, local or foreign taxation. You are urged to consult your tax advisors\nregarding the foreign and U.S. federal, state and local tax considerations of an investment in ADSs.\nFor purposes of this summary, the term “U.S. Holder” means an individual who is a citizen or, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a\nresident of the United States, a corporation or other entity taxable as a corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or\nany political subdivision thereof, an estate whose income is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source, or a trust if (a) a court within\nthe United States is able to exercise primary supervision over administration of the trust, and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control\nall substantial decisions of the trust or (b) it has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person.\nFor purposes of the discussion below, it is assumed that the representations contained in the deposit agreement governing the ADSs\nare true and that the obligations in the deposit agreement and any related agreement will be complied with in accordance with their terms.\nTaxation of Dividends\nFor U.S. federal income tax purposes, U.S. Holders of ADSs will be treated as owning the underlying ordinary shares represented by the\nADSs held by them. Subject to the passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, rules discussed below, the gross amount of any distributions\nreceived with respect to the underlying ordinary shares represented by the ADSs, including the amount of any Australian taxes withheld therefrom,\nwill constitute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes, to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under\nU.S. federal income tax principles. You will be required to include this amount of dividends in gross income as ordinary income. Distributions in\nexcess of our earnings and profits will be treated as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of your tax basis in the ADSs. Any amount in excess\nof your tax basis will be treated as gain from the sale of ADSs. See “Disposition of ADSs” below for the discussion on the taxation of capital gains.\nDividends will not qualify for the dividends-received deduction generally available to corporations under Section 243 of the Code.\nDividends that we pay in Australian dollars, including the amount of any Australian taxes withheld therefrom, will be included in your\nincome in a U.S. dollar amount calculated by reference to the exchange rate in effect on the day such dividends are received. A U.S. Holder who\nreceives payment in Australian dollars and converts Australian dollars into U.S. dollars at an exchange rate other than the rate in effect on such day\nwill likely have a foreign currency exchange gain or loss, which would be treated as U.S.-source ordinary income or loss.\nSubject to complex limitations, any Australian withholding tax imposed on our dividends will be a foreign income tax eligible for credit\nagainst a U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability (or, alternatively, for deduction against income in determining such tax liability). The\nlimitations set forth in the Code include computational rules under which foreign tax credits allowable with respect to specific classes of income\ncannot exceed the U.S. federal income taxes otherwise payable with respect to each such class of income. Dividends generally will be treated as\nforeign-source passive category income or general category income for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes, depending upon the holder’s circumstances.\nA U.S. Holder will be denied a foreign tax credit with respect to Australian income tax withheld from dividends received with respect to the\nunderlying ordinary shares represented by the ADSs to the extent such U.S. Holder has not held the ADSs for at least 16 days of the 31-day period\nbeginning on the date that is 15 days before the ex-dividend date or to the extent such U.S. Holder is under an obligation to make related payments\nwith respect to substantially similar or related property. Any days during which a U.S. Holder has substantially diminished its risk of loss on the\nADSs are not counted toward meeting the 16-day holding period required by the statute. The rules relating to the determination of the foreign tax\ncredit are complex. You should consult with your own tax advisors to determine whether and to what extent you would be entitled to this credit.\n73\nSubject to certain limitations, “qualified dividend income” received by a non-corporate U.S. Holder will be subject to tax at a reduced\nmaximum tax rate of 20 percent. Distributions taxable as dividends generally qualify for the 20 percent rate provided that either: (i) the issuer is\nentitled to benefits under the Tax Treaty or (ii) the ADSs are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States and certain\nother requirements are met. We believe that we are entitled to benefits under the Tax Treaty and that the ADSs currently are readily tradable on an\nestablished securities market in the United States. However, no assurance can be given that the ADSs will remain readily tradable. Furthermore, the\nreduced rate does not apply to dividends received from PFICs. The amount of foreign tax credit is limited in the case of foreign qualified dividend\nincome. U.S. Holders of ADSs should consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect of these rules in their particular circumstances.\nDisposition of ADSs\nIf you sell or otherwise dispose of ADSs, you will recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the\ndifference between the amount realized on the sale or other disposition and your adjusted tax basis in the ADSs. Subject to the PFIC rules discussed\nbelow, such gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if you have held the ADSs for more than one\nyear at the time of the sale or other disposition. In general, any gain that you recognize on the sale or other disposition of ADSs will be U.S.-source\nfor purposes of the foreign tax credit limitation; losses will generally be allocated against U.S.-source income. Deduction of capital losses is subject\nto certain limitations under the Code.\nIn the case of a cash basis U.S. Holder who receives Australian dollars in connection with the sale or disposition of ADSs, the amount\nrealized will be based on the U.S. dollar value of the Australian dollars received with respect to the ADSs as determined on the settlement date of\nsuch exchange. A U.S. Holder who receives payment in Australian dollars and converts them into U.S. dollars at a conversion rate other than the rate\nin effect on the settlement date may have a foreign currency exchange gain or loss that would be treated as ordinary income or loss.\nAn accrual basis U.S. Holder may elect the same treatment of foreign currency gain or loss required of cash basis taxpayers with respect to a\nsale or disposition of ADSs, provided that the election is applied consistently from year to year. Such election may not be changed without the\nconsent of the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS. In the event that an accrual basis U.S. Holder does not elect to be treated as a cash basis taxpayer\n(pursuant to the Treasury regulations applicable to foreign currency transactions), such U.S. Holder may have a foreign currency gain or loss for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes because of differences between the U.S. dollar value of the Australian dollars received prevailing on the trade date and\nthe settlement date. Any such currency gain or loss would be treated as ordinary income or loss and would be in addition to gain or loss, if any,\nrecognised by such U.S. Holder on the sale or other disposition of such ADSs.\nPassive Foreign Investment Companies\nWe are likely a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes for some U.S. Holders of our ADSs and a controlled foreign corporation (CFC)\nto other U.S Holders of our ADSs. Our treatment as a PFIC could result in a reduction in the after-tax return to those U.S. Holders of our ADSs and\nmay affect the value of the securities.\nFor U.S. federal income tax purposes, we will be classified as a PFIC for any taxable year in which either (i) 75% or more of our gross\nincome is passive income, or (ii) at least 50% of the average value of all of our assets for the taxable year produce or are held for the production of\npassive income. For this purpose, cash is considered to be an asset that produces passive income. Passive income generally includes dividends,\ninterest, royalties, rents, annuities and the excess of gains over losses from the disposition of assets that produce passive income. As a result of our\nsubstantial cash position and the decline in the value of our stock, we believe that we became a PFIC during the taxable year ended June 30, 2005.\nWe believe that we continued to be classified as a PFIC during the taxable year ended June 30, 2021 for some U.S Holders of our ADSs and may\ncontinue to be a PFIC for each of the subsequent fiscal years.\nIf we are a PFIC with respect to you, our dividends (if any are paid) will not qualify for the reduced maximum tax rate, discussed above,\nand, unless you timely elect to “mark-to-market” your ADSs, as described below:\n● you will be required to allocate “excess distributions” or gain recognised upon the disposition of ADRs ratably over your holding period\nfor the ADSs. An “excess distribution” is the amount by which distributions during a taxable year in respect of an ADS exceed 125% of\nthe average annual distributions during the three preceding taxable years (or, if shorter, your holding period for the ADSs).\n74\n● the amount allocated to each year during which we are considered a PFIC, other than the year of the distribution or disposition, will be\nsubject to tax at the highest individual or corporate tax rate, as the case may be, in effect for that year and an interest charge will be\nimposed with respect to the resulting tax liability allocated to each such year,\n● the amount allocated to the current taxable year and any taxable year before we became a PFIC will be taxable as ordinary income in\nthe current year, and\n● you will be required to file an annual return on IRS Form 8621.\nThe PFIC provisions discussed above apply to U.S. persons who directly or indirectly hold stock in a PFIC.\nGenerally, a U.S. person is considered an indirect shareholder of a PFIC if it is:\n● a direct or indirect owner of a pass-through entity, including a trust or estate, that is a direct or indirect shareholder of a PFIC,\n● a shareholder of a PFIC that is a shareholder of another PFIC, or\n● a 50%-or-more shareholder of a foreign corporation that is not a PFIC and that directly or indirectly owns stock of a PFIC.\nAn indirect shareholder may be taxed on a distribution paid to the direct owner of the PFIC and on a disposition of the stock indirectly\nowned. Indirect shareholders are strongly urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of these rules.\nIf we cease to be a PFIC in a future year, a U.S. Holder may avoid the continued application of the tax treatment described above by electing\nto be treated as if it sold its ADSs on the last day of the last taxable year in which we were a PFIC. Any gain would be recognised and subject to tax\nunder the rules described above and any loss would not be recognised. A U.S. Holder’s basis in its ADSs would be increased by the amount of gain,\nif any, recognised on the sale. Solely for purposes of the PFIC rules, a U.S. Holder would be required to treat its holding period for its ADSs as\nbeginning on the day following the last day of the last taxable year in which we were a PFIC.\nIf the ADSs are considered “marketable stock” and if you elect to “mark-to-market” your ADSs, you would not be subject to the rules\ndescribed above. Instead, you will generally include in income any excess of the fair market value of the ADSs at the close of each tax year over your\nadjusted basis in the ADSs. If the fair market value of the ADSs has depreciated below your adjusted basis at the close of the tax year, you may\ngenerally deduct the excess of the adjusted basis of the ADSs over its fair market value at that time. However, such deductions generally would be\nlimited to the net mark-to-market gains, if any, that you included in income with respect to such ADSs in prior years. Income recognised and\ndeductions allowed under the mark-to-market provisions, as well as any gain or loss on the disposition of ADSs with respect to which the mark-to-\nmarket election is made, are treated as ordinary income or loss (except that loss is treated as capital loss to the extent the loss exceeds the net mark-\nto-market gains, if any, that a U.S. Holder included in income with respect to such ADSs in prior years). However, gain or loss from the disposition\nof ADSs (as to which a “mark-to-market” election was made) in a year in which we are no longer a PFIC will be capital gain or loss. Our ADSs\nshould be considered “marketable stock” if they traded at least 15 days during each calendar quarter of the relevant calendar year in more than de\nminimis quantities.\nA U.S. Holder of ADSs will not be able to avoid the tax consequences described above by electing to treat us as a qualified electing fund, or\nQEF, because we do not intend to prepare the information that U.S. Holders would need to make a QEF election.\nAdditional Tax on Investment Income\nU.S. Holders that are individuals, estates, or trusts and whose income exceeds certain thresholds will be subject to a 3.8% Medicare\ncontribution tax on net investment income, which will include dividends on and capital gains from the sale or other taxable disposition of ADSs,\nsubject to certain limitations and exceptions.\n75\nBackup Withholding and Information Reporting\nPayments in respect of ADSs may be subject to information reporting to the IRS and to U.S. backup withholding tax at a rate equal to the\nfourth lowest income tax rate applicable to individuals (which, under current law, is 24%). Backup withholding will not apply, however, if you (i) are\na corporation or come within certain exempt categories and demonstrate the fact when so required or (ii) furnish a correct taxpayer identification\nnumber and make any other required certification.\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be credited against a U.S. Holder’s\nU.S. tax liability. A U.S. Holder may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by filing the appropriate\nclaim for refund with the IRS, which is generally an annual income tax return.\nU.S. individuals who hold certain specified foreign financial assets, including stock in a foreign corporation, with values in excess of certain\nthresholds are required to file IRS Form 8938 with their U.S. federal income tax return. Such form requires disclosure of information concerning\nsuch foreign assets, including their value. Failure to file the form when required is subject to penalties. An exemption from reporting applies to\nforeign assets held through a U.S. financial institution, generally including a non-U.S. branch or subsidiary of a U.S. institution and a U.S. branch of\na non-U.S. institution. Investors are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the possible application of this disclosure\nrequirement to their investment in our ADSs.\nF. DIVIDENDSAND PAYING AGENTS\nNot applicable.\nG. STATEMENTBY EXPERTS\nNot applicable.\nH. DOCUMENTSON DISPLAY\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, as applicable to “foreign private issuers” as defined in Rule 3b-4\nthereunder. As a foreign private issuer, we are exempt from certain provisions of the Exchange Act. Accordingly, our proxy solicitations are not\nsubject to the disclosure and procedural requirements of Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act, transactions in our equity securities by our officers\nand directors are exempt from reporting and the “short-swing” profit recovery provisions contained in Section 16 of the Exchange Act. In addition,\nwe are not required to file periodic reports and financial statements as frequently or as promptly as U.S. companies whose securities are registered\nunder the Exchange Act. However, we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission an annual report on Form 20-F containing financial\nstatements that have been examined and reported on, with an opinion expressed by, an independent registered public accounting firm, and we submit\nreports to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 6-K containing (among other things) press releases and unaudited financial information\nfor the first six months of each fiscal year. We post our annual report on Form 20-F on our website (www.alteritytherapeutics.com) promptly\nfollowing the filing of our annual report with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information on our website is not incorporated by\nreference into this annual report.\nThe documents concerning our company referred to in this annual report may also be inspected at our registered office located at Level 3, 62\nLygon Street, Carlton, Victoria, 3053, Australia.\nI. SUBSIDIARY INFORMATION\nNot applicable.\n76\nITEM 11. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe invest our excess cash and cash equivalents in interest-bearing accounts and term deposits with banks in Australia. Our management\nbelieves that the financial institutions that hold our investments are financially sound and accordingly, minimal credit risk exists with respect to these\ninvestments. Certain of our cash equivalents are subject to interest rate risk. Due to the short duration and conservative nature of these instruments,\nwe do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk. Our major market risk is changes in foreign exchange rates as we had\napproximately A$21,523,678, A$5,403,402 and A$9,726,790 cash held in U.S. dollars, which is our major foreign currency, as of June 30, 2021,\n2020 and 2019, respectively. A hypothetical 14% adverse movement, based on average of highest and lowest exchange rate during the year, would\nreduce the cash balance at the end of each year by approximately A$2,999,130.\nWe conduct our activities in mostly in Australia and the USA. We are required to make certain payments in U.S. dollars and other\ncurrencies, however we believe an adverse movement in end-of-period exchange rates would not have a material impact on our operating results. In\nthe twelve months ended June 30, 2021, the Australian dollar appreciated against the U.S. dollar by 9.16%. In the financial years 2020 and 2019, the\nAustralian dollar depreciated by 1.66% and 5.27% against the U.S. dollar, respectively. A hypothetical 14% adverse movement in the U.S. dollar\nwould increase the cost of our foreign currency payables by approximately A$114,233.\nWe do not currently utilize derivative financial instruments or other financial instruments subject to market risk.\nITEM 12. DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES OTHER THAN EQUITY SECURITIES\nFees and Charges Payable by ADS Holders\nThe table below summarizes the fees and charges that a holder of our ADSs may have to pay, directly or indirectly, to our depositary, The\nBank of New York Mellon, or BNYM, pursuant to the Deposit Agreement, which was filed as Exhibit 2.1 to our Registration Statement on Form F-6\nfiled with the SEC on December 21, 2007, and the types of services and the amount of the fees or charges paid for such services. The disclosure\nunder this heading “Fees and Charges Payable by ADS Holders” is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Deposit\nAgreement. The holder of an ADS may have to pay the following fees and charges to BNYM in connection with ownership of the ADS:\nPersons Depositing or Withdrawing Shares Must Pay: For:\n● U.S.$3.00 (or less) per 100 ADSs (or portion of 100 ADSs) ● Issuance of ADSs, including issuances resulting from a distribution\nof shares or rights or other property\n● Cancellation of ADSs for the purpose of withdrawal, including if\nthe deposit agreement terminates\n● U.S.$0.03 (or less) per ADS ● Any cash distribution to you\n● A fee equivalent to the fee that would be payable if securities ● Distribution of securities distributed to holders of deposited\ndistributed to you had been shares and the shares had been securities which are distributed by the depositary to ADS holders\ndeposited for issuance of ADSs\n● U.S.$1.50 (or less) per ADS ● Transfers, combination and split-up of ADSs\n● Expenses of the depositary ● Cable, telex and facsimile transmissions (when expressly provided\nin the deposit agreement)\n● Converting foreign currency to U.S. dollars\n● Taxes and other governmental charges the depositary or the ● As necessary\ncustodian have to pay on any ADS or share underlying an ADS,\nfor example, stock transfer taxes, stamp duty or withholding taxes\n● Any charges incurred by the depositary or its agents for servicing ● As necessary\nthe deposited securities\n77\nThe depositary collects its fees for delivery and surrender of ADSs directly from investors depositing shares or surrendering ADSs for the\npurpose of withdrawal or from intermediaries acting for them. The depositary collects fees for making distributions to investors by deducting those\nfees from the amounts distributed or by selling a portion of distributable property to pay the fees. The depositary may collect its annual fee for\ndepositary services by deduction from cash distributions or by directly billing investors or by charging the book-entry system accounts of participants\nacting for them. The depositary may collect any of its fees by deduction from any cash distribution payable to ADS holders that are obligated to pay\nthose fees. The depositary may generally refuse to provide fee-attracting services until its fees for those services are paid.\nFrom time to time, the depositary may make payments to us to reimburse and/or share revenue from the fees collected from ADS holders, or\nwaive fees and expenses for services provided, generally relating to costs and expenses arising out of establishment and maintenance of the ADS\nprogram. In performing its duties under the deposit agreement, the depositary may use brokers, dealers or other service providers that are affiliates of\nthe depositary and that may earn or share fees or commissions.\nFees and Payments Made by the Depositary to the Company\nWe incurred expenses in relation to services for our annual general meeting and special general meeting of shareholders. For the year ended\nJune 30, 2021, we paid BNYM a total of U.S.$41,180 (comprised of payments for the distribution and printing of meeting material and proxy vote\ntabulation). For the year ended June 30, 2020, we paid BNYM a total of U.S.$23,040 (comprised of payments for the distribution and printing of\nmeeting material and proxy vote tabulation).\n78\nPART II\nITEM 13.

MATERIAL MODIFICATIONS TO THE RIGHTS OF SECURITY HOLDERS AND USE OF PROCEEDS\nNot applicable.\nITEM 15.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that\nwe file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) is recorded, processed, summarised and reported\nwithin the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information required to be disclosed by\nus in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our chief executive officer and chief financial\nofficer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer,\nconducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), as of the end of the period\ncovered by this Annual Report on Form 20-F. Based upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of\nJune 30, 2021, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over\nfinancial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision\nof, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company’s board of directors, management and other\npersonnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external\npurposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:\n● pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets\nof the company;\n● provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance\nwith generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance\nwith authorizations of management and directors of the company; and\n● provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use of disposition of the company’s\nassets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any\nevaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the\ndegree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nOur management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2021. In making this assessment,\nour management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-\nIntegrated Framework (2013). Based on that assessment, our management concluded that as of June 30, 2021, our internal control over financial\nreporting is effective.\n79\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this annual report on Form\n20-F that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nITEM 16.RESERVED\nITEM 16A. AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT\nOur Board of Directors has determined that Mr. Brian Meltzer, an independent director, meets the definition of an audit committee financial\nexpert, as defined by rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. For a brief listing of Mr. Meltzer’s relevant experience, see Item 6.A.\n“Directors, Senior Management and Employees - Directors and Senior Management.”\nITEM 16B. CODE OF ETHICS\nWe have adopted a code of ethics that applies to all senior financial officers of our company, including our chief executive officer, chief\nfinancial officer, chief accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions. The code of ethics is publicly available on our\nwebsite at www.alteritytherapeutics.com. Written copies are available upon request.

Pre-approval of an audit or non-audit service may be given as a general pre-approval, as part of the audit\ncommittee’s approval of the scope of the engagement of our independent registered public accounting firm, or on an individual basis. Any proposed\nservices exceeding general pre-approved levels also requires specific pre-approval by our audit committee. The policy prohibits retention of the\nindependent registered public accounting firm to perform the prohibited non-audit functions defined in Section 201 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or the\nrules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and also requires the audit committee to consider whether proposed services are compatible with\nthe independence of the registered public accounting firm.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the\nCompany’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting\nOversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we\nplan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement,\nwhether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial\nreporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of\nexpressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error\nor fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts\nand disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates\nmade by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a\nreasonable basis for our opinion.\nF-2\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was\ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the\nconsolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit\nmatters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the\ncritical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nResearch and development tax incentive receivable\nAs described in Notes 1, 2 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s research and development (“R&D”) tax incentive\nreceivable was $4.1 million as of June 30, 2021, which was recorded as other income for the year ended June 30, 2021. Management assesses the\nR&D activities to determine which are eligible under the R&D tax incentive scheme and then records the expected R&D tax incentive amount as a\nreceivable on the consolidated statement of financial position and other income in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other\ncomprehensive loss. Management applies significant judgement in determining whether the R&D activities and related expenditures are eligible\nunder the R&D tax incentive scheme.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the R&D tax incentive receivable is a critical audit matter\nare the significant judgements made by management to determine whether the R&D activities and related expenditures are eligible under the R&D\ntax incentive scheme. This in turn lead to a high degree of auditor subjectivity, judgement and effort to evaluate the audit evidence related to the\nvaluation of the R&D tax incentive receivable.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the\nconsolidated financial statements. These procedures included, among others, testing management’s process for determining the R&D tax incentive\nreceivable, which included: (i) evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodology used to estimate the amount of the R&D tax incentive\nreceivable; (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying expense data used to determine the R&D tax incentive receivable and (iii)\nevaluating, for a selection of eligible expenditures, the reasonableness of management’s assessment of eligibility. The work of management’s\nspecialist was used in performing the procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the R&D tax incentive receivable. As a basis for using this work,\nwe obtained an understanding of the specialist’s qualifications and the Company’s relationship with the specialist was assessed. The procedures\nperformed also included evaluation of the assumptions used by the specialist and an evaluation of the specialist’s findings.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers\nMelbourne, Australia\nSeptember 2, 2021\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2006.\nF-3\nALTERITY THERAPEUTICS LIMITED\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION\n(in Australian dollars, except number of shares)\nJune 30,\nNotes 2021 2020\nAssets\nCurrent Assets\nCash and cash equivalents 28,115,516 9,196,892\nTrade and other receivables 5 4,277,677 61,321\nOther current assets 6 1,095,753 578,136\nTotal Current Assets 33,488,946 9,836,349\nNon-Current Assets\nProperty and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation of A$374,064 and A$355,955\nrespectively 31,313 39,503\nRight-of-use assets net of accumulated depreciation of A$272,491 and A$215,875 respectively 13 65,495 31,866\nTotal Non-Current Assets 96,808 71,369\nTotal Assets 33,585,754 9,907,718\nLiabilities\nCurrent Liabilities\nTrade and other payables 7 2,502,509 2,069,604\nProvisions 8 537,368 612,039\nLease liabilities 13 27,746 32,879\nTotal Current Liabilities 3,067,623 2,714,522\nNon-Current Liabilities\nProvisions 8 9,768 41,514\nLease liabilities 13 37,903 868\nTotal Non-Current Liabilities 47,671 42,382\nTotal Liabilities 3,115,294 2,756,904\nNet Assets 30,470,460 7,150,814\nEquity\nIssued capital 10 197,447,990 160,703,754\n2021: 2,084,016,678 fully paid ordinary shares\nNil options over fully paid ordinary shares\n2020: 1,037,358,032 fully paid ordinary shares\nNil options over fully paid ordinary shares\nReserves 11 2,750,884 866,121\nAccumulated deficit during the development stage 12 (169,728,414) (154,419,061)\nTotal Equity 30,470,460 7,150,814\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.\nF-4\nALTERITY THERAPEUTICS LIMITED\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF PROFIT OR LOSS AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS\n(in Australian dollars, except number of shares and per share amounts)\nYears ended June 30,\nNotes 2021 2020 2019\nInterest income 2 20,676 17,117 108,538\nOther income 2 4,485,225 122,729 4,951,167\nIntellectual property expenses (360,026) (352,922) (322,097)\nGeneral and administration expenses 3 (6,937,842) (3,446,139) (4,308,352)\nResearch and development expenses 3 (12,283,848) (10,098,439) (12,983,185)\nOther operating expenses (2,227) (44,217) (132,965)\nOther gains and losses 3 (297,111) 333,055 349,064\nForfeited options from reserves 65,800 12,016 -\nLoss before income tax expense (15,309,353) (13,456,800) (12,337,830)\nIncome tax expense 4 -

BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBackground\nAlterity Therapeutics Limited and its controlled subsidiaries, Alterity Therapeutics Inc. and Alterity Therapeutics UK Limited (referred to\ncollectively as “Alterity” or the “Group”), is a development stage enterprise engaged in the research and development of therapeutic drugs designed\nto treat the underlying cause of degeneration of the brain focusing on Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington disease, Parkinson’s disease and other\nneurological disorders. Alterity Therapeutics Limited, the parent entity, was incorporated on November 11, 1997 in Melbourne, Australia and the UK\nand U.S. subsidiaries were incorporated in August 2004.\nFinancial Reporting Framework\nThe financial report of Alterity Therapeutics Limited for the year ended June 30, 2021 was authorized for issue on September 2, 2021.\nAlterity Therapeutics Limited is a for-profit entity for the purpose of preparing the financial statements.\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group comply with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International\nAccounting Standards Board (IASB) and Australian equivalent International Financial Reporting Standards, as issued by the Australian Accounting\nStandards Board.\nThese financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of financial liabilities at fair value\nthrough profit or losses.\nAccounting policies are selected and applied in a manner which ensures that the resulting financial information satisfies the concepts of relevance\nand reliability, thereby ensuring that the substance of the underlying transactions or other events is reported.\nThe accounting policies set out below have been applied in preparing the financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2021 and the comparative\ninformation presented in these financial statements for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019.\nCritical accounting estimates, judgments and assumptions\nEstimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events\nthat may have a financial impact on the entity and that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.\nThe Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related\nactual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and\nliabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.\nShare-based Payments\nThe value attributed to share options and remuneration shares issued is an estimate calculated using an appropriate mathematical formula based on an\noption pricing model. The choice of models and the resultant option value require assumptions to be made in relation to the likelihood and timing of\nthe conversion of the options to shares and the value and volatility of the price of the underlying shares.\nR&D Tax Incentives\nThe Australian Government replaced the research and development tax concession with the research and development tax incentive from July 1,\n2011. The provisions provide refundable or non-refundable tax offsets. The research and development tax incentive applies to expenditure incurred\nand the use of depreciating assets in an income year commencing on or after July 1, 2011. A 43.5% refundable tax offset will be available to eligible\nsmall companies with an annual aggregate turnover of less than $20 million. Management has assessed these activities and expenditure to determine\nwhich are likely to be eligible under the incentive scheme. For the period to June 30, 2021 the Group has recorded an item in other income of A$4.1\nmillion (2020: Nil, 2019: A$5.0 million) to recognize this amount which relates to this period.\nOn October 7, 2020, the Treasury Laws Amendment (A Tax Plan for the Covid-19 Economic Recovery Bill 2020) was introduced to the Parliament.\nThis legislation supersedes the Treasury Laws Amendment (Research and Development Incentive) Bill 2019. Under the amendments, commencing\nJuly 1, 2021, the refundable tax offset rate for companies with aggregated turnover below $20million would become 18.5% above the companies tax\nrate and the R&D expenditure threshold would be increased from $100 million to $150 million.\nF-8\nALTERITY THERAPEUTICS LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – in Australian dollars (unless otherwise noted)\n1. BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nManagement does not consider the rate reduction or the refund cap has material impact towards the Group’s R&D tax incentive claim for the next\nfinancial year going forward.\nGoing Concern Basis\nThe Group is a development stage medical biotechnology company and as such expects to be utilizing cash until its research activities have become\nmarketable. The Group has incurred recurring losses since inception including an operating loss of $15,309,353 (2020: $13,456,800) and an\noperating cash outflow of $17,330,069 (2020: $9,431,122). The Group expects to continue incurring losses into the foreseeable future and will need\nto raise additional capital to continue the long-term development of its planned research and development programs. Cash and cash equivalents on\nhand as at June 30, 2021 was A$28,115,516. During the financial year ended June 30, 2021 the Group raised $35,000,000 via a two tranche\nplacement to institutions and other unrelated sophisticated, professional or exempt investors. Subsequent to June 30, 2021, cash further increased by\nA$17,176,040 resulting from the sale of shares of our ordinary shares pursuant to the ‘At-the-market” (ATM) facility. Furthermore, the Group has\nrecorded a Trade and Other Receivable as at June 30, 2021 of $4,126,364 from the Australian Taxation Office in respect of our 2021 Research and\nDevelopment Tax Incentive claim. The Group has sufficient funds to meet our forecast cash outflows for all planned research and development\nactivities, including preparation for and commencement of the ATH434 Phase 2 clinical study and working capital for at least the next twelve months\nfrom the issuance of this report.\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Group will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the\nrealization of assets and the satisfaction of its liabilities in the normal course of business.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the Group to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of\nassets, liabilities, income and expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the Group evaluates its significant accounting policies and\nestimates. Estimates are based on historical experience and on various market-specific and other relevant assumptions that the Group believes to be\nreasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\nEstimates are assessed each period and updated to reflect current information, such as the economic considerations related to the impact that COVID-\n19 could have on the Group’s significant accounting estimates. The Group’s future assessments of the impact of COVID-19 could result in material\nimpacts to the its consolidated financial statements in future periods.\nHowever, COVID-19 has had limited effect thus far on the Group’s operation. Development activities have continued with minimal disruption.\nSlowdown in collaborative research activities do not have a material impact on the Group’s operations.\nDevelopment Stage – Risks and Uncertainties\nAs a development stage enterprise, the Group’s prospects are subject to the risks, expenses and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies\nwhich have not yet commercialized any applications of their technology, particularly in new and evolving markets. Alterity’s operating results may\nfluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors, including capital expenditure and other costs relating to establishing,\nmaintaining and expanding the operations, the number and mix of potential customers, potential pricing of future products by the Group and its\ncompetitors, new technology introduced by the Group and its competitors, delays or expense in obtaining necessary equipment, economic and social\nconditions in the biotechnology industry and general economic conditions.\nThe Group cannot be certain that it will be able to raise any required funding or capital, on favorable terms or at all, or that it will be able to establish\ncorporate collaborations on acceptable terms, if at all. If the Group is unable to obtain such additional funding or capital, it may be required to reduce\nthe scope of its development plans.\nThe Group’s experience in exploiting its technology is limited and it cannot be certain that its operations will be profitable in the short-term, or at all.\nIf the Group fails in its efforts to establish or expand its business, the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity of the Group could be\nmaterially adversely affected. The Group cannot be certain that it will be able to sell and deliver its technology or to obtain or retain any permits\nrequired in the market in which it operates. Any of these factors could result in the reduction or cessation of the Group’s operations.\nF-9\nALTERITY THERAPEUTICS LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – in Australian dollars (unless otherwise noted)\n1. BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nAccounting policies are selected and applied in a manner which ensures that the resulting financial information satisfies the concepts of relevance\nand reliability, thereby ensuring that the substance of the underlying transactions or other events is reported.\nThe following significant accounting policies have been adopted in the preparation and presentation of the financial report.\n(a) Principles of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared by combining the financial statements of all the entities that comprise the Group, being Alterity\nTherapeutics Limited and its subsidiaries as defined in Accounting Standard IFRS10: Consolidated Financial Statements. Consistent accounting\npolicies are employed in the preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements.\nSubsidiaries are all those entities (including special purpose entities) over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating\npolicies, generally accompanying a shareholder of more than one-half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are\ncurrently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity.\nSubsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated from the date that control\nceases.\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, all inter-company balances and transactions, and unrealized profits/losses arising within the Group\nare eliminated in full. Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost in the individual financial statements of Alterity Therapeutics Limited.\n(b) Segment Reporting\nOperating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker. The chief\noperating decision maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the\nChief Executive Officer of Alterity Therapeutics Limited. For the current and previous reporting periods, the Group operated in one segment, being\nresearch into Parkinsonian and other neurodegenerative disorders.\n(c) Income Tax\nCurrent tax\nCurrent tax is calculated by reference to the amount of income taxes payable or recoverable in respect of the taxable profit or loss for the period. It is\ncalculated using tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by reporting date. Current tax for current and prior periods is\nrecognised as a liability (or asset) to the extent that it is unpaid (or refundable).\nDeferred tax\nDeferred tax is accounted for using the liability method in respect of temporary differences arising from differences between the carrying amount of\nassets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax base of those items.\nIn principle, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent\nthat it is probable that sufficient taxable amounts will be available against which deductible temporary differences or unused tax losses and tax offsets\ncan be utilized. However, deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences giving rise to them arise from the initial\nrecognition of assets and liabilities (other than as a result of a business combination) which affects neither taxable income nor accounting profit or\nloss.\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries except where the Group is able to\ncontrol the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred\ntax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with these investments are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that\nthere will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilize the benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the\nforeseeable future.\nF-10\nALTERITY THERAPEUTICS LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – in Australian dollars (unless otherwise noted)\n1. BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\n(c) Income Tax (continued)\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period(s) when the asset and liability giving rise to\nthem are realized or settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by reporting date. The measurement of\ndeferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the reporting date,\nto recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and when the deferred\ntax balances relate to the same taxation authority. Current tax assets and tax liabilities are offset when the entity has a legally enforceable right to\noffset and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\nCurrent and deferred tax for the period\nCurrent and deferred tax is recognised as an expense or income in the Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income, except when it\nrelates to items credited or debited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also recognised directly in equity, or where it arises from the\ninitial accounting for a business combination, in which case it is taken into account in the determination of goodwill.\nThe Group has significant unused tax losses and as such a significant deferred tax asset; however, the deferred tax asset has not been recognised, as it\nis not probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the unused losses and unused tax credits can be utilized, given the nature of\nthe Group’s business (research and development) and its history of losses.\n(d) Property and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is measured at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment and consists of laboratory equipment, computer\nequipment, furniture and fittings and leasehold improvements attributable to the Group’s premises at Melbourne, Victoria, Australia and San\nFrancisco, USA.\nHistorical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the item.\nSubsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future\neconomic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of any\ncomponent accounted for as a separate asset is derecognised when replaced. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement\nduring the reporting period in which they are incurred.\nDepreciation\nDepreciation is provided on property and equipment. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line method to allocate their cost, net of their residual\nvalues, over their estimated useful lives.\nThe following estimated useful lives, ranging from 3 to 20 years are used in the calculation of depreciation:\nDepreciation\nClass of Fixed Asset Rate\nFurniture and fittings 5-33%\nComputer equipment 33%\nPlant and equipment 10-33%\nLeasehold improvements 33%\nLeasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and useful life.\nThe depreciation method, residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each annual reporting period.\n(e) Leases\nThe accounting policies for the Group’s lease recognition are explained in note 13.\nF-11\nALTERITY THERAPEUTICS LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – in Australian dollars (unless otherwise noted)\n1. BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\n(f) Investments and other financial assets\nClassification\nFrom July 1, 2019, the Group classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:\n● those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through OCI or through profit or loss), and\n● those to be measured at amortized cost.\nThe classification depends on the entity’s business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flow. For assets\nmeasured at fair value, gains and losses will either be recorded in profit or loss or OCI. For investments in equity instruments that are not held for\ntrading, this will depend on whether the Group has made an irrevocable election at the time of initial recognition to account for the equity investment\nat fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI).\nRecognition and derecognition\nRegular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade-date, the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.\nFinancial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred and the Group\nhas transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.\nMeasurement\nAt initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss\n(FVPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at FVPL\nare expensed in profit or loss.\nAssets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured\nat amortised cost. Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method. Any gain or loss\narising on derecognition is recognised directly in profit or loss and presented in other gains/(losses) together with foreign exchange gains and losses.\nImpairment losses are presented as separate line item in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.\nEquity instruments\nThe Group subsequently measures all equity investments at fair value. Where the Group’s management has elected to present fair value gains and\nlosses on equity investments in OCI, there is no subsequent reclassification of fair value gains and losses to profit or loss following the derecognition\nof the investment. Dividends from such investments continue to be recognised in profit or loss as other income when the Group’s right to receive\npayments is established.\nImpairment\nFrom July 1, 2019, the Group assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its debt instruments carried at amortized\ncost and FVOCI. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.\nFor trade receivables, the Group applies the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from\ninitial recognition of the receivables, see note 10(b) for further details.\nF-12\nALTERITY THERAPEUTICS LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – in Australian dollars (unless otherwise noted)\n1. BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\n(g) Impairment of Assets\nAt each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that\nthose assets have been impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated to determine the extent of the\nimpairment loss (if any).\nWhere the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-\ngenerating unit to which the asset belongs.\nRecoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are\ndiscounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks\nspecific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.\nIf the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or\ncash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other\ncomprehensive income immediately.\nWhere an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reversed to the revised estimate of its\nrecoverable amount, but only to the extent that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined\nhad no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the\nconsolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income immediately.\nNo impairment charges were incurred during the three years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n(h) Intangible Assets - Research and Development\nExpenditure during the research phase of a project is recognised as an expense when incurred. Where no internally generated intangible assets can be\nrecognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period as incurred. Development costs are capitalised if and only if, all of the\nfollowing are demonstrated:\n● the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale;\n● the intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;\n● the ability to use or sell the intangible asset;\n● how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits;\n● the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset; and\n● the ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development.\nInternally-generated intangible assets (capitalised development costs) are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment, and are\namortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives over a maximum of five years.\nAs of June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Group had no capitalized research and development costs.\n(i) Foreign Currency Transactions and Balances\nFunctional and Presentation Currency\nItems included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using Australian dollars, which is the currency of the primary\neconomic environment in which the Group operates (the functional currency). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Australian\ndollars ($), which is Alterity Therapeutics Limited’s functional and presentation currency.\nForeign currency transactions\nAll foreign currency transactions during the financial year are brought to account using the exchange rate in effect at the date of the transaction.\nForeign currency monetary items at each reporting date are translated at the exchange rate existing at each reporting date. Non-monetary assets and\nliabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was\ndetermined.\nExchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise except for exchange differences on monetary items receivable\nfrom or payable to a foreign operation for which settlement is neither planned or likely to occur, which form part of the net investment in a foreign\noperation, are recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve and recognised in profit or loss on disposal of the net investment.\nF-13\nALTERITY THERAPEUTICS LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – in Australian dollars (unless otherwise noted)\n1. BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\n(i) Foreign Currency Transactions and Balances (continued)\nSubsidiaries\nThe results and financial position of all the Group’s entities that have a functional currency difference from the presentation currency are translated\ninto the presentation currency as follows:\n● assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet, and\n● income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates (unless this is not a reasonable approximation of\nthe cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the\ntransactions), and\n● all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.\nOn consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date. Income\nand expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly. Exchange differences\narising, if any, are recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve, and recognised in profit or loss on disposal of the foreign operations.\n(j) Employee Benefits\nShort-term obligations\nShort-term employee benefits are benefits (other than termination benefits) that are expected to be settled wholly before 12 months after the end of\nthe annual reporting period in which the employees render the related service, including wages, and salaries. Short-term employee benefits are\nmeasured at the (undiscounted) amounts expected to be paid when the obligation is settled. The Group’s obligations for short-term employee benefits\nsuch as wages and salaries are recognised as a part of current trade and other payables in the statement of financial position.\nThe Group’s obligations for annual leave are presented as part of provisions in the Statement of Financial Position. The obligations are presented as\ncurrent liabilities in the Statement of Financial Position if the Group does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least twelve\nmonths after the reporting period regardless of when the actual settlement is expected to occur.\nOther long-term obligations\nThe liability for long service leave is not expected to be settled wholly within twelve months after the end of the period in which the employees\nrender the related service. The liability is therefore recognised in the provision for employee benefits and measured as the present value of expected\nfuture payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the end of the reporting period using the projected unit credit method.\nConsideration is given to expected future wage and salary levels, experience of employee departures and periods of service. Expected future\npayments are discounted using market yields at the end of the reporting period of high quality corporate bonds with terms and currencies that match,\nas closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows. Re-measurements as a result of experience adjustments and changes in actuarial\nassumptions are recognised in profit or loss.\nThe obligations are presented as current liabilities in the balance sheet if the entity does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least\ntwelve months after the reporting period, regardless of when the actual settlement is expected to occur.\nF-14\nALTERITY THERAPEUTICS LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – in Australian dollars (unless otherwise noted)\n1. BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\n(k) Provisions\nProvisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation, the future sacrifice of economic benefits is probable, and the amount of the\nprovision can be measured reliably.\nThe amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at reporting date, taking into\naccount the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present\nobligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows.\nWhen some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, the receivable is recognised\nas an asset if it is virtually certain that recovery will be received and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably.\n(l) Cash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with original\nmaturities of three months or less.\n(m) Interest income\nOther income is made up of interest income which is recognised on a time proportion basis using the effective interest method.\n(n) Grants\nGrants are recognised when there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all grant conditions will be complied with.\nWhen the grant relates to an expense item, it is recognised as income over the periods necessary to match the grant on a systematic basis to the costs\nthat it is expected to compensate.\n(o) Goods and Services Tax (“GST”)\nRevenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of GST, except where the amount of GST incurred is not recoverable from the\ntaxation authority. In these circumstances the GST is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of an item of expense.\nReceivables and payables in the Balance Sheet are shown inclusive of GST. The net amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation\nauthority is included as part of receivables or payables.\nCash flows are included in the Cash Flow Statement on a gross basis. The GST component of cash flows arising from investing and financing\nactivities which is recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is classified as operating cash flows.\n(p) Trade and Other Payables\nThese amounts represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the end of financial year which are unpaid. The amounts are\nunsecured and are usually paid within 30 days of recognition. Trade and other payables are presented as current liabilities unless payment is not due\nwithin 12 months from the reporting date. They are recognised initially at their fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the\neffective interest method.\nF-15\nALTERITY THERAPEUTICS LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – in Australian dollars (unless otherwise noted)\n1. BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\n(q) Share-Based Payments\nThe measurement date is determined for share-based payments issued to directors, employees and consultants as follows:\nDirectors\nThe issuance of share-based payments to directors is subject to approval by shareholders as per ASX Listing Rule 10.11. The measurement date for\nshare-based payments issued to directors is the grant date, being the date at which the share-based payments are approved by shareholders.\nEmployees\nThe issuance of share-based payments to employees may be subject to shareholder approval per ASX Listing Rule 7.1 which prohibits the issuance\nof more than 15% of the Group’s shares in a 12 month period without shareholder approval. The measurement date for share-based payments issued\nto employees is the grant date, being the date at which a shared understanding of the terms and conditions of the arrangement is reached. However, if\nan issuance to an employee is subject to shareholder approval because it exceeds the 15% threshold per ASX Listing Rule 7.1, then the measurement\ndate of these share-based payments is the date at which the share-based payments are approved by shareholders.\nConsultants\nThe issuance of share-based payments to consultants may be subject to shareholder approval per ASX Listing Rule 7.1 which prohibits the issuance\nof more than 15% of the Group’s shares in a 12 month period without shareholder approval. The measurement date for share-based payments issued\nto consultants who provide services considered to be similar to employees is deemed to be the date at which a shared understanding of the terms and\nconditions of the arrangement is reached. The measurement date for share-based payments issued to consultants who provide services considered to\nbe differentiated from those provided by employees is deemed to be the date at which the entity obtains the goods or the counterparty renders the\nservice. If a service period applies and the work is continually provided over the service period, and if the share price of the Group does not change\nsignificantly during the service period, then the average share price, volatility and risk-free rate over the service period are used in calculating the\nvalue of the share-based payments issued. However, if the underlying share price of the Group does change significantly during the service period,\nthen the value of share-based payments are calculated at each individual date that goods and services are provided, using the actual valuation inputs\nat that date. Shares issued to consultants for services are recorded as non-cash compensation and are recognised at either the fair value of the services\nrendered, or if this cannot be reasonably estimated, the fair value of the underlying equity instruments issued.\nEquity-based compensation benefits are provided to directors, employees and consultants under the 2004 ASX Plan (the “2004 ASX Plan”) and the\n2018 American Depository Share (ADS) Option Plan (the “2018 ADS Plan”). Information relating to this plan is set out in Note 16\nThe fair value of options granted under these plans is recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at\ngrant date and recognised over the period during which the recipients become unconditionally entitled to the options.\nThe fair value at grant date is independently determined using a Black-Scholes (for options without market condition) and Barrier Pricing (for\noptions with market conditions) model that takes into account the exercise price, the term of the option, the impact of dilution, the share price at grant\ndate and expected price volatility of the underlying share, the expected dividend yield and the risk free interest rate for the term of the option. The\nexpected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions,\nand behavioral considerations.\nThe fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period,\nbased on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest.\n(r) Loss Per Share\nBasic loss per share is determined by dividing the net loss after income tax expense by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding\nduring the financial period. For all periods presented, diluted loss per share is equivalent to basic loss per share as the potentially dilutive securities\nare excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share because the effect is anti-dilutive.\n(s) Share Capital\nOrdinary share capital is recognised as the fair value of the consideration received by the Group. Any transaction costs arising on the issue of\nordinary shares are recognised directly in equity as a reduction of the share proceeds received.\nF-16\nALTERITY THERAPEUTICS LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – in Australian dollars (unless otherwise noted)\n1. BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\n(t) Trade and Other Receivables\nTrade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method\nless provision for impairment.\n(u) Comparative Figures\nComparative figures, are, where appropriate, reclassified to be comparable with figures presented in the current financial year.\n(v) New Accounting Standards and Interpretations\nThe Group has adopted all of the new or amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board\n‘IASB’ that are mandatory for the current reporting period.\nThe adoption of these standards has not had any impact on the disclosures or amounts reported in these financial statements.\nThe Directors have also reviewed all the new and revised Standards and Interpretations in issue not yet adopted for the year ended June 30, 2021. As\na result of this review, the Directors have determined that there is no material impact of the Standards and Interpretations in issue not yet adopted on\nthe Group and, therefore, no change is considered necessary to the Group’s accounting policies.\nNew Accounting Standards adopted in prior year\nThe Group has adopted IFRS 16 on a modified retrospective basis, from 1 July 2019, but has not restated comparatives, as permitted under the\nspecific transitional provisions in the standard. The reclassifications and the adjustments arising from the new leasing rules are therefore recognised\nin the opening balance sheet on 1 July 2019.\nOn adoption of IFRS 16, the Group recognised lease liabilities in relation to leases which had previously been classified as ‘operating leases’ under\nthe principles of IAS 17 Leases. These liabilities were measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the lessee’s\nincremental borrowing rate as of 1 July 2019. The weighted average lessee’s incremental borrowing rate applied to the lease liabilities on 1 July 2019\nwas 5.20%.\nThe associated right-of use assets were measured at the amount equal to the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of any prepaid or accrued lease\npayments relating to that lease recognised in the balance sheet as of June 30, 2020. There were no onerous lease contracts that would have required\nan adjustment to the right-of-use assets at the date of initial application.\nIn applying IFRS 16 for the first time, the Group has used the following practical expedients permitted by the standard:\n● the use of a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics\n● reliance on previous assessments on whether leases are onerous\n● the accounting for operating leases with a remaining lease term of less than 12 months as of July 1, 2019 as short-term leases, and\n● the use of hindsight in determining the lease term where the contract contains options to extend or terminate the lease.\nThe Group has also elected not to reassess whether a contract is, or contains a lease at the date of initial application. Instead, for contracts entered into\nbefore the transition date the Group relied on its assessment made applying IAS 17 and Interpretation 4 Determining whether an arrangement\ncontains a Lease.\nF-17\nALTERITY THERAPEUTICS LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – in Australian dollars (unless otherwise noted)\n1.

In the year ended June 30, 2019, the Group obtained a Commissioner’s Discretion pursuant to subsection 328-126(6) of the Income\nTax Assessment Act 1997 regarding the Group’s eligibility to receive the incentive as a refundable cash offset, and recorded $4,951,167 in other\nincome with respect to eligible expenditure under the incentive scheme. The receivable as of June 30, 2019 was subsequently received as cash in\nthe prior period. In the year ended June 30, 2020, the Group did not obtain a Commissioner’s Discretion so did not recognize a receivable and\nother income of $3,363,433 relating to eligible expenditure for the year ended June 30, 2020. The income tax return for the year ended June 30,\n2020 has since been lodged and the R&D Tax Incentive assessed as a non-refundable cash offset. The Group is considering its options, including\nappealing this assessment. For the year ended June 30, 2021, the Group is eligible to receive the refundable tax offset, so a Commissioner’s\nDiscretion pursuant to subsection 328-126(6) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 was not required and the management has assessed\nactivities and expenditures that are likely to be eligible under the incentive scheme and therefore recorded $4,126,364 in other income.\nF-18\nALTERITY THERAPEUTICS LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – in Australian dollars (unless otherwise noted)\n2.

The modified approach does\nnot require restatement of comparative periods. Instead the cumulative impact of applying IFRS 16 is accounted for as an adjustment to equity at the\nstart of the current financial year in which it was first applied, known as the ‘date of initial application’. Refer to note 1(v) for further details.\nLeases are recognised as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset is available for use by the Group. Each\nlease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease year so as to produce a\nconstant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each year. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the\nasset’s useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis.\nAssets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the\nfollowing lease payments:\n● fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable\n● variable lease payment that are based on an index or a rate\n● amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees\n● the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and\n● payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option.\nThe lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be determined, or the Group’s incremental borrowing\nrate applied at the commencement date.\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:\n● the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability\n● any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, less any lease incentives received\n● any initial direct costs, and\n● restoration costs.\nPayments associated with short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss.\nShort-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less.\nF-27\nALTERITY THERAPEUTICS LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – in Australian dollars (unless otherwise noted)\n14.

SHARE BASED PAYMENTS\nAt the Annual General Meeting held on November 17, 2004, the shareholders approved the establishment of employee and consultant plans designed\nto reward directors, employees and consultants for their contributions to the Group. The plans are to be used as a method of retaining key personnel\nfor the growth and development of the Group.

At the September 2020 General Meeting, shareholders authorized the Group to issue up to 157.5 million securities. At the 2020\nAnnual General Meeting, shareholders authorized the Group to issue up to 200 million ordinary shares.\nThe Share Plan Committee, a sub-committee of the Remuneration Committee administers the two plans and is able to change the terms of the equity\nissued under them from the default terms.\nUnder the 2018 ADS Plan, the exercise price must equal or exceed the fair value of the ADS on the date the options are awarded. The option\nexpiration date cannot exceed ten years from the date the options were awarded. The default vesting conditions are 25% per year on the date the\noptions were awarded.\nUnder the 2004 ASX Plan, the exercise price must be equal or be less than the market value of the ordinary shares on ASX on the date of grant.

The Australian government bond rate has been used for options which are exercisable for fully paid ordinary shares and the U.S.\ngovernment bond rate has been used for options which are exercisable for ADRs.\nDividend yield – Alterity has never declared or paid dividends on its ordinary shares and does not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable\nfuture.\nExpected volatility – Alterity estimates expected volatility based on historical volatility over the estimated life of the option and other factors.\nHistorical volatility has been the basis for determining expected share price volatility as it is assumed that this is indicative of future movements. The\nlife of the options is based on historical exercise patterns, which may not eventuate in the future.\nExpected life – This is the period of time that the options granted are expected to remain outstanding. This estimate is based primarily on historical\ntrend of option holders to exercise their option near the date of expiry. As a result, the expected life is considered to equal the period from grant date\nto expiry date.\nModel inputs –\nThe model inputs for the valuations of options approved and issued during the current and previous financial years are as follows:\nShare Expected Fair\nExercise Price at Share Risk-free Value\nPrice per Grant Price Years to Dividend Interest per\nSeries Grant Date Share Date Volatility Expiry Yield Rate Options\nA$ A$ A$\nPBTAH February 19, 2015 0.26 0.16 74.80% 5.00 0% 2.00% 0.083\nPBTAR May 27, 2015 0.27 0.17 69.40% 5.00 0% 2.25% 0.082\nPBTAS June 7, 2017 0.07 0.05 100.00% 5.00 0% 1.97% 0.034\nPBTAAA December 18, 2017 0.11 0.07 100% 5.00 0% 2.38% 0.047\nPBTAI February 1, 2018 0.08 0.06 100% 5.00 0% 2.24% 0.038\nATHAAB September 18, 2020 0.09 0.05 98.00% 5.00 0% 0.43% 0.032\nATHAAD January 7, 2021 0.03 0.032 139.52% 5.00 0% 0.38% 0.028\nF-30\nALTERITY THERAPEUTICS LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – in Australian dollars (unless otherwise noted)\n16.

Remuneration packages are based on fixed and variable components, determined by the executive’s position, experience\nand performance, and may be satisfied via cash or equity.\nF-32\nALTERITY THERAPEUTICS LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – in Australian dollars (unless otherwise noted)\n21. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS (continued)\nNon-executive Directors are remunerated out of the aggregate amount approved by shareholders and at a level that is consistent with industry\nstandards. Non-executive Directors do not receive performance based bonuses and prior shareholder approval is required to participate in any\nissuance of equity. No retirement benefits are payable other than statutory superannuation, if applicable.\nThe Group’s remuneration policy is not solely based on the Group’s performance, but also on industry practice.\nThe Group’s primary focus is research activities with a long term objective of developing and commercializing its research and development results.\nThe Group envisages its performance in terms of earnings will remain negative whilst the Group continues in the research and clinical trials.\nShareholder wealth reflects this speculative and volatile market sector. This pattern is indicative of the Group’s performance over the past four years.\nThe purpose of a performance bonus is to reward individual performance in line with Group objectives. Consequently, performance based\nremuneration is paid to an individual where the individual’s performance clearly contributes to a successful outcome for the Group. This is regularly\nmeasured in respect of performance against key performance indicators (“KPI’s”).\nThe Group uses a variety of KPI’s to determine achievement, depending on the role of the executive being assessed.\nLong\nPost- Term\nEmployment Benefits\nLong-\n2021 Short Term Benefits Superannuation service Termination Equity\nBase Fee Bonus Contribution Leave Benefit Options Total\nDirectors’ remuneration A$ A$ A$ A$ A$ A$ A$\nMr. Geoffrey Kempler (2) 487,292 - 16,184 (121,542) 1,000,000 450,777 1,832,711\nMr. Brian Meltzer 66,209 - 6,290 - - 225,389 297,888\nMr. Peter Marks 68,333 - - - - 225,389 293,722\nMr. Lawrence Gozlan (3) 218,333 - - - - 225,389 443,722\nDr. David Sinclair 65,800 - - - - 225,389 291,189\nMr. Tristan Edwards 64,774 - 1,012 - - 225,389 291,175\n970,741 - 23,486 (121,542) 1,000,000 1,577,722 3,450,407\nOther key management personnel\nDr. David Stamler (1)(4) 606,058 - - - - 372,843 978,901\nMs. Kathryn Andrews (1) 314,978 - 21,694 11,257 - - 347,929\n921,036 - 21,694 11,257 - 372,843 1,326,830\nTotal 1,891,777 - 45,180 (110,285) 1,000,000 1,950,565 4,777,237\n(1) Base Fee includes movements in the annual leave provision for Ms. Kathryn Andrews and Dr. David Stamler in accordance with their\nemployment contracts.\n(2) Upon termination of employment as Chief Executive Officer on January 7, 2021 Mr. Kempler received the sum of A$1 million in accordance\nwith his employment agreement dated September 21, 2007 and accrued leave entitlements.

SEGMENT INFORMATION\nThe Group’s Chief Executive Officer (Chief Operating Decision Maker) examines internal reports to assess the Group’s performance and determine\nthe allocation of resources. The Group’s activities are predominantly within Australia and cover research into Parkinsonian movement disorders,\nAlzheimer’s disease, Huntington disease, and other neurodegenerative disorders. Accordingly, the Group has identified one reportable segment.\n23. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nThe Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk\nmanagement program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimize potential adverse effects on the financial\nperformance of the Group. Risk management is carried out under policies approved by the Board of Directors and overseen by the Audit Committee.\n(a) Market Risk\n(i) Foreign Currency Risk\nThe Group engages in international purchase transactions and is exposed to foreign currency risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily\nwith respect to the Australian dollar. The parent entity also has exposure to foreign exchange risk in the currency cash reserves it holds to meet its\nforeign currency payments. The Group does not make use of derivative financial instruments to hedge foreign exchange risk.\nThe following financial assets and liabilities are subject to foreign currency risk, the currency of the original amounts are displayed in brackets, all\nthe amounts in the table below are displayed in A$ at year-end spot rates:\nConsolidated Entity\n2021 2020\nA$ A$\nCash and cash equivalents (USD) 21,523,678 5,403,402\nCash and cash equivalents (€EUR) - -\nCash and cash equivalents (£GBP) 442 430\nTrade and other payables (USD) (819,812) (562,710)\nTrade and other payables (€EUR) (1,901) (12,245)\nTrade and other payables (£GBP) (124,863) (4,337)\nTotal exposure 20,577,544 4,824,540\nAs shown in the table above, the Group is primarily exposed to changes in USD/AUD exchange rates. The sensitivity of profit or loss to changes in\nthe exchange rates arises mainly from US-dollar denominated financial instruments and there is no impact on other components of equity.\nBased on the financial instruments held as of June 30, 2021, had the Australian dollar weakened/strengthened by 9.16% (2020: 2.17%) against the\nUSD with all other variables held constant, the Group’s post-tax loss for the year would have been A$1,896,923 lower/higher (2020: A$105,090\nlower/higher).\nF-39\nALTERITY THERAPEUTICS LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – in Australian dollars (unless otherwise noted)\n23. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)\n(ii) Interest Rate Risk\nThe Group’s exposure to interest rate risk, which is the risk that a financial instruments value will fluctuate as a result of changes in market interest\nrates and the effective weighted average interest rates on classes of financial assets and financial liabilities.\nThe Group’s exposure to interest rate risk has not changed since the prior year.\nAt June 30, 2021, the Group had the following cash accounts:\n● A$3,231,661 in an Australian dollar transaction account at an interest rate of 0.01% as of June 30, 2021;\n● A$46,862 in an Australian dollar transaction account at an interest rate of 0.00% as of June 30, 2021;\n● A$119,340 in an Australian dollar transaction account at an interest rate of 0.00% as of June 30, 2021;\n● U.S.$16,159,039 (A$21,523,678) in U.S. checking accounts at an interest rate of 0.00% as of June 30, 2021;\n● A$42,713 in a three month term deposit at a fixed interest rate of 0.10% which matures on September 7, 2021;\n● A$150,000 in a three month term deposit at a fixed interest rate of 0.10% which matures on September 11, 2021;\n● A$3,000,000 in a 90 days term deposit at a fixed interest rate of 0.05% which matures on July 27, 2021.\nAt June 30, 2020, the Group had the following cash accounts:\n● A$3,448,551 in an Australian dollar transaction account at an interest rate of 0.60% as of June 30, 2020;\n● A$83,932 in an Australian dollar transaction account at an interest rate of 0.05% as of June 30, 2020;\n● A$66,841 in an Australian dollar transaction account at an interest rate of 0.00% as of June 30, 2020;\n● U.S.$3,716,309 (A$5,403,402) in U.S. checking accounts at an interest rate of 0% as of June 30, 2020;\n● A$42,713 in a three month term deposit at a fixed interest rate of 0.80% which matures on September 7, 2020;\n● A$150,000 in a three month term deposit at a fixed interest rate of 0.80% which matures on September 11, 2019.\nAt June 30, 2019, the Group had the following cash accounts:\n● A$1,354,771 in an Australian dollar transaction account at an interest rate of 0.60% as of June 30, 2019;\n● A$45,486 in an Australian dollar transaction account at an interest rate of 0.05% as of June 30, 2019;\n● A$66,534 in an Australian dollar transaction account at an interest rate of 0.00% as of June 30, 2019;\n● A$15 in an Australian Trust account at an interest rate of 0% as of June 30, 2019;\n● U.S.$6,836,116 (A$9,726,016) in U.S. checking accounts at an interest rate of 0% as of June 30, 2019;\n● A$2,012,329 in a three month term deposit at a fixed interest rate of 1.50% which matures on August 26, 2019;\n● A$1,000,000 in a three month term deposit at a fixed interest rate of 1.85% which matures on July 27, 2019;\n● A$42,713 in a three month term deposit at a fixed interest rate of 2.00% which matures on September 7, 2019;\n● A$150,000 in a three month term deposit at a fixed interest rate of 2.00% which matures on September 11, 2019.\nThe weighted average interest rate is 0.10% for cash and cash equivalents and 0.05% for terms deposits over three months and apart from usual\nvariances in general rates of interest the Group is not exposed to any significant interest rate risk.\nF-40\nALTERITY THERAPEUTICS LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – in Australian dollars (unless otherwise noted)\n23.

The Group has no\nsignificant concentration of credit risk and it is not the Group’s policy to hedge credit risk.\nThe Group ensures that surplus cash is invested with financial institutions of appropriate credit worthiness and limits the amount of credit exposure to\nany one counter party.\nThere has been no significant change in the Group’s exposure to credit risk since the previous year. The carrying amount of the Group’s financial\nassets represents the maximum credit exposure.\nF-41\nALTERITY THERAPEUTICS LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – in Australian dollars (unless otherwise noted)\n23. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)\n(c) Liquidity Risk\nPrudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed\ncredit facilities.

In order to maintain or achieve an optimal capital structure, the Group may issue new shares or reduce\nits capital, subject to the provisions of the Group’s constitution. The capital structure of the Group consists of equity attributed to equity holders of\nthe Group, comprising contributed equity, reserves and accumulated losses disclosed in Notes 10, 11 and 12. By monitoring undiscounted cash flow\nforecasts and actual cash flows provided to the Board by the Group’s Management the Board monitors the need to raise additional equity from the\nequity markets.\n(e) Fair Value Estimation\nThe carrying amount of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the financial statements represents their respective fair values, determined\nin accordance with the accounting policies disclosed in Note 1 to the financial statements.\nFinancial Instruments measured at Fair Value\nThe financial instruments recognised at fair value in the Statement of Financial Position have been analyzed and classified using a fair value\nhierarchy reflecting the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements. The fair value hierarchy consists of the following levels:\n- quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1);\n- inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (as prices) or indirectly\n(derived from prices) (Level 2); and\n- inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs) (Level 3).\nIn 2021 and 2020, none of the Group’s assets and liabilities had their fair value determined using the fair value hierarchy. No transfers between the\nlevels of the fair value hierarchy occurred during the current or previous years.\nF-42\nAustralian Disclosure Requirements\nDirectors’ Declaration\nIn the Directors’ opinion:\na) the financial statements and notes set out on pages F-1 to F-42 are in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001, including:\n(i) complying with Accounting Standards, the Corporations Regulations 2001 and other mandatory professional reporting requirements,\nand\n(ii) giving a true and fair view of the consolidated entity’s financial position as at June 30, 2021 and of its performance for the financial\nyear ended on that date, and\nb) there are reasonable grounds to believe that the Group will be able to pay its debts as and when they become due and payable.\nNote 1 confirms that the consolidated financial statements also comply with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the\nInternational Accounting Standards Board.\nThe Directors have been given the declarations by the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer required by section 295A of the\nCorporations Act 2001.\nThis declaration is made in accordance with a resolution of Directors.\n/s/ Geoffrey Kempler\nDirector\nMelbourne\nSeptember 2, 2021\nF-43\nITEM 19.
