OSRX, Inc.\n\nNovember 21, 2024 at 7:00 AM EST\n\n[Download PDF](/node/12756/pdf)\n\n**Jury in Trademark Infringement Case Finds in Favor of ImprimisRx**\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 21, 2024-- Harrow (Nasdaq: HROW), a leading North American eyecare pharmaceutical company, today announced a favorable jury verdict in the case of _ImprimisRx, LLC v. OSRX, Inc_. ImprimisRx, a wholly owned subsidiary of Harrow, brought the lawsuit to a jury trial in a San Diego, California, federal court alleging willful acts of trademark infringement against OSRX, Inc. and its related party, Ocular Science, Inc. An eight-person jury in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California unanimously validated the entirety of ImprimisRx’s subject trademark estate and found OSRX, Inc. or Ocular Science, Inc. acted with malice, fraud, or oppression, willfully engaging in trademark infringement and unfair competition under California and federal law. The $34.9 million verdict includes $20.4 million in punitive damages and $14.5 million in actual damages. \n\n“While we are extremely pleased with the jury verdict, which supports ImprimisRx’s position as the market-leading innovator in the U.S. ophthalmic compounding market, we would have rather had the defendant in this case, and its CEO and leadership team, respect our trademarks and not willfully engage in unfair competition,” said Mark L. Baum, Chief Executive Officer of Harrow. “It goes without saying that, having now successfully defended our intellectual property, at great time and expense, we have confidence that these defendants and any others will not infringe on our creativity or attempt to take advantage of the significant investments we’ve made over many years building our trusted brands. In addition to our sincere appreciation to our extraordinary lawyers, we are grateful to the jury for carefully reviewing the evidence and reaching a just conclusion, allowing us to continue focusing on our work to make eyecare more accessible and affordable for patients across North America.” \n\nImprimisRx, LLC was represented by Keith J. Wesley, Christopher W. Arledge, and George Laiolo of ELLIS GEORGE LLP, with the management of litigation strategist Nikki Wyll of Wyll Legal Consulting. \n\nOSRX, Inc. and Ocular Science, Inc. were represented by Dylan J. Liddiard, Dale Bish, Thomas J. Martin, Charles A. Talpas, and Mikaela Burkhardt of WILSON SONSINI GOODRICH & ROSATI. \n\nThe subject case is _Case No. 3:21-cv-01305-BAS-DDL_. \n\n**About Harrow**\n\nHarrow, Inc.

(“Melt”), a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company developing novel approaches for procedural sedation, today announced positive topline results of its pivotal Phase 3 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of its lead product candidate, MELT‑300, a non-IV, non-opioid tablet for procedural sedation during cataract surgery. Based on a Special Protocol Assessment agreement [reached](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meltpharma.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Fmelt-pharmaceuticals-announces-dosing-last-patient-pivotal-phase&esheet=54155716&newsitemid=20241120082898&lan=en-US&anchor=reached&index=1&md5=19d0ec8891bc1f9c077b323ca34025a0) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) earlier this year, this study design and these positive results support the necessary objectives required for a regulatory submission.\n\nMELT-300 uniquely combines a fixed dose of midazolam (3mg) and ketamine (50mg) in one tablet that is administered sublingually using Catalent’s proprietary [Zydis®](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fconsumerhealth.catalent.com%2Fover-the-counter%2Fzydis-odt-technology%2F&esheet=54155716&newsitemid=20241120082898&lan=en-US&anchor=Zydis%26%23174%3B&index=2&md5=c8fdb3d10eacb6ea264ef91de3b30faa) delivery technology which dissolves in as little as 3 seconds allowing absorption of the active ingredients across the sublingual mucosa.\n\nThe MELT-300 Phase 3 clinical trial was a randomized, double-blind, three-arm study comparing, at a 4:1:1 ratio, MELT-300, sublingual midazolam, and sublingual placebo, respectively, for procedural sedation in patients undergoing cataract surgery. The study was conducted at 13 clinical sites in the United States and enrolled over 530 patients.\n\nIn commenting on the topline results, Dr. Larry Dillaha, Chief Executive Officer of Melt, said, “We are extremely excited with this robust topline data from our pivotal Phase 3 study. These overwhelmingly positive results support our belief that MELT-300, if approved by the FDA, would be a safe and effective non-IV, non-opioid alternative to current IV-based cataract surgery sedation protocols, which generally involve the administration of opioids. With the number of cataract surgeries performed each year in the U.S. expected to exceed 5 million in the coming years, we believe offering patients and physicians the ability to achieve an adequate sedation level without the need to start an IV or administer opioids is a very attractive proposition.”\n\nMELT-300 co-inventor, Melt Pharmaceuticals board member, and board-certified ophthalmologist John Berdahl, M.D., commented, “A proprietary compounded combination of midazolam and ketamine, which was the inspiration for the development of the MELT-300 product candidate, has been used by hundreds of ophthalmologists, including myself – in hundreds of thousands of cataract surgeries. I am thrilled at the prospect of the FDA approving MELT-300, which I believe would greatly enhance the confidence of healthcare professionals in considering the adoption of this groundbreaking sedation method.”\n\nGeorge Magrath, M.D., a board-certified ophthalmologist and a MELT-300 Phase 3 study principal investigator, commented, “These Phase 3 data show the superiority of the combination of midazolam and ketamine compared with midazolam alone. If approved, I believe MELT-300 will be a safe and effective alternative to current sedation methods used for cataract surgery. As an ophthalmologist, I am excited about the prospect of using MELT-300 to enhance the overall experience for my cataract surgery patients.”\n\nDr. Dillaha continued, “In addition to supporting a regulatory submission, these MELT-300 Phase 3 data should further strengthen our already strong patent portfolio, both domestically and internationally. Further, with these data now confirming and complementing our robust Phase 2 efficacy and safety results, we believe we are well positioned to elevate the procedural sedation standard of care for cataract surgery and, through lifecycle management, eventually expand the potential use of MELT-300 to over 100 million annual procedures in various medical specialties, including dermatology, plastic surgery, dentistry, gastroenterology, and emergency care.\n\n“Melt Pharmaceuticals is profoundly grateful to the Phase 3 MELT-300 study participants, whose involvement has been invaluable. This includes the ophthalmologists, optometrists, anesthesiologists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, staff, and patients at the 13 U.S. clinical sites.”\n\n**About Melt Pharmaceuticals**\n\nMelt Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on developing proprietary non-IV, non-opioid, sedation, and analgesia therapeutics for human medical procedures in the hospital, outpatient, and in-office settings.
