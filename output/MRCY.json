(NASDAQ: MRCY, www.mrcy.com), reported operating results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, ended September 27, 2024.\n\n“Our first quarter 2025 results were generally as expected, and I am optimistic about our strategic positioning and expectations to deliver predictable organic growth with expanding margins and robust free cash flow,” said Bill Ballhaus, Mercury’s Chairman and CEO. “In the quarter we generated bookings of $247.7M, which is up 29% year-over-year and represents a book-to-bill of 1.21; revenue of $204.4M, up 13% year-over-year; adjusted EBITDA of $21.5M and adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.5%, both up substantially year-over-year.\"\n\n**First Quarter Fiscal 2025 Results**\n\nTotal Company first quarter fiscal 2025 revenues were $204.4 million, compared to $181.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nTotal bookings for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 were $247.7 million, yielding a book-to-bill ratio of 1.21 for the quarter.\n\nTotal Company GAAP net loss and loss per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 were $17.5 million, and $0.30, respectively, compared to GAAP net loss and loss per share of $36.7 million, and $0.64, respectively, for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Adjusted earnings per share (“adjusted EPS”) was $0.04 per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, compared to $(0.24) per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nFirst quarter fiscal 2025 adjusted EBITDA for the total Company was $21.5 million, compared to $2.0 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nCash flows used in operating activities in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 were $14.7 million, compared to $39.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Free cash flow, defined as cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures for property and equipment, was $(20.9) million for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and $(47.1) million for the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\n**Backlog**\n\nMercury’s total backlog at September 27, 2024 was $1.34 billion, a $187.8 million increase from a year ago. Of the September 27, 2024 total backlog, $777.0 million represents orders expected to be recognized as revenue within the next 12 months.\n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nManagement will host a conference call and simultaneous webcast at 5:00 p.m. ET on Tuesday, November 5, 2024, to discuss Mercury's quarterly financial results, business highlights and outlook. In addition, Company representatives may answer questions concerning business and financial developments and trends, the Company's view on earnings forecasts, and other business and financial matters affecting the Company, the responses to which may contain information that has not been previously disclosed.\n\nTo attend the conference call or webcast, participants should register online at _ir.mrcy.com/events-presentations_. Participants are requested to register a day in advance or at a minimum 15 minutes before the start of the call. A replay of the webcast will be available two hours after the call and archived on the same web page for six months.\n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures** In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, the Company provides adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income, adjusted earnings per share (“adjusted EPS”) and free cash flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income, and adjusted EPS exclude certain non-cash and other specified charges. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to help investors understand its past financial performance and prospects for the future. However, these non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. Management believes these non-GAAP measures assist in providing a more complete understanding of the Company’s underlying operational results and trends, and management uses these measures along with the corresponding GAAP financial measures to manage the Company’s business, to evaluate its performance compared to prior periods and the marketplace, and to establish operational goals. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial results discussed in this press release is contained in the attached exhibits.\n\n**Mercury Systems – Innovation that Matters®** Mercury Systems is a technology company that delivers mission-critical processing power to the edge, making advanced technologies profoundly more accessible for today’s most challenging aerospace and defense missions.

Management believes that exclusion of these items assists in providing a more complete understanding of the Company’s underlying results and trends, and management uses these measures along with the corresponding GAAP financial measures to manage the Company’s business, to evaluate its performance compared to prior periods and the marketplace, and to establish operational goals. The adjustments to calculate this non-GAAP financial measure, and the basis for such adjustments, are outlined below:\n\n_Other non-operating adjustments_. The Company records other non-operating adjustments such as gains or losses on foreign currency remeasurement, investments and fixed asset sales or disposals among other adjustments. These adjustments may vary from period to period without any direct correlation to underlying operating performance.\n\n_Interest income and expense_. The Company receives interest income on investments and incurs interest expense on loans, financing leases and other financing arrangements. These amounts may vary from period to period due to changes in cash and debt balances and interest rates driven by general market conditions or other circumstances which may be outside of the normal course of the Company’s operations.\n\n_Income taxes_. The Company’s GAAP tax expense can fluctuate materially from period to period due to tax adjustments that are not directly related to underlying operating performance or to the current period of operations.\n\n_Depreciation_. The Company incurs depreciation expense related to capital assets purchased to support the ongoing operations of the business. These assets are recorded at cost or fair value and are depreciated using the straight-line method over the useful life of the asset. Purchases of such assets may vary significantly from period to period and without any direct correlation to underlying operating performance.\n\n_Amortization of intangible assets._ The Company incurs amortization of intangible assets primarily as a result of acquired intangible assets such as backlog, customer relationships and completed technologies but also due to licenses, patents and other arrangements. These intangible assets are valued at the time of acquisition or upon receipt of right to use the asset, amortized over the requisite life and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after acquisition.\n\n_Restructuring and other charges._ The Company incurs restructuring and other charges in connection with management’s decisions to undertake certain actions to realign operating expenses through workforce reductions and the closure of certain Company facilities, businesses and product lines. The Company’s adjustments reflected in restructuring and other charges are typically related to acquisitions and organizational redesign programs initiated as part of discrete post-acquisition integration activities. Management believes these items are non-routine and may not be indicative of ongoing operating results.\n\n_Impairment of long-lived assets._ The Company incurs impairment charges of long-lived assets based on events that may or may not be within the control of management. Management believes these items are outside the normal operations of the Company’s business and are not indicative of ongoing operating results.\n\n_Acquisition, financing and other third party costs_. The Company incurs transaction costs related to acquisition and potential acquisition opportunities, such as legal, accounting, and other third party advisory fees. The Company may also incur third party costs, such as legal, banking, communications, proxy solicitation, and other third party advisory fees in connection with engagements by activist investors or unsolicited acquisition offers. Although the Company may incur such third party costs and other related charges and adjustments, it is not indicative that any transaction will be consummated. Additionally, the Company incurs unused revolver and bank fees associated with maintaining its credit facility as well as non-cash financing expenses associated with obtaining its credit facility. Management believes these items are outside the normal operations of the Company’s business and are not indicative of ongoing operating results.\n\n_Fair value adjustments from purchase accounting._ As a result of applying purchase accounting rules to acquired assets and liabilities, certain fair value adjustments are recorded in the opening balance sheet of acquired companies. These adjustments are then reflected in the Company’s income statements in periods subsequent to the acquisition. In addition, the impact of any changes to originally recorded contingent consideration amounts are reflected in the income statements in the period of the change. Management believes these items are outside the normal operations of the Company and are not indicative of ongoing operating results.\n\n_Litigation and settlement income and expense._ The Company periodically receives income and incurs expenses related to pending claims and litigation and associated legal fees and potential case settlements and/or judgments. Although the Company may incur such costs and other related charges and adjustments, it is not indicative of any particular outcome until the matter is fully resolved. Management believes these items are outside the normal operations of the Company’s business, often occur in periods other than the period of activity, and are not indicative of ongoing operating results. The Company periodically receives warranty claims from customers and makes warranty claims towards its vendors and supply chain. Management believes the expenses and gains associated with these recurring warranty items are within the normal operations and operating cycle of the Company’s business. Therefore, management deems no adjustments are necessary unless under extraordinary circumstances.\n\n_Stock-based and other non-cash compensation expense._ The Company incurs expense related to stock-based compensation included in its GAAP presentation of cost of revenues, selling, general and administrative expense and research and development expense. The Company also incurs non-cash based compensation in the form of pension related expenses and matching contributions to its defined contribution plan. Although stock-based and other non-cash compensation is an expense of the Company and viewed as a form of compensation, these expenses vary in amount from period to period, and are affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management, such as the market price and volatility of the Company’s shares, risk-free interest rates and the expected term and forfeiture rates of the awards, as well as pension actuarial assumptions. Management believes that exclusion of these expenses allows comparisons of operating results to those of other companies, both public, private or foreign, that disclose non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation and other non-cash compensation.\n\nMercury uses adjusted EBITDA as an important indicator of the operating performance of its business. Management excludes the above-described items from its internal forecasts and models when establishing internal operating budgets, supplementing the financial results and forecasts reported to the Company’s board of directors, determining a portion of bonus compensation for executive officers and other key employees based on operating performance, evaluating short-term and long-term operating trends in the Company’s operations, and allocating resources to various initiatives and operational requirements. The Company believes that adjusted EBITDA permits a comparative assessment of its operating performance, relative to its performance based on its GAAP results, while isolating the effects of charges that may vary from period to period without direct correlation to underlying operating performance. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial adjustments are useful to investors because they allow investors to evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. The Company believes that trends in its adjusted EBITDA are valuable indicators of its operating performance.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company expects to continue to incur expenses similar to the adjusted EBITDA financial adjustments described above, and investors should not infer from the Company’s presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure that these costs are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring.\n\nThe following table reconciles the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to the non-GAAP financial measure.\n\nFirst Quarters Ended  \n---  \nSeptember 27, 2024| September 29, 2023  \nNet loss| $| (17,525| )| $| (36,708| )  \nOther non-operating adjustments, net| (1,735| )| 731  \nInterest expense, net| 8,362| 7,760  \nIncome tax benefit| (5,594| )| (13,027| )  \nDepreciation| 9,985| 10,145  \nAmortization of intangible assets| 11,235| 12,547  \nRestructuring and other charges| 2,260| 9,546  \nImpairment of long-lived assets| —| —  \nAcquisition, financing and other third party costs| 2,331| 1,332  \nFair value adjustments from purchase accounting| 177| 177  \nLitigation and settlement expense, net| 1,394| 503  \nStock-based and other non-cash compensation expense| 10,560| 8,951  \nAdjusted EBITDA| $| 21,450| $| 1,957  \n  \nFree cash flow, a non-GAAP measure for reporting cash flow, is defined as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures for property and equipment, which includes capitalized software development costs, and, therefore, has not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on cash available for investment and acquisitions after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations and long-term value creation. The Company believes that trends in its free cash flow are valuable indicators of its operating performance and liquidity.\n\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company expects to continue to incur expenditures similar to the free cash flow financial adjustment described above, and investors should not infer from the Company’s presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure that these expenditures reflect all of the Company's obligations which require cash.\n\nThe following table reconciles the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to the non-GAAP financial measure.\n\nFirst Quarters Ended  \n---  \nSeptember 27, 2024| September 29, 2023  \nNet cash used in operating activities| $| (14,660| )| $| (39,068| )  \nPurchases of property and equipment| (6,236| )| (8,015| )  \nFree cash flow| $| (20,896| )| $| (47,083| )  \n**UNAUDITED SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP MEASURES**  \n---  \n(In thousands, except per share data)   \n  \nAdjusted income and adjusted earnings per share (“adjusted EPS”) are non-GAAP measures for reporting financial performance, exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that exclusion of these items assists in providing a more complete understanding of the Company’s underlying results and trends and allows for comparability with its peer company index and industry. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company uses these measures along with the corresponding GAAP financial measures to manage the Company’s business and to evaluate its performance compared to prior periods and the marketplace. The Company defines adjusted income as income before other non-operating adjustments, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring and other charges, impairment of long-lived assets, acquisition, financing and other third party costs, fair value adjustments from purchase accounting, litigation and settlement income and expense, and stock-based and other non-cash compensation expense. The impact to income taxes includes the impact to the effective tax rate, current tax provision and deferred tax provision(1). Adjusted EPS expresses adjusted income on a per share basis using weighted average diluted shares outstanding. \n\nThe following table reconcile the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nFirst Quarters Ended  \n---  \nSeptember 27, 2024| September 29, 2023  \nNet loss and loss per share| $| (17,525| )| $| (0.30| )| $| (36,708| )| $| (0.64| )  \nOther non-operating adjustments, net| (1,735| )| 731  \nAmortization of intangible assets| 11,235| 12,547  \nRestructuring and other charges| 2,260| 9,546  \nImpairment of long-lived assets| —| —  \nAcquisition, financing and other third party costs| 2,331| 1,332  \nFair value adjustments from purchase accounting| 177| 177  \nLitigation and settlement expense, net| 1,394| 503  \nStock-based and other non-cash compensation expense| 10,560| 8,951  \nImpact to income taxes(1)| (6,253| )| (10,758| )  \nAdjusted income (loss) and adjusted earnings (loss) per share(2)| $| 2,444| $| 0.04| $| (13,679| )| $| (0.24| )  \nDiluted weighted-average shares outstanding| 58,585| 57,105  \n(1) Impact to income taxes is calculated by recasting income before income taxes to include the items involved in determining adjusted income and recalculating the income tax provision using this adjusted income from operations before income taxes. The recalculation also adjusts for any discrete tax expense or benefit related to the items.(2) Adjusted earnings per share is calculated using diluted shares whereas Net loss per share or Adjusted loss per share is calculated using basic shares. There was no impact to the calculation of adjusted earnings per share as a result of this for the first quarters ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023.   \n  \n![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/NmM4NDdhNGYtODM0ZC00ZTA0LWFhNjgtZjViNTg0N2RmNjk4LTEwMTcyNDU=/tiny/Mercury-Systems-Inc.png)\n\n  * [![](/sites/g/files/knoqqb59591/themes/site/nir_pid978/client/images/delicious_icon.gif) delicious](http://delicious.com/save?v=5&amp;noui&jump=close&url=&title=Mercury, Inc. -  \"delicious\")\n  * [![](/sites/g/files/knoqqb59591/themes/site/nir_pid978/client/images/digg_icon.gif) Digg](http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url= \"Digg\")\n  * [![](/sites/g/files/knoqqb59591/themes/site/nir_pid978/client/images/facebook_icon.gif) Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=&t=Mercury, Inc. -  \"Facebook\")\n  * [![](/sites/g/files/knoqqb59591/themes/site/nir_pid978/client/images/linkedin_icon.gif) LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=&title=Mercury, Inc. -  \"LinkedIn\")\n  * [![](/sites/g/files/knoqqb59591/themes/site/nir_pid978/client/images/twitter_icon.gif) Twitter](http://twitter.com/home?status=Currently%20reading%20 \"Twitter\")\n\n\n\nInvestor Relations\n\n  * [Overview](/ \"Main Investor Relations Page\")\n  * [Press Releases](/press-releases)\n  * [Events & Presentations](/events-presentations)\n  * + [Corporate Governance](/corporate-governance)\n    * [Management](/corporate-governance/management)\n    * [Board of Directors](/corporate-governance/board-directors)\n    * [Committee Composition](/corporate-governance/committee-composition)\n    * [Contact the Board](/corporate-governance/contact-board)\n  * + [Financial Information](/financial-information)\n    * [SEC Filings](/financial-information/sec-filings)\n    * [Annual Reports](/financial-information/annual-reports)\n    * [Quarterly Results](/financial-information/quarterly-results)\n    * [Key Ratios](/financial-information/key-ratios)\n  * + [Stock Information](/stock-information)\n    * [Historic Stock Lookup](/stock-information/historic-stock-lookup)\n    * [Investment Calculator](/stock-information/investment-calculator)\n    * [Dividend History](/stock-information/dividend-history)\n    * [Analyst Coverage](/stock-information/analyst-coverage)\n    * [Ownership Profile](/stock-information/ownership-profile)\n  * [Acquisitions](https://www.mrcy.com/company-overview/acquisitions/)\n  * [Investor FAQs](/investor-faqs)\n  * [Contact Us](/contact-us)\n\n\n\n  * [Print Page](javascript:window.print\\(\\);)\n  * [Email Alerts](/email-alerts)\n  * [RSS News Feeds](/rss-news-feeds)\n\n\n\n  * [](http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https://ir.mrcy.com/financial-information/sec-filings?items_per_page=10&items_per_page_toggle=1&mobile=1&order=field_nir_sec_description&page=27&sort=asc?&t=SEC Filings | MediWound \"Facebook\")\n  * [](https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://ir.mrcy.com/financial-information/sec-filings?items_per_page=10&items_per_page_toggle=1&mobile=1&order=field_nir_sec_description&page=27&sort=asc?&t=SEC Filings | MediWound \"GooglePlus\")\n  * [](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://ir.mrcy.com/financial-information/sec-filings?items_per_page=10&items_per_page_toggle=1&mobile=1&order=field_nir_sec_description&page=27&sort=asc?&t=SEC Filings | MediWound \"LinkedIn\")\n  * [](http://twitter.com/home?status=Currently%20reading%20https://ir.mrcy.com/financial-information/sec-filings?items_per_page=10&items_per_page_toggle=1&mobile=1&order=field_nir_sec_description&page=27&sort=asc?&t=SEC Filings | MediWound \"Twitter\")\n  * [](/rss-news-feeds \"RSS\")\n\n\n\nWe use cookies to analyze website traffic and to enhance your experience.
