Our branded prepared foods portfolio expanded across retail and foodservice through increased distribution and promotional activity. \n  * Europe improved Adjusted EBITDA nearly 40% versus prior year given recent network and back office optimization efforts, enhanced mix with Key Customers, and further diversification through branded offerings and innovation. _Richmond_ _®_ and _Fridge Raiders_ _®_ continued to grow faster than category averages and our innovation efforts continue to be recognized by the market with multiple industry awards.\n  * Mexico results followed normal seasonality, while continuing to cultivate partnerships with Key Customers as sales grew ahead of the market.

Our unrelenting focus on quality, service and innovation is reflected in our performance,” said Fabio Sandri, Pilgrim’s President and Chief Executive Officer. \n\nIn the U.S., the relative affordability and availability of chicken drove increased demand across retail and food service. Case Ready and Small Bird drove profitable growth as demand improved from Key Customers and there was continued progress in operational excellence. In Big Bird, profitability grew from sustained improvements in production efficiencies, lower input costs, and enhanced commodity cutout values. Similarly, Prepared continued to diversify the portfolio through incremental distribution across retail and foodservice. \n\n“We partnered closely with our Key Customers to further cultivate consumer demand. As such, our approach accommodated changing input costs, enabling further investment in promotional activity, generating store traffic and driving growth well above the category. These efforts were amplified by attractive market fundamentals, especially in the Big Bird segment,” Sandri said. \n\nEurope realized its highest quarterly adjusted EBITDA to date given continued progress in operational excellence, further diversification through branded offerings and strengthening Key Customer partnerships. New product introductions continue to gain momentum as the business launched over 280 new products during the quarter. \n\n“Our new product pipeline has generated significant marketplace interest. We received multiple industry awards during the quarter for innovation, quality and functionality for our recently launched items. Given these efforts, we can further scale partnerships with Key Customers, enhance mix through branded offerings, and grow our prepared portfolio,” said Sandri. \n\nMexico continued to build its presence with Key Customers across retail and foodservice and further diversify its portfolio through brands. Investments in operational excellence to build capacity and drive operational efficiencies remained on track.\n\n“Mexico continued to successfully drive all pillars of our strategies during typical seasonality for the business. As a result, we are increasingly well positioned to capture both short- and long-term growth opportunities,” remarked Sandri. \n\nPilgrim’s provided an update on its progress to become an industry leader in sustainability through the publication of its 2023 Sustainability Report. The report included an update on a variety of topics, including the company’s exceptional safety performance, product integrity standards, and GHG emissions reductions. \n\n“Sustainability is critical to achieve our vision of becoming the best and most respected company in our industry and creating a better future for our team members and their families,” said Sandri.\n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nA conference call to discuss Pilgrim’s quarterly results will be held tomorrow, Oct. 31, at 7 a.m. MT (9 a.m. ET).

\n****(Unaudited)****  \n  \n“EBITDA” is defined as the sum of net income plus interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. “Adjusted EBITDA” is calculated by adding to EBITDA certain items of expense and deducting from EBITDA certain items of income that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance consisting of: (1) foreign currency transaction losses (gains), (2) costs related to litigation settlements, (3) restructuring activities losses, (4) loss on settlement of pension obligations due to plan termination, (5) write-downs of inventory as a result of hurricane, (6) property insurance recoveries for property damage losses, and (7) net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. EBITDA is presented because it is used by management and we believe it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties, in addition to and not in lieu of results prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”), to compare the performance of companies. We believe investors would be interested in our Adjusted EBITDA because this is how our management analyzes EBITDA applicable to continuing operations. The Company also believes that Adjusted EBITDA, in combination with the Company’s financial results calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, provides investors with additional perspective regarding the impact of certain significant items on EBITDA and facilitates a more direct comparison of its performance with its competitors. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements of financial performance under U.S. GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for an analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. In addition, other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income as indicators of our operating performance or any other measures of performance derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These limitations should be compensated for by relying primarily on our U.S. GAAP results and using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA only on a supplemental basis.\n\n**PILGRIM'S PRIDE CORPORATION**  \n---  \n**Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA**  \n**(Unaudited)**  \n**Three Months Ended** | **Nine Months Ended**  \n**September 29, 2024** | **September 24, 2023** | **September 29, 2024** | **September 24, 2023**  \n**(In thousands)**  \nNet income | $ |  349,990 | $ |  121,567 | $ |  851,451 | $ |  188,106  \nAdd:  \nInterest expense, net(a) |  19,498 |  33,530 |  65,733 |  112,116  \nIncome tax expense |  131,609 |  44,553 |  284,321 |  20,488  \nDepreciation and amortization |  110,470 |  104,300 |  321,768 |  307,414  \nEBITDA |  611,567 |  303,950 |  1,523,273 |  628,124  \nAdd:  \nForeign currency transaction losses (gains)(b) |  (678 | ) |  8,924 |  (7,240 | ) |  43,462  \nLitigation settlements(c) |  — |  10,500 |  72,190 |  34,700  \nRestructuring activities losses(d) |  30,836 |  940 |  82,070 |  38,684  \nLoss on settlement of pension from plan termination(e) |  10,709 |  — |  10,709 |  —  \nInventory write-down as a result of hurricane(f) |  8,075 |  — |  8,075 |  —  \nMinus:  \nProperty insurance recoveries(g) |  — |  — |  — |  19,086  \nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest |  130 |  289 |  867 |  1,185  \nAdjusted EBITDA | $ |  660,379 | $ |  324,025 | $ |  1,688,210 | $ |  724,699  \n  \n(a) | Interest expense, net, consists of interest expense less interest income.  \n---|---  \n(b) | Prior to April 1, 2024, the Company measures the financial statements of its Mexico reportable segment as if the U.S. dollar were the functional currency.
