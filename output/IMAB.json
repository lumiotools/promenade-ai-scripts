These results have provided us with a strong foundation for advancing each molecule into expanded clinical trials, including Phase 2 studies, in the next year.\"\n\n**Pipeline Overview and Potential Upcoming Milestones:**\n\n**Uliledlimab (CD73 antibody)** : Initiating a randomized Phase 2 combination study in first-line metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (\"mNSCLC\")\n\nUliledlimab (TJ004309) is an antibody designed to target CD73, the rate-limiting enzyme critical for adenosine-driven immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment. I-Mab owns worldwide rights to uliledlimab outside of Greater China.\n\nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (\"PK/PD\") Phase 1 data presented at the 2024 World Conference on Lung Cancer (\"WCLC 2024\") in September showed that uliledlimab achieved full target engagement with a positive correlation between the overall response rate (\"ORR\") in patients with mNSCLC and uliledlimab exposure.\n\nThe Company is on track to dose the first patient in the randomized Phase 2 study in patients with first-line mNSCLC testing multiple doses of uliledlimab in combination with pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy versus standard of care in 1H 2025.\n\n**Givastomig (Claudin 18.2 x 4-1BB bispecific antibody):** Ongoing Phase 1b escalation and expansion study in combination with nivolumab plus chemotherapy in first-line metastatic gastric cancer\n\nGivastomig (TJ033721 / ABL111) is a bispecific antibody targeting Claudin 18.2 (\"CLDN 18.2\")-positive tumor cells that conditionally activates T cells via 4-1BB in the tumor microenvironment, with potential CLDN 18.2 specificity even in tumors with low levels of CLDN 18.2 expression. The program is being jointly developed with ABL Bio.\n\nTopline Phase 1 monotherapy dose escalation and dose expansion data presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology (\"ESMO 2024\") in September 2024 showed promising objective responses in patients with gastric cancers expressing CLDN 18.2 across low and high levels and defined the optimal monotherapy dose range (8-12 mg/kg). The study showed an ORR of 16.3% (7/43), including seven partial responses (\"PR\") at doses between 5 mg/kg and 18 mg/kg, with five of the seven patients (71%) having received prior checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Stable disease (\"SD\") was reported in 14 patients, with a disease control rate (\"DCR\") of 48.8% (21/43 patients). The safety profile was favorable, with mainly grade 1 or 2 treatment-related adverse events (\"TRAEs\") and no observations of dose-limiting toxicities (\"DLTs\") or identification of a maximum tolerated dose (\"MTD\").\n\nI-Mab presented a poster highlighting Phase 1 pharmacokinetic modeling data for optimizing dose estimation of givastomig at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (\"SITC 2024\") on November 9, 2024, based on three clinical studies and additional nonclinical data. The studies demonstrated a dose-response relationship for givastomig and supported 8-12 mg/kg administered every two weeks (\"Q2W\") as the optimal monotherapy dose range for gastric cancer patients.\n\nTopline data from the on-going Phase 1b study evaluating givastomig in combination with nivolumab plus chemotherapy are expected in 2H 2025 in patients with treatment-naïve CLDN 18.2-positive metastatic gastric cancer. The primary endpoint is safety, with secondary endpoints including tumor response, PK/PD, and survival.\n\n**Ragistomig (PD-L1 x 4-1BB bispecific antibody):** Ongoing Phase 1 dose escalation and dose expansion in advanced and/or PD-L1 positive, solid tumors\n\nRagistomig (TJ-L14B / ABL503) is a bispecific, Fc-silent antibody designed to provide anti-PD-L1 activity and conditional 4-1BB-driven T-cell activation in one molecule. The program is being jointly developed with ABL Bio.\n\nIn October, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\"USPTO\") issued a composition of matter patent for ragistomig, providing coverage through February 2039 before consideration of any potential patent term extensions.\n\nAdditional dose schedules are being explored to maximize the therapeutic index in advanced and/or PD-L1-positive solid tumors.\n\n**Significant Strategic Progress and Corporate Development**\n\n  * **Appointment of Dr. Sean (Xi-Yong) Fu, PhD, MBA, as Chief Executive Officer:** Dr. Fu was appointed as the Company's permanent Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") effective November 1, 2024. Dr. Fu has served as the Company's Interim CEO since July 15, 2024. Dr. Fu will continue to serve as a member of the I-Mab Board of Directors. Dr. Fu has over 20 years of experience in the life sciences industry, leading and developing clinical-stage assets.\n  * **Sanofi S.A. (\"Sanofi\") / TJ Biopharma (\"TJ Bio\") agreement for uliledlimab: **On September 25, 2024, Sanofi and TJ Bio entered into a collaboration agreement to develop and commercialize uliledlimab in Greater China. The agreement includes an initial payment and near-term milestone payments totaling approximately €32 million, with the potential to receive up to €213 million in success-based milestone payments plus tiered royalties based on sales, with upside from potential expanded indications. I-Mab holds worldwide rights, excluding Greater China.\n  * **Settlement of remaining repurchase obligations** : I-Mab settled the remaining RMB equivalent of approximately $15 million in redemption obligations related to the divestiture of its China operations in mid-September 2024. As previously disclosed, in connection with the divestiture of I-Mab's China operations, certain non-participating shareholders of TJ Bio commenced arbitration against I-Mab Biopharma Hong Kong Limited. As reported in the Company's 1H 2024 business update, the RMB equivalent of $17.3 million related to the ongoing arbitration with certain non-participating shareholders was settled from funds previously placed into escrow, which was accounted for in prepayments and other current assets. I-Mab's ownership in TJ Bio post-settlement of the repurchase obligations is approximately 15%. As a result of the settlement of the redemption obligations, the corresponding put right liability was fully extinguished.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n**_Cash Position_**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $184.4 million, compared to $311.0 million as of December 31, 2023. There was $10.8 million of cash classified as discontinued operations as of December 31, 2023. The Company expects its existing cash and cash related balances to be sufficient to fund its current operating plan into 2027.\n\n**_Shares Outstanding_**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had 187,452,500 ordinary shares issued and outstanding, representing the equivalent of 81,501,087 ADSs, assuming the conversion of all ordinary shares into ADSs.\n\n**_Research & Development Expenses_**\n\nResearch and development (\"R&D\") expenses were $4.5 million and $15.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to $5.1 million and $13.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. R&D costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024, were $0.6 million lower than the comparable period in 2023, primarily due to streamlined clinical pipeline activities. R&D costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were $2.4 million higher than the comparable period in 2023, driven by higher clinical trial costs associated with the preparation of enrollment for the uliledlimab Phase 2 combination study and increased spend on the givastomig Phase 1b dose expansion study. These higher costs were partially offset by decreased share-based compensation expense.\n\n**_Administrative Expenses_**\n\nAdministrative expenses were $7.9 million and $22.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to $5.9 million and $19.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase of $2.0 million and $2.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, were primarily driven by legal costs associated with the litigation against Inhibrx, Inc., partially offset by lower share-based compensation expense.\n\n**_Other Income (Expenses), Net_**\n\nOther income (expenses), net were $(10.5) million and $(5.0) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to $2.4 million and $(9.1) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The $12.9 million increase in other expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily driven by the settlement of the TJ Bio repurchase obligations. The $4.1 million decrease in other expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily driven by a smaller impact from foreign exchange losses for the current period, partially offset by the settlement of the TJ Bio repurchase obligations.\n\n**_Net Loss from Continuing Operations_**\n\nNet loss from continuing operations was $(20.5) million and $(38.9) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to $(8.2) million and $(45.3) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\n\n**About I-Mab**\n\nI-Mab (NASDAQ: IMAB) is a U.S.-based, global biotech company, exclusively focused on the development of highly differentiated immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer.
