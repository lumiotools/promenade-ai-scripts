We achieved that objective. Our first commercial project not only exceeded customer expectations but also secured additional work for the fourth quarter. With the 2024 work season in the Gulf of Mexico ending, we are now fully focused on building a robust pipeline of commercial opportunities for 2025. Nauticus' untethered, autonomous deepwater solutions have set us apart as the technical leader in this field, earning strong recognition from our customers.\n\nOn the financial front, we raised over $1 million in cash through a tranche of convertible debentures, with the option to access an additional $20 million. Alongside converting existing debentures into preferred equity, these steps bolster our shareholder equity and position us to regain compliance with NASDAQ listing requirements. This access to additional funds provides a solid financial foundation to cement our position as a leader in the ocean economy.\"\n\n**Operational Highlights**\n\n**Vehicle 2 Testing:** Nauticus' flagship vehicle, Aquanaut Mark 2 (Vehicle 2), completed deepwater qualification trials and began commercial operations in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM). The vehicle completed offshore operations for 2024 and will now be readied for the upcoming 2025 offshore season. The success of the commercial work performed this year resulted in continued discussions with current as well as new customers for 2025 work. The pipeline for Aquanaut services remains strong and the company expects that customers will continue placing the vehicle into their offshore execution models.\n\n**Vehicle 1 Assembly and Testing:** Aquanaut Vehicle 1 deepwater electronics upgrades are complete and final assembly is expected to complete this month. Once the vehicle is fully assembled it is planned to ship to a testing facility to complete factory acceptance testing. We expect this to occur by the end of the year.\n\n**Vehicle 3 Assembly:** Assembly of Aquanaut Vehicle 3 remains pending. Company focus remained on Vehicles 1 and 2 throughout the quarter. Work on this vehicle is not expected until sometime in 2025.\n\n**ToolKITT Software:** ToolKITT performed reliably during Aquanaut vehicle operations this quarter. The team continues to progress the technology towards higher levels of autonomy and broader commercial functionality. ToolKITT is also expected to provide value added differentiation for third party platform integration. Discussions with third party ROV manufacturers and services providers are ongoing and Nauticus is targeting to sell its first commercial license in 2025.\n\n**Revenue:** Nauticus reported third-quarter revenue of $0.4 million, compared to $1.6 million for the prior-year period and $0.5 million for the prior quarter.\n\n**Operating Expenses:** Total expenses during the third quarter were $5.9 million, a $3.9 million decrease from the prior-year period, and a $0.6 million decrease from Q2 2024.\n\n**Net Income:** For the third quarter, Nauticus recorded a net loss of $11.4 million, or basic loss per share of $4.24. This compares with a net loss of $17.7 million from the same period in 2023, and a net loss of $5.4 million in the prior quarter.\n\n**Adjusted Net Loss:** Nauticus reported adjusted net loss of $11.4 million for the third quarter, compared to $8.1 million for the same period in 2023. Adjusted net loss is a non-GAAP measure which excludes the impact of certain items, as shown in the non-GAAP reconciliation table below.\n\n**2024 G &A Cost: **Nauticus reported G&A third-quarter costs of $2.8 million, which is a decrease of $3.9 million compared to the same period in 2023 and an additional $0.4 million decrease from the second quarter.\n\n**Balance Sheet and Liquidity**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $2.9 million, compared to $0.8 million as of December 31, 2023.\n\n**Conference Call Details**\n\nNauticus will host a conference call on November 13, 2024 at 10:00 a.m. Central Standard Time (11:00 a.m. EST) to discuss its results for the quarter ending September 30, 2024.

Items excluded are those which the Company believes affect the comparability of operating results and are typically excluded from published estimates by the investment community, including items whose timing and/or amount cannot be reasonably estimated or are non-recurring.\n\nAdjusted net loss attributable to common stockholders is presented because management believes it provides useful additional information to investors for analysis of the Company's fundamental business on a recurring basis. In addition, management believes that adjusted net loss attributable to common stockholders is widely used by professional research analysts and others in the valuation, comparison, and investment recommendations of companies such as Nauticus.\n\nAdjusted net loss attributable to common stockholders should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders or any other measure of a company's financial performance or profitability presented in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the differences between net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders and adjusted net loss attributable to common stockholders is presented below. Because adjusted net loss attributable to common stockholders excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders and may vary among companies, our calculation of adjusted net loss attributable to common stockholders may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\n\n**Three Months Ended** |  **Nine Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n**9/30/2024** |  **6/30/2024** |  **9/30/2023** |  **9/30/2024** |  **9/30/2023**  \n**Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders (GAAP)** |  $(11,356,956) |  $(5,373,320) |  $(17,678,787) |  $(16,316,664) |  $(11,144,012)  \nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities |  (615,505) |  (4,422,701) |  8,656,392 |  (13,347,829) |  (18,775,158)  \nStock compensation expense |  532,539 |  809,310 |  917,993 |  1,872,504 |  3,995,020  \nSales and use tax assessment |  - |  - |  - |  - |  1,189,164  \nLoss on exchange of warrants |  - |  - |  - |  - |  590,266  \nInterest and penalties on RRA Amendment |  - |  - |  - |  - |  4,320,690  \n**Adjusted net loss attributable to common stockholders (non-GAAP)** |  $(11,439,922) |  $(8,986,711) |  $(8,104,402) |  $(27,791,989) |  $(19,824,030)  \n  \nView original content to download multimedia:<https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nauticus-robotics-announces-results-for-the-third-quarter-of-2024-302303412.html>\n\nSOURCE Nauticus Robotics, Inc.\n\nReleased November 12, 2024\n\n  * [Email Alerts](/news-events/email-alerts)\n  * [Contacts](/company-information/contacts)\n  * [RSS News Feed](https://ir.nauticusrobotics.com/news-events/press-releases/rss \"Opens in a new window\")\n\n\n\nWe use cookies to enhance your browsing experience.

We achieved that objective. Our first commercial project not only exceeded customer expectations but also secured additional work for the fourth quarter. With the 2024 work season in the Gulf of Mexico ending, we are now fully focused on building a robust pipeline of commercial opportunities for 2025. Nauticus' untethered, autonomous deepwater solutions have set us apart as the technical leader in this field, earning strong recognition from our customers.\n\nOn the financial front, we raised over $1 million in cash through a tranche of convertible debentures, with the option to access an additional $20 million. Alongside converting existing debentures into preferred equity, these steps bolster our shareholder equity and position us to regain compliance with NASDAQ listing requirements. This access to additional funds provides a solid financial foundation to cement our position as a leader in the ocean economy.\"\n\n**Operational Highlights**\n\n**Vehicle 2 Testing:** Nauticus' flagship vehicle, Aquanaut Mark 2 (Vehicle 2), completed deepwater qualification trials and began commercial operations in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM). The vehicle completed offshore operations for 2024 and will now be readied for the upcoming 2025 offshore season. The success of the commercial work performed this year resulted in continued discussions with current as well as new customers for 2025 work. The pipeline for Aquanaut services remains strong and the company expects that customers will continue placing the vehicle into their offshore execution models.\n\n**Vehicle 1 Assembly and Testing:** Aquanaut Vehicle 1 deepwater electronics upgrades are complete and final assembly is expected to complete this month. Once the vehicle is fully assembled it is planned to ship to a testing facility to complete factory acceptance testing. We expect this to occur by the end of the year.\n\n**Vehicle 3 Assembly:** Assembly of Aquanaut Vehicle 3 remains pending. Company focus remained on Vehicles 1 and 2 throughout the quarter. Work on this vehicle is not expected until sometime in 2025.\n\n**ToolKITT Software:** ToolKITT performed reliably during Aquanaut vehicle operations this quarter. The team continues to progress the technology towards higher levels of autonomy and broader commercial functionality. ToolKITT is also expected to provide value added differentiation for third party platform integration. Discussions with third party ROV manufacturers and services providers are ongoing and Nauticus is targeting to sell its first commercial license in 2025.\n\n**Revenue:** Nauticus reported third-quarter revenue of $0.4 million, compared to $1.6 million for the prior-year period and $0.5 million for the prior quarter.\n\n**Operating Expenses:** Total expenses during the third quarter were $5.9 million, a $3.9 million decrease from the prior-year period, and a $0.6 million decrease from Q2 2024.\n\n**Net Income:** For the third quarter, Nauticus recorded a net loss of $11.4 million, or basic loss per share of $4.24. This compares with a net loss of $17.7 million from the same period in 2023, and a net loss of $5.4 million in the prior quarter.\n\n**Adjusted Net Loss:** Nauticus reported adjusted net loss of $11.4 million for the third quarter, compared to $8.1 million for the same period in 2023. Adjusted net loss is a non-GAAP measure which excludes the impact of certain items, as shown in the non-GAAP reconciliation table below.\n\n**2024 G &A Cost: **Nauticus reported G&A third-quarter costs of $2.8 million, which is a decrease of $3.9 million compared to the same period in 2023 and an additional $0.4 million decrease from the second quarter.\n\n**Balance Sheet and Liquidity**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $2.9 million, compared to $0.8 million as of December 31, 2023.\n\n**Conference Call Details**\n\nNauticus will host a conference call on November 13, 2024 at 10:00 a.m. Central Standard Time (11:00 a.m. EST) to discuss its results for the quarter ending September 30, 2024.

Autonomy requires the extensive use of sensors, artificial intelligence, and effective algorithms for perception and decision allowing the robot to adapt to changing environments. The company's business model includes using robotic systems for service, selling vehicles and components, and licensing of related software to both the commercial and defense business sectors. Nauticus has designed and is currently testing and certifying a new generation of vehicles to reduce operational cost and gather data to maintain and operate a wide variety of subsea infrastructure. Besides a standalone service offering and forward-facing products, Nauticus' approach to ocean robotics has also resulted in the development of a range of technology products for retrofit/upgrading traditional ROV operations and other third-party vehicle platforms. Nauticus' services provide customers with the necessary data collection, analytics, and subsea manipulation capabilities to support and maintain assets while reducing their operational footprint, operating cost, and greenhouse gas emissions, to improve offshore health, safety, and environmental exposure.\n\n_Cautionary Language Regarding Forward-Looking Statements_\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Act\"), and are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided by the Act as well as protections afforded by other federal securities laws.

Items excluded are those which the Company believes affect the comparability of operating results and are typically excluded from published estimates by the investment community, including items whose timing and/or amount cannot be reasonably estimated or are non-recurring.\n\nAdjusted net loss attributable to common stockholders is presented because management believes it provides useful additional information to investors for analysis of the Company's fundamental business on a recurring basis. In addition, management believes that adjusted net loss attributable to common stockholders is widely used by professional research analysts and others in the valuation, comparison, and investment recommendations of companies such as Nauticus.\n\nAdjusted net loss attributable to common stockholders should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders or any other measure of a company's financial performance or profitability presented in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the differences between net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders and adjusted net loss attributable to common stockholders is presented below. Because adjusted net loss attributable to common stockholders excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders and may vary among companies, our calculation of adjusted net loss attributable to common stockholders may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\n\n**Three Months Ended** |  **Nine Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n**9/30/2024** |  **6/30/2024** |  **9/30/2023** |  **9/30/2024** |  **9/30/2023**  \n**Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders (GAAP)** |  $(11,356,956) |  $(5,373,320) |  $(17,678,787) |  $(16,316,664) |  $(11,144,012)  \nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities |  (615,505) |  (4,422,701) |  8,656,392 |  (13,347,829) |  (18,775,158)  \nStock compensation expense |  532,539 |  809,310 |  917,993 |  1,872,504 |  3,995,020  \nSales and use tax assessment |  - |  - |  - |  - |  1,189,164  \nLoss on exchange of warrants |  - |  - |  - |  - |  590,266  \nInterest and penalties on RRA Amendment |  - |  - |  - |  - |  4,320,690  \n**Adjusted net loss attributable to common stockholders (non-GAAP)** |  $(11,439,922) |  $(8,986,711) |  $(8,104,402) |  $(27,791,989) |  $(19,824,030)  \n  \nView original content to download multimedia:<https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nauticus-robotics-announces-results-for-the-third-quarter-of-2024-302303412.html>\n\nSOURCE Nauticus Robotics, Inc.\n\nReleased November 12, 2024\n\n  * [Email Alerts](/news-events/email-alerts)\n  * [Contacts](/company-information/contacts)\n  * [RSS News Feed](https://ir.nauticusrobotics.com/news-events/press-releases/rss \"Opens in a new window\")\n\n\n\nWe use cookies to enhance your browsing experience.
