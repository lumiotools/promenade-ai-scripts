Third quarter 2024 gross merchandise value (GMV) and total revenue increased 6% and 11% respectively, compared to the third quarter of 2023. During the quarter, consignment revenue grew 14% compared to the same period in 2023. Third quarter Adjusted EBITDA improved $9 million compared to the third quarter of 2023.\n\n“I am pleased to report strong results for the third quarter, and I am encouraged by the continued strength in supply trends as we enter the fourth quarter,\" said Rati Levesque, Chief Executive Officer of The RealReal. “Third quarter GMV, Total Revenue, and Adjusted EBITDA all exceeded our prior expectations, enabling us to raise our full year outlook.”\n\nLevesque continued, “Our team is focused on delivering against our 2024 commitments. I’m encouraged by our results and by how our teams are executing against our vision to change the way people shop for the better, creating a unique circular shopping experience built on technical expertise and high-touch human service.”\n\n**Third Quarter Highlights**\n\n  * GMV was $433 million, an increase of 6% compared to the same period in 2023\n  * Total Revenue was $148 million, an increase of 11% compared to the same period in 2023\n  * Gross Profit was $111 million, an increase of $17 million compared to the same period in 2023\n  * Gross Margin was 74.9%, an increase of 430 basis points compared to the same period in 2023\n  * Net Loss was $(18) million or (12.1)% of total revenue, compared to $(23) million or (17.2)% of total revenue in the same period in 2023\n  * Adjusted EBITDA was $2.3 million or 1.6% of total revenue compared to $(7.0) million or (5.2)% of total revenue in the same period in 2023\n  * GAAP basic net loss per share was $(0.16) compared to $(0.22) in the prior year period and GAAP diluted net loss per share was $(0.17) compared to $(0.22) in the prior year period\n  * Non-GAAP basic and diluted net loss attributable to common shareholders per share was $(0.09) compared to $(0.15) in the prior year period\n  * _Top-line-related Metrics_\n    * Trailing three months active buyers was 389,000, an increase of 7% compared to the same period in 2023\n    * Orders were 829,000, an increase of 4% compared to the same period in 2023\n    * Average order value (AOV) was $522, an increase of 2% versus the same period in 2023\n\n\n\n**Q4 and Full Year 2024 Guidance** Based on market conditions as of November 4, 2024, we are raising our full year guidance. Additionally, we are providing guidance for fourth quarter 2024 GMV, Total Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, which is a Non-GAAP financial measure.\n\nWe have not reconciled forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP measure, because we cannot predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of certain components of such reconciliations including payroll tax expense on employee stock transactions that are not within our control, or other components that may arise, without unreasonable effort. For these reasons, we are unable to assess the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could materially impact the amount of future net income (loss).\n\n**Q4 2024** | **Full Year 2024**  \n---|---  \n**GMV** | $484 - $500 million | $1.810 - $1.826 billion  \n**Total Revenue** | $158 - $165 million | $595 - $602 million  \n**Adjusted EBITDA** | $6.5 - $9.5 million | $4.7 - $7.7 million  \n  \n**W****ebcast and Conference Call** The RealReal will host a conference call to review the company’s third quarter 2024 results beginning at approximately 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time today (5:00 p.m. Eastern Time). A live webcast of the conference call and accompanying materials will be available online at [investor.therealreal.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=50UFtgcBoZ_jywHY8mXVHPlsBPRBnYutp84iF4dBjnORcJx8DEMY93nKtMKCibroY8sCdts1XTXMA0Ysuktnlys4zd63AudttoauZ5q2E2FuMOeFDXJZIMseVagVz3wy).

In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “target,” “contemplate,” “project,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “intend,” “potential,” “continue,” “ongoing” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements about future operating and financial results, including our strategies, plans, commitments, objectives and goals, in particular in the context of the impacts of recent geopolitical events, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war, and uncertainty surrounding macro-economic trends, the debt exchange, financial guidance, anticipated growth in 2024, the anticipated impact of generative AI, and long-range financial targets and projections. Actual results could differ materially from those predicted or implied and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. Other factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, inflation, macroeconomic uncertainty, geopolitical instability, any failure to generate a supply of consigned goods, pricing pressure on the consignment market resulting from discounting in the market for new goods, failure to efficiently and effectively operate our merchandising and fulfillment operations, labor shortages and other reasons.\n\nMore information about factors that could affect the company's operating results is included under the captions “Risk Factors” and “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, copies of which may be obtained by visiting the company's Investor Relations website at <https://investor.therealreal.com> or the SEC's website at [www.sec.gov](http://www.sec.gov). Undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements in this press release, which are based on information available to the company on the date hereof. The company assumes no obligation to update such statements.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures** To supplement our unaudited and condensed financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), this earnings release and the accompanying tables and the related earnings conference call contain certain non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue (“Adjusted EBITDA Margin”), free cash flow, non-GAAP net loss attributable to common stockholders, and non-GAAP net loss per share attributable to common stockholders, basic and diluted. We have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in this earnings release.\n\nWe do not, nor do we suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors should also note that non-GAAP financial measures we use may not be the same non-GAAP financial measures, and may not be calculated in the same manner, as that of other companies, including other companies in our industry.\n\n**Adjusted EBITDA** is a key performance measure that our management uses to assess our operating performance. Because Adjusted EBITDA facilitates internal comparisons of our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis, we use this measure as an overall assessment of our performance, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies and for business planning purposes. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled metrics of other companies.\n\nWe calculate **Adjusted EBITDA** as net loss before interest income, interest expense, other (income) expense net, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, further adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation, employer payroll tax expense on employee stock transactions, legal settlement charges, restructuring, warehouse fire costs (net), gain on extinguishment of debt, change in fair value of warrant liabilities and certain one-time expenses. The employer payroll tax expense related to employee stock transactions are tied to the vesting or exercise of underlying equity awards and the price of our common stock at the time of vesting, which may vary from period to period independent of the operating performance of our business. Adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations as the measure excludes the impact of certain expenses that are included in our statements of operations that are necessary to run our business and should not be considered as an alternative to net loss or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nIn particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin facilitates operating performance comparisons on a period-to-period basis and, in the case of exclusion of the impact of stock-based compensation and the related employer payroll tax expense on employee stock transactions, excludes an item that we do not consider to be indicative of our core operating performance. Investors should, however, understand that stock-based compensation and the related employer payroll tax expense will be a significant recurring expense in our business and an important part of the compensation provided to our employees. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors.\n\n**Free cash flow** is a non-GAAP financial measure that is calculated as net cash (used in) provided by operating activities less net cash used to purchase property and equipment and capitalized proprietary software development costs. We believe free cash flow is an important indicator of our business performance, as it measures the amount of cash we generate. Accordingly, we believe that free cash flow provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management.\n\n**Non-GAAP net loss per share attributable to common stockholders, basic and diluted** is a non-GAAP financial measure that is calculated as GAAP net loss plus stock-based compensation expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, payroll tax expenses on employee stock transactions, legal settlement charges, restructuring charges, gain on extinguishment of debt, change in fair value of warrant liabilities and certain one-time expenses divided by weighted average shares outstanding. We exclude the effect of our liability classified warrants to arrive at the weighted average common shares outstanding when their effect is anti-dilutive. We believe that making these adjustments before calculating per share amounts for all periods presented provides a more meaningful comparison between our operating results from period to period.\n\n**THE REALREAL, INC.****Statements of Operations**(In thousands, except share and per share data)(Unaudited)  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended September 30,** | **Nine Months Ended September

Ms. Levesque succeeds John Koryl, who has departed from the Company and no longer serves on the Board.\n\nMs. Levesque helped found The RealReal in 2011 and most recently served as the Company’s President and COO. She has held leadership roles across multiple areas of the business including sales, merchandising, product and technology, operations, and marketing. Over the course of her 13-year tenure, Ms. Levesque has been instrumental in setting the Company’s strategy and positioning The RealReal as the leader in luxury resale.\n\n“I am thrilled to announce Rati as The RealReal’s next CEO,” said Karen Katz, Chairperson of the Board. “Rati has been pivotal in formulating and executing the recent strategic shifts that have propelled the Company on its path to profitability.

Gross Merchandise Value (GMV), Total Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter are expected to exceed previously issued guidance ranges, as outlined in the table below.\n\n**Q3 2024 Preliminary Results** | **Prior Q3 2024 Guidance**  \n---|---  \n**GMV** | $433.1 million | $410 - $430 million  \n**Total Revenue** | $147.8 million | $135 - $142 million  \n**Adjusted EBITDA*** | $2.3 million | $(2) - $1 million  \n  \n**Updated FY 2024 Guidance** | **Prior FY 2024 Guidance**  \n---|---  \n**GMV** | $1.810 - $1.826 billion | $1.790 - $1.820 billion  \n**Total Revenue** | $595 - $602 million | $580 - $595 million  \n**Adjusted EBITDA** | $4.5 - $7.5 million | $0 - $6 million  \n  \n*Adjusted EBITDA is based on preliminary Net Loss of $(17.938) million for the three months ended September 30, 2024.\n\n“We are pleased to report strong preliminary third quarter financial results enabling us to raise our full year guidance ranges,” commented Ms. Levesque. “Based on our preliminary results, GMV, Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA exceeded our expectations for the quarter, increasing our confidence in the momentum of our business.”\n\nMs. Levesque continued, “Our growth playbook, which is centered on unlocking supply, is working with proof points in both top line and margin metrics. The RealReal is positioned well as the leader in luxury resale with significant room to grow. Our strong third quarter results are an important step as we focus on growing our business profitably. We look forward to reporting actual third quarter results and discussing our fourth quarter and full year outlook in more detail during our earnings conference call next week.”\n\nThe Company’s preliminary financial results are based on the Company’s current estimate of its results for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, and remain subject to change based on the completion of closing and review procedures and the execution of the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting.\n\nThe Company plans to release its actual third quarter financial results after the market closes on November 4, 2024.

In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “target,” “contemplate,” “project,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “intend,” “potential,” “continue,” “ongoing” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements about future operating and financial results, including our strategies, plans, commitments, objectives and goals, in particular in the context of the impacts of recent geopolitical events, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war, and uncertainty surrounding macro-economic trends, the debt exchange, financial guidance, anticipated growth in 2024, the anticipated impact of generative AI, and long-range financial targets and projections. Actual results could differ materially from those predicted or implied and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. Other factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, inflation, macroeconomic uncertainty, geopolitical instability, any failure to generate a supply of consigned goods, pricing pressure on the consignment market resulting from discounting in the market for new goods, failure to efficiently and effectively operate our merchandising and fulfillment operations, labor shortages and other reasons.\n\nMore information about factors that could affect the company's operating results is included under the captions “Risk Factors” and “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, copies of which may be obtained by visiting the company's Investor Relations website at <https://investor.therealreal.com> or the SEC's website at [www.sec.gov](http://www.sec.gov). Undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements in this press release, which are based on information available to the company on the date hereof. The Company assumes no obligation to update such statements.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures** To supplement our unaudited and condensed financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), this release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures, including GMV and Adjusted EBITDA. We have provided a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure in this release.\n\nWe do not, nor do we suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors should also note that non-GAAP financial measures we use may not be the same non-GAAP financial measures, and may not be calculated in the same manner, as that of other companies, including other companies in our industry.\n\n**Adjusted EBITDA** is a key performance measure that our management uses to assess our operating performance. Because Adjusted EBITDA facilitates internal comparisons of our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis, we use this measure as an overall assessment of our performance, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies and for business planning purposes. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled metrics of other companies.\n\nWe calculate **Adjusted EBITDA** as net loss before interest income, interest expense, other (income) expense net, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, further adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation, employer payroll tax expense on employee stock transactions, change in fair value of warrant liabilities and certain one-time expenses. The employer payroll tax expense related to employee stock transactions are tied to the vesting or exercise of underlying equity awards and the price of our common stock at the time of vesting, which may vary from period to period independent of the operating performance of our business. Adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations as the measure excludes the impact of certain expenses that are included in our statements of operations that are necessary to run our business and should not be considered as an alternative to net loss or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nIn particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA facilitates operating performance comparisons on a period-to-period basis and, in the case of exclusion of the impact of stock-based compensation and the related employer payroll tax expense on employee stock transactions, excludes an item that we do not consider to be indicative of our core operating performance. Investors should, however, understand that stock-based compensation and the related employer payroll tax expense will be a significant recurring expense in our business and an important part of the compensation provided to our employees. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and Board.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA (in thousands):  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n**2024**  \n**Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation:**  \nNet loss | $ | (17,938 | )  \nDepreciation and amortization | 8,270  \nInterest income | (1,940 | )  \nInterest expense | 5,948  \nProvision for income taxes | 72  \nEBITDA | (5,588 | )  \nStock-based compensation | 7,758  \nPayroll taxes expense on employee stock transactions | 76  \nChange in fair value of warrant liability (1) | (744 | )  \nOne time expenses (2) | 822  \n**Adjusted EBITDA** | $ | 2,324  \n  \n(1) The change in fair value of warrant liability for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflects the remeasurement of the warrants issued by the Company in connection with the Note Exchange in February 2024.\n\n(2) One time expenses for the three ended September 30, 2024 consists of vendor services settlements and estimated losses, net of estimated insurance recoveries related to the fire at one of our New Jersey authentication centers.\n\n![](https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=OTI2MjkxMyM2NTUxNjk2IzIxODM4NjM=)![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/ZTAwNmZiNGMtODJhNS00YjliLWExMTEtMjdkMTBhMmFkMzYxLTExOTU0MjE=/tiny/The-RealReal.png)\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/7095c167-5ff3-4212-9af3-cb3aa2e909c5/small/trr-logo-jpg.jpg)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/7095c167-5ff3-4212-9af3-cb3aa2e909c5)\n\nSource: The RealReal\n\n[](# \"Back to top\")\n"
