The data showed reductions in multiple classes of inflammatory lipid species associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Pemvidutide is a balanced GLP-1/glucagon dual receptor agonist in development for the treatment of MASH and obesity.\n\nThe new data were derived from an analysis of plasma samples from subjects who completed a randomized placebo-controlled Phase 1b trial of pemvidutide in subjects with overweight or obesity and MASLD. In the Phase 1b clinical trial, 94 subjects with obesity or overweight and liver fat content (LFC) ≥10% were dosed 1:1:1:1 to pemvidutide (1.2mg, 1.8mg and 2.4mg) or placebo administered once-weekly subcutaneously for 12 weeks. In this study, pemvidutide reduced LFC relative to baseline by up to 68.5% and decreased total cholesterol and triglycerides by up to 12.2% and 44.6%, respectively, after 12 weeks of treatment.\n\nThe goal of the study was to characterize changes in the lipid profile of patients before and after treatment with pemvidutide. In this study of 50 subjects, treatment with pemvidutide was shown to reduce plasma concentrations of atherogenic lipoproteins and lipotoxic lipid classes associated with MASH and implicated in cardiovascular and atherosclerotic disease. In particular, a rapid and significant reduction in small atherogenic LDL particles was observed in the 1.8 mg and 2.4 mg dose groups compared to placebo.\n\n“Cardiovascular events, as opposed to liver-specific events, are the primary co-morbidities associated with MASH, and there is a growing unmet need for a therapy that can not only reduce the inflammation and fibrosis of MASH, but also address key drivers of the longer-term outcomes of the disease,” said Mazen Noureddin, M.D., MHS Director, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center Fatty Liver Program.\n\nDr. Vipin Garg, CEO of Altimmune added, “These data further underscore the potential for pemvidutide to be a differentiated MASH therapy that could address the principal co-morbidities associated with this growing disease. We look forward to sharing results from our ongoing biopsy-driven Phase 2b IMPACT trial of pemvidutide in MASH in the second quarter of 2025.”\n\n**About Pemvidutide**\n\nPemvidutide is a novel, investigational, peptide-based GLP-1/glucagon dual receptor agonist in development for the treatment of obesity and MASH. Activation of the GLP-1 and glucagon receptors is believed to mimic the complementary effects of diet and exercise on weight loss, with GLP-1 suppressing appetite and glucagon increasing energy expenditure. Glucagon is also recognized as having direct effects on hepatic fat metabolism, which is believed to lead to rapid reductions in levels of liver fat and serum lipids. In clinical trials to date, once-weekly pemvidutide has demonstrated compelling weight loss with class-leading lean mass preservation, and robust reductions in triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, liver fat content and blood pressure. The U.S. FDA has granted Fast Track designation to pemvidutide for the treatment of MASH. Pemvidutide recently completed the MOMENTUM Phase 2 obesity trial and is being studied in the ongoing IMPACT Phase 2b MASH trial.\n\n**About Altimmune**\n\nAltimmune is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing innovative next-generation peptide-based therapeutics. The Company is developing pemvidutide, a GLP-1/glucagon dual receptor agonist for the treatment of obesity and MASH.

Garg, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Altimmune. “Further, we successfully completed our End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA for the pemvidutide Phase 3 obesity program, gaining agreement on the design of the pivotal studies as well as the measures of efficacy and safety.”\n\nDr. Garg continued, “The Phase 3 program is designed to leverage the key attributes of pemvidutide, including the effects of balanced GLP-1/glucagon dual agonism in subjects with overweight and obesity. The program will include four pivotal trials with a primary efficacy endpoint of weight loss and will evaluate the effects of pemvidutide on principal co-morbidities of obesity, including elevated serum lipids and excess liver fat. The program will also assess the preservation of lean mass and its impact on subjects at risk for loss of physical function and other complications of sarcopenia.”\n\n“At the 60th Annual Meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, we presented compelling data from our Phase 2 MOMENTUM trial of pemvidutide in obesity, which highlighted its class-leading preservation of lean mass and preferential reduction in visceral adipose tissue, both of which are important differentiators for pemvidutide,” said Scott Harris, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Altimmune. “We also remain on-track to submit an IND application this quarter for the first of up to three additional indications for pemvidutide, with the trial expected to initiate in the first half of 2025.”\n\nDr. Garg concluded, “The data we have generated to date, coupled with the multiple key inflection points on the horizon, give us confidence that 2025 will be a transformational year for pemvidutide, and for Altimmune.”\n\n**Recent Highlights and Anticipated Milestones:**\n\n**Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis (MASH):**\n\n  * _The Company completed patient enrollment in IMPACT, a biopsy-driven Phase 2b trial of pemvidutide in MASH_\n    * The IMPACT trial is evaluating the efficacy and safety of pemvidutide in approximately 190 subjects with biopsy-confirmed MASH.\n    * With a successful readout from IMPACT, pemvidutide would be the first MASH therapy to achieve both fibrosis improvement and significant weight loss at 24 weeks of treatment.\n    * Top-line efficacy data is expected in Q2 2025.\n\n\n\n**Obesity:**\n\n  * _Completed End-of-Phase 2 Meeting for the obesity program with the FDA_\n    * Agreement was reached on the plan for four Phase 3 clinical trials that leverage the key attributes of pemvidutide including balanced GLP-1/glucagon dual agonism.\n    * Each of the four studies is designed to assess the ability of pemvidutide treatment to drive meaningful weight loss and address co-morbidities in specific subpopulations of patients with overweight or obesity.\n    * Data from these studies are expected to form the basis for a registrational package to support FDA approval of pemvidutide in obesity.\n  * _The Company presented data from_ _a_ _body composition sub-study_ _from the Phase 2 MOMENTUM trial_ _at the 60th Annual Meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD)_\n    * In an MRI evaluation of subjects with overweight and obesity treated with pemvidutide for 48 weeks, the lean loss ratio was 21.9%.\n    * Lean mass preservation was greater in subjects aged 60 years and older, in whom the lean loss ratio was further reduced to 19.9%.\n    * In addition to the preservation of lean mass, visceral adipose tissue (VAT) was reduced by 28.3% in the 2.4mg cohort at Week 48. Reduction of VAT is important as VAT is closely associated with cardiovascular risk.\n\n\n\n**Additional Indications for Pemvidutide:**\n\n  * _The Company plans to submit IND applications for pemvidutide in up to three additional indications_\n    * The first of these IND applications will be submitted in Q4 2024, with remaining IND applications expected to be submitted in the first half of 2025.\n    * Preparations for the first trial are underway, with initiation planned for H1 2025.\n\n\n\n**Corporate Update:**\n\n  * _On November 11, 2024, the Company announced the appointment of life sciences industry veteran Greg Weaver as Chief Financial Officer_\n\n\n\n**Financial Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024:**\n\n  * Altimmune had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $139.4 million on September 30, 2024.\n  * Research and development expenses were $19.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $18.4 million in the same period in 2023. The expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, included $12.4 million in direct costs related to development activities for pemvidutide and $0.8 million in direct costs related to additional research and discovery projects.\n  * General and administrative expenses were $5.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $4.5 million in the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to a $0.4 million increase in professional fees.\n  * Interest income was consistent period-over-period at $1.9 million for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n  * Net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was $22.8 million, or $0.32 net loss per share, compared to a net loss of $20.7 million, or $0.39 net loss per share, in the same period in 2023.\n\n\n\n**Conference Call Information:**\n\nDate: | November 12, 2024  \n---|---  \nTime: | 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time  \nWebcast: | To listen, the conference call will be webcast live on Altimmune’s Investor Relations website at <https://ir.altimmune.com/investors>.  \nDial-in: | To participate or dial-in, register [here](https://register.vevent.com/register/BI64fda1a114e543c7b6303b211b805daf) to receive the dial-in numbers and unique PIN to access the call.  \n  \nFollowing the conclusion of the call, the webcast will be available for replay on the Investor Relations (IR) page of the Company’s website at [www.altimmune.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=PSGLf45-r6UjqohYjc8Fdbt_XQg7ZfGYHa3gFXy0Xusn-FU_4Jn0DshPXbYcjHrgNT71zRzXxdfPI9zKhMUmOXrWDNJEc4eCxr_zUEnSt90=). The Company has used, and intends to continue to use, the IR portion of its website as a means of disclosing material non-public information and for complying with disclosure obligations under Regulation FD.\n\n**About Pemvidutide**\n\nPemvidutide is a novel, investigational, peptide-based GLP-1/glucagon dual receptor agonist in development for the treatment of obesity and MASH. Activation of the GLP-1 and glucagon receptors is believed to mimic the complementary effects of diet and exercise on weight loss, with GLP-1 suppressing appetite and glucagon increasing energy expenditure. Glucagon is also recognized as having direct effects on hepatic fat metabolism, which is believed to lead to rapid reductions in levels of liver fat and serum lipids. In clinical trials to date, once-weekly pemvidutide has demonstrated compelling weight loss with class-leading lean mass preservation, and robust reductions in triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, liver fat content and blood pressure. The U.S. FDA has granted Fast Track designation to pemvidutide for the treatment of MASH. Pemvidutide recently completed the MOMENTUM Phase 2 obesity trial and is being studied in the ongoing IMPACT Phase 2b MASH trial.\n\n**About Altimmune**\n\nAltimmune is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing innovative next-generation peptide-based therapeutics. The Company is developing pemvidutide, a GLP-1/glucagon dual receptor agonist for the treatment of obesity and MASH.
