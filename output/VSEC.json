The key drivers to our growth include the successful execution of new distribution awards, the expansion of our maintenance, repair, and overhaul (\"MRO\") capabilities, the launch of our new OEM-licensed manufacturing program, and contributions from our recent acquisition of Turbine Controls (\"TCI\").\"\n\nMr. Cuomo continued, \"Additionally, during the quarter, we completed the integration of Desser Aerospace's U.S. distribution business, launched a new Aviation e-commerce platform, made substantial progress in establishing our OEM-licensed manufacturing capabilities, and began distributing new products through our European Distribution Center of Excellence in Hamburg, Germany. The Aviation segment continues to perform successfully during a year of repositioning and focused execution.\n\n\"In our Fleet segment, we continue to advance our customer diversification strategy, with our commercial customers representing 64% of segment revenue as of the third quarter. Following a temporary reduction in activity with the United States Postal Service (\"USPS\") due to their system integration, activity levels have stabilized at the quarter's end, positioning us for improved revenue and profitability in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter,\" Mr. Cuomo concluded.\n\n\"Our third quarter 2024 results reflect our commitment to financial discipline,\" stated Adam Cohn, Chief Financial Officer of VSE Corporation. \"During the quarter, we generated positive free cash flow, reduced our debt, and maintained an adjusted net leverage ratio within our target range of 3.0 to 3.5 times. Following our successful October 2024 equity offering, the Company has ample financial liquidity and flexibility to complete the acquisition of Kellstrom Aerospace in the fourth quarter and capitalize on the significant growth opportunities that lie ahead. As we look out to the fourth quarter, we expect to drive stronger free cash flow supported by ongoing operational execution on the strategic inventory investments made earlier this year. As I step into my role as CFO, I am excited to join such a dynamic team and look forward to building on VSE's impressive track record. In the months ahead, I am committed to enhancing shareholder value as we continue to execute on our strategic priorities.\"\n\n**STRATEGIC UPDATE**\n\n**KELLSTROM AEROSPACE ACQUISITION:**\n\n  * On October 15, 2024, VSE announced it signed a definitive agreement to acquire Kellstrom Aerospace Group, Inc. (\"Kellstrom Aerospace\"), a leading full-service aftermarket solutions provider of value-added distribution and technical services for the commercial aerospace aftermarket. Kellstrom's portfolio of engine-focused products and MRO services, coupled with its technical advisory capabilities, expands VSE Aviation's portfolio of product and service solutions in the high-growth commercial aftermarket.\n  * Kellstrom generated approximately $175 million of revenue for the trailing-twelve-month period ended September 2024. The Company expects to generate run-rate synergies of approximately $4 million within 18 months of close. The total consideration for the acquisition is approximately $200 million, comprised of approximately $185 million in cash and approximately $15 million of common shares of the Company, subject to working capital adjustments. The acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024, pending customary closing conditions, including regulatory review.\n\n\n\n**AVIATION NEW PROGRAM EXECUTION AND INTEGRATION UPDATE:**\n\n  * The Aviation segment continues to scale the new European distribution Center of Excellence in Hamburg, Germany, supporting the Pratt & Whitney Canada Europe, Middle East and Africa (\"EMEA\") aftermarket product support program. The program is expected to be at a full year run-rate by the end of the fourth quarter of 2024.\n  * The OEM-licensed manufacturing fuel control program continues to outpace expectations and contribute to the segment's profitability. The Kansas facility expansion supporting the fuel control program is expected to be operational in the first quarter of 2025.\n  * The integration of Desser Aerospace's U.S. distribution business was completed in the third quarter of 2024. Desser Aerospace's tire, tube, brake and battery product lines are now being sold under the VSE Aviation name, and tires are now being sold in Europe through the Company's new distribution facility in Hamburg, Germany.\n  * VSE Aviation's new e-commerce site was successfully launched in the third quarter of 2024, focused on initial offerings including legacy Desser Aerospace products.\n\n\n\n**FLEET UPDATE:**\n\n  * The USPS transition to a new Fleet Management Information System (\"FMIS\") platform was completed in the third quarter of 2024. Post-implementation, the Company expects an increase in repair activity, and subsequently, an increase in the usage of parts.\n  * The e-commerce fulfillment distribution center continues to scale and support above-market growth and additional market share opportunities.\n  * The Fleet segment strategic review remains in process, and the Company expects to provide an update in the coming months.\n\n\n\n**CORPORATE UPDATE:**\n\n  * In October 2024, VSE completed a follow-on equity offering of 1,982,757 shares of common stock at $87.00 per share, resulting in net cash proceeds of approximately $163.8 million.\n  * The net proceeds from the offering will be used to finance a portion of the Kellstrom Aerospace acquisition.\n\n\n\n**THIRD QUARTER SEGMENT RESULTS**\n\n**Aviation** segment revenue increased 34% year-over-year to a record $203.6 million in the third quarter of 2024. The year-over-year revenue improvement was attributable to strong program execution of new and existing distribution awards, an expanded portfolio of MRO capabilities, and contributions from the TCI acquisition. Aviation distribution and MRO revenue increased 12% and 86%, respectively, in the third quarter of 2024, versus the prior-year period. The Aviation segment reported operating income of $25.4 million in the third quarter, compared to $21.0 million in the same period of 2023. Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased by 29% in the third quarter to $32.6 million, versus $25.3 million in the prior-year period. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 16.0%, a decline of approximately 60 basis points versus the prior-year period, driven by lower margin contributions from the TCI acquisition.\n\n**Fleet** segment revenue decreased 11% year-over-year to $70.0 million in the third quarter of 2024. Revenue from the USPS declined approximately 40% on a year-over-year basis. This revenue decline was primarily driven by USPS' transition to a new Fleet Management Information System (\"FMIS\") platform, which has resulted in a temporary reduction in maintenance related activities and reduced part requirements. The FMIS conversion was completed in the third quarter of 2024, supporting a modest recovery beginning in the fourth quarter of 2024. Revenue from commercial customers increased 20% on a year-over-year basis, driven by growth in e-commerce fulfillment and commercial fleet sales. Commercial, or non-USPS, revenue represented 64% of total Fleet segment revenue in the period. The Fleet segment reported operating income of $2.5 million in the third quarter, compared to $8.5 million in the same period of 2023. Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 59% year-over-year to $3.8 million, and Adjusted EBITDA margin declined approximately 620 basis points to 5.4%, primarily driven by the decline in USPS revenue.\n\n**FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had $189 million in cash and unused commitment availability under its $350 million revolving credit facility maturing in 2026. The Company generated approximately $4 million of free cash flow in the third quarter of 2024. As of September 30, 2024, VSE had a total net debt outstanding of $442 million. Adjusted net leverage was approximately 3.3 times trailing-twelve-month Adjusted EBITDA as of the end of the third quarter.\n\n**GUIDANCE**\n\nVSE is increasing its full-year 2024 revenue growth and maintaining Adjusted EBITDA margin percentage guidance for its Aviation segment. The guidance is as follows:\n\n  * Aviation segment full-year 2024 revenue guidance is increasing from 34% to 38% growth to 39% to 41%, as compared to the prior year revenue. Revenue contributions from the Kellstrom acquisition, which is expected to close in the in the fourth quarter of 2024, are not included in our updated guidance.\n  * Aviation segment maintains full-year 2024 Adjusted EBITDA margin guidance of 15.5% to 16.5%.\n\n\n\nVSE is revising its full-year 2024 revenue and maintaining Adjusted EBITDA margin guidance for its Fleet segment. The guidance is as follows:\n\n  * Fleet segment full-year 2024 revenue guidance is decreasing from 0% to 5% to (5)% to (10)%, as compared to the prior year revenue.\n  * Fleet segment maintains full-year 2024 Adjusted EBITDA margin guidance of 6% to 8%.\n\n\n\n**THIRD QUARTER RESULTS**\n\nThree months ended September 30, |  Nine months ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n_(in thousands, except per share data)_ |  2024 |  2023 |  % Change |  2024 |  2023 |  % Change  \nRevenues |  $ |  273,613 |  $ |  231,353 |  18.3 |  % |  $ |  781,111 |  $ |  625,163 |  24.9 |  %  \nOperating income |  $ |  23,698 |  $ |  25,264 |  (6.2 |  )% |  $ |  54,004 |  $ |  62,677 |  (13.8 |  )%  \nNet income from continuing operations |  $ |  11,650 |  $ |  12,111 |  (3.8 |  )% |  $ |  20,973 |  $ |  30,318 |  (30.8 |  )%  \nEPS (Diluted) |  $ |  0.63 |  $ |  0.80 |  (21.3 |  )% |  $ |  1.22 |  $ |  2.22 |  (45.0 |  )%  \n  \n**THIRD QUARTER SEGMENT RESULTS**\n\nThe following is a summary of revenues and operating income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023:\n\nThree months ended September 30, |  Nine months ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n_(in thousands)_ |  2024 |  2023 |  % Change |  2024 |  2023 |  % Change  \nRevenues:  \nAviation |  $ |  203,642 |  $ |  152,355 |  33.7 |  % |  $ |  558,853 |  $ |  390,319 |  43.2 |  %  \nFleet |  69,971 |  78,998 |  (11.4 |  )% |  222,258 |  234,844 |  (5.4 |  )%  \nTotal revenues |  $ |  273,613 |  $ |  231,353 |  18.3 |  % |  $ |  781,111 |  $ |  625,163 |  24.9 |  %  \nOperating income:  \nAviation |  $ |  25,435 |  $ |  20,951 |  21.4 |  % |  $ |  72,214 |  $ |  52,397 |  37.8 |  %  \nFleet |  2,471 |  8,531 |  (71.0 |  )% |  11,299 |  22,284 |  (49.3 |  )%  \nCorporate/unallocated expenses |  (4,208 |  ) |  (4,218 |  ) |  (0.2 |  )% |  (29,509 |  ) |  (12,004 |  ) |  145.8 |  %  \nOperating income |  $ |  23,698 |  $ |  25,264 |  (6.2 |  )% |  $ |  54,004 |  $ |  62,677 |  (13.8 |  )%  \n  \nThe Company reported $5.8 million and $17.4 million of total capital expenditures for three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.\n\n**NON-GAAP MEASURES**\n\nIn addition to the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), this earnings release also contains Non-GAAP financial measures.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Adjusted EBITDA for the most recent twelve (12) month period. (2) TTM Acquisition Adjusted EBITDA includes Turbine Controls EBITDA for the trailing twelve months that are not included in historical results.  \n  \nThe non-GAAP Financial Information set forth in this document is not calculated in accordance with GAAP under SEC Regulation G. We consider Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS (Diluted), EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Acquisition Adjusted EBITDA, net debt, adjusted net leverage ratio and free cash flow as non-GAAP financial measures and important indicators of performance and useful metrics for management and investors to evaluate our business' ongoing operating performance on a consistent basis across reporting periods. These non-GAAP financial measures, however, should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted Net Income represents Net Income adjusted for acquisition-related costs, other discrete items, and related tax impact. Adjusted EPS (Diluted) is computed by dividing net income, adjusted for the discrete items as identified above and the related tax impacts, by the diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding. EBITDA represents net income before interest expense, income taxes, amortization of intangible assets and depreciation and other amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA (as defined above) adjusted for discrete items as identified above. Acquisition Adjusted EBITDA represents Adjusted EBITDA plus the pre-acquisition portion of EBITDA for the trailing twelve months. Net debt is defined as principal amount of debt less debt issuance costs and less cash and cash equivalents. Free cash flow represents operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Adjusted net leverage ratio is calculated as net debt divided by trailing twelve month Acquisition Adjusted EBITDA.\n\nThe Company has presented forward-looking statements regarding Adjusted EBITDA margin. This non-GAAP financial measure is derived by excluding certain amounts, expenses or income, from the corresponding financial measure determined in accordance with GAAP. The determination of the amounts that are excluded from this non-GAAP financial measure is a matter of management judgment and depends upon, among other factors, the nature of the underlying expense or income amounts recognized in a given period in reliance on the exception provided by item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K. We are unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA margin to its most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measure because such information is not available, and management cannot reliably predict all of the necessary components of such GAAP measure without unreasonable effort or expense. In addition, we believe such reconciliation would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to investors. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on the company's future financial results. This non-GAAP financial measure is a preliminary estimate and is subject to risks and uncertainties, including, among others, changes in connection with quarter-end and year-end adjustments. Any variation between the company's actual results and preliminary financial data set forth above may be material.\n\n**CONFERENCE CALL**\n\nA conference call will be held Wednesday, November 6, 2024 at 8:30 A.M.

See additional information at the end of this release regarding non-GAAP financial measures  \n  \n**MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY**\n\n\"We are very pleased to announce our third quarter 2024 results, marked by the strongest quarterly performance in our Aviation segment's history, achieving a revenue milestone of over $200 million,\" stated John Cuomo, President and CEO of VSE Corporation. \"The 34% year-over-year revenue growth, combined with record profitability, reflects balanced contributions across our Aviation business units. The key drivers to our growth include the successful execution of new distribution awards, the expansion of our maintenance, repair, and overhaul (\"MRO\") capabilities, the launch of our new OEM-licensed manufacturing program, and contributions from our recent acquisition of Turbine Controls (\"TCI\").\"\n\nMr. Cuomo continued, \"Additionally, during the quarter, we completed the integration of Desser Aerospace's U.S. distribution business, launched a new Aviation e-commerce platform, made substantial progress in establishing our OEM-licensed manufacturing capabilities, and began distributing new products through our European Distribution Center of Excellence in Hamburg, Germany. The Aviation segment continues to perform successfully during a year of repositioning and focused execution.\n\n\"In our Fleet segment, we continue to advance our customer diversification strategy, with our commercial customers representing 64% of segment revenue as of the third quarter. Following a temporary reduction in activity with the United States Postal Service (\"USPS\") due to their system integration, activity levels have stabilized at the quarter's end, positioning us for improved revenue and profitability in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter,\" Mr. Cuomo concluded.\n\n\"Our third quarter 2024 results reflect our commitment to financial discipline,\" stated Adam Cohn, Chief Financial Officer of VSE Corporation. \"During the quarter, we generated positive free cash flow, reduced our debt, and maintained an adjusted net leverage ratio within our target range of 3.0 to 3.5 times. Following our successful October 2024 equity offering, the Company has ample financial liquidity and flexibility to complete the acquisition of Kellstrom Aerospace in the fourth quarter and capitalize on the significant growth opportunities that lie ahead. As we look out to the fourth quarter, we expect to drive stronger free cash flow supported by ongoing operational execution on the strategic inventory investments made earlier this year. As I step into my role as CFO, I am excited to join such a dynamic team and look forward to building on VSE's impressive track record. In the months ahead, I am committed to enhancing shareholder value as we continue to execute on our strategic priorities.\"\n\n**STRATEGIC UPDATE**\n\n**KELLSTROM AEROSPACE ACQUISITION:**\n\n  * On October 15, 2024, VSE announced it signed a definitive agreement to acquire Kellstrom Aerospace Group, Inc. (\"Kellstrom Aerospace\"), a leading full-service aftermarket solutions provider of value-added distribution and technical services for the commercial aerospace aftermarket. Kellstrom's portfolio of engine-focused products and MRO services, coupled with its technical advisory capabilities, expands VSE Aviation's portfolio of product and service solutions in the high-growth commercial aftermarket.\n  * Kellstrom generated approximately $175 million of revenue for the trailing-twelve-month period ended September 2024. The Company expects to generate run-rate synergies of approximately $4 million within 18 months of close. The total consideration for the acquisition is approximately $200 million, comprised of approximately $185 million in cash and approximately $15 million of common shares of the Company, subject to working capital adjustments. The acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024, pending customary closing conditions, including regulatory review.\n\n\n\n**AVIATION NEW PROGRAM EXECUTION AND INTEGRATION UPDATE:**\n\n  * The Aviation segment continues to scale the new European distribution Center of Excellence in Hamburg, Germany, supporting the Pratt & Whitney Canada Europe, Middle East and Africa (\"EMEA\") aftermarket product support program. The program is expected to be at a full year run-rate by the end of the fourth quarter of 2024.\n  * The OEM-licensed manufacturing fuel control program continues to outpace expectations and contribute to the segment's profitability. The Kansas facility expansion supporting the fuel control program is expected to be operational in the first quarter of 2025.\n  * The integration of Desser Aerospace's U.S. distribution business was completed in the third quarter of 2024. Desser Aerospace's tire, tube, brake and battery product lines are now being sold under the VSE Aviation name, and tires are now being sold in Europe through the Company's new distribution facility in Hamburg, Germany.\n  * VSE Aviation's new e-commerce site was successfully launched in the third quarter of 2024, focused on initial offerings including legacy Desser Aerospace products.\n\n\n\n**FLEET UPDATE:**\n\n  * The USPS transition to a new Fleet Management Information System (\"FMIS\") platform was completed in the third quarter of 2024. Post-implementation, the Company expects an increase in repair activity, and subsequently, an increase in the usage of parts.\n  * The e-commerce fulfillment distribution center continues to scale and support above-market growth and additional market share opportunities.\n  * The Fleet segment strategic review remains in process, and the Company expects to provide an update in the coming months.\n\n\n\n**CORPORATE UPDATE:**\n\n  * In October 2024, VSE completed a follow-on equity offering of 1,982,757 shares of common stock at $87.00 per share, resulting in net cash proceeds of approximately $163.8 million.\n  * The net proceeds from the offering will be used to finance a portion of the Kellstrom Aerospace acquisition.\n\n\n\n**THIRD QUARTER SEGMENT RESULTS**\n\n**Aviation** segment revenue increased 34% year-over-year to a record $203.6 million in the third quarter of 2024. The year-over-year revenue improvement was attributable to strong program execution of new and existing distribution awards, an expanded portfolio of MRO capabilities, and contributions from the TCI acquisition. Aviation distribution and MRO revenue increased 12% and 86%, respectively, in the third quarter of 2024, versus the prior-year period. The Aviation segment reported operating income of $25.4 million in the third quarter, compared to $21.0 million in the same period of 2023. Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased by 29% in the third quarter to $32.6 million, versus $25.3 million in the prior-year period. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 16.0%, a decline of approximately 60 basis points versus the prior-year period, driven by lower margin contributions from the TCI acquisition.\n\n**Fleet** segment revenue decreased 11% year-over-year to $70.0 million in the third quarter of 2024. Revenue from the USPS declined approximately 40% on a year-over-year basis. This revenue decline was primarily driven by USPS' transition to a new Fleet Management Information System (\"FMIS\") platform, which has resulted in a temporary reduction in maintenance related activities and reduced part requirements. The FMIS conversion was completed in the third quarter of 2024, supporting a modest recovery beginning in the fourth quarter of 2024. Revenue from commercial customers increased 20% on a year-over-year basis, driven by growth in e-commerce fulfillment and commercial fleet sales. Commercial, or non-USPS, revenue represented 64% of total Fleet segment revenue in the period. The Fleet segment reported operating income of $2.5 million in the third quarter, compared to $8.5 million in the same period of 2023. Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 59% year-over-year to $3.8 million, and Adjusted EBITDA margin declined approximately 620 basis points to 5.4%, primarily driven by the decline in USPS revenue.\n\n**FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had $189 million in cash and unused commitment availability under its $350 million revolving credit facility maturing in 2026. The Company generated approximately $4 million of free cash flow in the third quarter of 2024. As of September 30, 2024, VSE had a total net debt outstanding of $442 million. Adjusted net leverage was approximately 3.3 times trailing-twelve-month Adjusted EBITDA as of the end of the third quarter.\n\n**GUIDANCE**\n\nVSE is increasing its full-year 2024 revenue growth and maintaining Adjusted EBITDA margin percentage guidance for its Aviation segment.

We consider Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS (Diluted), EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Acquisition Adjusted EBITDA, net debt, adjusted net leverage ratio and free cash flow as non-GAAP financial measures and important indicators of performance and useful metrics for management and investors to evaluate our business' ongoing operating performance on a consistent basis across reporting periods. These non-GAAP financial measures, however, should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted Net Income represents Net Income adjusted for acquisition-related costs, other discrete items, and related tax impact. Adjusted EPS (Diluted) is computed by dividing net income, adjusted for the discrete items as identified above and the related tax impacts, by the diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding. EBITDA represents net income before interest expense, income taxes, amortization of intangible assets and depreciation and other amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA (as defined above) adjusted for discrete items as identified above. Acquisition Adjusted EBITDA represents Adjusted EBITDA plus the pre-acquisition portion of EBITDA for the trailing twelve months. Net debt is defined as principal amount of debt less debt issuance costs and less cash and cash equivalents. Free cash flow represents operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Adjusted net leverage ratio is calculated as net debt divided by trailing twelve month Acquisition Adjusted EBITDA.\n\nThe Company has presented forward-looking statements regarding Adjusted EBITDA margin. This non-GAAP financial measure is derived by excluding certain amounts, expenses or income, from the corresponding financial measure determined in accordance with GAAP. The determination of the amounts that are excluded from this non-GAAP financial measure is a matter of management judgment and depends upon, among other factors, the nature of the underlying expense or income amounts recognized in a given period in reliance on the exception provided by item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K. We are unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA margin to its most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measure because such information is not available, and management cannot reliably predict all of the necessary components of such GAAP measure without unreasonable effort or expense. In addition, we believe such reconciliation would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to investors. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on the company's future financial results. This non-GAAP financial measure is a preliminary estimate and is subject to risks and uncertainties, including, among others, changes in connection with quarter-end and year-end adjustments. Any variation between the company's actual results and preliminary financial data set forth above may be material.\n\n**CONFERENCE CALL**\n\nA conference call will be held Wednesday, November 6, 2024 at 8:30 A.M.

          "content": "Third Quarter 2024\nResults Conference Call\nNovember 6, 2024\nvsecorp.com\nIntroduction\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis presentation contains statements that, to the extent they are not recitations of historical fact, constitute \"forward looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities\nAct of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. All such statements are intended to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking\nstatements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and includes this statement for purposes of such safe harbor provisions. “Forward-looking” statements, as such\nterm is defined by the SEC in its rules, regulations and releases, represent VSE Corporation’s (the “Company”) expectations or beliefs, including, but not limited to, statements concerning its\noperations, economic performance, financial condition, growth and acquisition strategies, investments and future operational plans. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, words\nsuch as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “forecast,” “seek,” “plan,” “predict,” “project,” “could,” “estimate,” “might,” “continue,” “seeking” or the negative or other\nvariations thereof or comparable terminology are intended to identify forward-looking statements.\nThese statements speak only as of the date of this presentation and the Company undertakes no ongoing obligation, other than that imposed by law, to update these statements. These\nstatements appear in a number of places in this presentation, and relate to, among other things, the Company’s intent, belief or current expectations with respect to: its future financial\ncondition, results of operations or prospects; our business and growth strategies; and our financing plans and forecasts. You are cautioned that any such forward-looking statements are not\nguarantees of future performance and involve significant risks and uncertainties, and that actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by the forward-looking\nstatements as a result of various factors, some of which are unknown, including, without limitation the factors identified in the Company’s reports filed with the SEC including its Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this document also contains Non-GAAP financial measures. We consider\nAdjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS (Diluted), EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Acquisition Adjusted EBITDA, trailing-twelve month Adjusted EBITDA, net debt, adjusted net leverage, and free cash\nflow (FCF) as non-GAAP financial measures and important indicators of performance and useful metrics for management and investors to evaluate our business’s ongoing operating\nperformance on a consistent basis across reporting periods. Adjusted Net Income represents Net Income adjusted for discrete items. Adjusted EPS (Diluted) is computed by dividing net\nincome, adjusted for the discrete items and the related tax impacts, by the diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding. EBITDA represents net income before interest\nexpense, income taxes, amortization of intangible assets and depreciation and other amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted for discrete items. Acquisition Adjusted\nEBITDA represents Adjusted EBITDA plus Turbine Controls EBITDA for the trailing twelve months. Net debt is defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents. Free cash flow\nrepresents operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Net leverage ratio is calculated as net debt divided by trailing twelve month Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted Net leverage ratio is\ncalculated as net debtdivided by trailing twelve month Acquisition Adjusted EBITDA. The reasons why we believe these measures provide useful information to investors and a reconciliation\nof these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and other information relating to these Non-GAAP measures are included in the supplemental schedules attached.\nThe Company has presented forward-looking statements regarding Adjusted EBITDA margin. This non-GAAP financial measure is derived by excluding certain amounts, expenses or\nincome, from the corresponding financial measure determined in accordance with GAAP. The determination of the amounts that are excluded from this non-GAAP financial measure is a\nmatter of management judgment and depends upon, among other factors, the nature of the underlying expense or income amounts recognized in a given period in reliance on the exception\nprovided by item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K. We are unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA margin to its most directly comparable forward-\nlooking GAAP financial measure because such information is not available, and management cannot reliably predict all of the necessary components of such GAAP measure without\nunreasonable effort or expense. In addition, we believe such reconciliation would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to investors. The unavailable information\ncould have a significant impact on the company's future financial results. This non-GAAP financial measure is a preliminary estimate and is subject to risks and uncertainties, including,\namong others, changes in connection with quarter-end and year-end adjustments. Any variation between the company's actual results and preliminary financial data set forth above may be\nmaterial.\nvsecorp.com\nPg.2\nVSE Corporation\nStrategic Update: A Year of Repositioning and

See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\nResults of Operations” for more information regarding our business.\nMarketing\nOur marketing activities are conducted separately by each of our two business segments by industry-specific sales\nrepresentatives and professional marketing and business development staff. New customer contacts and information concerning\nnew parts or programs, requirements and opportunities become available through sales calls and client visits, negotiation with\nkey customer and supplier business partners, and formal and informal briefings. We participate in various professional\norganizations and trade associations, and attend global industry trade shows and events in order to increase our brand awareness\nand strengthen our service offerings.\nHuman Capital Resources\nWorkforce Demographics\nOur employees have a variety of specialized experience, training and skills that provide the expertise required to service our\ncustomers. As of December 31, 2023, we employed approximately 1,200 employees. Principal employee categories include (a)\nmechanics and vehicle, aircraft and equipment technicians, (b) logisticians, (c) finance, information technology, and human\nresources support personnel, (d) warehouse and sales personnel, and (e) engineers.\nEmployee Health and Safety\nWe are committed to providing a safe working environment for our employees. Supported by a Health, Environmental and\nSafety Program, we strive to minimize the risk of injury or illness to workers. We provide our employees with upfront and\ncontinuing safety training to communicate and implement safety policies and procedures. We also provide our employees with\nany additional information, leadership, support and equipment needed to safely perform their job function.\nTalent Acquisition, Retention and Development\nWe strive to attract and retain top talent at all levels of the company. To support this objective, we seek to provide opportunities\nfor professional development and career growth to recognize and reward our employees for their contributions and\naccomplishments.\nWe encourage employees to provide feedback about their experience and we regularly conduct employee engagement surveys\nto gauge employee satisfaction and to understand the effectiveness of engaging our employees on all levels. These surveys\nprovide valuable information on drivers of engagement and areas of improvement to help us maintain an employee-focused\nexperience and culture. We also host quarterly town hall meetings to provide an open and frequent line of communication for\nall employees.\nCompany culture is a priority. We model our values and focus on reinforcing these through employee recognition. Our people\nand teams remain a key market differentiator for our business. Developing internal talent and sourcing for new talent that fits\nour culture is a key part of our strategy.\n-6-\nTable of Contents\nWe offer competitive compensation and comprehensive benefits to attract, reward and retain a qualified and diverse workforce\nto achieve our vision and mission and meet the dynamic needs of employees and their families. In addition to competitive base\npay, we offer bonus opportunities, a Company matched 401(k) plan, an employee stock purchase plan, healthcare insurance\nbenefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, holiday pay, flexible work schedules, education\nreimbursement, and employee assistance programs.\nInclusion and Diversity\nWe embrace and encourage inclusion and strive to build a culture and company environment supporting inclusion and diversity.\nOur inclusion and diversity initiatives include our practices and policies on employee recruitment and hiring, professional\ntraining and development, employee engagement and the development of a work environment built on the premise of diversity\nand equity. In 2020, we formed the VSE Inclusion & Diversity Council (\"I&D Council\"), a leader-led group focused on\ncreating a framework and action plan for inclusion and diversity related initiatives across the organization. Our I&D Council\nregularly hosts roundtable discussions aimed at increasing cultural awareness and promoting dialogue to encourage a culture\nthat values inclusive behavior in our workplace.\nWe also support employee resource groups, which are voluntary, employee-led groups that are open to all employees and\nprovide a forum for diverse employees and allies from a variety of backgrounds to share experiences and support our company's\ndiversity initiatives. We firmly believe in the power of our employee resource groups, which include Women in the Workforce,\nPride, Latinos Unidos, and Veterans, to foster diversity and inclusivity in our workplace. These groups serve as platforms for\nemployees from different backgrounds to connect, share experiences, and advocate for continuous improvement within our\norganization. We actively seek initiatives and participate in outreach programs to assist individuals who served in the U.S.\nArmed Forces. These efforts include an emphasis on hiring military veterans to enhance the quality of our workforce. In our\ncontinuous pursuit of creating a more inclusive and diverse workplace, we recently launched an inclusion and diversity training\nprogram. The goal of this initiative is to increase awareness and promote cultural sensitivity among our employees.\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics\nWe are committed to the highest ethical standards, and we expect all of our directors, officers and employees to comply with\nour standards and applicable laws and regulations in the conduct of our business. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the\n\"Code\") sets forth our policies and expectations on what is appropriate behavior and guides ethical business decisions that\nmaintain a commitment to integrity. In addition, we require annual ethics and compliance training for our employees to provide\nthem with the knowledge necessary to maintain our standards of ethics and compliance.\nRegulation and Supervision\nOur businesses are subject to extensive regulation in the markets we serve. We work with numerous U.S. government agencies\nand entities, including but not limited to, the Federal Aviation Administration (\"FAA\"), the United States Postal Service\n(\"USPS\"), and the Department of Defense (\"DoD\"). Similar government authorities and regulations exist in the other countries\nin which we do business.\nCommercial Aircraft\nThe FAA regulates the manufacture, repair and operation of all aircraft and aircraft parts operated in the United States. Its\nregulations are designed to ensure that all aircraft and aviation equipment are continuously maintained in proper condition to\nensure safe operation of the aircraft. The inspection, maintenance, and repair procedures for various types of aircraft and\nequipment are prescribed by these regulatory authorities and can be performed only at certified repair facilities utilizing\ncertified technicians. Certification and conformance are required prior to installation of a part on an aircraft. The FAA requires\nthat various maintenance routines be performed on aircraft components, and we currently satisfy these maintenance standards in\nour MRO services.\nFor additional information on regulations and risks affecting our business, refer to Item 1A., \"Risk Factors\".\nCompetition\nOur businesses operate in highly competitive industries that include numerous competitors, many of which are larger in size\nand have greater name recognition, financial resources, and larger technical staff than we do. We also compete against smaller,\nmore specialized competitors that concentrate their resources on narrower service offerings.\n-7-\nTable of Contents\nThe extent of competition that we will encounter because of changing economic or competitive conditions, customer\nrequirements or technological developments is unpredictable. We believe the principal competitive factors for our business are\ncustomer knowledge, product availability, technical and financial qualifications, past performance, repair turnaround time,\ngovernment budgetary priorities, sales force initiatives and price.\nAvailable Information\nWe maintain an internet website at www.vsecorp.com. We make available free of charge through our website, our Annual\nReports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed\nwith or otherwise furnished to the SEC pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably\npracticable after the reports are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. The information on or obtainable through our\nwebsite is not intended to be incorporated into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The SEC also maintains an internet website\n(http://www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file\nelectronically with the SEC.\n-8-\nTable of Contents\nITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nOur future results may differ materially from past results and from those projected in the forward-looking statements contained\nin this Form 10-K due to various uncertainties and risks, including those risks set forth below, nonrecurring events and other\nimportant factors disclosed previously and from time to time in our other reports filed with the SEC.\nOperational Risks\nWe face various risks related to health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks, which could adversely affect our\nbusiness.\nWe face a wide variety of risks related to health epidemics, pandemics, and similar outbreaks. These events have adversely\naffected, and may continue to adversely affect, our operations, supply chains and distribution systems. Public health crises pose\na risk that we or our employees, customers, suppliers, manufacturers, and other partners may be prevented from conducting\nbusiness activities for an indefinite period of time, including due to the spread of the disease or shutdowns requested or\nmandated by governmental authorities.\nThe extent to which public health crises may have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition and\nresults of operations will depend on many factors that are not within our control, including but not limited to the path and effect\nof epidemics, pandemics, crises or public health concerns, including factors like new variants, vaccinations, potential supply\nchain disruptions, and inflation, which can impact our key markets.\nSupply chain delays, disruptions, and potential geopolitical uncertainty could adversely affect our business operations and\nexpenses.\nDue to current economic and geopolitical uncertainty and supply chain disruptions, our business could be adversely impacted\nby delays or the inability to source products and services for our customers. If our suppliers experience increased disruptions to\ntheir operations as a result of these dynamics, they may be unable to fill our supply needs in a timely, compliant and cost-\neffective manner. We have incurred and may in the future incur additional costs and delays in our business, including higher\nprices, schedule delays or the costs associated with identifying alternative suppliers. In instances where we may not be able to\nmitigate these consequences, our ability to perform on our contracts may be impacted, which could result in reduced revenues\nand profits.\nCertain customers comprise a material portion of our revenue. Our work on large government fleets present a risk to\nrevenue growth and sustainability and profit margins.\nThe loss of or disruption of revenues on a single customer may reduce our revenues and profits. Our USPS managed inventory\nprogram constitutes a material portion of our revenues and profits. This concentration of our revenue subjects us to the risk of\nmaterial adverse revenue disruptions if customer operational decisions, government contract matters, or other issues prevent or\ndelay the fulfillment of work requirements associated with these key customer fleets. Variations in volume and types of parts\npurchased by the USPS in recent years have caused changes in our profit margins. The USPS has initiated a fleet replacement\nprogram for the next generation of the delivery vehicle fleet. The timing of the new vehicle deployment and the retirement of\nexisting vehicles could potentially have a significant impact on our future revenues and profits.\nAcquisitions, which are a part of our business strategy, present certain risks.\nA key element of our business strategy is growth through the acquisition of additional companies. We are focused on acquiring\ncomplementary assets that add new products, new customers, and new capabilities or new geographic and/or operational\ncompetitive advantages in both new and existing markets within our core competencies. Our acquisition strategy is affected by,\nand poses a number of challenges and risks, including the availability of suitable acquisition candidates, availability of capital,\ndiversion of management’s attention, effective integration of the operations and personnel of acquired companies, potential\nwrite downs of acquired intangible assets, potential loss of key employees of acquired companies, use of a significant portion of\nour available cash, compliance with debt covenants and consummation of acquisitions on satisfactory terms.\nWe may not be able to successfully execute our acquisition strategy, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n-9-\nTable of Contents\nCircumstances associated with divestitures could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nWe may periodically divest or seek to divest certain businesses, including remaining assets in our former Federal and Defense\nsegment that are no longer a part of our ongoing strategic plan and are held for sale. A decision to divest or discontinue assets,\nbusinesses, or product lines may result in asset impairments, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, and\nlosses upon disposition, both of which could have adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition. In\naddition, we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or executing alternative exit strategies at acceptable prices and terms in\na timely manner and prospective buyers may have difficulty obtaining financing. These divestitures may require a significant\ninvestment of time and resources and may disrupt our business, distract management from other responsibilities, and may\ninvolve the retention of certain current or future liabilities in order to induce a buyer to complete a divestiture or may otherwise\nresult in losses on disposal or continued financial involvement in the divested business, including through indemnification or\nother arrangements, for a period of time following the transaction, which could adversely affect our financial results. We may\nnot be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that we may encounter in divesting or discontinuing a\nbusiness or product line, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nChanges in future business conditions could cause business investments, recorded goodwill, and/or purchased intangible\nassets to become impaired, resulting in substantial losses and write-downs that would reduce our operating income.\nAs part of our business strategy, we make acquisitions and investments following careful analysis and due diligence processes\ndesigned to achieve a desired return or strategic objective. Business acquisitions involve estimates, assumptions, and judgments\nto determine acquisition prices, which are allocated among acquired assets, including goodwill, based upon fair market values.\nNotwithstanding our analyses, due diligence processes, and business integration efforts, actual operating results of acquired\nbusinesses may vary significantly from initial estimates. In such events, we may be required to write down our carrying value of\nthe related goodwill and/or purchased intangible assets. In addition, declines in the trading price of our common stock or the\nmarket as a whole can result in goodwill and/or purchased intangible asset impairment charges associated with our existing\nbusinesses.\nAs of December 31, 2023, goodwill and intangible assets, net of amortization, accounted for 28% and 9%, respectively, of our\ntotal assets (excluding assets held for sale). We test our goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or when\nevidence of potential impairment exists. We test acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate their carrying value may be impaired. The impairment tests are based on several factors requiring\njudgments. As a general matter, a significant decrease in expected cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicate\npotential impairment of recorded goodwill or intangible assets.\nAdverse equity market conditions that result in a decline in market multiples and the trading price of our common stock, or\nother events, such as reductions in future contract awards or significant adverse changes in our operating margins or the\noperating results of acquired businesses that vary significantly from projected results on which purchase prices are based, could\nresult in an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets. Any such impairments that result in us recording goodwill or\nintangible asset impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nCompetition from existing and new competitors may harm our business.\nThe aviation and vehicle parts industries are highly fragmented, have several highly visible leading companies, and are\ncharacterized by intense competition. Some of our original equipment manufacturer (\"OEM\") competitors have greater name\nrecognition than VSE or our subsidiaries, as well as complementary lines of business and financial, marketing and other\nresources that we do not have. In addition, OEMs, aircraft maintenance providers, leasing companies and U.S. Federal Aviation\nAdministration (\"FAA\") certificated repair facilities may attempt to bundle their services and product offerings in the supply\nindustry, thereby significantly increasing industry competition.\nOur success is highly dependent on the performance of the aviation aftermarket, which could be impacted by lower demand\nfor business aviation and commercial air travel or airline fleet changes causing lower demand for our goods and services.\nGeneral global industry and economic conditions that affect the aviation industry may also affect our business. We are subject\nto macroeconomic cycles, and when recessions occur, we may experience reduced orders, payment delays, supply chain\ndisruptions or other factors as a result of the economic challenges faced by our customers, prospective customers and suppliers.\nFurther, the aviation industry has historically, from time to time, been subject to downward cycles which reduce the overall\ndemand for jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts and repair and overhaul services, and such downward cycles\n-10-\nTable of Contents\nresult in lower sales and greater credit risk. Demand for commercial air travel can be influenced by airline industry profitability,\nworld trade policies, government-to-government relations, terrorism, disease outbreaks, environmental constraints imposed\nupon aircraft operations, technological changes, price, and other competitive factors. These global industry and economic\nconditions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nGlobal economic conditions and political factors could adversely affect our revenues.\nRevenues for work performed in or products delivered to foreign countries are subject to economic conditions in these countries\nand to political risks posed by ongoing foreign conflicts and potential terrorist activity. Significant domestic and political unrest\nin client countries can constrain our ability to maintain consistent staffing levels, resulting in a fluctuating level of services\nperformed by our employees. We cannot predict when these conditions will occur or the effect it will have on our revenues.\nRegime changes in these countries can result in government restrictions upon the continuation of ongoing work. Economic\nconditions in both the United States and foreign countries, and global prices and availability of oil and other commodities could\npotentially have an adverse effect on the demand for some of our services, including our aviation services.\nProlonged periods of inflation where we do not have adequate inflation protections in our customer contracts may adversely\naffect us by increasing costs beyond what we can recover through price increases.\nInflation can adversely affect us by increasing the costs of labor, material and other costs. In addition, inflation is often\naccompanied by higher interest rates, which increases the cost associated with our variable rate outstanding debt obligations and\ncould increase rates for any new debt obligations that we incur. In an inflationary environment, depending on economic\nconditions, we may be unable to raise prices enough to keep up with the rate of inflation, which would reduce our profit\nmargins. We have experienced, and continue to experience, increases in the prices of labor, materials, and other costs of\nproviding service. Continued inflationary pressures could impact our profitability.\nThe nature of our operations and work performed by our employees presents certain challenges related to workforce\nmanagement.\nOur financial performance is heavily dependent on the abilities of our operating and administrative staff with respect to\ntechnical skills, operating performance, pricing, cost management, safety, and administrative and compliance efforts. A wide\ndiversity of contract types, nature of work, work locations, and legal and regulatory complexities challenge our administrative\nstaff and skill sets. We also face challenges associated with our quality of workforce, quality of work, safety, and labor relations\ncompliance. Our current and projected work in foreign countries exposes us to challenges associated with export and ethics\ncompliance, local laws and customs, workforce issues, extended supply chain, political unrest, and war zone threats. Failure to\nattract or retain an adequately skilled workforce, lack of knowledge or training in critical functions, or inadequate staffing\nlevels, can result in lost work, reduced profit margins, losses from cost overruns, performance deficiencies, workplace\naccidents, and regulatory noncompliance.\nOur business could be adversely affected by incidents that could cause an interruption in our operations or impose a\nsignificant financial liability on us.\nDisruption of our operations due to internal or external system or service failures, accidents or incidents involving employees or\nthird parties working in high-risk locations, or other crises could adversely affect our financial performance and condition. A\nfire, flood, earthquake, other natural disaster, or other crisis at or affecting physical facilities, procurement systems, or\ncontractual deliveries could potentially interrupt the revenues from our operations.\nInvestments in inventory and facilities could cause losses if certain work is disrupted or discontinued.\nWe have made investments in inventory, facilities, and lease commitments to support specific business programs, work\nrequirements, and service offerings. A slowing or disruption of these business programs, work requirements, or service\nofferings that results in operating below intended levels could cause us to suffer financial losses.\nWe are dependent on access to and the performance of third-party package delivery companies.\nOur ability to provide efficient distribution of the products we sell to our customers is an integral component of our overall\nbusiness strategy, both domestic and international. We do not maintain our own delivery networks, and instead rely on\nthird-party package delivery companies. We cannot guarantee that we will always be able to ensure access to preferred shipping\nand delivery companies or that these companies will continue to meet our needs or provide reasonable pricing terms. In\n-11-\nTable of Contents\naddition, if the package delivery companies on which we rely on experience delays resulting from inclement weather or other\ndisruptions, we may be unable to maintain appropriate stock of inventory or deliver products to our customers on a timely basis,\nwhich may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nWe are subject to numerous government rules and regulations that could expose us to potential liabilities or work loss.\nThe aviation industry is highly regulated by the FAA and similar regulatory agencies in other countries. Aviation engines,\nengine accessories and components that we sell components and repair services for must meet certain airworthiness standards\nestablished by the FAA or the equivalent agencies in certain other countries. We also operate repair facilities that are licensed\nby the FAA and equivalent agencies of certain other countries to perform such services. New and more stringent regulations\nmay be adopted in the future that could have an adverse effect on us.\nLastly, border tariffs and new trade deals could have significant effects on our customers and, in turn, on our suppliers, which\nmay impact our business.\nDue to the nature of our work, we could potentially be exposed to legal actions arising from our operations.\nOur work includes many manual tasks, including warehousing, shipping, and packing of truck parts inventory, and maintaining\nand repairing aircraft components and equipment. Some of our work efforts involve the handling of hazardous materials. These\nservices may pose certain challenges that could cause us to be exposed to legal and other liabilities arising from performance\nissues, work related incidents or employee misconduct that result in damages, injury or death to third parties. Such events could\ncause us to suffer financial losses and adversely affect our financial condition. See Item 3, \"Legal Proceedings” below.\nEnvironmental and pollution risks could potentially impact our financial results.\nOur operations are subject to and affected by a variety of existing federal, state, and local environmental protection laws and\nregulations. In addition, we could be affected by future laws or regulations, including those imposed in response to concerns\nover climate change, other aspects of the environment, or natural resources. We expect to incur future capital and operating\ncosts to comply with current and future environmental laws and regulations, and such costs could be substantial, depending on\nthe future proliferation of environmental rules and regulations and the extent to which we discover currently unknown\nenvironmental conditions.\nSome of our contract work includes the use of chemical solvents and the handling of hazardous materials to maintain, repair,\nand refurbish vehicles, aircraft engines, and equipment. This exposes us to certain environmental and pollution risks. Various\nfederal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations impose restrictions on the discharge of pollutants into the\nenvironment and establish standards for the transportation, storage, and disposal of toxic and hazardous wastes. Substantial\nfines, penalties, and criminal sanctions may be imposed for noncompliance, and certain environmental laws impose joint and\nseveral \"strict liability\" for remediation of spills and releases of oil and hazardous substances. Such laws and regulations impose\nliability upon a party for environmental cleanup and remediation costs and damage without regard to negligence or fault on the\npart of such party and could expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by third parties.\nCosts associated with compliance with Federal, State, and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials or that\notherwise relate to the protection of the environment have not had a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures,\nearnings, or competitive position. However, we cannot predict the likelihood of such a material adverse effect should we\nexperience the occurrence of a future environmental or pollution event.\nThe adoption of new environmental laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, imposition of\nnew cleanup requirements, discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination, litigation involving\nenvironmental impacts, our inability to recover related costs under our government contracts, or the financial insolvency of\nother responsible parties could cause us to incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results\nof operations, or cash flows.\n-12-\nTable of Contents\nTechnology Risks\nTechnology and cybersecurity threats and risks could potentially impact our financial results.\nWe face cybersecurity risk related to our computer systems and data, which may include unauthorized access, acts by computer\nhackers, computer viruses, malicious code, organized cybersecurity attacks and other security problems and system disruptions,\nincluding possible unauthorized access to our and our customers' information. We also rely on third-parties to host certain\nenterprise systems and manage and host our data and that of our customers. Our ability to monitor such third parties’ security\nmeasures and the full impact of the systemic risk is limited. If our systems, data, or any third party service that we use is\nunavailable to us for any reason, our customers may experience service interruptions, which could significantly impact our\noperations, reputation, business, and financial results. Lack of access to our data and that of our clients, or failure of our systems\nor those of our third-party service providers, may result in interruptions in our service, all of which may cause a loss in\ncustomers, refunds of product fees, and/or material harm to our reputation and operating results.\nWe maintain a cybersecurity risk management program to monitor and mitigate cybersecurity threats and an incident response\nplan for emerging threats. To date, costs associated with preventing or remediating information management security breaches\nor complying with related laws and regulations have not had a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or\ncompetitive position. Additionally, we have obtained insurance that provides coverage for certain cybersecurity incidents.\nDespite these efforts, we can make no assurances that we will be able to mitigate, detect, prevent, timely and adequately\nrespond, or fully recover from the negative effects of cybersecurity incidents or other cybersecurity compromises, and such\ncybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction,\ncorruption, or unavailability of personal information, critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that\nof third parties) and the disruption of business operations. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident\ninclude financial loss, reputational damage, damage to our IT systems, data loss, litigation with third parties, theft of intellectual\nproperty, fines, customer attrition, diminution in the value of our investment in research and development, and increased\ncybersecurity protection and remediation costs due to the increasing sophistication and proliferation of threats, which in turn\ncould adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations. Any imposition of liability, particularly liability that is not\ncovered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage, could materially harm our operating results and financial condition.\nFinancial Risks\nThere can be no assurance we will continue to pay dividends at current levels or in the future.\nThe payment of cash dividends and repurchases of our common stock are subject to limitations under applicable law and our\ncredit agreement, and to the discretion of our board of directors, considered in the context of then current conditions, including\nour earnings, other operating results, and capital requirements. Declines in asset values or increases in liabilities, including\nliabilities associated with benefit plans and assets and liabilities associated with taxes, can reduce stockholders’ equity. A deficit\nin stockholders’ equity could limit our ability under Delaware law to pay dividends.\nOur debt exposes us to certain risks.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $429 million of total debt outstanding (net of unamortized debt issuance costs). The amount\nof our existing debt, combined with our ability to incur significant amounts of debt in the future, could have important\nconsequences, including:\n• Increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions;\n• Requiring us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the\navailability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, strategic initiatives, and general corporate\npurposes;\n• Increasing our vulnerability to, and limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or\nthe industries in which we operate;\n• Exposing us to the risk of higher interest rates on borrowings under our credit facility, which is subject to variable rates\nof interest;\n• Placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and\n• Limiting our ability to borrow additional funds.\n-13-\nTable of Contents\nMarket volatility and adverse capital market conditions may affect our ability to access cost-effective sources of funding and\nmay expose us to risks associated with the financial viability of suppliers.\nThe financial markets can experience high levels of volatility and disruption, reducing the availability of credit and other capital\nsources for certain issuers. We may access these markets from time to time to support certain business activities, including\nfunding acquisitions and refinancing existing indebtedness. We may also access these markets to acquire credit support for our\nletters of credit. A number of factors could cause us to incur higher borrowing costs, experience greater difficulty accessing\npublic and private markets for debt or prevent us from raising capital in the equity capital markets. These factors include\ndisruptions or declines in the global capital markets, a decline in our financial performance, outlook, or credit ratings and/or\nvolatility in the price of shares of our common stock due to our trading volume and public float. The occurrence of any or all of\nthese events may adversely affect our ability to fund our operations, meet contractual commitments, make future investments or\ndesirable acquisitions, or respond to competitive challenges.\nITEM 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nITEM 1C. Cybersecurity\nRisk Management and Strategy\nWe have an information security process integrated into our overall enterprise risk management (ERM) process that is designed\nto identify, assess, and manage material risks and threats from cybersecurity. To protect our information systems against\ncybersecurity threats, we employ a range of security processes designed to identify, prevent, detect, respond to, and recover\nfrom identified vulnerabilities and cybersecurity incidents in a timely manner. These include internal reporting mechanisms,\nmonitoring solutions, and detection tools. We also leverage the expertise and support of key cybersecurity third-party partners\nand tools. Our protective measures include technical and organizational safeguards, employee training, incident response\ncapability assessments, cybersecurity insurance, and business continuity mechanisms. We perform employee training as part of\nour information security processes for all employees. We regularly assess cybersecurity risks and technology threats, utilizing a\nqualitative risk model to identify, measure, and prioritize certain risks, and develop related security controls and safeguards.\nRisk assessments are conducted when we onboard certain new services and new vendors, including third-party vendors,\napplications, and other technology services, and when there are significant changes to IT or security architecture. Further, we\nmonitor key vendors to understand how such vendors manage cybersecurity risks and threats during the term of their provision\nservices or products to us.\nAs part of our cybersecurity incident response framework, our incident response team focuses on responding to, containing, and\nrecovering from a cybersecurity threat and minimizing any business impact. In the event of a cybersecurity incident, the\ncybersecurity team assesses, among other factors, data and personal information loss, business operations disruption, projected\ncost and potential for reputational harm, with support from business stakeholders and external technical, legal and law\nenforcement support.\nGovernance\nOur Board of Directors (\"Board\") and Audit Committee have oversight responsibility for cybersecurity risks and incidents,\nincluding compliance with disclosure requirements, collaboration with law enforcement, and related effects on financial and\nother risks. Findings and recommendations are reported, as deemed appropriate, to the Board. Senior management including our\nChief Information Security Officer (CISO) engages in regular discussions with the Board regarding cybersecurity risks, trends,\nand any material incidents that may arise. Furthermore, the Board receives briefings on cybersecurity matters from the CISO on\nour cybersecurity and information security.\nOur CISO has served in various roles in information technology and information security for over 20 years, with experience in\ntechnology risk management, cybersecurity, compliance, network engineering, information systems, and business resiliency. He\nis a Certified Information Systems Security Professional. Our CISO manages the Company's information security and oversees\nour data security personnel and our incident response and business continuity management programs to assess and manage the\ncybersecurity element of our risk management program, including policies, cybersecurity training, security operations and\n-14-\nTable of Contents\nengineering, cyber threat detection and incident response. Our CISO promptly informs and updates the Board about any\ninformation security incidents that may pose a significant risk to the Company.\nTo date, we have not identified any cybersecurity incidents that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially\naffect our business strategy, results of our operations, or financial condition. However, we have been the target of cybersecurity\nthreats and expect them to continue as cybersecurity threats have been rapidly evolving in sophistication and becoming more\nprevalent. We cannot provide assurance that they will not be materially affected in the future by such risks or any future\nmaterial incidents. For more information on our cybersecurity related risks, see Item 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K.\nITEM 2. Properties\nAs of December 31, 2023, we owned or leased building space (including offices, warehouses, shops, and other facilities) at 24\nlocations. Our major operations are at the following locations:\nAviation - Doral and Miramar, Florida; Independence and Augusta, Kansas; Hebron, Kentucky; Phoenix, Arizona; Montebello\nand San Bernardino, California; Memphis, Tennessee; Lydney and Southend-on-Sea, United Kingdom; and Norderstedt,\nGermany\nFleet - Somerset, Pennsylvania; Olive Branch, Mississippi; and Grand Prairie, Texas\nCorporate - Alexandria, Virginia\nThe following is a summary of the square footage our of floor space as of December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\nOwned Leased Total\nAviation Segment 91 598 689\nFleet Segment 271 572 843\nCorporate — 95 95\nTotal 362 1,265 1,627\nWe consider our facilities to be in good operating condition and sufficient to meet our operational needs for the foreseeable\nfuture.\nITEM 3. Legal Proceedings\nWe may have certain claims in the normal course of business, including legal proceedings against us and against other parties.\nIn our opinion, the resolution of these claims will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial\nposition or cash flows. However, because the results of any legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, the amount of\nloss, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated.\nFurther, from time-to-time, government agencies investigate whether our operations are being conducted in accordance with\napplicable contractual and regulatory requirements. Government investigations of us, whether relating to government contracts\nor conducted for other reasons, could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities, including repayments, fines or\npenalties being imposed upon us, or could lead to suspension or debarment from future government contracting. Government\ninvestigations often take years to complete and many result in no adverse action against us. We believe, based upon current\ninformation, that the outcome of any such government disputes and investigations will not have a material adverse effect on our\nresults of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nITEM 4.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated statements and related notes\nincluded in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following\ngenerally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and\nyear-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found under Item 7.\n\"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-\nK for fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, filed with the SEC on March 10, 2023.\nBusiness Overview\nWe are a leading provider of aftermarket distribution and maintenance, repair and overhaul (\"MRO\") services for air and land\ntransportation assets for commercial and government markets. Our operations are conducted within two reportable segments\naligned with our operating segments: Aviation and Fleet.\nRecent Developments\nSale of Federal and Defense Segment\nIn May 2023, we announced our decision to sell our Federal and Defense segment. As a result, we have reported the results of\noperations for the Federal and Defense segment as discontinued operations for all periods presented. See Note (3)\n\"Discontinued Operations\" to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nIn February 2024, we entered into two separate agreements to sell substantially all of the Federal and Defense segment assets.\nSee Note (18) \"Subsequent Events\" for further information.\nAcquisition of Turbine Controls, Inc.\nOn February 29, 2024, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire Turbine Controls, Inc. (\"TCI\"), a leading provider of\naftermarket MRO support services for complex engine components, as well as engine and airframe accessories, across\ncommercial and military applications. See Note (18) \"Subsequent Events\" for further information.\n2023 Acquisitions\nIn February 2023, we completed the acquisition of Precision Fuel Components, LLC (\"Precision Fuel\"), a provider of MRO\nservices for engine accessories and fuel systems supporting the business and general aviation (\"B&GA\") market.\nIn July 2023, we completed the acquisition of Desser Holding Company LLC (\"Desser Aerospace\"), a global aftermarket\nsolutions provider of specialty distribution and MRO services.\nIn September 2023, we entered into an Asset Purchase and License Agreement with Honeywell International Inc. to exclusively\nmanufacture, sell, market, distribute, and repair certain Honeywell fuel control systems (the \"Honeywell FCS Acquisition\").\nSee Note (2) \"Acquisitions\" to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nUnderwritten Public Offering\nIn July 2023, we initiated a public offering of the Company's common stock relating to the issuance and sale of 2,846,250\nshares at a public offering price of $48.50 per share. The offering closed in two transactions, and net proceeds of $129.1 million\nwere received by the Company, which were used to repay outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility and for\ngeneral corporate purposes. See Note (15) \"Capital Stock\" to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nBusiness Trends\nThe following discussion provides a brief description of some of the key business factors impacting our results of operations\ndetailed by segment.\n-19-\nTable of Contents\nAviation Segment\nOur Aviation segment has seen favorable results due to successful investments in growth initiatives, resulting in a 33% increase\nin annual revenue, totaling $544 million in 2023. The expansion of our distribution services was driven by strong execution of\nnew and existing programs. Our repair business experienced growth driven by increased market share in the commercial and\nB&GA sectors. These factors, combined with our growth initiatives, led to a 29% increase in distribution revenue and a 46%\nincrease in repair revenue in 2023 compared to the prior year. In 2023, we secured key multi-year distribution deals for both\ndomestic and new international markets, including an expansion of our flagship distribution agreement with Pratt & Whitney\nCanada supporting Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. These new distribution initiatives are expected to drive sustainable and\nrecurring revenue with growth opportunities, contributing to future positive results.\nInvestments in the Aviation segment are focused on businesses and programs that broaden our portfolio and reach new\ncustomers and geographies. The February 2023 acquisition of Precision Fuel expands our product offerings and customer base,\noffering strategic cross-selling opportunities and market share in niche B&GA related markets. The July 2023 acquisition of\nDesser Aerospace supports our tip-to-tail aircraft distribution and MRO services strategy and provides a platform for\ninternational expansion. The September 2023 Honeywell FCS Acquisition allows us to exclusively manufacture and support\ncertain of Honeywell's fuel control systems on four key engine platforms. The Aviation segment is expected to see continued\ngrowth due to progress on new initiatives and recent acquisitions, offering a favorable outlook for 2024.\nFleet Segment\nOur Fleet segment continues to see growth in revenue from commercial fleet customers and e-commerce fulfillment, as the\nsegment moves towards revenue diversification. Fleet is executing its revenue diversification strategy by acquiring new\ncustomers and expanding product options for the e-commerce fulfillment business. Commercial customer revenue continues to\nexperience strong growth, increasing 45% in 2023 compared to the prior year. We anticipate continued growth as we extend our\nreach to meet the increasing demand from the commercial market. In 2023, commercial revenues were 48% of total Fleet\nsegment revenue compared to 40% in 2022, demonstrating the continued success of our revenue diversification strategy. To\nsupport commercial revenue, Fleet opened a new distribution warehouse and e-commerce center of excellence in Olive Branch,\nMS (near Memphis, TN), in January 2023. The new facility, which is 450,000 square feet, enhances Fleet's geographical\ncoverage and product offerings for customers. The launch of this new location allowed Fleet to keep up with the growing\ndemand for e-commerce fulfillment. Additionally, we generated steady revenue from our support of the United States Postal\nServices (\"USPS\") delivery vehicle fleet through supplying parts and managing inventory, with revenue increasing 8% in 2023\ncompared to the prior year. We continue to monitor USPS vehicle procurement and are ready to support both new vehicles\nadded to the fleet and existing vehicles still in service. Our experience and understanding of the USPS' needs strategically\nposition us to remain a key partner. We are committed to remaining agile and supporting the USPS during its vehicle transition.\nWe expect continued growth within our commercial channels, coupled with stable contributions from the USPS.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations (in thousands):\nYears ended December 31,\n2023 2022 Change ($) Change (%)\nRevenues $ 860,488 $ 669,448 $ 191,040 29 %\nCosts and operating expenses 772,492 615,844 156,648 25 %\nOperating income 87,996 53,604 34,392 64 %\nInterest expense, net 31,083 17,893 13,190 74 %\nIncome from continuing operations before income taxes 56,913 35,711 21,202 59 %\nProvision for income taxes 13,761 9,052 4,709 52 %\nNet income from continuing operations $ 43,152 $ 26,659 $ 16,493 62 %\nRevenues. Revenues increased $191.0 million, or 29%, in 2023 compared to 2022 due to revenue growth in our Aviation\nsegment of $135.9 million and our Fleet segment of $55.1 million. See \"Segment Operating Results\" section below for further\ndiscussion of revenues by segment.\nCosts and Operating Expenses. Costs and operating expenses increased $156.6 million, or 25%, in 2023 compared to 2022.\nCosts and operating expenses for our operating segments increase and decrease in conjunction with the level of business\n-20-\nTable of Contents\nactivity and revenues generated by each segment. See \"Segment Operating Results\" section below for further discussion of\ncosts and operating expenses by segment.\nOperating Income. Operating income increased $34.4 million, or 64%, in 2023 compared to 2022 attributable to increases of\n$34.8 million for our Aviation segment and $7.3 million for our Fleet segment. See \"Segment Operating Results\" section below\nfor further discussion of operating income by segment. The operating income increase attributable to our segments was partially\noffset by an increase in corporate costs, including acquisition and integration costs incurred during the current period.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased approximately $13.2 million, or 74% in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to\nan increase in our debt facility borrowings and higher average interest rates on borrowings outstanding.\nProvision for Income Taxes. The effective tax rate for continued operations was 24.2% in 2023 compared to 25.3% in 2022.\nThe decrease in our effective tax rate primarily resulted from book income in connection with an increase in the fair market\nvalue of our corporate owned life insurance (\"COLI\") plan assets in 2023 versus book expense recorded in 2022. For tax\npurposes, current year COLI book income was nontaxable income resulting in a reduction to our effective tax rate as opposed to\n2022 nondeductible COLI loss that increased our effective tax rate.\nOur tax rate is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year but may not be consistent from year to year. In\naddition to state income taxes, certain federal and state tax credits and permanent book-tax differences such as foreign derived\nintangible income (\"FDII\") deduction, I.R.C. Section 162(m) executive compensation limitation and unrealized investment\nincome or loss from our COLI plan caused differences between the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate and our effective tax\nrate.\nSegment Operating Results\nAviation Segment Results\nThe results of operations for our Aviation segment were as follows (in thousands):\nYears ended December 31,\n2023 2022 Change ($) Change (%)\nRevenues $ 544,020 $ 408,112 $ 135,908 33 %\nCosts and operating expenses 472,852 371,696 101,156 27 %\nOperating income $ 71,168 $ 36,416 $ 34,752 95 %\nRevenues. Revenues increased $135.9 million, or 33%, in 2023 compared to 2022. Distribution revenue increased $86.2\nmillion, or 29%, driven by strong program execution on new and existing distribution contracts and contributions from the\nacquisition of Desser Aerospace (which occurred in July 2023). Repair revenue increased $49.8 million, or 46%, driven by an\nexpansion of repair capabilities, improved end market demand, and share gains with commercial and B&GA customers.\nCosts and Operating Expenses. Costs and operating expenses increased $101.2 million, or 27%, in 2023 compared to 2022\nprimarily due to increased revenues as discussed above. In addition, costs and operating expenses for this segment included\nexpenses for amortization of intangible assets associated with acquisitions and allocated corporate costs. Expense for\namortization of intangible assets increased $2.4 million in 2023 to $11.7 million from $9.3 million in 2022 driven by newly\nacquired intangibles in connection with acquisitions completed in the current year. Expense for allocated corporate costs was\n$12.9 million for 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nOperating Income. Operating income increased $34.8 million, or 95%, in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to revenue\ngrowth and a favorable shift in sales mix and pricing.\n-21-\nTable of Contents\nFleet Segment Results\nThe results of operations for our Fleet segment were as follows (in thousands):\nYears ended December 31,\n2023 2022 Change ($) Change (%)\nRevenues $ 316,468 $ 261,336 $ 55,132 21 %\nCosts and operating expenses 285,211 237,425 47,786 20 %\nOperating income $ 31,257 $ 23,911 $ 7,346 31 %\nRevenues. Revenues increased $55.1 million, or 21%, in 2023 compared to 2022. The increase was primarily from commercial\ncustomers of $46.7 million, or 45%, and other government customers (primarily USPS) of $11.5 million, or 7%. Commercial\ncustomer revenue growth was driven by our commercial fleet and e-commerce fulfillment business. Revenues from other\ngovernment customers increased primarily due to increased support of legacy USPS vehicle fleets. These increases were\npartially offset by a decrease in sales to DoD customers of $3 million, or 94%.\nCosts and Operating Expenses. Costs and operating expenses increased $47.8 million, or 20%, primarily due to increased\nrevenues. In addition, costs and operating expenses for this segment included expense for amortization of intangible assets\nassociated with acquisitions and allocated corporate costs. Expense for amortization of intangible assets decreased $3.8 million\nin 2023 to $2.6 million from $6.4 million in 2022 driven by intangibles becoming fully amortized during the current year.\nExpense for allocated corporate costs was $7.8 million for 2023 and $7.5 million for 2022.\nOperating Income. Operating income increased $7.3 million, or 31%, in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily driven by increased\nrevenues, a change in mix of products sold, and decreased amortization expense.\nFinancial Condition\nThere has been no material adverse change in our financial condition in 2023. Our outstanding borrowings under our term loan\nand revolving facility increased $144 million, and we had $216 million of unused commitments under the credit agreement as\nof December 31, 2023. In July 2023, we completed an underwritten public offering of 2,846,250 shares of the Company's\ncommon stock, generating proceeds of $129.1 million in connection with the offering, net of issuance costs. Changes to other\nasset and liability accounts were primarily due to our earnings; our level of business activity; the timing and level of inventory\npurchases to support new distribution programs, and vendor payments required to perform our work; and collections from our\ncustomers.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows (in thousands):\nYear ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nNet cash (used in) provided by operating activities $ (21,829) $ 8,051\nNet cash used in investing activities (235,690) (2,377)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities 264,971 (5,714)\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 7,452 $ (40)\nCash used in operating activities was $21.8 million in 2023 compared to cash provided by operating activities of $8.1 million in\n2022. The change was primarily due to greater use of cash for inventory purchases.\nCash used in investing activities increased $233.3 million in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to cash paid for acquisitions,\nnet of cash acquired, of $218.6 million in connection with acquisitions during the current period as discussed in Note (2)\n\"Acquisitions\" to the consolidated financial statements.\n-22-\nTable of Contents\nCash provided by financing activities was $265.0 million in 2023 compared to cash used in financing activities of $5.7 million\nin 2022. The change was primarily due to the receipt of $129.1 million in proceeds related to our public underwritten offering\nof our common stock in July 2023 and overall higher proceeds from net borrowings of our debt during the current period\nprimarily related to the increase in our term loan facility borrowings to fund cash paid for acquisitions.\nWe paid cash dividends totaling approximately $5.4 million, or $0.40 per share, in 2023. Pursuant to our credit agreement, our\npayment of cash dividends is subject to annual restrictions. We have paid cash dividends each year since 1973.\nLiquidity\nOur internal sources of liquidity are primarily from operating activities, specifically from changes in our level of revenues and\nassociated inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable, and from profitability. Significant increases or decreases in\nrevenues and inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable can affect our liquidity. Our inventory and accounts payable\nlevels can be affected by the timing of large opportunistic inventory purchases and by distributor agreement requirements. Our\naccounts receivable and accounts payable levels can be affected by changes in the level of work we perform and by the timing\nof large purchases. In addition to operating cash flows, other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity\ninclude capital expenditures; investments in expansion; improvement and maintenance of our operational and administrative\nfacilities; and investments in the acquisition of businesses.\nOur primary source of external financing is our credit agreement. Our credit agreement is with a bank group and includes a term\nloan and a revolving facility, with an aggregate maximum borrowing capacity under our revolving facility of $350.0 million.\nUnder the credit agreement we may elect to increase the maximum availability of the term loan, the revolving facility, or a\ncombination of both, subject to customary lender commitment approvals. The aggregate limit of increases is $25.0 million.\nIn July 2023, we entered into a fifth amendment to our credit agreement which, among other things, provided for the following:\n(i) the extension of a new term loan in the aggregate principal amount of $90.0 million; (ii) a reduction in our capacity to incur\nincremental revolving or term loan credit facilities from $100.0 million to $25.0 million; (iii) quarterly amortization payments\nfor the new term loan in the amount of $2.25 million; (iv) an increase in the maximum Total Funded Debt to EBITDA Ratio\nfrom 4.50x to 5.00x, with such ratios decreasing thereafter (as indicated in the table below); (v) the addition of a tier to the top\nof the pricing grid if the Total Funded Debt to EBITDA ratio exceeds 4.50x; and (vi) expressly permitting the Desser\nAerospace acquisition and subsequent and simultaneous business sale to Loar Group Inc.\nMaximum Total Funded Debt\nTesting Period to EBITDA Ratio\nJune 30, 2023 through and including September 30, 2023 5.00 to 1.00\nDecember 31, 2023 through and including June 30, 2024 4.75 to 1.00\nSeptember 30, 2024 4.50 to 1.00\nDecember 31, 2024 through and including March 31, 2025 4.25 to 1.00\nJune 30, 2025 4.00 to 1.00\nSeptember 30, 2025 and thereafter 3.75 to 1.00\nOn December 28, 2023, we entered into a sixth amendment to our credit agreement which, among other things, provided for the\nfollowing: (i) an increase in the aggregate principal amount of the term loan from $177.5 million to $300 million and an\nextension of the maturity date of the term loan by one year to October 7, 2026; (ii) a modification to the amortization payments\non the term loan from $5.0 million quarterly to $7.5 million quarterly, commencing with the first quarterly amortization\npayment due on April 1, 2024; and (iii) an extension of the maturity date of the revolving credit facility by one year to October\n7, 2026. As a result of the amendment, the capacity under the revolving facility remained unchanged and we have increased\navailability under the revolving facility by approximately $122.0 million.\nWe believe our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents, along with our cash flows from operations and debt instruments\nunder our credit agreement mentioned above, will provide sufficient liquidity for our business operations as well as capital\nexpenditures, dividends, and other capital requirements associated with our business operations over the next twelve months\nand thereafter for the foreseeable future.\n-23-\nTable of Contents\nOther Obligations and Commitments\nSee Note (7) \"Debt\" to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our long-term debt obligations. We\nestimate cash requirements for interest payments on our debt facilities to be approximately $32.1 million for 2024, $28.7\nmillion for 2025, and $23.0 million for 2026. The estimates do not take into account future draw downs and repayments on the\ndebt or changes in the variable interest rate, and actual interest may be different. The estimates included variable rate interest\nobligations estimated based on rates as of December 31, 2023. The interest payments are estimated through the maturity date of\nour term loan. Interest payments under our revolving facility have been excluded because a reasonable estimate of timing and\namount of cash out flows cannot be determined.\nSee Note (12) \"Leases\" to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information pertaining to future minimum lease payments\nrelating to our operating lease obligations.\nInflation and Pricing\nOur Aviation and Fleet segments have experienced broad-based inflationary impacts consistent with overall trends in the\naerospace and industrial distribution market, due primarily to increased materials, labor, and services costs. The effect of these\nincreased costs on total company net income has been mitigated with improved efficiency in our underlying business through\nproductivity improvements and pass-through price increases. Given broader inflation in the economy, we are monitoring the\nrisk inflation presents to active and future contracts.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material\neffect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital\nexpenditures or capital resources.\nCritical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles\n(\"U.S. GAAP\"), which require us to make estimates and assumptions. Certain critical accounting policies affect the more\nsignificant accounts, particularly those that involve judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our\nconsolidated financial statements. The development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by\nour management. Due to the significant judgment involved in selecting certain of the assumptions used in these policies, it is\npossible that different parties could choose different assumptions and reach different conclusions. We consider our policies\nrelating to the following matters to be critical accounting policies.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe account for revenue in accordance with ASC 606. The unit of account in ASC 606 is a performance obligation. At the\ninception of each contract with a customer, we determine our performance obligations under the contract and the contract's\ntransaction price. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and\nis defined as the unit of account. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and\nrecognized as revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied. The majority of our contracts have a single performance\nobligation to transfer goods or services. Our performance obligations are satisfied over time as work progresses or at a point in\ntime based on transfer of control of products and services to our customers.\nOur Aviation segment revenues result from the sale of aircraft parts and the performance of MRO services. Our Aviation\nsegment recognizes revenues for the sale of aircraft parts at a point in time when control is transferred to the customer, which\nusually occurs when the parts are shipped. Our Aviation segment recognizes revenues for MRO services over time as the\nservices are transferred to the customer. MRO services revenue recognition is measured based on the cost-to-cost input method,\nas costs incurred reflect the work completed, and therefore, the services transferred to date. Sales returns and allowances are not\nsignificant.\nSubstantially all Fleet segment revenues from the sale of vehicle parts to customers are recognized at the point in time of the\ntransfer of control to the customer. Sales returns and allowances for vehicle parts are not significant.\n-24-\nTable of Contents\nInventory Valuation\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in, first-out (\"FIFO\") method. Inventories for our\nAviation segment consist primarily of aftermarket parts for distribution, and general aviation engine accessories and parts, and\nalso include related purchasing, overhaul labor, storage and handling costs. Inventories for our Fleet segment consist primarily\nof vehicle replacement parts, and also include related purchasing, storage and handling costs. We periodically evaluate the\ncarrying value of inventory, considering factors such as its physical condition, sales patterns and expected future demand in\norder to estimate the amount necessary to write down any slow moving, obsolete or damaged inventory. These estimates could\nvary significantly from actual amounts based on future economic conditions, customer inventory levels or competitive factors\nthat were not foreseen or did not exist when the estimated write-downs were made.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. The purchase price of each business\nacquired is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on information regarding\ntheir respective fair values on the date of acquisition. Any excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the separately\nidentifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is allocated to goodwill. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed requires management's judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions,\nincluding assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, and market multiples, among other\nitems. We determine the fair values of intangible assets acquired generally in consultation with third-party valuation advisors.\nThe valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires a number of judgments and is subject to revision as additional\ninformation about the fair values becomes available. We will recognize any adjustments to provisional amounts that are\nidentified during the period not to exceed twelve months from the acquisition date (the \"measurement period\") in which the\nadjustments are determined. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred. The results of operations of businesses acquired are\nincluded in the consolidated financial statements from their dates of acquisition.\nValuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of fair value of consideration paid for an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired\nand liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. We recognize purchased intangible assets in connection with our business\nacquisitions at fair value on the acquisition date. We evaluate goodwill for our reporting units for impairment at least annually\non the first day of the fourth quarter, or whenever events or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may\nnot be fully recoverable. We estimate and compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its respective carrying value including\ngoodwill. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of fair values derived from the income approach\nand market approach. The analysis relies on significant judgements and assumptions about expected future cash flows,\nweighted-average cost of capital, discount rates, expected long-term growth rates, and financial measures derived from\nobservable market data of comparable public companies. Based on the annual goodwill impairment test performed during the\nfourth quarter of 2023, we determined that each reporting unit's fair value significantly exceeded its carrying value.\nIntangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the method that best reflects how their economic benefits are utilized or, if\na pattern of economic benefits cannot be reliably determined, on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.\nIntangible assets with finite lives are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the\ncarrying value may not be recoverable.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets\nand liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial\nstatement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. This method also requires the\nrecognition of future tax benefits, such as net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards, to the extent that realization of such\nbenefits is more likely than not. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to\ntaxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred\ntax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nThe carrying value of net deferred tax assets is based on assumptions regarding our ability to generate sufficient future taxable\nincome to utilize these deferred tax assets within the carryback or carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each\napplicable tax jurisdiction. Deferred tax assets are evaluated quarterly to determine if valuation allowances are required or\nshould be adjusted.\n-25-\nTable of Contents\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee \"Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Recent Accounting Pronouncements\" in Note (1) to\nour Consolidated Financial Statements included below in Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks\nInterest Rates\nOur credit agreement provides available borrowing at variable interest rates. Our interest expense is impacted by the overall\nglobal economic and interest rate environment. Accordingly, an increase in interest rates could have a material adverse impact\non our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. To mitigate the risks associated with future interest rate\nmovements we have employed interest rate hedges to fix the rate on a portion of our outstanding borrowings for various\nperiods.\nA hypothetical 1% increase to interest rates would have increased interest expense by approximately $4.0 million and would\nhave decreased our net income and operating cash flows by a comparable amount.\nFor additional information related to our debt and interest rate swap agreements, see Note (7) and Note (8), respectively, to our\nConsolidated Financial Statements contained in this report.\n-26-\nTable of Contents\nITEM 8.

In our\nopinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December\n31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December\n31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. .\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in\nthe 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission (“COSO”), and our report dated March 7, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion.\nBasis for opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\nthe Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are\nrequired to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable\nrules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the\naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to\nerror or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included\nexamining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included\nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall\npresentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical audit matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that\nwas communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that\nare material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The\ncommunication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and\nwe are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAssessment of the write-down of Aviation inventories\nAs described further in note 1 to the financial statements, the Company records inventory within its Aviation Segment at the\nlower of cost or net realizable value. The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of inventory which requires the\nwrite-down of slow-moving inventory for excess or obsolete inventory based on certain inputs and assumptions used to\ndetermine the net realizable value. These assumptions include future demand and sales patterns. Changes in these assumptions\ncould have a significant impact on the valuation of the inventory for the Aviation Segment.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that the assessment of the write-down of inventories, within the Aviation\nSegment, is a critical audit matter are the magnitude of the inventory balance in the Aviation Segment and that the inputs and\nassumptions used in determining the write-down are subject to significant management judgement. The inputs and assumptions\nused in determining the write-down of slow-moving inventory includes the future demand and sales patterns, the identification\nof specific inventories associated with aircraft with declining usage trends and the impact of recently executed distribution\nagreements. The assessment of these inputs required a high degree of auditor judgement in evaluating the future customer\ndemand for slow moving inventory.\nOur audit procedures related to the write-down of inventories, within the Aviation Segment, included the following, among\nothers.\n• We tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls relating to the Company’s inventory process, including\ncontrols over the Company’s evaluation of the impact on the estimate of net realizable value based on the number of\ndays transpiring from the date the inventory was original received, historical sales of the inventory, specific inventories\nidentified to relate to aircraft with declining usage and the approval and evaluation of new distribution agreements.\n-28-\nTable of Contents\n• We assessed the recovery rates applied to slow moving inventory are consistent with management’s forecasted\ndemand.\n• We assessed the identification of specific inventory with declining usage trends by evaluating external industry\ninformation.\n• We conducted sensitivity analysis around the reserve assumptions applied to aged inventory included in the perpetual\nlisting as of year-end.\n/s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2019.\nArlington, Virginia\nMarch 7, 2024\n-29-\nTable of Contents\nVSE Corporation and Subsidiaries\nConsolidated

Our operations include aircraft and airframe parts supply and distribution, supply\nchain and inventory management services; MRO of aircraft components and engine accessories; vehicle fleet sustainment\nprograms; vehicle fleet parts supply and distribution. We serve commercial and government markets. We operate in two\nreportable segments aligned with our operating segments: Aviation and Fleet.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations\nof the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") and include the assets, liabilities, results of operations and cash flows our\nparent company and our wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in\nconsolidation.\nIn May 2023, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Federal and Defense segment which we mutually agreed to\nterminate in September 2023, with neither party paying any termination fees. In February 2024, we entered into two separate\nagreements to sell substantially all of the Federal and Defense segment assets. See Note (3) \"Discontinued Operations\" and\nNote (18) \"Subsequent Events\" for further information. The consolidated financial statements reflect the Federal and Defense\nsegment's results of operations as discontinued operations, and the related assets and liabilities as held-for-sale for all periods\npresented.\nCertain reclassifications have been made to the prior period financial information to reflect discontinued operations\npresentation. Unless otherwise noted, amounts and disclosures throughout these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nrelate solely to continuing operations and exclude all discontinued operations.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"U.S.\nGAAP\") requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure\nof contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting\nperiod. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates affecting the financial statements may include, but\nare not limited to, fair value measurements, inventory provisions, collectability of receivables, estimated profitability of long-\nterm contracts, valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets and contingencies.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe issue stock-based awards as compensation to employees and directors. Stock-based awards include stock-settled bonus\nawards, time-vested stock awards and performance share awards. We recognize stock-based compensation expense over the\nunderlying award’s requisite service period, as measured using the award’s grant date fair value. Our policy is to recognize\nforfeitures as they occur. For performance share awards, we assess the probability of achieving the performance conditions at\neach reporting period end and adjust compensation expense based on the number of shares we expect to ultimately issue.\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per share (\"EPS\") is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common\nstock outstanding during each period. Shares issued during the period are weighted for the portion of the period that they were\noutstanding. Our calculation of diluted earnings per common share includes the dilutive effects for the assumed vesting of\noutstanding stock-based awards. There were no antidilutive common stock equivalents excluded from the diluted per share\ncalculation.\n-36-\nTable of Contents\nThe weighted-average number of shares outstanding used to compute basic and diluted EPS were as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nBasic weighted average common shares outstanding 14,130,334 12,780,117 12,551,459\nEffect of dilutive shares 54,395 47,777 81,415\nDiluted weighted average common shares outstanding 14,184,729 12,827,894 12,632,874\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nWe consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Due to the\nshort maturity of these instruments, the carrying values on our consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we held approximately $6.0 million of cash in foreign bank accounts, primarily in connection with\nour acquisition of Desser Holding Company LLC (\"Desser Aerospace\"). Refer to Note (2) \"Acquisitions,\" for details regarding\nour acquisitions.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is recorded at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization is\ngenerally provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the various assets. Property and equipment is\ngenerally depreciated over the following estimated useful lives: computer equipment, furniture, other equipment from three to\n15 years; and buildings and land improvements from 15 to 20 years. Amortization of leasehold improvements is provided by\nthe straight-line method over the lesser of their useful life or the remaining term of the lease.\nLeases\nWe determine at inception whether an arrangement that provides us control over the use of an asset is a lease. Substantially all\nof our leases are long-term operating leases for facilities with fixed payment terms. We recognize a right-of-use (\"ROU\") asset\nand a lease liability upon commencement of our operating leases. The initial lease liability is equal to the future fixed minimum\nlease payments discounted using our incremental borrowing rate, on a secured basis. The lease term includes option renewal\nperiods and early termination payments when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise those rights. The initial measurement\nof the ROU asset is equal to the initial lease liability plus any initial indirect costs and prepayments, less any lease incentives.\nWe recognize lease costs on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term, except for variable lease payments that are\nexpensed in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred.\nLeases with an initial term of 12 months or less with purchase options or extension options that are not reasonably certain to be\nexercised are not recorded on the balance sheet. Operating lease cost is included in costs and operating expenses on our\nconsolidated statement of income.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of our trade receivables. Our\ntrade receivables consist of amounts due from various commercial entities and government clients. We believe that\nconcentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the large number of customers comprising the\ncustomer base and their dispersion across many different geographic regions. The credit risk, with respect to contracts with the\ngovernment, is limited due to the creditworthiness of the respective governmental entity. We perform ongoing credit\nevaluations and monitoring of the financial condition of all our customers. We maintain an allowance for credit losses based\nupon several factors, including historical collection experience, current aging status of the customer accounts and financial\ncondition of our customers.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe account for revenue in accordance with ASC 606. The unit of account in ASC 606 is a performance obligation. At the\ninception of each contract with a customer, we determine our performance obligations under the contract and the contract's\ntransaction price. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and\nis defined as the unit of account. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and\n-37-\nTable of Contents\nrecognized as revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied. The majority of our contracts have a single performance\nobligation as the promise to transfer the respective goods or services is not separately identifiable from other promises in the\ncontracts and is, therefore, not distinct. For product sales, each product sold to a customer typically represents a distinct\nperformance obligation. Our performance obligations are satisfied over time as work progresses or at a point in time based on\ntransfer of control of products and services to our customers.\nSubstantially all our Fleet segment revenues from the sale of vehicle parts to customers are recognized at the point in time of\nthe transfer of control to the customer. Sales returns and allowances for vehicle parts are not significant.\nOur Aviation segment revenues result from the sale of aircraft parts and performance of MRO services for private and\ncommercial aircraft owners, other aviation MRO providers, and aviation original equipment manufacturers. Our Aviation\nsegment recognizes revenues for the sale of aircraft parts at a point in time when control is transferred to the customer, which\nusually occurs when the parts are shipped. Our Aviation segment recognizes revenues for MRO services over time as the\nservices are transferred to the customer. MRO services revenue recognized is measured based on the cost-to-cost input method,\nas costs incurred reflect the work completed, and therefore the services transferred to date. Sales returns and allowances are not\nsignificant.\nReceivables and Contract Assets\nReceivables are recorded at amounts earned less an allowance. We review our receivables regularly to determine if there are\nany potentially uncollectible accounts.\nContract assets include unbilled amounts typically resulting from sales under contracts when the cost-to-cost method of revenue\nrecognition is utilized, and revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the customer. The amounts may not exceed their\nestimated net realizable value. Contract assets are classified as current based on our contract operating cycle.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nWe establish allowances for credit losses on our accounts receivable and contract assets. To measure expected credit losses, we\nhave disaggregated pools of receivable balances by segment. Within each segment, receivables exhibit similar risk\ncharacteristics. In determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, we consider historical collectability based on past\ndue status. We also consider current market conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions to inform potential\nadjustments to historical loss data. In addition, we also record allowances for credit losses for specific receivables that are\ndeemed to have a higher risk profile than the rest of the respective pool of receivables, such as concerns about a specific\ncustomer's inability to meet its financial obligation to us. The adequacy of these allowances is assessed quarterly through\nconsideration of factors on a collective basis where similar characteristics exist and on an individual basis.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in, first-out (\"FIFO\") method. Inventories consist\nprimarily of finished goods replacement parts for our Fleet and Aviation segments, and also include related purchasing, storage,\nand handling costs. Inventories for our Aviation segment consist primarily of aftermarket parts for distribution, and general\naviation engine accessories and parts, and also include related purchasing, overhaul labor, storage, and handling costs.\nWe periodically evaluate the carrying value of inventory, considering factors such as its physical condition, sales patterns and\nexpected future demand in order to estimate the amount necessary to write down any slow moving, obsolete or damaged\ninventory. These estimates could vary significantly from actual amounts based upon future economic conditions, customer\ninventory levels or competitive factors that were not foreseen or did not exist when the estimated write-downs were made.\nDuring 2021, we recorded a $24.4 million provision for inventory within cost and operating expenses primarily related to slow\nmoving and excess quantities of Aviation segment inventory supporting certain international region distribution programs\nentered into prior to 2019.\nDeferred Compensation Plans\nWe established the VSE Corporation Deferred Supplemental Compensation Plan (\"DSC Plan\") for the benefit of certain key\nmanagement employees to be incentivized and rewarded based on overall company performance. We recognized DSC Plan\nexpenses of $0.4 million, $0.3 million, and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n-38-\nTable of Contents\nWe invest in corporate owned life insurance (\"COLI\") products and in mutual funds that are held in a Rabbi Trust to fund the\nDSC Plan obligations. The COLI investments are recorded at cash surrender value and the mutual fund investments are\nrecorded at fair value. The DSC Plan assets are included in other assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nGains and losses recognized on the changes in fair value of the investments are recorded as selling, general and administrative\nexpenses on the accompanying consolidated statements of income. We recorded net gains of $0.6 million and $22 thousand for\nthe years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and a net loss of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31,\n2021.\nDerivative Instruments\nDerivative instruments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on derivatives\ndesignated as cash flow hedges are reported in other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in a manner that\nmatches the timing of the earnings impact of the hedged transactions.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets\nand liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial\nstatement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. This method also requires the\nrecognition of future tax benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that realization of such benefits is more\nlikely than not. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in\nthe years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and\nliabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nThe carrying value of net deferred tax assets is based on assumptions regarding our ability to generate sufficient future taxable\nincome to utilize these deferred tax assets.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe allocate the purchase price of acquired entities to the underlying tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values, with any excess recorded as goodwill. The operating results\nof acquired businesses are included in our results of operations beginning as of their effective acquisition dates. For contingent\nconsideration arrangements, a liability is recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date with subsequent fair value\nadjustments recorded in operations.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a\nbusiness combination. Goodwill is tested for potential impairment at the reporting unit level annually at the beginning of the\nfourth quarter, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.\nWe estimate and compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its respective carrying value including goodwill. The fair value\nof our reporting units is determined using a combination of the income approach and the market approach, which involves the\nuse of estimates and assumptions, including projected future operating results and cash flows, the cost of capital, and financial\nmeasures derived from observable market data of comparable public companies. If the fair value is less than the carrying value,\nthe amount of impairment expense is equal to the difference between the reporting unit’s fair value and the reporting unit’s\ncarrying value.\nIntangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the method that best reflects how their economic benefits are utilized or, if\na pattern of economic benefits cannot be reliably determined, on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.\nIntangible assets with finite lives are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the\ncarrying value may not be recoverable.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets (Excluding Goodwill)\nWe review our long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, operating lease right-of-use assets, and property and\nequipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in facts and circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be\nfully recoverable and the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows. When the carrying\n-39-\nTable of Contents\namount of the asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the asset’s\ncarrying amount to its estimated fair value based on the present value of its estimated future cash flows.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”)\n2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires public entities to\ndisclose information about their reportable segments’ significant expenses and other segment items on an interim and annual\nbasis. Public entities with a single reportable segment are required to apply the disclosure requirements in ASU 2023-07, as\nwell as all existing segment disclosures and reconciliation requirements in ASC 280 on an interim and annual basis. ASU\n2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning\nafter December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. This guidance is required to be adopted by us beginning with the\nannual period of 2024. We are currently evaluating the impact that adoption of ASU 2023-07 may have on our consolidated\nfinancial statements and disclosure.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures,\nwhich requires public entities, on an annual basis, to provide disclosure of specific categories in the rate reconciliation, as well\nas disclosure of income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. This guidance is required to be adopted by us in the first quarter of 2025.\nWe are currently evaluating the impact that adoption of ASU 2023-09 may have on our consolidated financial statements and\ndisclosure.\n(2) Acquisitions\nFiscal 2023\nPrecision Fuel Components, LLC\nOn February 1, 2023, our Aviation segment acquired Precision Fuel Components, LLC (\"Precision Fuel\") for a purchase price\nof $11.7 million. Precision Fuel provides MRO services for engine accessory and fuel systems supporting the business and\ngeneral aviation (\"B&GA\") market. Our acquisition of Precision Fuel expanded our MRO capabilities and client base. Precision\nFuel operating results are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements beginning on the acquisition date.\nThe acquisition was not material to our consolidated financial statements.\nThe final allocation of the purchase price resulted in net tangible assets of $3.2 million, goodwill of $4.8 million, and contract\nand customer-related intangible asset of $3.8 million, which is being amortized over a period of five years. During the year\nended December 31, 2023, we incurred $0.2 million of acquisition-related expenses related to the acquisition of Precision Fuel,\nwhich are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nDesser Aerospace\nOn July 3, 2023, we completed the acquisition of Desser Holding Company LLC (\"Desser Aerospace\"), a global aftermarket\nsolutions provider of specialty distribution and MRO services. We purchased Desser Aerospace for a preliminary cash\nconsideration of $133.7 million, which included $9.5 million as an estimated net working capital adjustment (subject to post-\nclosing adjustments). Concurrent with the closing of the transaction, we immediately sold, in a separate transaction, Desser\nAerospace’s propriety solutions businesses to Loar Group Inc. (“Loar”) for a cash consideration of $31.8 million, which\nincluded $1.8 million as an estimated net working capital adjustment (the “Loar Sale”).\nThe purchase price for Desser Aerospace was allocated on a preliminary basis, among assets acquired, and liabilities assumed,\nat fair value based on the best available information on the acquisition date, with the excess purchase price recorded as\ngoodwill. The fair values of the non-financial assets acquired, and liabilities assumed, were determined based on preliminary\nestimates, assumptions, and other information compiled by management, including independent valuations utilizing established\nindustry valuation techniques. We have not yet finalized the determination of the fair values allocated to various assets and\nliabilities, including, but not limited to, working capital and income taxes. Therefore, the allocation of the total consideration for\nthe acquisition to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired, and liabilities assumed, is preliminary until we obtain\nfinal information regarding their fair values, which could potentially result in changes to the Desser Aerospace opening balance\nsheet. Adjustments or changes to goodwill, assets or liabilities remain possible.\n-40-\nTable of Contents\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, we adjusted the purchase price allocation as a result of certain measurement period\nadjustments to acquired assets and liabilities assumed due to updated valuation reports received from our external valuation\nspecialist, revisions to internal estimates, and new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the\nacquisition date. The measurement period adjustments included: an increase in the purchase price of $0.6 million, a decrease in\ninventories of $8.0 million, a decrease in accounts payable of $4.6 million, and a decrease in net other tangible assets of\n$1.0 million. These adjustments resulted in an increase to goodwill of $5.0 million.\nThe adjusted preliminary purchase price is as follows (in thousands):\nReceivables $ 7,383\nInventories 31,112\nOther current assets 515\nProperty and equipment 2,527\nIntangible assets 21,950\nGoodwill 55,681\nOperating lease right-of-use-assets 6,680\nTotal assets acquired 125,848\nAccounts payable (10,128)\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities (5,793)\nLong-term operating lease obligations (5,937)\nDeferred tax liabilities (4,307)\nOther long-term liabilities —\nTotal liabilities assumed (26,165)\nNet assets acquired, excluding cash $ 99,683\nCash consideration, net of cash acquired $ 101,870\nEstimated post-close adjustment (2,187)\nTotal $ 99,683\nGoodwill resulting from the acquisition of Desser Aerospace reflects the strategic advantage of expanding our specialty\ndistribution and MRO services to new customers. The value attributed to goodwill and customer relationships is not fully\ndeductible for income tax purposes. The estimated value attributed to the customer relationship intangible assets is being\namortized on a straight-line basis using a weighted average useful life of 8.5 years.\nThe operating results of Desser Aerospace were included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition.\nFrom the date of acquisition, our consolidated revenues and operating income include $48.5 million and $4.8 million,\nrespectively, for Desser Aerospace. Desser Aerospace's operating income does not include the impact of acquisition-related\nexpenses incurred by VSE Corporation. We incurred $3.2 million of acquisition-related expenses related to the Desser\nAerospace acquisition during the year ended December 31, 2023, which are included in selling, general and administrative\nexpenses.\nThe following unaudited pro forma financial information presents the combined results of operations for Desser Aerospace and\nVSE Corporation for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The unaudited consolidated pro forma results\nof operations are as follows (in thousands):\nFor the years ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nRevenue $ 908,243 $ 749,489\nIncome from continuing operations $ 46,265 $ 25,541\nThe unaudited pro forma combined financial information presented above has been prepared from historical financial\nstatements that have been adjusted to give effect to the acquisition of Desser Aerospace as though it had occurred on January 1,\n-41-\nTable of Contents\n2022 and includes adjustments for intangible asset amortization; interest expense and debt issuance costs on long-term debt;\nacquisition and other transaction costs; and certain costs allocated from the former parent. The unaudited pro forma financial\ninformation is not intended to reflect the actual results of operations that would have occurred if the acquisition had occurred on\nJanuary 1, 2022, nor is it indicative of future operating results.\nHoneywell Fuel Control Systems\nOn September 27, 2023, our Aviation segment entered into an Asset Purchase and License Agreement with Honeywell\nInternational Inc. (\"Honeywell\"), for a purchase price of $105.0 million, to exclusively manufacture, sell, market, distribute,\nand repair certain Honeywell fuel control systems (the \"Honeywell FCS Acquisition\"). The purchase price of this acquisition\nwas funded by borrowings under our revolving credit facility. This agreement expands existing distribution and MRO\ncapabilities supporting certain Honeywell fuel control systems and associated subcomponents.\nThe acquisition was accounted for as a business combination under ASC 805, Business Combinations. The purchase price for\nthe acquisition was allocated on a preliminary basis, among assets acquired, at fair value based on the best available information\non the acquisition date, with the excess purchase price recorded as goodwill. The fair values of the non-financial assets acquired\nwere determined based on preliminary estimates, assumptions, and other information compiled by management, including\nindependent valuations utilizing established industry valuation techniques. We have not yet finalized the purchase price\nallocation related to this acquisition due to the fact that while legal control has occurred, we have not received physical\npossession of the prepaid inventory and property and equipment, and thus these assets will be subject to settlement adjustments\nupon transfer as outlined in the Asset Purchase and License Agreement with Honeywell. Therefore, the allocation of the total\nconsideration for the acquisition is preliminary until we obtain final information regarding their fair values, which could\npotentially result in changes in the fair values and an adjustment to goodwill.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, we adjusted the purchase price allocation as a result of certain measurement period\nadjustments to acquired assets due to updated valuation report received from our external valuation specialist. The measurement\nperiod adjustments included: a decrease in intangible assets of $1.1 million and a corresponding increase to goodwill.\nThe adjusted preliminary purchase price allocation is as follows (in thousands):\nOther current assets (a) $ 12,000\nProperty and equipment 2,714\nIntangible assets 16,200\nGoodwill 74,086\nTotal assets acquired $ 105,000\nCash consideration $ 105,000\nTotal consideration $ 105,000\n(a) Represents prepaid inventory consisting of finished goods acquired but not in our physical possession as of the acquisition date.\nGoodwill resulting from the acquisition reflects the expected synergies from the acquisition. The value attributed to goodwill\nand customer relationship is deductible for income tax purposes. The estimated value attributed to the customer relationship\nintangible asset is being amortized on a straight-line basis using a useful life of 10 years.\nWe incurred $0.3 million of acquisition-related expenses related to the Honeywell FCS Acquisition during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. The pro-forma impact of the\nacquisition is not material to the Company’s results of operations.\nFiscal 2021\nGlobal Parts Group, Inc.\nOn July 26, 2021, our Aviation segment acquired Global Parts Group, Inc. (\"Global Parts\"), a privately owned company with\noperations in Augusta, Kansas. Global Parts provides distribution and MRO services for B&GA aircraft families. The\nacquisition expands our existing B&GA focus and further diversifies our existing product and platform offerings to include\nadditional airframe components, while expanding our customer base of regional and global B&GA customers. The cash\n-42-\nTable of Contents\npurchase price for Global Parts was approximately $40.0 million, net of cash acquired, which was funded using our existing\nbank revolving loan. The purchase price included $2.0 million of contingent consideration.\nWe completed the purchase accounting valuation for this transaction in 2021 and the final purchase price allocation was as\nfollows (in thousands):\nReceivables $ 6,410\nInventories 13,240\nOther current assets 620\nProperty and equipment 368\nIntangibles assets 16,000\nGoodwill 10,019\nOperating lease right-of-use-assets 3,043\nDeferred tax assets 1,775\nAccounts payable (6,112)\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities (1,936)\nLong-term operating lease obligations (2,874)\nNet assets acquired, excluding cash $ 40,553\nCash consideration, net of cash acquired $ 38,553\nAcquisition date estimated fair value of earn-out obligation 2,000\nTotal consideration $ 40,553\nThe value attributed to the customer relationship intangible asset is being amortized on a straight-line basis using a useful life of\n15 years. None of the value attributed to goodwill and customer relationships was deductible for income tax purposes.

As of\nDecember 31, 2023, we have outstanding stock-settled bonus awards, time-vested stock awards, and performance share awards\nunder this plan.\nStock-settled bonus awards are a fixed dollar-denominated award. On the first anniversary of the grant date, the total fixed\ndollar value of the award is converted into shares based on our closing stock price on the date of conversion. Vesting occurs\nover a three-year service period in three equal tranches. Beginning with the 2023 stock-settled bonus awards, the first vesting\noccurs one year after the award is converted into shares. For awards granted prior to 2023, the first vesting occurs one year after\nthe grant date. On each vesting date, 100% of the vested award is paid in stock. Expense is recognized on a straight-line basis\nover the requisite service period for each tranche, which results in an accelerated pattern for an award.\nTime-vested stock awards generally vest over a three-year service period in equal installments on each anniversary of the grant\ndate. Our directors receive a grant of stock annually as part of their compensation and the stock vests immediately upon grant.\nWe grant performance share awards to certain employees under the 2006 Plan. Performance share awards are rights to receive\nshares of our stock on the satisfaction of service requirements and performance conditions.

While the US has not yet adopted the Pillar Two rules, many\ncountries took steps to incorporate Pillar Two model rule concepts into their domestic laws in 2023. Considering that we do not\nhave material operations in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the Pillar Two minimum, we do not expect these rules will\nsignificantly increase our global tax costs. We will continue to monitor US and global legislative action related to Pillar Two for\nfuture potential impacts.\n(12) Leases\nOur operating lease cost was as follows for the years ended December 31, (in thousands):\n2023 2022 2021\nOperating lease cost (a) $ 6,480 $ 2,714 $ 1,731\n(a) Excludes short-term lease expense, which is not material.\nOur lease arrangements do not contain any material residual guarantees, variable payment provisions, or restrictive covenants.\n-52-\nTable of Contents\nThe table below summarizes future minimum lease payments under operating leases, recorded on the balance sheet, as of\nDecember 31, 2023 (in thousands):\nYear ending December 31,\n2024 $ 6,555\n2025 6,959\n2026 6,079\n2027 5,119\n2028 4,612\nThereafter 6,448\nMinimum lease payments 35,772\nLess: imputed interest (5,856)\nPresent value of minimum lease payments 29,916\nLess: current portion of lease liabilities (a) (4,957)\nLong-term lease liabilities\n$ 24,959\n(a) The current portion of lease liabilities are presented within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to\nNote (9) \"Accrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities.\"\nOther supplemental operating lease information for the year ended December 31, was as follows (in thousands):\n2023 2022 2021\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease\nliabilities $ 5,045 $ 2,441 $ 1,474\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities $ 11,812 $ 11,876 $ 8,182\nThe weighted-average discount rate was 5.9% and 5.4% and the weighted-average remaining lease term was 5.7 years and 6.0\nyears as of December 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n(13) Commitments and Contingencies\nWe may have certain claims in the normal course of business, including legal proceedings, against us and against other parties.\nIn our opinion, the resolution of these claims will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial\nposition, or cash flows. However, because the results of any legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, the amount of\nloss, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated.\nFurther, from time-to-time, government agencies audit or investigate whether our operations are being conducted in accordance\nwith applicable contractual and regulatory requirements. Government audits or investigations, whether relating to government\ncontracts or conducted for other reasons, could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities, including repayments, fines\nor penalties imposed, or could lead to suspension or debarment from future government contracting. Government investigations\noften take years to complete and many result in no adverse action. We believe, based upon current information, that the\noutcome of any such government disputes, audits and investigations will not have a material adverse effect on our results of\noperations, financial condition, or cash flows.\n-53-\nTable of Contents\n(14) Business Segments and Customer Information\nSegment Information\nThe sale of the Federal and Defense segment is intended to allow us to focus on a long-term strategic growth strategy focused\non higher margin and higher growth aftermarket parts distribution and MRO businesses. Following the completion of the\nFederal and Defense segment sale transaction, management of our business operations is conducted under two reportable\noperating segments:\nAviation\nOur Aviation segment provides aftermarket MRO and distribution services to commercial, business and general aviation, cargo,\nmilitary and defense, and rotorcraft customers globally. Core services include parts distribution, MRO services including fuel\ncontrols, avionics, pneumatics, hydraulics, wheel and brake, and rotable exchange and supply chain services.\nFleet\nOur Fleet segment provides parts, inventory management, e-commerce fulfillment, logistics, supply chain support and other\nservices to support the commercial aftermarket medium- and heavy-duty truck market, and the United States Postal Service\n(\"USPS\"). Core services include vehicle parts distribution, sourcing, IT solutions, customized fleet logistics, warehousing,\nkitting, just-in-time supply chain management, alternative product sourcing, and engineering and technical support.\nThe operating segments reported below are our segments for which separate financial information is available and for which\nsegment results are evaluated regularly by our Chief Executive Officer in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing\nperformance. We evaluate segment performance based on consolidated revenues and operating income. Net sales of our\nbusiness segments exclude inter-segment sales as these activities are eliminated in consolidation. Corporate expenses are\nprimarily selling, general and administrative expenses not allocated to segments. Corporate assets are primarily cash, property\nand equipment and investments held in separate trust.\nOur segment information is as follows (in thousands):\nFor the years ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nRevenues:\nAviation $ 544,020 $ 408,112 $ 247,852\nFleet 316,468 261,336 233,532\nTotal revenues $ 860,488 $ 669,448 $ 481,384\nOperating income (loss):\nAviation $ 71,168 $ 36,416 $ (14,373)\nFleet 31,257 23,911 20,426\nCorporate/unallocated expenses (a) (14,429) (6,723) (8,758)\nTotal operating income (loss) $ 87,996 $ 53,604 $ (2,705)\nDepreciation and amortization expense:\nAviation $ 16,080 $ 13,174 $ 11,374\nFleet 5,300 8,783 9,679\nTotal depreciation and amortization $ 21,380 $ 21,957 $ 21,053\nCapital expenditures:\nAviation $ 16,467 $ 5,961 $ 7,468\nFleet 2,198 5,502 1,669\nCorporate 269 861 843\nTotal capital expenditures $ 18,934 $ 12,324 $ 9,980\n(a) Certain corporate costs previously allocated to the Federal and Defense business for segment reporting purposes did not qualify for classification within\ndiscontinued operations and have been reallocated to continuing operations.\n-54-\nTable of Contents\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nTotal assets:\nAviation $ 950,143 $ 637,615\nFleet 274,382 218,138\nCorporate 32,811 33,097\nAssets held-for-sale 93,002 110,939\nTotal assets $ 1,350,338 $ 999,789\nCustomer Information\nOur revenues are derived from the delivery of products and services performed for commercial and government customers.\nRevenues from the USPS, reported within our Fleet segment, represented 19%, 23%, and 30% of consolidated revenues for\n2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our customers also include various other commercial entities and government agencies.\nSee Note (4) \"Revenue Recognition\" for revenue by customer.\nWe do not measure revenue or profit by product or service lines, either for internal management or external financial reporting\npurposes, because it would be impractical to do so. Products offered and services performed are determined by contract\nrequirements and the types of products and services provided for one contract bear no relation to similar products and services\nprovided on another contract. Products and services provided vary when new contracts begin, or current contracts expire. In\nmany cases, more than one product or service is provided under a contract. Accordingly, cost and revenue tracking are designed\nto best serve contract requirements and segregating costs and revenues by product or service lines in situations for which it is\nnot required would be difficult and costly to both us and our customers.\nGeographical Information\nRevenue by geography is based on the billing address of the customer. Our revenue by geographic area is as follows (in\nthousands):\nYears ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nUnited States $ 656,767 $ 557,615 $ 399,423\nOther Countries (a) 203,721 111,833 81,961\nTotal revenue $ 860,488 $ 669,448 $ 481,384\n(a) No individual country, other than disclosed above, exceeded 10% of our total revenue for any period presented.\n(15) Capital Stock\nOur common stock has a par value of $0.05 per share. Proceeds from common stock issuances that are greater than $0.05 per\nshare are credited to additional paid in capital. Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per common share held on all\nmatters voted on by our stockholders. Stockholders of record are entitled to the amount of dividends declared per common\nshare held.\nIn July 2023, we entered into an underwriting agreement with William Blair & Company, L.L.C and RBC Capital Markets,\nacting as representatives of several underwriters, relating to the issuance and sale of 2,846,250 shares of the Company's\ncommon stock at a public offering price of $48.50 per share. The issuance and sale of shares pursuant to the agreement was\nexecuted in two transactions, with the first transaction closing on July 24, 2023, and the second transaction, which represented\nshares issued and sold pursuant to the underwriters' exercise of their option to purchase additional shares, closing on July 28,\n2023. We received proceeds of $129.1 million in connection with the offering, net of issuance costs.\n(16) 401(k) Plan\nWe maintain a defined contribution plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, that covers\nsubstantially all our employees. Under the provisions of our 401(k) plan, employees' eligible contributions are matched at rates\nspecified in the plan documents. Our expense associated with this plan was approximately $1.6 million, $1.7 million, and $1.4\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\n-55-\nTable of Contents\n(17) Fair Value Measurements\nWe utilize fair value measurement guidance prescribed by GAAP to value our financial instruments. The accounting standard\nfor fair value measurements establishes a three-tier value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as\nfollows: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets (Level 1); inputs other than the quoted prices in active\nmarkets that are observable either directly or indirectly (Level 2); and unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market\ndata, which requires the Company to develop its own assumptions (Level 3).\nThe carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and amounts included in other current assets\nand accrued expenses and other current liabilities that meet the definition of a financial instrument approximate fair value due to\ntheir relatively short maturity. The carrying value of our outstanding debt obligations approximates its fair value. The fair value\nof long-term debt is calculated using Level 2 inputs based on interest rates available for debt with terms and maturities similar\nto our existing debt arrangements.\nNon-financial assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations were measured at fair value using income,\nmarket and cost valuation methodologies. See Note (2), \"Acquisitions.\" The fair value measurements were estimated using\nsignificant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represent a Level 3 measurement.\nThe following table summarizes the financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of\nDecember 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022 and the level they fall within the fair value hierarchy (in thousands):\nFair Value December 31,\nFinancial Statement\nAmounts Recorded at Fair Value Classification Fair Value Hierarchy 2023 2022\nNon-COLI assets held in Deferred\nSupplemental Compensation Plan(a) Other assets Level 1 $ 594 $ 539\nInterest rate swaps Other assets Level 2 $ 2,840 $ 6,620\n(a) Non-COLI assets held in our deferred supplemental compensation plan consist of equity funds with fair value based on observable inputs such as quoted\nprices for identical assets in active markets and changes in fair value are recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses.\n(18) Subsequent Events\nSale of Federal and Defense Segment\nIn February 2024, we entered into two separate agreements to sell substantially all the Federal and Defense operational assets\n(\"FDS Sale\") for cash proceeds of $44.0 million, which included $10.0 million of an estimated net working capital adjustment\n(subject to post-closing adjustments). The FDS Sale excluded our Alexandria, VA headquarters and the Greensboro MRO\nfacility. We estimate incurring a non-cash impairment loss of approximately $4.2 million related to the cancellation of a\ncontract at the Greensboro MRO facility.\nAcquisition of Turbine Controls, Inc.\nOn February 29, 2024, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire Turbine Controls, Inc. (\"TCI\"), a leading provider of\naftermarket MRO support services for complex engine components, as well as engine and airframe accessories, across\ncommercial and military applications. The acquisition will allow our Aviation segment to broaden OEM Authorized MRO\ncapabilities, expand into new markets, and serve new customers. Total consideration is approximately $120.0 million,\ncomprising $110.0 million in cash and $10.0 million in shares of VSE common stock, subject to certain post-closing and\nworking capital adjustments. The acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of 2024, subject to customary closing\nconditions.\n-56-\nTable of Contents\nITEM 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nITEM 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management has evaluated, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the\neffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Exchange\nAct). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of\nDecember 31, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information we are required to disclose\nin reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time\nperiods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,\nincluding our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required\ndisclosure.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for assessing\nthe effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and\n15d-15(f). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in\nreasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the issuer; (ii) provide reasonable\nassurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the issuer are being made only in accordance with\nauthorizations of management and directors of the issuer; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely\ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the issuer’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial\nstatements.\nOur management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the framework in Internal\nControl – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013\nFramework). Based on the assessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was\neffective as of December 31, 2023.\nAs permitted by the SEC rules, management's assessment and conclusion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control\nover financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, excludes an assessment of internal control over financial reporting of Desser\nAerospace, acquired on July 3, 2023. Desser Aerospace represents total assets, excluding goodwill and intangibles related to the\nacquisitions, and revenues constituting 4% and 6%, respectively, of our consolidated total assets and total revenues as of and for\nthe year ended December 31, 2023.\nGrant Thornton LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, audited our consolidated financial statements included\nin this report and our internal control over financial reporting, and the firm's report on our internal control over financial\nreporting are set forth below.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nChange in Internal Controls\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined\nin Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act), that have materially affected these controls or are reasonably likely\nto materially affect these controls after the evaluation of these controls.\n-57-\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nBoard of Directors and Stockholders\nVSE Corporation\nOpinion on internal control over financial reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of VSE Corporation (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the\n“Company”) as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, the Company\nmaintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on\ncriteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by COSO.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(“PCAOB”), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, and our\nreport dated March 7, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report\non Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control\nover financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the\naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all\nmaterial respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk\nthat a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the\nassessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit\nprovides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nOur audit of, and opinion on, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting does not include the internal control over\nfinancial reporting of Desser-Graham Partnership, L.P. (“Desser Aerospace”), a wholly-owned subsidiary, whose financial\nstatements reflect total assets, excluding goodwill and intangibles related to the acquisition, and revenues constituting 4 and 6\npercent, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nAs indicated in Management’s Report, Desser Aerospace was acquired during 2023. Management’s assertion on the\neffectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting excluded internal control over financial reporting of\nDesser Aerospace.\nDefinition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures\nthat (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and\ndispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and\nexpenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the\ncompany; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP\nArlington, Virginia\nMarch 7, 2024\n-58-\nTable of Contents\nITEM 9B.Other Information\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2023, no director or \"officer,\" as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Exchange Act, of\nthe Company adopted, modified, or terminated a \"Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement\" or a \"non-Rule 10b5-1 trading\narrangement,\" as each term is defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K.\nITEM 9C.Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections\nNone.\nPART III\nExcept as otherwise indicated below, the information required by Items 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 of Part III of Form 10-K has been\nomitted in reliance of General Instruction G(3) to Form 10-K and is incorporated herein by reference to our definitive proxy\nstatement to be filed with the SEC not later than 120 days after December 31, 2023 in respect of the Annual Meeting of VSE's\nstockholders scheduled to be held on May 21, 2024 (the \"Proxy Statement\").\nITEM 10.
