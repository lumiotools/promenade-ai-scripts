We are pioneering a business model that aims to enable customers to\nintegrate next-generation truck technology, hydrogen fueling and charging infrastructure, and\nrelated maintenance. By creating this ecosystem, we and our strategic business partners and\nsuppliers expect to build a long-term competitive advantage for clean technology vehicles and\nnext generation fueling solutions.\nOur expertise lies in design, innovation, software, and engineering. We assemble, integrate, and\ncommission our vehicles in collaboration with our business partners and suppliers. Our approach\nhas always been to leverage strategic partnerships to help lower cost, increase capital efficiency,\nand accelerate speed to market.\nGREEN BOND FRAMEWORK | 2023 3\nOU R P U RP OSE\nOur vision is to be the zero-emissions transportation industry leader. We plan to realize this\nvision through world-class strategic partnerships, groundbreaking research and development,\nand a revolutionary business model.\nAccording to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and the European Environment\nAgency (“EEA”), the transportation industry causes an estimated 25% to 30% of U.S. and EU\ngreenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. While heavy-duty trucking represents less than 10% of the\ntransportation industry by volume, it is responsible for approximately 40% of the transportation\nindustry’s GHG emissions according to the International Council on Clean Transportation (“ICCT”).\nWith expected expansion of e-commerce freight demands, we believe zero-emission vehicles are\ncrucial for a sustainable future.\nGREEN BOND FRAMEWORK | 2023 4\nO UR BUSINESS\nWe operate in two business units: Truck and Energy. The Truck business unit is developing and\ncommercializing battery-electric vehicles (“BEV”) and hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (“FCEV”),\nClass 8 trucks that provide environmentally friendly, cost-effective solutions to the short-haul,\nmedium-haul, and long-haul trucking sector. The Energy business unit is developing hydrogen\nfueling infrastructure to support our FCEV customers, as well as other third-party customers.\nWe believe the key differentiator of our business model is our planned hydrogen fueling ecosystem,\nwhich includes (1) participation in hydrogen production projects and hydrogen procurement, (2)\nSource: 2022 10-K\nhydrogen distribution, and (3) hydrogen storage and dispensing. Historically, investing in alternative\nfuel vehicles has represented a high risk for both original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), and\ncustomers due to the uncertainty of the fueling infrastructure. Existing fuel providers have limited\nincentive to deploy the required resources and capital to develop an alternative fuel infrastructure\ndue to a lack of known demand. The inability to tackle both sides of this equation has prohibited\nhydrogen from reaching its full potential. Our approach aims to solve this \"chicken or the egg\"\nproblem, by pairing fueling demand from our FCEV trucks to the refueling infrastructure to reduce\nthe risk of developing the infrastructure while giving our customers the assurance that fuel will be\navailable where and when they need it. We believe this strategy could help unlock hydrogen's\npotential as the fuel of the future.\nCONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE\nGREEN BOND FRAMEWORK | 2023 5\nOUR BUSINESS continued\nFor the BEV and FCEV, we offer both direct sale and lease models through our dealer network. For\nFCEV, we expect that our go-to-market strategy will initially be to provide truck customers with a\nstand-alone hydrogen supply agreement that charges customers based on the volume consumed,\nalthough alternative structures may be available, especially in the early stages of the FCEV roll-out.\nIn the future, we, along with our dealer network, aim to provide integrated offerings of trucks and\nfueling solutions, which may include a combination of truck, hydrogen fuel, and/or maintenance.\nWe believe our hydrogen fueling ecosystem will provide a competitive advantage and help accelerate\nthe adoption of our FCEV. We believe our product portfolio and planned hydrogen fueling ecosystem\nwill provide a key strategic advantage that differentiates us from competitors and will allow us to\nprovide significant and valuable innovation to the global heavy-duty commercial vehicle market and\nthe related fueling and maintenance markets. In the future, we anticipate other Truck OEMs planning\nto launch FCEVs in the US market will be interested in leveraging the hydrogen infrastructure that\nNikola will be establishing with its partners, further spurring FCEV adoption.\nGREEN BOND FRAMEWORK | 2023 6\nOU R P RODU CT P ORTFOLI O\nH Y DRO GEN -EL EC TRIC BA T T ERY -EL EC T RIC\nAs the commercial transportation sector transitions towards zero-emission solutions, we believe\nthere will be a need to offer tailored solutions that meet the needs of each customer. By offering\nboth BEV (for short and medium-haul, city, regional, and drayage deliveries) and FCEV (for medium\nand long-haul) solutions, we believe we are positioned to change the commercial transportation\nsector by providing solutions that address a range of customer needs.\nBy designing our BEV and FCEV trucks on a common platform, key systems such as the high voltage\nbattery and other components can be incorporated in both powertrain offerings. Moreover, our\nproprietary architecture and controls strategies result in efficient vehicle operation in a wide range\nof applications.\nGREEN BOND FRAMEWORK | 2023 7\nO U R APPRO ACH TO\nSUSTAINABIL ITY\nOur core mission is to combat climate change by globally\ntransforming the transportation industry. Our investment in\nclean transportation and energy technology provides a\ncomprehensive strategy for reducing carbon emissions.\nWe remain committed to investing capital to continue to\ndevelop and innovate clean technology. Having a strong\nenvironmental, social and governance (“ESG”) program is core\nto our mission. To develop and execute our strategy we have\nappointed a senior manager over ESG and partnered with a\nthird party to perform a voluntary ESG materiality assessment.\nBased on the results of the assessment, we believe we have\ndeveloped meaningful goals, programs, and metrics.\nWe strive to increase disclosure on the priority ESG topics we\ndetermine to be of greatest significance to our business and\nstakeholders. We have included ESG in the charter of our\nsustainability, nominating and corporate governance\ncommittee and are actively establishing processes to have\nboard and executive guidance, and input and oversight of our\nsustainability strategy, programs, and performance.\nNikola’s sustainability strategy includes:\n▪ Prioritize waste diversion and circular economy principles.\n▪ Source hydrogen with the carbon intensity that matches our\ncustomers’ carbon reduction goals and Total Cost of\nOwnership (TCO) economics.\n▪ Measure and disclose operation and product GHG emissions.\nOn average, we estimate that one Nikola truck avoids\napproximately 106 metric tons of CO per year.*\n2\n*Assumes replacement of a class 8 diesel truck with an average of 6 miles per gallon, 62,751 annual miles.\nUses 2022 US EPA emission factors and specified averages.\nGREEN BOND FRAMEWORK | 2023 8\nAL IG NM ENT W ITH TH E G REEN\nBO ND PRINCIPL ES, 2021\nThe Green Bond Principles, 2021 (with June 2022 Appendix I) (“GBP”) are voluntary process guidelines\nthat were developed through collaboration between members and observers of the International\nCapital Markets Association (“ICMA”).

Medium and heavy-duty trucks\nproduce more emissions than passenger cars and rail combined. Our commitment – our mission, really -\nto improving air quality, avoiding emissions, and mitigating our contributions to climate change is why\nmost of us work for Nikola.\nWhat we are most proud of, besides our dedicated team, is bringing our battery electric truck to market\nwhile developing and launching our hydrogen fuel cell electric truck shortly thereafter. We are a small\norganization, and in my opinion, the best in the industry. We move and pivot quickly, understand the\nmarket, and evolve with our customers’ needs while staying true to our mission. What we accomplished\nin 2023, including successes and overcoming setbacks, was simply astonishing.\nAnd as of today, hundreds of Nikola zero-emissions trucks are on the road, delivering goods.\nBut the sustainability bar keeps on raising, and we are doubling down on our marketplace commitments\nto evolve our zero-emissions technologies and products to best suit our customers’ needs, as well as\ncontinue to develop safety practices for our modular refuelers and in our manufacturing plant. Most\nimportantly, we #FollowNone when it means doing the right thing for people, the planet, and the drivers\nthat are on the front lines.\ncontinued on next page\n2 SUSTAINABILITY IMPACT REPORT | 2023\ncontinued from previous page\nIn many ways, 2023 may prove to be the most important and critical year for Nikola. We launched our\nhydrogen FCEV into the market in Q3 – the first Class 8 truck of its kind assembled in the U.S. available\nfor sale today in the U.S. and Canada. To have the honor of being first comes with trials and celebrations.\nWe had no defined path to follow, but the beacon of our mission, our commitment to zero emissions and\nour faith that we were – and are - leading the North American trucking industry towards the right side of\nhistory.\nIt’s an honor to be the CEO of Nikola, and I thank you for joining us on this sustainability journey.\nSteve Girsky\nPresident and CEO\nNIKOLA 2023 COMPANY HIGHLIGHTS:\n▪ Celebrated the commercial launch ▪ Nikola expanded presence to\nof our hydrogen fuel cell electric Canada with Nikola Tre BEV and\ntruck, the Nikola Tre FCEV FCEV trucks and hydrogen modular\nrefueler order from Alberta Motor\n▪ Nikola celebrated 100 sale order\nTransport Association\nmilestone for Nikola Tre hydrogen\nFCEV class 8 truck ▪ Launch of our first hydrogen fuel\ncell truck modular refueler\n▪ Announced expansion of dealer\nsales and service network into ▪ Introduction of our new hydrogen\nCanada in collaboration with ITD energy brand, HYLA, with refueling\nIndustries locations launched in California\n▪ Nikola hydrogen FCEV class 8 truck ▪ PGT Trucking, Nikola and Nucor\nwas named winner in the collaborate to launch clean energy\nSustainable Product category of the supply chain initiative\n2023 Altair Enlighten Award\nSUSTAINABILITY IMPACT REPORT | 2023 3\nW HO W E ARE\nNikola Corporation’s mission is clear: We are leading the way for a zero-emission world, starting\nwith the transportation industry.

The 2023 year for this inventory is for the period\nJanuary 1st to December 31, 2023.\n“Operational Control” was selected as the consolidation approach to inform our organizational boundary in\nalignment with the GHG Protocol.\nThe inventory includes all Nikola and Hyla locations.\nScope 2 emissions are calculated using a location-based methodology.\nWhere utility data was not available, the United States Energy Information Administration (EIA)’s Commercial\nBuildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) data was utilized based on each building’s primary function\n(office, warehouse, manufacturing, etc.), building size (sq.ft), and geographic location. CBECS is a national\nsample survey that collects information on U.S. commercial buildings including energy-related building\ncharacteristics and energy usage data (such as natural gas or electricity consumption).\nNearly all energy use in the commercial sector is associated with commercial activity buildings. CBECS provides an\nanalysis of building structures, activities, and equipment to evaluate energy use within the commercial sector. The\ndata used is from the most recent publicly-available CBECS survey results at the time of calculation.\nUsing the purchase-based method, Nikola is accounting for emissions based on top-ups of refrigerants during the\nreporting year.\nFor mobile combustion fuel-based calculations, the fuel type selected was based on the majority fuel used for the\nreporting year.\n“Manufacturing facility” includes our Coolidge, Arizona site only. “Headquarters” includes our Phoenix, Arizona\nsites. “Other” includes all mobile assets and all other sites.\nRelevant Emission Factors include:\n▪ Stationary Combustion: US EPA Emission Factor Hub (2023)\n▪ Mobile Combustion, distance-based and fuel-based calculation: U.S. EPA Emission Factor Hub (2023)\n▪ Refrigeration, purchase-based : GWP set from IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR 4/5)\n▪ Location-based electricity: U.S. EPA eGRID 2022 Sub Region (Publication Year 2024)\nSUSTAINABILITY IMPACT REPORT | 2023 35"

With every truck delivered and fueled at our HYLA stations, we continue to deliver proof points to the market that zero-emission trucks are driving the future of Class 8 mobility.” \n\n**Hydrogen Fuel Cell Electric Truck** We delivered record sales of 88 FCEVs to our dealer network, up 22% from last quarter. On the retail front, we continued to see strong organic growth from existing end fleets. National fleet partners such as [Kenan Advantage Group](https://www.nikolamotor.com/nestle-purina-petcare-debuts-use-of-hydrogen-fuel-cell-electric-semi-truck-in-california) and [DHL Supply Chain recently](https://www.nikolamotor.com/dhl-supply-chain-and-diageo-north-america-power-up-sustainability-partnership-with-deployment-of-hydrogen-fuel-cell-trucks) announced deployment of [Nikola FCEVs](https://www.nikolamotor.com/tre-fcev) and noted the important role we play in not only helping them meet their sustainability goals, but those of their end customers, which includes Nestlé and Diageo.\n\nWe expanded our dealer network for the first time since the launch of our FCEV with [the addition of GTS Group](https://www.nikolamotor.com/gts-group-joins-nikola-dealership-network), in Southern California. GTS, a successful traditional truck dealership, recently introduced a new division, created for the sales and service of Nikola trucks called “Next Generation Truck” or NGT. This additional dealer brings the number of Nikola sales and service locations up to nineteen across the U.S. \n\nWe reiterate FCEV volume guidance of 300-350 trucks by year-end.\n\n**HYLA Energy** We expect to deliver 10 HYLA fueling solutions by year-end. We are focusing our strategy on providing more support at existing stations to better serve our customers as we scale. Operationally, over the lifetime of the entire HYLA network, we have recorded more than 5900 fueling events, dispensing more than 210 metric tons of hydrogen, for an average of 36kg per fill. The year-to-date ramp-up in mobile hydrogen refueling stations has been very strong. Since we began measuring commercial fueling operations in Q1, total hydrogen dispensing has grown nearly 350% year-to-date.\n\n**Battery-Electric Truck** We are excited that the [BEV “2.0”](https://www.nikolamotor.com/tre-bev) is back on the road, hauling freight, and validating its use case. Since putting the BEV 2.0 back into service, 19 end fleets have accumulated more than 715K in-service road miles. The BEV 2.0 has been the truck of choice for our end fleets not only for its performance but also to meet the sustainability goals of end fleet partners. Program-to-date, we’ve returned 78 BEVs back to the market to overwhelmingly positive feedback.\n\n**Third Quarter Operational and Financial Highlights**\n\n![1nikola financial highlights 24q3](https://www.nikolamotor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/1nikola_financial_highlights_24q3.png.webp)Nikola Corporation Reports Third Quarter 2024 Results 10\n\n**Webcast and Conference Call Information** Nikola will host a webcast to discuss its third quarter results and business progress at 7:30 a.m. Pacific Time (10:30 a.m. Eastern Time) on October 31, 2024.

The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, and certain other items determined by the Company. Non-GAAP net loss is defined as net loss adjusted for stock-based compensation expense and certain other items determined by the Company. Non-GAAP net loss per share, basic and diluted is defined as non-GAAP net loss divided by weighted average basic and diluted shares outstanding. These non-GAAP measures are not substitutes for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) and should not be considered as an alternative to any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP.\n\nThe Company believes that presenting these non-GAAP measures provides useful supplemental information to investors about the Company in understanding and evaluating its operating results, enhancing the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects, and allowing for greater transparency with respect to key financial metrics used by its management in financial and operational-decision making. However, there are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP measures and their nearest GAAP equivalents. For example, other companies may calculate non-GAAP measures differently or may use other measures to calculate their financial performance, and therefore any non-GAAP measures the Company uses may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\n\n![2nikola ccsoo 24q3](https://www.nikolamotor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2nikola_ccsoo_24q3-795x1024.png.webp)Nikola Corporation Reports Third Quarter 2024 Results 11 ![3nikola ccsoo 24q3b](https://www.nikolamotor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/3nikola_ccsoo_24q3b.png.webp)Nikola Corporation Reports Third Quarter 2024 Results 12 ![4nikola ccbs 24q3](https://www.nikolamotor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/4nikola_ccbs_24q3-902x1024.png.webp)Nikola Corporation Reports Third Quarter 2024 Results 13 ![5nikola ccsocf 24q3](https://www.nikolamotor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/5nikola_ccsocf_24q3-906x1024.png.webp)Nikola Corporation Reports Third Quarter 2024 Results 14 ![6nikola ccsocf 24q3b](https://www.nikolamotor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/6nikola_ccsocf_24q3b.png.webp)Nikola Corporation Reports Third Quarter 2024 Results 15 ![7nikola gaap 24q3](https://www.nikolamotor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7nikola_gaap_24q3-765x1024.png.webp)Nikola Corporation Reports Third Quarter 2024 Results 16 ![8nikola gaap 24q3b](https://www.nikolamotor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/8nikola_gaap_24q3b.png.webp)Nikola Corporation Reports Third Quarter 2024 Results 17\n\n**INVESTOR INQUIRIES:**investors@nikolamotor.com\n"

We are _the_ catalyst to disrupt Class 8 trucking to make zero-emission a reality,” said Steve Girsky, President and CEO of Nikola. “We are the only OEM with Class 8 FCEVs commercially available in North America today. Our trucks are put to the test every day by end fleet users, hauling freight and delivering to their customers. Q2 is an example of how we’re approaching the intersection of mission and reality and how Nikola is out front, charting the course.”\n\n**Hydrogen Fuel Cell Electric Truck**\n\nIn Q2, we exceeded the high-end of the guidance range by delivering 72 [hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs)](https://www.nikolamotor.com/tre-fcev) to our dealer network. That makes 147 wholesaled FCEVs in the first three quarters of serial production. Last quarter, we talked about the importance of expanding our reach to meet the demands of end fleet users virtually anywhere in North America. [Walmart Canada](https://www.nikolamotor.com/walmart-canada-becomes-the-first-major-retailer-in-canada-to-introduce-a-hydrogen-fuel-cell-electric-semi-truck) is the first major retailer in Canada to introduce a hydrogen fuel cell electric semi-truck to its fleet. We also received repeat orders from two national accounts. Nikola’s Profitability Flywheel is beginning to gain momentum with these national accounts, as each of these end fleets grows its zero-emission presence to achieve decarbonization goals.\n\nWe continue to delight fleet users with data-driven quality and performance. To date, our FCEV end fleets have traveled more than 550K miles with an average fuel economy of 7.2 mi/kg, validating our performance benchmark. We collect field data every day and the numbers bear out. On a converted basis, our FCEVs outperformed the average Class 8 truck on fuel economy and avoidance of tailpipe emissions. We estimate the average miles per gallon (mpg) diesel equivalent of our FCEV is 8.0, or 23% better, than the Class 8 fuel economy average of 6.5/diesel gallon equivalent (DGE) per the Department of Energy. Moreover, in-service FCEVs have consumed more than 77 metric tons of hydrogen dispensed at various Nikola fueling solutions. In total, we estimate our FCEV end fleet operations have avoided approximately 867 metric tons of CO2 tailpipe emissions.*\n\n**HYLA Energy**\n\nWe’re delivering HYLA fueling solutions to support volume ramp up. As a strategy, we are launching stations and deploying assets where we anticipate demand. It is our objective to stay ahead of FCEV deployment so that fueling solutions are ready and available for end fleets. To that end, since the Q1 earnings call, we opened a [HYLA branded station in Toronto, Ontario, Canada](https://www.nikolamotor.com/nikola-and-itd-industries-launch-first-hydrogen-station-in-ontario) and completed commissioning a modular station in Santa Fe Springs in Southern Calif. We also added another modular refueler at our [Ontario, Calif. station](https://www.nikolamotor.com/ontario-station/), doubling capacity. We recently had a record day in Ontario, with 28 FCEVs refueled and more than 850kg of hydrogen dispensed in one day. Likewise, through our work with Shell, our fleet customers have been able to fuel at Shell’s heavy-duty station in Ontario, CA, where density has been growing. Our stations run 24/7 to support the around-the-clock operations of our fleet users.\n\n**Constructive Green Policies**\n\nWe continued to maintain our dominant share of [HVIP vouchers in Calif](https://promotions.nikolamotor.com/hvip). At quarter-end, we had 99% of FCEV and 23% of [battery-electric vehicle (BEV)](https://www.nikolamotor.com/the-nikola-tre-bev-reinventing-short-haul-transportation) HVIP vouchers. We also created alternative revenue streams from the sale of regulatory credits. We recognized our first sale agreement of NOx and PM credits in the quarter. We expect this revenue stream to grow as volume increases each model year.\n\n**Battery-Electric Truck**\n\nWe continued to make progress returning BEVs to our dealer network and end fleet users. We remain on track to complete the recall program by year-end 2024. Feedback on returned units has been overwhelmingly positive and over-the-air updates continue to reach customers.\n\n![1nikola financial highlights 24q2](https://www.nikolamotor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/1nikola_financial_highlights_24q2.png.webp)\n\n**Webcast and Conference Call Information**\n\nNikola will host a webcast to discuss its second quarter results and business progress at 7:30 a.m. Pacific Time (10:30 a.m. Eastern Time) on August 9, 2024.

The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, and certain other items determined by the Company. Non-GAAP net loss is defined as net loss adjusted for stock-based compensation expense and certain other items determined by the Company. Non-GAAP net loss per share, basic and diluted is defined as non-GAAP net loss divided by weighted average basic and diluted shares outstanding. These non-GAAP measures are not substitutes for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) and should not be considered as an alternative to any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP.\n\nThe Company believes that presenting these non-GAAP measures provides useful supplemental information to investors about the Company in understanding and evaluating its operating results, enhancing the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects, and allowing for greater transparency with respect to key financial metrics used by its management in financial and operational-decision making. However, there are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP measures and their nearest GAAP equivalents. For example, other companies may calculate non-GAAP measures differently or may use other measures to calculate their financial performance, and therefore any non-GAAP measures the Company uses may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\n\n![2nikola csoo 24q2](https://www.nikolamotor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2nikola_csoo_24q2.png.webp)\n\n![3nikola csoo 24q2b](https://www.nikolamotor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/3nikola_csoo_24q2b.png.webp)\n\n![4nikola cbs 24q2](https://www.nikolamotor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4nikola_cbs_24q2.png.webp)\n\n![5nikola csocf 24q2](https://www.nikolamotor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/5nikola_csocf_24q2.png.webp)\n\n![6nikola csocf 24q2b](https://www.nikolamotor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/6nikola_csocf_24q2b.png.webp)\n\n![7nikola gaap 24q2](https://www.nikolamotor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7nikola_gaap_24q2.png.webp)\n\n![8nikola gaap 24q2b](https://www.nikolamotor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/8nikola_gaap_24q2b.png.webp)\n\nI**NVESTOR INQUIRIES:**\n\n[investors@nikolamotor.com](https://www.nikolamotor.com/contact-ir)\n"

And please keep that in mind – we are in the execution phase, not the planning or concepting phase,” said Steve Girsky, President and CEO of Nikola. “Last quarter, I talked about getting on the field with the first deliveries of our hydrogen fuel cell electric trucks. Today, we are executing plays, competing, and cultivating more green shoots as we expand upon current markets and enter new ones.”\n\n**Hydrogen Fuel Cell Electric Truck** At the end of Q1, we exceeded the high-end of the guidance range by delivering 40 [FCEVs](https://nikolamotor.com/tre-fcev), all designated for end fleets. That makes 75 wholesaled FCEVs in the first two quarters of serial production. We’re seeing green shoots with repeat and new fleets, some in new markets such as N.Y. While our initial focus has been Calif. and Canada, we can expand our reach to meet the demands of end fleet users virtually anywhere in the U.S.\n\nProgram-to-date, Nikola FCEVs have accumulated over 830,000 miles with an average fuel economy exceeding our target of 7.2 mi/kg. We’re doing what it takes to delight prospective and existing customers with the best possible experience. \n\n**Energy** Our HYLA team is executing its Hydrogen Highway Plan, and we remain on track. Previously we had committed to nine additional HYLA refueling stations in Calif. by year-end 2024. Now we are expecting to provide nine hydrogen fueling solutions by mid-year 2024 and 14 by year-end 2024. These solutions include [modular fuelers](https://nikolamotor.com/energy#modular-solutions) and partner stations in Calif., Canada and our home station at our Coolidge, Ariz. manufacturing facility. We want to emphasize that building the hydrogen ecosystem requires industry wide collaboration for the benefit of all. We need partners and they come in different forms and stages of infrastructure development. The shared mission is to build an open ecosystem accessible to all. \n\n**Constructive Green Policies** We maintained our dominant market share of [HVIP vouchers](https://promotions.nikolamotor.com/hvip) for Class 8 FCEVs, ending the quarter with 362 of 367 or 99% of the unredeemed vouchers that were requested in 2023 through March 2024. On the Class 8 [BEV](https://nikolamotor.com/the-nikola-tre-bev-reinventing-short-haul-transportation) side, we ended Q1 with 85 unredeemed vouchers or 30% market share. While HVIP is only one program, we’re encouraged by the progress in constructive green policies. Two in particular, help us fund our business. CARB’s Heavy-Duty Omnibus Regulation allows us to monetize the NOx and particulate matter or PM credits we generate from selling zero-emissions trucks on a model year basis. We are pleased to confirm that Nikola has executed its first sale agreement for credits generated for Model Year 22 and revenue from this transaction will be recognized in Q2 2024. We expect future revenue from the sale of CARB credits to grow over time and be meaningful. \n\n**Battery-Electric Truck** Lastly, we completed the first delivery of a remediated BEV in Q1. We continue to prioritize returning BEVs to customers and dealers and now expect to complete remediation of these units by year-end 2024. Our ability to sell Nikola’s on-hand inventory, however, will be dependent upon future battery supply; we now expect to opportunistically sell on-hand inventory for revenue in 2025. \n\nWe’ve also taken this opportunity to “future proof” the BEV 2.0, as it now shares significant software commonality with the battery and operating systems on the FCEV, allowing customers to receive [next-generation upgrades seamlessly over-the-air](https://nikolamotor.com/digital-products) as they are deployed. We’ve kept our fleet users front and center as we’ve engineered over-the-air enhancements, including dynamic data gathering for predictive diagnostics, improved truck performance and field issue identification. We’ve also deployed new Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) features to effectively manage powertrain demand in aggressive route conditions such as mountainous driving.\n\n**First Quarter Financial Highlights**\n\n![1nikola financial highlights 24q1](https://nikolamotor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/1nikola_financial_highlights_24q1.png)Nikola Corporation Reports First Quarter 2024 Results 10\n\n**Webcast and Conference Call Information** Nikola will host a webcast to discuss its first quarter results and business progress at 7:30 a.m. Pacific Time (10:30 a.m. Eastern Time) on May 7, 2024.

For example, other companies may calculate non-GAAP measures differently or may use other measures to calculate their financial performance, and therefore any non-GAAP measures the Company uses may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\n\n![2nikola csoo 24q1](https://nikolamotor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2nikola_csoo_24q1-907x1024.png)Nikola Corporation Reports First Quarter 2024 Results 11 ![3nikola csoo 24q1b2](https://nikolamotor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/3nikola_csoo_24q1b2.png)Nikola Corporation Reports First Quarter 2024 Results 12 ![4nikola cbs 24q1](https://nikolamotor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/4nikola_cbs_24q1-895x1024.png)Nikola Corporation Reports First Quarter 2024 Results 13 ![5nikola csocf 24q1](https://nikolamotor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/5nikola_csocf_24q1-802x1024.png)Nikola Corporation Reports First Quarter 2024 Results 14 ![6nikola csocf 24q1b](https://nikolamotor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/6nikola_csocf_24q1b.png)Nikola Corporation Reports First Quarter 2024 Results 15 ![7nikola gaap 24q1](https://nikolamotor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/7nikola_gaap_24q1-919x1024.png)Nikola Corporation Reports First Quarter 2024 Results 16 ![8nikola gaap 24q1b2](https://nikolamotor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/8nikola_gaap_24q1b2.png)Nikola Corporation Reports First Quarter 2024 Results 17\n\n**INVESTOR INQUIRIES:**investors@nikolamotor.com\n"
