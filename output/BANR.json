$45.2 Million, or $1.30 Per Diluted Share, for Third Quarter 2024; Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.48 Per Share\n\nCompany Release - 10/16/2024 4:00 PM ET\n\nDownload the PDF version PDF Format (opens in new window)\n\nWALLA WALLA, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--  Banner Corporation (NASDAQ: BANR) (“Banner”), the parent company of Banner Bank, today reported net income of $45.2 million, or $1.30 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $39.8 million, or $1.15 per diluted share, for the preceding quarter and $45.9 million, or $1.33 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2023. Net interest income was $135.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $132.5 million in the preceding quarter and $141.8 million in the third quarter a year ago. The increase in net interest income compared to the preceding quarter reflects an increase in interest-earning assets and net interest margin. The decrease in net interest income compared to the prior year quarter reflects an increase in funding costs, partially offset by an increase in yields on earning assets. Banner’s results for the preceding quarter included a $562,000 net loss on the sale of securities and for the third quarter a year ago a $2.7 million net loss recorded on the sale of securities, compared to no gain or loss during the current quarter as no securities were sold during the third quarter of 2024. Third quarter 2024 results included a $1.7 million provision for credit losses, down from $2.4 million in the preceding quarter and $2.0 million in the third quarter of 2023. \n\nNet income was $122.5 million, or $3.54 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $141.0 million, or $4.09 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included a $4.6 million provision for credit losses, a $5.5 million net loss on the sale of securities and a $1.1 million net decrease in the fair value adjustments on financial instruments carried at fair value, compared to an $8.3 million provision for credit losses, a $14.4 million net loss on the sale of securities and a $4.4 million net decrease in the fair value adjustments on financial instruments carried at fair value during the same period in 2023. \n\nBanner announced that its Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.48 per share payable November 15, 2024, to common shareholders of record on November 5, 2024. \n\n“Banner’s third quarter operating results reflect the continued successful execution of our super community bank strategy, which emphasizes growing new client relationships, maintaining our core funding position, promoting client loyalty and advocacy through our responsive service model, and sustaining a moderate risk profile,” said Mark Grescovich, President and CEO. “Our earnings for the third quarter of 2024 benefited from our solid year over year loan growth coupled with our expanded net interest margin. Additionally, Banner's credit metrics continue to be strong, our reserve for loan losses remained solid, and our capital base continues to be robust. We continue to benefit from a strong core deposit base that has been resilient in a highly competitive environment, with core deposits representing 89% of total deposits at quarter end. Banner has upheld its core values for the past 133 years, which are to do the right thing for our clients, communities, colleagues, company and shareholders; and to provide consistent and reliable strength through all economic cycles and change events.” \n\nAt September 30, 2024, Banner, on a consolidated basis, had $16.19 billion in assets, $11.07 billion in net loans and $13.54 billion in deposits. Banner operates 135 full-service branch offices, including branches located in eight of the top 20 largest western Metropolitan Statistical Areas by population. \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * Revenue was $153.7 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $149.7 million in the preceding quarter and $154.4 million in the third quarter a year ago. \n  * Adjusted revenue* (the total of net interest income and total non-interest income adjusted for the net gain or loss on the sale of securities and the net change in valuation of financial instruments) was $153.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $150.5 million in the preceding quarter and $157.7 million in the third quarter a year ago. \n  * Net interest income was $135.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $132.5 million in the preceding quarter and $141.8 million in the third quarter a year ago. \n  * Net interest margin, on a tax equivalent basis, was 3.72%, compared to 3.70% in the preceding quarter and 3.93% in the third quarter a year ago. \n  * Mortgage banking operations revenue was $3.2 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $3.0 million in the preceding quarter and $2.0 million in the third quarter a year ago. \n  * Return on average assets was 1.13%, compared to 1.02% in the preceding quarter and 1.17% in the third quarter a year ago. \n  * Net loans receivable increased 1% to $11.07 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to $10.99 billion at June 30, 2024, and increased 6% compared to $10.46 billion at September 30, 2023. \n  * Non-performing assets were $45.2 million, or 0.28% of total assets, at September 30, 2024, compared to $33.3 million, or 0.21% of total assets, at June 30, 2024 and $26.8 million, or 0.17% of total assets, at September 30, 2023. \n  * The allowance for credit losses - loans was $154.6 million, or 1.38% of total loans receivable, as of September 30, 2024, compared to $152.8 million, or 1.37% of total loans receivable, as of June 30, 2024 and $147.0 million, or 1.38% of total loans receivable, as of September 30, 2023. \n  * Total deposits increased to $13.54 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to $13.08 billion at June 30, 2024 and $13.17 billion at September 30, 2023. \n  * Core deposits represented 89% of total deposits at September 30, 2024. \n  * Dividends paid to shareholders were $0.48 per share in the quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n  * Common shareholders’ equity per share increased 6% to $52.06 at September 30, 2024, compared to $49.07 at the preceding quarter end, and increased 18% from $44.27 at September 30, 2023. \n  * Tangible common shareholders’ equity per share* increased 8% to $41.12 at September 30, 2024, compared to $38.12 at the preceding quarter end, and increased 24% from $33.22 at September 30, 2023. \n\n\n\n_*Non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) financial measure; See, “Additional Financial Information - Non-GAAP Financial Measures” on the final two pages of this press release for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures._\n\n**Income Statement Review**\n\nNet interest income was $135.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $132.5 million in the preceding quarter and $141.8 million in the third quarter a year ago. Net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis increased two basis points to 3.72% for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 3.70% in the preceding quarter, and decreased compared to 3.93% in the third quarter a year ago. Net interest margin for the current quarter benefited from increased yields on loans due to new loans being originated at higher interest rates and adjustable rate loans repricing higher, partially offset by increased funding costs. On September 18, 2024, the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve System decreased the target range for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points, and as the change occurred late in the third quarter of 2024, it had minimal impact on our current quarter net interest margin. \n\nAverage yields on interest-earning assets increased eight basis points to 5.33% for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 5.25% for the preceding quarter, and increased compared to 4.94% in the third quarter a year ago. Average loan yields increased eight basis points to 6.04%, compared to 5.96% in the preceding quarter, and increased compared to 5.65% in the third quarter a year ago. The increase in average yields, especially loans, during the current quarter reflects the benefit of originating new loans at higher interest rates as well as adjustable rate loans repricing higher. \n\nTotal deposit costs increased 11 basis points to 1.61% in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 1.50% in the preceding quarter, and increased compared to 0.94% in the third quarter a year ago. The increase in deposit costs was due to a larger percentage of growth in higher costing deposits during the quarter. The average rate paid on borrowings increased one basis-point to 5.08% in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 5.07% in the preceding quarter, and increased compared to 4.64% in the third quarter a year ago. The total cost of funding liabilities increased seven basis points to 1.73% during the third quarter of 2024, compared to 1.66% in the preceding quarter, and increased compared to 1.08% in the third quarter a year ago. \n\nA $1.7 million provision for credit losses was recorded in the current quarter (comprised of a $2.0 million provision for credit losses - loans, a $262,000 recapture of provision for credit losses - unfunded loan commitments and a $13,000 recapture of provision for credit losses - held-to-maturity debt securities). This compares to a $2.4 million provision for credit losses in the prior quarter (comprised of a $2.0 million provision for credit losses - loans, a $430,000 provision for credit losses - unfunded loan commitments and a $14,000 recapture of provision for credit losses - held-to-maturity debt securities) and a $2.0 million provision for credit losses in the third quarter a year ago (comprised of a $2.9 million provision for credit losses - loans, a $346,000 provision for credit losses - unfunded loan commitments, a $1.3 million recapture of provision for credit losses - available for sale securities and a $12,000 recapture of provision for credit losses - held-to-maturity debt securities). The provision for credit losses for the current quarter primarily reflected an increase in the reserve for non-performing collateral dependent loans. \n\nTotal non-interest income was $18.1 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $17.2 million in the preceding quarter and $12.7 million in the third quarter a year ago. The increase in non-interest income during the current quarter compared to the preceding quarter was primarily due to a $562,000 decrease in the net loss recognized on the sale of securities. The increase in non-interest income during the current quarter compared to the prior year quarter was primarily due to a $1.1 million increase in mortgage banking operations revenue, a $2.7 million decrease in the net loss recognized on the sale of securities and a $693,000 decrease in the net loss recognized for fair value adjustments on financial instruments carried at fair value. Total non-interest income was $46.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $30.4 million for the same period a year earlier. \n\nMortgage banking operations revenue was $3.2 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $3.0 million in the preceding quarter and $2.0 million in the third quarter a year ago. The volume of one- to four-family loans sold during the current quarter increased compared to the preceding and prior year quarters, although overall volumes remained low due to reduced refinancing and purchase activity in the current rate environment. The increase in mortgage banking operations revenue from the preceding quarter was also impacted by increases in the pricing on the one- to four-family loans sold during the current quarter. Home purchase activity accounted for 88% of one- to four-family mortgage loan originations in the third quarter of 2024, 89% in the preceding quarter and 90% in the third quarter of 2023. \n\nTotal non-interest expense was $96.3 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $98.1 million in the preceding quarter and $95.9 million in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in non-interest expense for the current quarter compared to the prior quarter reflects a $2.0 million decrease in salary and employee benefits, primarily resulting from decreased medical premiums expense and unemployment and workers compensation expense. The increase in non-interest expense for the current quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago primarily reflects increases in salary and employee benefits and real estate operations, net expenses, partially offset by a decrease in professional and legal expenses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total non-interest expense was $292.1 million, compared to $285.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Banner’s efficiency ratio was 62.63% for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 65.53% in the preceding quarter and 62.10% in the same quarter a year ago. Banner’s adjusted efficiency ratio, a non-GAAP financial measure, was 61.27% for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 63.60% in the preceding quarter and 59.00% in the year ago quarter. See, “Additional Financial Information - Non-GAAP Financial Measures” on the final two pages of this press release for a discussion and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. \n\n**Balance Sheet Review**\n\nTotal assets increased to $16.19 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to $15.82 billion at June 30, 2024, and $15.51 billion at September 30, 2023. Securities and interest-bearing deposits held at other banks totaled $3.50 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to $3.27 billion at June 30, 2024 and $3.44 billion at September 30, 2023. The increase compared to the prior quarter was primarily due to an increase in interest-bearing deposit balances. The average effective duration of the securities portfolio was approximately 6.3 years at September 30, 2024, compared to 6.8 years at September 30, 2023. \n\nTotal loans receivable increased to $11.22 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to $11.14 billion at June 30, 2024, and $10.61 billion at September 30, 2023. One- to four-family residential loans decreased 2% to $1.58 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to $1.60 billion at June 30, 2024, and increased 9% compared to $1.44 billion at September 30, 2023. The decrease in one- to four-family residential loans from the prior quarter was primarily the result of the transfer of $47.5 million of one- to four-family residential loans from portfolio to held for sale. The increase in one- to four-family residential loans from the prior year was primarily the result of one- to four-family construction loans converting to one- to four-family portfolio loans upon the completion of the construction phase and new loan production. Multifamily real estate loans increased 24% to $889.9 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $717.1 million at June 30, 2024, and increased 16% compared to $766.6 million at September 30, 2023. The increase in multifamily real estate loans from June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was primarily the result of the conversion of multifamily construction loans to the multifamily portfolio upon the completion of the construction phase. The increase from the prior year also reflects the transfer of $43.5 million of multifamily loans held for sale to the held for investment loan portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2023, partially offset by the transfer of certain affordable housing loans to small balance commercial real estate loans. Construction, land and land development loans decreased 9% to $1.53 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to $1.68 billion at June 30, 2024, and increased 1% compared to $1.50 billion at September 30, 2023. The decrease in construction, land and land development loans was primarily the result of multifamily construction loans converting to multifamily portfolio loans upon the completion of the construction phase. Agricultural business loans increased 4% to $346.7 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $334.6 million at June 30, 2024 and increased 4% compared to $334.6 million at September 30, 2023, primarily due to advances on agricultural lines of credit. \n\nLoans held for sale were $78.8 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $13.4 million at June 30, 2024 and $54.2 million at September 30, 2023. One- to four-family residential mortgage held for sale loans sold in the current quarter totaled $95.0 million, compared to $75.0 million in the preceding quarter and $87.3 million in the third quarter a year ago. The increase in loans held for sale was primarily the result of the transfer of $47.5 million of one- to four-family residential loans from portfolio to held for sale during the current quarter. The increase from the prior year was partially offset by the previously mentioned transfer of multifamily loans held for sale to the held for investment loan portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2023. There were no multifamily loans held for sale at September 30, 2024 or June 30, 2024. \n\nTotal deposits increased to $13.54 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to $13.08 billion at June 30, 2024 and $13.17 billion a year ago. Core deposits increased 4% to $12.02 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to $11.55 billion at June 30, 2024, and increased 3% compared to $11.72 billion at September 30, 2023. The increase in core deposits compared to the prior quarter primarily reflects normal seasonal increases primarily from agricultural clients. The increase in core deposits compared to the prior year quarter primarily reflects an increase in third-party insured sweep accounts. Core deposits were 89% of total deposits at September 30, 2024, compared to 88% of total deposits at June 30, 2024 and 89% of total deposits at September 30, 2023. Certificates of deposit decreased slightly to $1.52 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to $1.53 billion at June 30, 2024, and increased 4% compared to $1.46 billion a year earlier. The decrease in certificates of deposit during the current quarter compared to the preceding quarter was principally due to a $55.0 million decrease in brokered deposits. The increase in certificates of deposit during the current quarter compared to the third quarter a year ago was principally due to clients seeking higher yields moving funds from core deposit accounts to higher yielding certificates of deposits, partially offset by a $112.5 million decrease in brokered deposits. \n\nFHLB advances were $230.0 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $398.0 million at June 30, 2024 and $140.0 million a year ago. At September 30, 2024, off-balance sheet liquidity included additional borrowing capacity of $3.23 billion at the FHLB and $1.53 billion at the Federal Reserve as well as federal funds line of credit agreements with other financial institutions of $125.0 million. \n\nAt September 30, 2024, total common shareholders’ equity was $1.79 billion, or 11.08% of total assets, compared to $1.69 billion or 10.69% of total assets at June 30, 2024, and $1.52 billion or 9.81% of total assets at September 30, 2023. The increase in total common shareholders’ equity at September 30, 2024 compared to June 30, 2024 was due to a $28.4 million increase in retained earnings as a result of $45.2 million in net income, partially offset by the accrual of $16.7 million of cash dividends during the third quarter of 2024, as well as a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss of $72.0 million as the result of an increase in the fair value of the security portfolio. At September 30, 2024, tangible common shareholders’ equity, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $1.42 billion, or 8.96% of tangible assets, compared to $1.31 billion, or 8.51% of tangible assets, at June 30, 2024, and $1.14 billion, or 7.54% of tangible assets, a year ago. See, “Additional Financial Information - Non-GAAP Financial Measures” on the final two pages of this press release for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. \n\nBanner and Banner Bank continue to maintain capital levels in excess of the requirements to be categorized as “well-capitalized.” At September 30, 2024, Banner’s estimated common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.30%, its estimated Tier 1 leverage capital to average assets ratio was 10.91%, and its estimated total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio was 14.92%. These regulatory capital ratios are estimates, pending completion and filing of Banner’s regulatory reports. \n\n**Credit Quality**\n\nThe allowance for credit losses - loans was $154.6 million, or 1.38% of total loans receivable and 359% of non-performing loans, at September 30, 2024, compared to $152.8 million, or 1.37% of total loans receivable and 498% of non-performing loans, at June 30, 2024, and $147.0 million, or 1.38% of total loans receivable and 560% of non-performing loans, at September 30, 2023. In addition to the allowance for credit losses - loans, Banner maintains an allowance for credit losses - unfunded loan commitments, which was $13.8 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $14.0 million at June 30, 2024, and $15.0 million at September 30, 2023. Net loan charge-offs totaled $230,000 in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $245,000 in the preceding quarter and $663,000 in the third quarter a year ago. Non-performing loans were $43.0 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $30.7 million at June 30, 2024, and $26.3 million a year ago. \n\nAn increase in adversely classified loans, offset in part by payoffs and paydowns, resulted in total substandard loans of $150.1 million as of September 30, 2024. This compares to $122.0 million as of June 30, 2024 and $124.5 million a year ago. \n\nTotal non-performing assets were $45.2 million, or 0.28% of total assets, at September 30, 2024, compared to $33.3 million, or 0.21% of total assets, at June 30, 2024, and $26.8 million, or 0.17% of total assets, a year ago. \n\n**Conference Call**\n\nBanner will host a conference call on Thursday, October 17, 2024, at 8:00 a.m. PDT, to discuss its third quarter results.

You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date such statements are made and based only on information then actually known to Banner. Banner does not undertake and specifically disclaims any obligation to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances after the date of such statements. These statements may relate to future financial performance, strategic plans or objectives, revenues or earnings projections, or other financial information. By their nature, these statements are subject to numerous uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the statements and could negatively affect Banner’s operating and stock price performance._\n\n_Factors that could cause Banner’s actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, include but are not limited to, the following: (1) adverse impacts to economic conditions in our local market areas, other markets where the Company has lending relationships, or other aspects of the Company’s business operations or financial markets, including, without limitation, as a result of employment levels, labor shortages and the effects of inflation, a recession or slowed economic growth, or increased political instability due to acts of war; (2) changes in the interest rate environment, including increases or decreases in the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”) benchmark rate and duration at which such interest rate levels are maintained, which could affect our revenues and expenses, the value of assets and obligations, and the availability and cost of capital and liquidity; (3) the impact of inflation and the current and future monetary policies of the Federal Reserve in response thereto; (4) the effects of any federal government shutdown; (5) the impact of bank failures or adverse developments at other banks and related negative press about the banking industry in general on investor and depositor sentiment; (6) expectations regarding key growth initiatives and strategic priorities; (7) the credit risks of lending activities, including changes in the level and direction of loan delinquencies and write-offs and changes in estimates of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, which could necessitate additional provisions for credit losses, resulting both from loans originated and loans acquired from other financial institutions; (8) results of examinations by regulatory authorities, including the possibility that any such regulatory authority may, among other things, require increases in the allowance for credit losses or writing down of assets or impose restrictions or penalties with respect to Banner’s activities; (9) competitive pressures among depository institutions; (10) the effect of inflation on interest rate movements and their impact on client behavior and net interest margin; (11) the impact of repricing and competitors’ pricing initiatives on loan and deposit products; (12) fluctuations in real estate values; (13) the ability to adapt successfully to technological changes to meet clients’ needs and developments in the market place; (14) the ability to access cost-effective funding; (15) disruptions, security breaches or other adverse events, failures or interruptions in, or attacks on, information technology systems or on the third-party vendors who perform critical processing functions; (16) changes in financial markets; (17) changes in economic conditions in general and in Washington, Idaho, Oregon and California in particular; (18) the costs, effects and outcomes of litigation; (19) legislation or regulatory changes, including but not limited to changes in regulatory policies and principles, or the interpretation of regulatory capital or other rules, other governmental initiatives affecting the financial services industry and changes in federal and/or state tax laws or interpretations thereof by taxing authorities; (20) changes in accounting principles, policies or guidelines; (21) future acquisitions by Banner of other depository institutions or lines of business; (22) future goodwill impairment due to changes in Banner’s business or changes in market conditions; (23) effects of critical accounting policies and judgments, including the use of estimates in determining fair value of certain of our assets, which estimates may prove to be incorrect and result in significant declines in valuation; (24) environmental, social and governance goals and targets; (25) other economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory, and technological factors affecting our operations, pricing, products and services; and (26) other risks detailed from time to time in Banner’s other reports filed with and furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission including Banner’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Annual Reports on Form 10-K._\n\n** RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ** |  **Quarters Ended** |  **Nine Months Ended**  \n---|---|---  \n(in

Tangible common shareholders’ equity per share and the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets, and references to adjusted revenue, adjusted earnings, the adjusted return on average assets, the adjusted return on average equity and the adjusted efficiency ratio represent non-GAAP financial measures. Management has presented these non-GAAP financial measures in this earnings release because it believes that they provide useful and comparative information to assess trends in Banner’s core operations reflected in the current quarter’s results and facilitate the comparison of our performance with the performance of our peers. However, these non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental and are not a substitute for any analysis based on GAAP. Where applicable, comparable earnings information using GAAP financial measures is also presented.

$39.8 Million, or $1.15 Per Diluted Share, for Second Quarter 2024; Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.48 Per Share\n\nCompany Release - 7/17/2024 4:00 PM ET\n\nDownload the PDF version PDF Format (opens in new window)\n\nWALLA WALLA, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--  Banner Corporation (NASDAQ: BANR) (“Banner”), the parent company of Banner Bank, today reported net income of $39.8 million, or $1.15 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2024, compared to $37.6 million, or $1.09 per diluted share, for the preceding quarter and $39.6 million, or $1.15 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2023. Net interest income was $132.5 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared to $133.0 million in the preceding quarter and $142.5 million in the second quarter a year ago. The decrease in net interest income compared to the preceding quarter and prior year quarter reflects an increase in funding costs, partially offset by an increase in yields on earning assets. Banner’s second quarter 2024 results included a $562,000 net loss on the sale of securities, compared to a $4.9 million net loss on the sale of securities in the preceding quarter and a $4.5 million net loss on the sale of securities in the second quarter of 2023. Banner’s second quarter 2024 results also included a $2.4 million provision for credit losses, compared to a $520,000 provision for credit losses in the preceding quarter and a $6.8 million provision for credit losses in the second quarter of 2023. Net income was $77.4 million, or $2.24 per diluted share, for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to net income of $95.1 million, or $2.76 per diluted share, for the six months ended June 30, 2023. Banner’s results for the six months ended June 30, 2024 include a $2.9 million provision for credit losses, a $5.5 million net loss on the sale of securities and a $1.2 million net decrease in the fair value adjustments on financial instruments carried at fair value, compared to a $6.2 million provision for credit losses, an $11.8 million net loss on the sale of securities and a $3.7 million net decrease in the fair value adjustments on financial instruments carried at fair value during the same period in 2023. \n\nBanner announced that its Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.48 per share. The dividend will be payable August 16, 2024, to common shareholders of record on August 6, 2024. \n\n“Banner’s second quarter operating results reflect the continued successful execution of our super community bank strategy, which emphasizes strong relationship banking and a moderate risk profile,” said Mark Grescovich, President and CEO. “Our earnings for the second quarter of 2024 benefited from solid growth in loans and higher yields on interest-earning assets. The continued high interest rate environment and its effect on funding costs, however, resulted in moderate compression in our net interest margin during the quarter. We continue to maintain strong credit quality metrics and a solid reserve for potential credit losses. Additionally, we continue to benefit from a strong core deposit base that has been resilient in a highly competitive environment, with core deposits representing 88% of total deposits at quarter end. Banner has upheld its core values for the past 133 years, which are to do the right thing for our clients, communities, colleagues, company and shareholders; and to provide consistent and reliable strength through all economic cycles and change events.” \n\nAt June 30, 2024, Banner, on a consolidated basis, had $15.82 billion in assets, $10.99 billion in net loans and $13.08 billion in deposits. Banner operates 135 full-service branch offices, including branches located in eight of the top 20 largest western Metropolitan Statistical Areas by population. \n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * Revenue was $149.7 million for the second quarter of 2024, compared to $144.6 million in the preceding quarter and $150.9 million in the second quarter a year ago. \n  * Adjusted revenue* (the total of net interest income and total non-interest income adjusted for the net gain or loss on the sale of securities and the net change in valuation of financial instruments) was $150.5 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared to $150.4 million in the preceding quarter and $158.6 million in the second quarter a year ago. \n  * Net interest income was $132.5 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared to $133.0 million in the preceding quarter and $142.5 million in the second quarter a year ago. \n  * Net interest margin, on a tax equivalent basis, was 3.70%, compared to 3.74% in the preceding quarter and 4.00% in the second quarter a year ago. \n  * Mortgage banking operations revenue was $3.0 million for the second quarter of 2024, compared to $2.3 million in the preceding quarter and $1.7 million in the second quarter a year ago. \n  * Return on average assets was 1.02%, compared to 0.97% in the preceding quarter and 1.02% in the second quarter a year ago. \n  * Net loans receivable increased 3% to $10.99 billion at June 30, 2024, compared to $10.72 billion at March 31, 2024, and increased 6% compared to $10.33 billion at June 30, 2023. \n  * Non-performing assets were $33.3 million, or 0.21% of total assets, at June 30, 2024, compared to $29.9 million, or 0.19% of total assets, at March 31, 2024 and $28.7 million, or 0.18% of total assets, at June 30, 2023. \n  * The allowance for credit losses - loans was $152.8 million, or 1.37% of total loans receivable, as of June 30, 2024, compared to $151.1 million, or 1.39% of total loans receivable, as of March 31, 2024 and $144.7 million, or 1.38% of total loans receivable, as of June 30, 2023. \n  * Total deposits decreased to $13.08 billion at June 30, 2024, compared to $13.16 billion at March 31, 2024 and $13.10 billion at June 30, 2023. \n  * Core deposits represented 88% of total deposits at June 30, 2024. \n  * Available borrowing capacity was $4.73 billion at June 30, 2024, compared to $5.05 billion at March 31, 2024. \n  * On-balance sheet liquidity was $2.83 billion at June 30, 2024, compared to $2.77 billion at March 31, 2024. \n  * Dividends paid to shareholders were $0.48 per share in the quarter ended June 30, 2024. \n  * Common shareholders’ equity per share increased 1% to $49.07 at June 30, 2024, compared to $48.39 at the preceding quarter end, and increased 9% from $44.91 at June 30, 2023. \n  * Tangible common shareholders’ equity per share* increased 2% to $38.12 at June 30, 2024, compared to $37.40 at the preceding quarter end, and increased 13% from $33.83 at June 30, 2023. \n\n\n\n_*Non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) financial measure; See, “Additional Financial Information - Non-GAAP Financial Measures” on the final two pages of this press release for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures._\n\n**Income Statement Review**\n\nNet interest income was $132.5 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared to $133.0 million in the preceding quarter and $142.5 million in the second quarter a year ago. Net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis decreased four basis points to 3.70% for the second quarter of 2024, compared to 3.74% in the preceding quarter, and decreased compared to 4.00% in the second quarter a year ago. Net interest margin for the current quarter was impacted by increased funding costs reflecting the persistent high interest rate environment, partially offset by increased yields on loans due to new loans being originated at higher interest rates and adjustable rate loans repricing higher. \n\nAverage yields on interest-earning assets increased nine basis points to 5.25% for the second quarter of 2024, compared to 5.16% for the preceding quarter, and increased compared to 4.80% in the second quarter a year ago. Average loan yields increased nine basis points to 5.96%, compared to 5.87% in the preceding quarter, and increased compared to 5.51% in the second quarter a year ago. The increase in average yields, especially loans, during the current quarter reflects the benefit of originating new loans at higher interest rates as well as adjustable rate loans repricing higher. Total deposit costs increased 13 basis points to 1.50% in the second quarter of 2024, compared to 1.37% in the preceding quarter, and compared to 0.64% in the second quarter a year ago. The increase in deposit costs was due to a larger percentage of core deposits being in interest bearing accounts as well as an increase in the mix of higher cost retail CDs. The average rate paid on borrowings increased nine basis points to 5.07% in the second quarter of 2024, compared to 4.98% in the preceding quarter, and compared to 4.60% in the second quarter a year ago. The total cost of funding liabilities increased 13 basis points to 1.66% during the second quarter of 2024, compared to 1.53% in the preceding quarter, and compared to 0.86% in the second quarter a year ago. \n\nA $2.4 million provision for credit losses was recorded in the current quarter (comprised of a $2.0 million provision for credit losses - loans, a $430,000 provision for credit losses - unfunded loan commitments and a $14,000 recapture of provision for credit losses - held-to-maturity debt securities). This compares to a $520,000 provision for credit losses in the prior quarter (comprised of a $1.4 million provision for credit losses - loans, an $887,000 recapture of provision for credit losses - unfunded loan commitments and a $17,000 recapture of provision for credit losses - held-to-maturity debt securities) and a $6.8 million provision for credit losses in the second quarter a year ago (comprised of a $3.6 million provision for credit losses - loans, a $1.2 million provision for credit losses - unfunded loan commitments, a $2.0 million provision for credit losses - available for sale securities and a $16,000 recapture of provision for credit losses - held-to-maturity debt securities). The provision for credit losses for the current quarter primarily reflected loan growth and an increase in the reserve for collateral dependent loans. The provision for credit losses for the preceding quarter primarily reflected loan growth in the construction and one- to four-family loan portfolios and was partially offset by a reduction in unfunded loan commitments in the construction portfolio. \n\nTotal non-interest income was $17.2 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared to $11.6 million in the preceding quarter and $8.4 million in the second quarter a year ago. The increase in non-interest income during the current quarter compared to the preceding quarter was primarily due to a $4.3 million decrease in the net loss recognized on the sale of securities. The increase in non-interest income during the current quarter compared to the prior year quarter was primarily due to a $1.3 million increase in mortgage banking operations revenue, a $4.0 million decrease in the net loss recognized on the sale of securities and a $3.0 million decrease in the net loss recognized for fair value adjustments on financial instruments carried at fair value. Total non-interest income was $28.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $17.7 million for the same period a year earlier. \n\nMortgage banking operations revenue was $3.0 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared to $2.3 million in the preceding quarter and $1.7 million in the second quarter a year ago. The volume of one- to four-family loans sold during the current quarter increased compared to the prior year quarter, although overall volumes remained low due to reduced refinancing and purchase activity in the current rate environment. The increase from the preceding quarter included a $284,000 gain related to the sale of $19.8 million of one- to four-family portfolio loans during the second quarter of 2024. The increase from the preceding quarter also reflects an increase in the percentage of loan sold servicing retained. Home purchase activity accounted for 89% of one- to four-family mortgage loan originations in both the second quarter of 2024 and the preceding quarter and 93% in the second quarter of 2023. \n\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, non-interest income included a $190,000 net loss for fair value adjustments as a result of changes in the valuation of financial instruments carried at fair value, principally comprised of limited partnership investments, and a $562,000 net loss on the sale of securities, related to a security with a premium that was called early. In the preceding quarter, non-interest income included a $992,000 net loss for fair value adjustments and a $4.9 million net loss on the sale of securities. In the second quarter a year ago, non-interest income included a $3.2 million net loss for fair value adjustments and a $4.5 million net loss on the sale of securities. \n\nTotal non-interest expense was $98.1 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared to $97.6 million in the preceding quarter and $95.4 million in the second quarter of 2023. The increase in non-interest expense for the current quarter compared to the prior quarter reflects a $1.5 million increase in salary and employee benefits, primarily resulting from normal annual salary and wage increases and an increase in loan production related commission expense, partially offset by a $963,000 increase in capitalized loan origination costs, primarily due to increased loan production. The increase in non-interest expense for the current quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago primarily reflects increases in salary and employee benefits and payment and card processing services expense, partially offset by a decrease in professional and legal expenses. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, total non-interest expense was $195.8 million, compared to $190.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. Banner’s efficiency ratio was 65.53% for the second quarter of 2024, compared to 67.55% in the preceding quarter and 63.21% in the same quarter a year ago. Banner’s adjusted efficiency ratio, a non-GAAP financial measure, was 63.60% for the second quarter of 2024, compared to 63.70% in the preceding quarter and 58.58% in the year ago quarter. See, “Additional Financial Information - Non-GAAP Financial Measures” on the final two pages of this press release for a discussion and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. \n\nFederal and state income tax expense totaled $9.5 million for the second quarter of 2024 resulting in an effective tax rate of 19.2%, reflecting the benefits from tax exempt income. Banner’s statutory income tax rate for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, was 23.7%, representing a blend of the statutory federal income tax rate of 21.0% and apportioned effects of the state income tax rates. \n\n**Balance Sheet Review**\n\nTotal assets increased to $15.82 billion at June 30, 2024, compared to $15.52 billion at March 31, 2024, and $15.58 billion at June 30, 2023. Securities and interest-bearing deposits held at other banks totaled $3.27 billion at June 30, 2024, compared to $3.32 billion at March 31, 2024 and $3.64 billion at June 30, 2023. The decrease compared to the prior quarter was primarily due to normal cash flows from the securities portfolio. The average effective duration of the securities portfolio was approximately 6.5 years at June 30, 2024, compared to 6.8 years at June 30, 2023. \n\nTotal loans receivable increased to $11.14 billion at June 30, 2024, compared to $10.87 billion at March 31, 2024, and $10.47 billion at June 30, 2023. One- to four-family residential loans increased 2% to $1.60 billion at June 30, 2024, compared to $1.57 billion at March 31, 2024, and increased 20% compared to $1.34 billion at June 30, 2023. The increase in one- to four-family residential loans was the result of one- to four-family construction loans converting to one- to four-family portfolio loans upon the completion of the construction phase and new loan production, partially offset by the sale of $19.8 million of one- to four-family portfolio loans. Multifamily real estate loans decreased 11% to $717.1 million at June 30, 2024, compared to $809.1 million at March 31, 2024, and increased 2% compared to $699.8 million at June 30, 2023. The decrease in multifamily real estate compared to March 31, 2024 was primarily due to certain affordable housing loans transferring to small balance commercial real estate. The increase in multifamily real estate loans from June 30, 2023 was primarily the result of the conversion of affordable housing multifamily construction loans to the multifamily portfolio upon the completion of the construction phase as well as the transfer of $43.5 million of multifamily loans held for sale to the held for investment loan portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2023, partially offset by the transfer of certain affordable housing loans to small balance commercial real estate. Construction, land and land development loans increased 7% to $1.68 billion at June 30, 2024, compared to $1.57 billion at March 31, 2024, and increased 11% compared to $1.51 billion at June 30, 2023. The increase in construction, land and land development loans was primarily the result of new loan production and advances on multifamily construction loans, primarily related to affordable housing projects. Agricultural business loans increased 5% to $334.6 million at June 30, 2024, compared to $318.0 million at March 31, 2024 and increased 8% compared to $310.1 million at June 30, 2023, primarily due to new loan production and advances on agricultural lines of credit. \n\nLoans held for sale were $13.4 million at June 30, 2024, compared to $9.4 million at March 31, 2024 and $60.6 million at June 30, 2023. One- to four- family residential mortgage held for sale loans sold in the current quarter totaled $75.0 million, compared to $65.9 million in the preceding quarter and $62.6 million in the second quarter a year ago. The decrease in loans held for sale compared to June 30, 2023 was due to the previously mentioned transfer of multifamily loans held for sale to the held for investment loan portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2023. There were no multifamily loans held for sale at June 30, 2024 or March 31, 2024. \n\nTotal deposits decreased to $13.08 billion at June 30, 2024, compared to $13.16 billion at March 31, 2024 and $13.10 billion a year ago. Core deposits decreased 1% to $11.55 billion at June 30, 2024, compared to $11.67 billion at March 31, 2024, and decreased 2% compared to $11.74 billion at June 30, 2023. The decrease in core deposits primarily reflects clients using deposits for seasonal tax payments. Core deposits were 88% of total deposits at June 30, 2024, compared to 89% of total deposits at March 31, 2024 and 90% of total deposits at June 30, 2023. Certificates of deposit increased 3% to $1.53 billion at June 30, 2024, compared to $1.49 billion at March 31, 2024, and increased 12% compared to $1.36 billion a year earlier. The increase in certificates of deposit during the current quarter compared to the preceding quarter and second quarter a year ago was principally due to clients seeking higher yields moving funds from core deposit accounts to higher yielding certificates of deposit. The increase in certificates of deposit from the second quarter a year ago was partially offset by a $98.3 million decrease in brokered deposits. \n\nBanner Bank’s estimated uninsured deposits were $4.09 billion or 31% of total deposits at June 30, 2024, compared to $4.18 billion or 31% of total deposits at March 31, 2024. The uninsured deposit calculation includes $326.5 million and $316.6 million of collateralized public deposits at June 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively. Uninsured deposits also include cash held by the holding company of $63.9 million and $113.9 million at June 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively. Banner Bank’s estimated uninsured deposits, excluding collateralized public deposits and cash held at the holding company, were 28% of total deposits at both June 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024. \n\nBanner had $398.0 million of FHLB advances at June 30, 2024, compared to $52.0 million at March 31, 2024 and $270.0 million a year ago. At June 30, 2024, Banner’s off-balance sheet liquidity included additional borrowing capacity of $3.02 billion at the FHLB and $1.59 billion at the Federal Reserve as well as federal funds line of credit agreements with other financial institutions of $125.0 million. \n\nAt June 30, 2024, total common shareholders’ equity was $1.69 billion, or 10.69% of total assets, compared to $1.66 billion or 10.73% of total assets at March 31, 2024, and $1.54 billion or 9.90% of total assets at June 30, 2023. The increase in total common shareholders’ equity at June 30, 2024 compared to March 31, 2024 was primarily due to a $23.1 million increase in retained earnings as a result of $39.8 million in net income, partially offset by the accrual of $16.7 million of cash dividends during the second quarter of 2024. At June 30, 2024, tangible common shareholders’ equity, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $1.31 billion, or 8.51% of tangible assets, compared to $1.29 billion, or 8.50% of tangible assets, at March 31, 2024, and $1.16 billion, or 7.64% of tangible assets, a year ago. See, “Additional Financial Information - Non-GAAP Financial Measures” on the final two pages of this press release for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. \n\nBanner and Banner Bank continue to maintain capital levels in excess of the requirements to be categorized as “well-capitalized.” At June 30, 2024, Banner’s estimated common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.02%, its estimated Tier 1 leverage capital to average assets ratio was 10.80%, and its estimated total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio was 14.62%. These regulatory capital ratios are estimates, pending completion and filing of Banner’s regulatory reports. \n\n**Credit Quality**\n\nThe allowance for credit losses - loans was $152.8 million, or 1.37% of total loans receivable and 498% of non-performing loans, at June 30, 2024, compared to $151.1 million, or 1.39% of total loans receivable and 513% of non-performing loans, at March 31, 2024, and $144.7 million, or 1.38% of total loans receivable and 513% of non-performing loans, at June 30, 2023. In addition to the allowance for credit losses - loans, Banner maintains an allowance for credit losses - unfunded loan commitments, which was $14.0 million at June 30, 2024, compared to $13.6 million at March 31, 2024, and $14.7 million at June 30, 2023. Net loan charge-offs totaled $245,000 in the second quarter of 2024, compared to net loan recoveries of $73,000 in the preceding quarter and net loan charge-offs of $336,000 in the second quarter a year ago. Non-performing loans were $30.7 million at June 30, 2024, compared to $29.5 million at March 31, 2024, and $28.2 million a year ago. \n\nSubstandard loans were $122.0 million at June 30, 2024, compared to $116.1 million at March 31, 2024 and $145.0 million a year ago. The increase from the prior quarter reflects downgrades of loans, partially offset by paydowns and payoffs of substandard loans. The decrease from the prior year quarter primarily reflects paydowns and payoffs of substandard loans as well as risk rating upgrades. \n\nTotal non-performing assets were $33.3 million, or 0.21% of total assets, at June 30, 2024, compared to $29.9 million, or 0.19% of total assets, at March 31, 2024, and $28.7 million, or 0.18% of total assets, a year ago. \n\n**Conference Call**\n\nBanner will host a conference call on Thursday July 18, 2024, at 8:00 a.m. PDT, to discuss its second quarter results.

You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date such statements are made and based only on information then actually known to Banner. Banner does not undertake and specifically disclaims any obligation to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances after the date of such statements. These statements may relate to future financial performance, strategic plans or objectives, revenues or earnings projections, or other financial information. By their nature, these statements are subject to numerous uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the statements and could negatively affect Banner’s operating and stock price performance._\n\n_Factors that could cause Banner’s actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, include but are not limited to, the following: (1) potential adverse impacts to economic conditions in our local market areas, other markets where the Company has lending relationships, or other aspects of the Company’s business operations or financial markets, including, without limitation, as a result of employment levels, labor shortages and the effects of inflation, a potential recession or slowed economic growth, or increased political instability due to acts of war; (2) changes in the interest rate environment, including past increases in the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”) benchmark rate and duration at which such increased interest rate levels are maintained, which could adversely affect our revenues and expenses, the value of assets and obligations, and the availability and cost of capital and liquidity; (3) the impact of continuing elevated inflation and the current and future monetary policies of the Federal Reserve in response thereto; (4) the effects of any federal government shutdown; (5) the impact of bank failures or adverse developments at other banks and related negative press about the banking industry in general on investor and depositor sentiment; (6) expectations regarding key growth initiatives and strategic priorities; (7) the credit risks of lending activities, including changes in the level and direction of loan delinquencies and write-offs and changes in estimates of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, which could necessitate additional provisions for credit losses, resulting both from loans originated and loans acquired from other financial institutions; (8) results of examinations by regulatory authorities, including the possibility that any such regulatory authority may, among other things, require increases in the allowance for credit losses or writing down of assets or impose restrictions or penalties with respect to Banner’s activities; (9) competitive pressures among depository institutions; (10) the effect of inflation on interest rate movements and their impact on client behavior and net interest margin; (11) the impact of repricing and competitors’ pricing initiatives on loan and deposit products; (12) fluctuations in real estate values; (13) the ability to adapt successfully to technological changes to meet clients’ needs and developments in the market place; (14) the ability to access cost-effective funding; (15) disruptions, security breaches or other adverse events, failures or interruptions in, or attacks on, information technology systems or on the third-party vendors who perform critical processing functions; (16) changes in financial markets; (17) changes in economic conditions in general and in Washington, Idaho, Oregon and California in particular; (18) the costs, effects and outcomes of litigation; (19) legislation or regulatory changes, including but not limited to changes in regulatory policies and principles, or the interpretation of regulatory capital or other rules, other governmental initiatives affecting the financial services industry and changes in federal and/or state tax laws or interpretations thereof by taxing authorities; (20) changes in accounting principles, policies or guidelines; (21) future acquisitions by Banner of other depository institutions or lines of business; (22) future goodwill impairment due to changes in Banner’s business or changes in market conditions; (23) effects of critical accounting policies and judgments, including the use of estimates in determining fair value of certain of our assets, which estimates may prove to be incorrect and result in significant declines in valuation; (24) environmental, social and governance goals and targets; (25) other economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory, and technological factors affecting our operations, pricing, products and services; and (26) other risks detailed from time to time in Banner’s other reports

Tangible common shareholders’ equity per share and the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets, and references to adjusted revenue, adjusted earnings, the adjusted return on average assets, the adjusted return on average equity and the adjusted efficiency ratio represent non-GAAP financial measures. Management has presented these non-GAAP financial measures in this earnings release because it believes that they provide useful and comparative information to assess trends in Banner’s core operations reflected in the current quarter’s results and facilitate the comparison of our performance with the performance of our peers. However, these non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental and are not a substitute for any analysis based on GAAP. Where applicable, comparable earnings information using GAAP financial measures is also presented. Because not all companies use the same calculations, our presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures as calculated by other companies.

Social and Governance Report\n\nCompany Release - 7/1/2024 6:40 PM ET\n\nDownload the PDF version PDF Format (opens in new window)\n\nWALLA WALLA, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--  Today, Banner Bank released its [2023 ESG Report](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bannerbank.com%2Fesg&esheet=54089835&newsitemid=20240701140531&lan=en-US&anchor=2023+ESG+Report&index=1&md5=852256562b9da6c027c91be25a8694b5). The report identifies ongoing practices and recent accomplishments in the areas of environmental risk and impact management, social responsibility (including diversity, equity and inclusion), and governance. Report highlights include: \n\n  * Operating our business in a way that aligns with the highest ethical standards and effective governance practices. We maintained our mature ethics program and further refined our strong governance and risk management practices, including enhancements to several policies and processes and introducing a new policy on the ethical and responsible use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI). \n  * Continuing to focus on meeting the needs of our clients and the communities we serve. We originated a record amount for affordable housing loans to help reduce housing insecurity. We also provided extensive financing to local businesses and public infrastructure projects to enhance and strengthen the communities we serve. \n  * Advancing efforts to incorporate corporate sustainability practices in our day-to-day business activities, including recycling, reducing e-waste, reducing energy consumption and undertaking efficiency projects. We also made important strides in maturing our Climate Risk Management Program, including forming a Climate Risk Working Group. Our updated Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Report benchmarks our progress calculating our carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions. The TCFD Report is linked within the ESG Report. \n  * Retaining and developing our ambitious, skilled employees, including continuing to foster a culture that supports team members and provides equal opportunity as they build long-term, rewarding careers. For example, as a direct result of feedback from our 2023 DEI employee survey, we launched two new Employee Resource Groups: one dedicated to Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC) employees, and another for Veterans. \n\n\n\nAdditionally, the 2023 ESG report includes disclosures prepared using the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) standards for the financial sector that we determined to be most relevant to our business, as well as a link to our full SASB report. \n\n“Our environmental, social and governance actions are helping us stay deeply connected and responsive to the needs of all our stakeholders,” said Mark Grescovich, President and CEO of Banner Corporation and Banner Bank. “In 2023, we continued to evolve our approach to ESG. Although going above and beyond to support our communities has always been part of what we do at Banner, in the last few years we’ve made significant strides in formalizing how we communicate our impact. With this year’s report, we continue that momentum, share our progress and recognize accomplishments.” \n\nTo learn more about the Bank’s ESG efforts and view the report, please visit [www.bannerbank.com/esg](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bannerbank.com%2Fesg&esheet=54089835&newsitemid=20240701140531&lan=en-US&anchor=www.bannerbank.com%2Fesg&index=2&md5=754cf751ce4cce875a6e8d63291dc69c)\n\n**About the Company**\n\nBanner Corporation is a $15.5 billion bank holding company operating one commercial bank—Banner Bank—in four Western states through a network of branches offering a full range of deposit services and business, commercial real estate, construction, residential, agricultural and consumer loans.

$37.6 Million, or $1.09 Per Diluted Share, for First Quarter 2024; Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.48 Per Share\n\nCompany Release - 4/17/2024 4:00 PM ET\n\nDownload the PDF version PDF Format (opens in new window)\n\nWALLA WALLA, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--  Banner Corporation (NASDAQ:BANR) (“Banner”), the parent company of Banner Bank, today reported net income of $37.6 million, or $1.09 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2024, compared to $42.6 million, or $1.24 per diluted share, for the preceding quarter and $55.6 million, or $1.61 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2023. Net interest income was $133.0 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to $138.4 million in the preceding quarter and $153.3 million in the first quarter a year ago. The decrease in net interest income compared to the preceding quarter and prior year quarter reflects an increase in funding costs, partially offset by an increase in yields on earning assets. Banner’s first quarter 2024 results included a $4.9 million net loss on the sale of securities, compared to a $4.8 million net loss on the sale of securities in the preceding quarter and a $7.3 million net loss on the sale of securities in the first quarter of 2023. Banner’s first quarter 2024 results also included a $520,000 provision for credit losses, compared to a $2.5 million provision for credit losses in the preceding quarter and a $524,000 recapture of provision for credit losses in the first quarter of 2023. In addition, the preceding quarter included a $3.5 million fair value gain recorded on multifamily loans as a result of their transfer from held for sale to held for investment, with no similar transaction recorded in the current quarter. \n\nBanner announced that its Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.48 per share. The dividend will be payable May 10, 2024, to common shareholders of record on April 30, 2024. \n\n“Banner’s operating performance for the first quarter of 2024 reflects our super community bank business strategy of emphasizing a moderate risk profile and strong relationship banking, positioning the Company to weather current market conditions,” said Mark Grescovich, President and CEO. “Our results for the first quarter of 2024 benefited from higher yields on interest-earning assets. However, the continued high interest rate environment, and its effect on funding costs, resulted in moderate compression in our net interest margin during the quarter. We continue to maintain strong credit quality metrics and a solid reserve for potential credit losses. Additionally, we continue to benefit from a strong core deposit base, with core deposits representing 89% of total deposits at quarter end. Banner has upheld its core values for the past 133 years, which are to do the right thing for our clients, communities, colleagues, company and shareholders; and to provide consistent and reliable strength through all economic cycles and change events.” \n\nAt March 31, 2024, Banner, on a consolidated basis, had $15.52 billion in assets, $10.72 billion in net loans and $13.16 billion in deposits. Banner operates 135 full-service branch offices, including branches located in eight of the top 20 largest western Metropolitan Statistical Areas by population. \n\n**First Quarter 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * Revenues were $144.6 million for the first quarter of 2024, compared to $152.5 million in the preceding quarter and $162.6 million in the first quarter a year ago. \n  * Adjusted revenue* (the total of net interest income and total non-interest income adjusted for the net gain or loss on the sale of securities and the net change in valuation of financial instruments) was $150.4 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to $157.1 million in the preceding quarter and $170.4 million in the first quarter a year ago. \n  * Net interest income was $133.0 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to $138.4 million in the preceding quarter and $153.3 million in the first quarter a year ago. \n  * Net interest margin, on a tax equivalent basis, was 3.74%, compared to 3.83% in the preceding quarter and 4.30% in the first quarter a year ago. \n  * Mortgage banking operations revenue was $2.3 million for the first quarter of 2024, compared to $5.4 million in the preceding quarter and $2.7 million in the first quarter a year ago. \n  * Return on average assets was 0.97%, compared to 1.09% in the preceding quarter and 1.44% in the first quarter a year ago. \n  * Net loans receivable increased 1% to $10.72 billion at March 31, 2024, compared to $10.66 billion at December 31, 2023, and increased 7% compared to $10.02 billion at March 31, 2023. \n  * Non-performing assets were $29.9 million, or 0.19% of total assets, at March 31, 2024, compared to $30.1 million, or 0.19% of total assets, at December 31, 2023 and $27.1 million, or 0.17% of total assets, at March 31, 2023. \n  * The allowance for credit losses - loans was $151.1 million, or 1.39% of total loans receivable, as of March 31, 2024, compared to $149.6 million, or 1.38% of total loans receivable, as of December 31, 2023 and $141.5 million, or 1.39% of total loans receivable, as of March 31, 2023. \n  * Total deposits increased to $13.16 billion at March 31, 2024, compared to $13.03 billion at December 31, 2023 and $13.15 billion at March 31, 2023. Core deposits represented 89% of total deposits at March 31, 2024. \n  * Banner Bank’s estimated uninsured deposits were approximately 31% of total deposits at both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. \n  * Banner Bank’s estimated uninsured deposits, excluding collateralized public deposits and affiliate deposits, were approximately 28% of total deposits at both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. \n  * Available borrowing capacity was $5.05 billion at March 31, 2024, compared to $4.65 billion at December 31, 2023. \n  * On-balance sheet liquidity was $2.77 billion at March 31, 2024, compared to $2.93 billion at December 31, 2023. \n  * Dividends paid to shareholders were $0.48 per share in the quarter ended March 31, 2024. \n  * Common shareholders’ equity per share increased 1% to $48.39 at March 31, 2024, compared to $48.12 at the preceding quarter end, and increased 8% from $44.64 at March 31, 2023. \n  * Tangible common shareholders’ equity per share* increased 1% to $37.40 at March 31, 2024, compared to $37.09 at the preceding quarter end, and increased 12% from $33.52 at March 31, 2023. \n\n\n\n_*Non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) financial measure; See, “Additional Financial Information - Non-GAAP Financial Measures” on the final two pages of this press release for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures._\n\n**Income Statement Review**\n\nNet interest income was $133.0 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to $138.4 million in the preceding quarter and $153.3 million in the first quarter a year ago. Net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis decreased nine basis points to 3.74% for the first quarter of 2024, compared to 3.83% in the preceding quarter, and decreased compared to 4.30% in the first quarter a year ago. Net interest margin for the current quarter was impacted by increased funding costs reflecting the persistent high interest rate environment, partially offset by increased yields on loans due to new loans being originated at higher interest rates. \n\nAverage yields on interest-earning assets increased 10 basis points to 5.16% for the first quarter of 2024, compared to 5.06% for the preceding quarter, and increased compared to 4.68% in the first quarter a year ago. Average loan yields increased 10 basis points to 5.87%, compared to 5.77% in the preceding quarter, and increased compared to 5.38% in the first quarter a year ago. The increase in average yields on interest-earning assets, particularly loans, during the current quarter reflects the benefit of new loans being originated at higher interest rates. Total deposit costs increased 19 basis points to 1.37% in the first quarter of 2024, compared to 1.18% in the preceding quarter, and compared to 0.28% in the first quarter a year ago. The increase in the cost of deposits was due to a larger percentage of core deposits being in interest bearing accounts as well as an increase in the mix of higher cost retail CDs. The average rate paid on borrowings increased 21 basis points to 4.98% in the first quarter of 2024, compared to 4.77% in the preceding quarter, and compared to 3.41% in the first quarter a year ago. The total cost of funding liabilities increased 22 basis points to 1.53% during the first quarter of 2024, compared to 1.31% in the preceding quarter, and compared to 0.40% in the first quarter a year ago. \n\nA $520,000 provision for credit losses was recorded in the current quarter (comprised of a $1.4 million provision for credit losses - loans, an $887,000 recapture of provision for credit losses - unfunded loan commitments and a $17,000 recapture of provision for credit losses - held-to-maturity debt securities). This compares to a $2.5 million provision for credit losses in the prior quarter (comprised of a $3.8 million provision for credit losses - loans, a $526,000 recapture of provision for credit losses - unfunded loan commitments, a $750,000 recapture of provision for credit losses - available for sale securities and a $23,000 recapture of provision for credit losses - held-to-maturity debt securities) and a $524,000 recapture of provision for credit losses in the first quarter a year ago (comprised of a $774,000 provision for credit losses - loans, a $1.3 million recapture of provision for credit losses - unfunded loan commitments and a $20,000 recapture of provision for credit losses - held-to-maturity debt securities). The provision for credit losses for the current quarter is primarily related to the loan growth in the construction and one- to four-family loan portfolios and was partially offset by a reduction in unfunded loan commitments in the construction portfolio. The provision for credit losses for the preceding quarter primarily reflected increased loan balances and higher than forecasted net loan charge-offs, partially offset by an increase in the trading price of our investments in other banks’ subordinated debt. \n\nTotal non-interest income was $11.6 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to $14.1 million in the preceding quarter and $9.3 million in the first quarter a year ago. The decrease in non-interest income during the current quarter compared to the preceding quarter was primarily due to a $3.1 million decrease in mortgage banking operations revenue and a $1.1 million decrease in the fair value adjustments on financial instruments carried at fair value during the current quarter, partially offset by a $1.5 million increase in deposit fees and other service charges. The increase in non-interest income during the current quarter compared to the prior year quarter was primarily due to a $2.3 million decrease in the net loss recognized on the sale of securities. \n\nMortgage banking operations revenue, including gains on one- to four-family and multifamily loan sales and loan servicing fees, was $2.3 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to $5.4 million in the preceding quarter and $2.7 million in the first quarter a year ago. The decrease from the preceding quarter primarily reflects a $3.5 million reversal of the lower of cost or market adjustment on multifamily loans held for sale recognized during the preceding quarter due to the transfer of all remaining multifamily loans held for sale to the held for investment loan portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2023. In 2023, the Bank discontinued the origination of multifamily loans for sale into the secondary market. The volume of one- to four-family loans sold during the current quarter increased compared to the prior year quarter, although overall volumes remained low due to reduced refinancing and purchase activity in the current rate environment. Home purchase activity accounted for 89% of one- to four-family mortgage loan originations in the first quarter of 2024, compared to 92% in the preceding quarter and 88% in the first quarter of 2023. \n\nFirst quarter 2024, non-interest income included a $992,000 net loss for fair value adjustments as a result of changes in the valuation of financial instruments carried at fair value, principally comprised of limited partnership investments, and a $4.9 million net loss on the sale of securities. In the preceding quarter, non-interest income included a $139,000 net gain for fair value adjustments and a $4.8 million net loss on the sale of securities. In the first quarter a year ago, non-interest income included a $552,000 net loss for fair value adjustments and a $7.3 million net loss on the sale of securities. \n\nTotal non-interest expense was $97.6 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to $96.6 million in the preceding quarter and $94.6 million in the first quarter of 2023. The increase in non-interest expense for the current quarter compared to the prior quarter primarily reflects a $2.3 million increase in salary and employee benefits, primarily due to typically higher first quarter payroll taxes and 401(k) expense, as well as higher medical insurance expense, partially offset by a $737,000 decrease in professional and legal expense and a $607,000 decrease in advertising and marketing expense. The increase in non-interest expense for the current quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago primarily reflects increases in salary and employee benefits, payment and card processing services expense and deposit insurance expense. Banner’s efficiency ratio was 67.55% for the first quarter of 2024, compared to 63.37% in the preceding quarter and 58.20% in the same quarter a year ago. Banner’s adjusted efficiency ratio* was 63.70% for the first quarter of 2024, compared to 60.04% in the preceding quarter and 54.23% in the year ago quarter. \n\n_*Non-GAAP financial measures. See, “Additional Financial Information - Non-GAAP Financial Measures” on the final two pages of this press release for a discussion and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures._\n\nFederal and state income tax expense totaled $8.8 million for the first quarter of 2024 resulting in an effective tax rate of 19.0%, reflecting the benefits from tax exempt income. Banner’s statutory income tax rate for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, was 23.7%, representing a blend of the statutory federal income tax rate of 21.0% and apportioned effects of the state income tax rates. \n\n**Balance Sheet Review**\n\nTotal assets decreased to $15.52 billion at March 31, 2024, compared to $15.67 billion at December 31, 2023, and $15.53 billion at March 31, 2023. Securities and interest-bearing deposits held at other banks totaled $3.32 billion at March 31, 2024, compared to $3.48 billion at December 31, 2023 and $3.99 billion at March 31, 2023. The decrease compared to the prior quarter was primarily due to the sale of securities and normal cash flows from the security portfolio. The average effective duration of the securities portfolio was approximately 6.6 years at both March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023. \n\nTotal loans receivable increased to $10.87 billion at March 31, 2024, compared to $10.81 billion at December 31, 2023, and $10.16 billion at March 31, 2023. One- to four-family residential loans increased 3% to $1.57 billion at March 31, 2024, compared to $1.52 billion at December 31, 2023, and increased 25% compared to $1.25 billion at March 31, 2023. The increase in one- to four-family residential loans was the result of one- to four-family construction loans converting to one- to four-family portfolio loans upon the completion of the construction phase and new loan production. Multifamily real estate loans decreased slightly to $809.1 million at March 31, 2024, compared to $811.2 million at December 31, 2023, and increased 16% compared to $696.9 million at March 31, 2023. The increase in multifamily real estate loans year over year was primarily the result of the conversion of affordable housing multifamily construction loans to the multifamily portfolio upon the completion of the construction phase as well as the transfer of $43.5 million of multifamily loans held for sale to the held for investment loan portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2023. Construction, land and land development loans increased 2% to $1.57 billion at March 31, 2024, compared to $1.54 billion at December 31, 2023, and increased 7% compared to $1.47 billion at March 31, 2023. The increase in construction, land and land development loans was primarily the result of new loan production and advances on multifamily construction loans, primarily related to affordable housing projects. Agricultural business loans decreased 4% to $318.0 million at March 31, 2024, compared to $331.1 million at December 31, 2023, primarily due to operating line paydowns, and increased 17% compared to $272.7 million at March 31, 2023, primarily due to new loan production. \n\nLoans held for sale were $9.4 million at March 31, 2024, compared to $11.2 million at December 31, 2023 and $49.0 million at March 31, 2023. One- to four-family residential mortgage loans sold totaled $65.9 million in the current quarter, compared to $65.6 million in the preceding quarter and $40.5 million in the first quarter a year ago. The decrease in loans held for sale compared to March 31, 2023 was due to the previously mentioned transfer of multifamily loans held for sale to the held for investment loan portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2023. There were no multifamily loans held for sale at March 31, 2024 or December 31, 2023. \n\nTotal deposits increased to $13.16 billion at March 31, 2024, compared to $13.03 billion at December 31, 2023 and $13.15 billion a year ago. Core deposits increased 1% to $11.67 billion at March 31, 2024, compared to $11.55 billion at December 31, 2023, and decreased 4% compared to $12.20 billion at March 31, 2023. The increase in core deposits compared to the prior quarter was primarily due to increases in savings accounts while the decrease compared to the prior year quarter reflected clients moving funds out of non-interest bearing accounts into higher yielding certificates of deposits. Core deposits were 89% of total deposits at March 31, 2024, compared to 89% of total deposits at December 31, 2023 and 93% of total deposits at March 31, 2023. Certificates of deposit increased 1% to $1.49 billion at March 31, 2024, compared to $1.48 billion at December 31, 2023, and increased 56% compared to $949.9 million a year earlier. The increase in certificates of deposit during the current quarter compared to the preceding quarter and first quarter a year ago was principally due to clients seeking higher yields moving funds from core deposit accounts to higher yielding certificates of deposit. The increase in certificates of deposit from the first quarter a year ago was also due to a $107.5 million increase in brokered deposits. \n\nBanner Bank’s estimated uninsured deposits were $4.18 billion or 31% of total deposits at March 31, 2024, compared to $4.08 billion or 31% of total deposits at December 31, 2023. The uninsured deposit calculation includes $316.6 million and $305.3 million of collateralized public deposits at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Uninsured deposits also include cash held by the holding company of $113.9 million and $108.2 million at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Banner Bank’s estimated uninsured deposits, excluding collateralized public deposits and cash held at the holding company, were 28% of total deposits at both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. \n\nBanner had $52.0 million of FHLB advances at March 31, 2024, compared to $323.0 million at December 31, 2023 and $170.0 million a year ago. At March 31, 2024, Banner’s off-balance sheet liquidity included additional borrowing capacity of $3.27 billion at the FHLB and $1.66 billion at the Federal Reserve as well as federal funds line of credit agreements with other financial institutions of $125.0 million. \n\nSubordinated notes, net of issuance costs, were $89.5 million at March 31, 2024 compared to $92.9 million at December 31, 2023 and $99.0 million at March 31, 2023. The decrease in subordinated notes from both the preceding and prior year quarters was due to Banner Bank’s purchase of $10.0 million of Banner’s subordinated debt over the past year. \n\nAt March 31, 2024, total common shareholders’ equity was $1.66 billion, or 10.73% of total assets, compared to $1.65 billion or 10.55% of total assets at December 31, 2023, and $1.53 billion or 9.86% of total assets at March 31, 2023. The increase in total common shareholders’ equity at March 31, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 was primarily due to a $20.8 million increase in retained earnings as a result of $37.6 million in net income, partially offset by the accrual of $16.7 million of cash dividends during the first quarter of 2024. The increase in retained earnings was partially offset by a $10.3 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss, primarily due to a decrease in the fair value of the security portfolio as a result of an increase in market interest rates during the first quarter of 2024. At March 31, 2024, tangible common shareholders’ equity*, which excludes goodwill and other intangible assets, net, was $1.29 billion, or 8.50% of tangible assets*, compared to $1.27 billion, or 8.33% of tangible assets, at December 31, 2023, and $1.15 billion, or 7.59% of tangible assets, a year ago. \n\n_*Non-GAAP financial measures. See, “Additional Financial Information - Non-GAAP Financial Measures” on the final two pages of this press release for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures._\n\nBanner and Banner Bank continue to maintain capital levels in excess of the requirements to be categorized as “well-capitalized.” At March 31, 2024, Banner’s estimated common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.06%, its estimated Tier 1 leverage capital to average assets ratio was 10.71%, and its estimated total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio was 14.70%. These regulatory capital ratios are estimates, pending completion and filing of Banner’s regulatory reports. \n\n**Credit Quality**\n\nThe allowance for credit losses - loans was $151.1 million, or 1.39% of total loans receivable and 513% of non-performing loans, at March 31, 2024, compared to $149.6 million, or 1.38% of total loans receivable and 506% of non-performing loans, at December 31, 2023, and $141.5 million, or 1.39% of total loans receivable and 528% of non-performing loans, at March 31, 2023. In addition to the allowance for credit losses - loans, Banner maintains an allowance for credit losses - unfunded loan commitments, which was $13.6 million at March 31, 2024, compared to $14.5 million at December 31, 2023, and $13.4 million at March 31, 2023. Net loan recoveries totaled $73,000 in the first quarter of 2024, compared to net loan charge-offs of $1.1 million in the preceding quarter and net loan charge-offs of $782,000 in the first quarter a year ago. Non-performing loans were $29.5 million at March 31, 2024, compared to $29.6 million at December 31, 2023, and $26.8 million a year ago. \n\nSubstandard loans were $116.1 million at March 31, 2024, compared to $125.4 million at December 31, 2023 and $148.0 million a year ago. The decrease primarily reflects paydowns and payoffs of substandard loans as well as risk rating upgrades. \n\nTotal non-performing assets were $29.9 million, or 0.19% of total assets, at March 31, 2024, compared to $30.1 million, or 0.19% of total assets, at December 31, 2023, and $27.1 million, or 0.17% of total assets, a year ago. \n\n**Conference Call**\n\nBanner will host a conference call on Thursday, April 18, 2024, at 8:00 a.m. PDT, to discuss its first quarter results.

You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date such statements are made and based only on information then actually known to Banner. Banner does not undertake and specifically disclaims any obligation to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances after the date of such statements. These statements may relate to future financial performance, strategic plans or objectives, revenues or earnings projections, or other financial information. By their nature, these statements are subject to numerous uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the statements and could negatively affect Banner’s operating and stock price performance._\n\n_Factors that could cause Banner’s actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, include but are not limited to, the following: (1) potential adverse impacts to economic conditions in our local market areas, other markets where the Company has lending relationships, or other aspects of the Company’s business operations or financial markets, including, without limitation, as a result of employment levels, labor shortages and the effects of inflation, a potential recession or slowed economic growth, or increased political instability due to acts of war; (2) changes in the interest rate environment, including past increases in the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”) benchmark rate and duration at which such increased interest rate levels are maintained, which could adversely affect our revenues and expenses, the value of assets and obligations, and the availability and cost of capital and liquidity; (3) the impact of continuing elevated inflation and the current and future monetary policies of the Federal Reserve in response thereto; (4) the effects of any federal government shutdown; (5) the impact of bank failures or adverse developments at other banks and related negative press about the banking industry in general on investor and depositor sentiment; (6) the credit risks of lending activities, including changes in the level and direction of loan delinquencies and write-offs and changes in estimates of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, which could necessitate additional provisions for credit losses, resulting both from loans originated and loans acquired from other financial institutions; (7) results of examinations by regulatory authorities, including the possibility that any such regulatory authority may, among other things, require increases in the allowance for credit losses or writing down of assets or impose restrictions or penalties with respect to Banner’s activities; (8) competitive pressures among depository institutions; (9) the effect of inflation on interest rate movements and their impact on client behavior and net interest margin; (10) the impact of repricing and competitors’ pricing initiatives on loan and deposit products; (11) fluctuations in real estate values; (12) the ability to adapt successfully to technological changes to meet clients’ needs and developments in the market place; (13) the ability to access cost-effective funding; (14) disruptions, security breaches or other adverse events, failures or interruptions in, or attacks on, information technology systems or on the third-party vendors who perform critical processing functions; (15) changes in financial markets; (16) changes in economic conditions in general and in Washington, Idaho, Oregon and California in particular; (17) the costs, effects and outcomes of litigation; (18) legislation or regulatory changes, including but not limited to changes in regulatory policies and principles, or the interpretation of regulatory capital or other rules, other governmental initiatives affecting the financial services industry and changes in federal and/or state tax laws or interpretations thereof by taxing authorities; (19) changes in accounting principles, policies or guidelines; (20) future acquisitions by Banner of other depository institutions or lines of business; (21) future goodwill impairment due to changes in Banner’s business or changes in market conditions; (22) effects of critical accounting policies and judgments, including the use of estimates in determining fair value of certain of our assets, which estimates may prove to be incorrect and result in significant declines in valuation; (23) other economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory, and technological factors affecting our operations, pricing, products and services; and (24) other risks detailed from time to time in Banner’s other reports filed with and furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission including Banner’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Annual Reports on Form 10-K._\n\n**

Tangible common shareholders’ equity per share and the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets, and references to adjusted revenue, adjusted earnings, the adjusted return on average assets, the adjusted return on average equity and the adjusted efficiency ratio represent non-GAAP financial measures. Management has presented these non-GAAP financial measures in this earnings release because it believes that they provide useful and comparative information to assess trends in Banner’s core operations reflected in the current quarter’s results and facilitate the comparison of our performance with the performance of our peers. However, these non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental and are not a substitute for any analysis based on GAAP. Where applicable, comparable earnings information using GAAP financial measures is also presented. Because not all companies use the same calculations, our presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures as calculated by other companies.
