(“Venus Concept” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: VERO), a global medical aesthetic technology leader, announced financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Summary of Financial Results & Recent Progress: **\n\n  * Company continues to execute against Transformation Plan \n    * Cash used in operations for the first nine months of 2024 of $7.3 million, down 40% year-over-year\n  * Total revenue for the third quarter of $15.0 million, down 15% year-over-year, and below third quarter estimate of at “least $17.0 million”. \n    * Third quarter operating expenses declined 10% year-over-year; limiting GAAP operating loss to 6% year-over-year, despite 15% revenue decline\n    * Third quarter Adjusted EBITDA loss of $5.9 million, compared to $4.6 million last year\n  * On July 29, 2024, the Company announced that it received a medical device license issued by Health Canada to market the Venus Bliss MAX system in Canada. The Venus Bliss MAX is the Company’s flagship platform that offers a comprehensive, world-class solution for all customers’ body treatment needs and is currently available in select markets globally.\n  * On September 18, 2024, the Company announced that it received clearance from the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) in Australia to market the Venus Bliss MAX system.\n  * On September 27, 2024, the Company announced that, on September 26, 2024, the Company exchanged $15.0 million of its senior debt held by affiliates of Madryn Asset Management, LP (“Madryn”) for 203,583 shares of its Series Y preferred stock. Following this transaction, the Company had total debt obligations of approximately $34.6 million, down 25% from $46.0 million outstanding as of June 30, 2024 and down 54% from $74.9 million outstanding as of December 31, 2023.\n\n\n\n**Management Commentary:**\n\n“Third quarter revenue results were softer than the expectations we outlined during our second quarter report,” said Rajiv De Silva, Chief Executive Officer of Venus Concept. “Aesthetic capital equipment sales continue to be challenged by macroeconomic headwinds particularly in the US, as expected. However, importantly, we continue to see evidence that our efforts to reposition the business over the last eighteen months have been proving successful. We are enhancing our cash flow profile – as evidenced by the 40% reduction year-over-year in cash used in operations over the first nine months of 2024 -- and remain focused on enhancing the health of our balance sheet and the Company’s foundation to support long-term, sustainable, profitability and growth in the future.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results:**\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n---  \n**2024** | **2023**  \n_(dollars in thousands)_  \n**Revenues by region:**  \nUnited States | $ | 8,548 | $ | 11,167  \nInternational | 6,459 | 6,449  \nTotal revenue | $ | 15,007 | $ | 17,616  \n**Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n---  \n**2024** | **2023** | **Change**  \n_(in thousands, except percentages)_ | **$** | **% of Total** | **$** | **% of Total** | **$** | **%**  \n**Revenues by product:**  \nVenus Prime / Subscription—Systems | $ | 2,684 | 17.9 | $ | 4,368 | 24.8 | $ | (1,684 | ) | (38.6 | )  \nProducts—Systems | 8,898 | 59.3 | 9,834 | 55.8 | (936 | ) | (9.5 | )  \nProducts—Other | 2,741 | 18.3 | 2,487 | 14.1 | 254 | 10.2  \nServices | 684 | 4.5 | 927 | 5.3 | (243 | ) | (26.2 | )  \nTotal | $ | 15,007 | 100.0 | $ | 17,616 | 100.0 | $ | (2,609 | ) | (14.8 | )  \n  \nTotal revenue for the third quarter of 2024 decreased $2.6 million, or 15%, to $15.0 million, compared to the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in total revenue, by region, was driven by a 23% decrease year-over-year in United States revenue as the change in International revenue year-over-year was nominal. The decrease in total revenue, by product category, was driven primarily by a 39% decrease in lease revenue and a 10% decrease in products – systems revenue. The percentage of total systems revenue derived from the Company’s internal lease programs (Venus Prime and our legacy subscription model) was approximately 23% in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 31% in the prior year period.\n\nGross profit for the third quarter of 2024 decreased $2.3 million, or 19%, to $9.9 million compared to the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in gross profit is primarily due to the effects of tighter third-party lending practices which negatively impacted capital equipment sales in the U.S., and a decrease in revenue in our international markets driven by the accelerated exit from unprofitable direct markets, partially offset by an improvement in third party international distributor revenues. Gross margin was 66.1% of revenue, compared to 69.2% of revenue for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nOperating expenses for the third quarter of 2024 decreased $1.9 million, or 10%, to $17.1 million, compared to the third quarter of 2023. The change in total operating expenses was driven by a decrease of $1.4 million, or 14%, in general and administrative expenses, a decrease of $0.3 million, or 4%, in selling and marketing expenses, and a decrease of $0.2 million, or 12%, in research and development expenses. Third quarter of 2024 general and administrative expenses included approximately $0.1 million of costs related to restructuring activities designed to improve the Company's operations and cost structure.\n\nOperating loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $7.2 million, compared to operating loss of $6.8 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nNet loss attributable to stockholders for the third quarter of 2024 was $9.3 million, or $1.28 per share, compared to net loss of $9.1 million, or $1.64 per share for the third quarter of 2023. Third quarter net loss attributable to stockholders included a pre-tax loss on debt extinguishment of $0.5 million related to the debt-to-equity exchange transaction. Adjusted EBITDA loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $5.9 million, compared to adjusted EBITDA loss of $4.6 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $4.5 million and total debt obligations of approximately $34.6 million, compared to $5.4 million and $74.9 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2023.\n\n**Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Outlook:**\n\nThe Company expects total revenue for the three months ending December 31, 2024 of at least $17.0 million, representing a 6% decline year-over-year and a 13% increase quarter-over-quarter.\n\n**Conference Call Details:**\n\nManagement will host a conference call at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time on November 13, 2024 to discuss the results of the quarter with a question-and-answer session. Those who would like to participate may dial 877-407-2991 (201-389-0925 for international callers) and provide access code 13749236.

Financial Measures**\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure defined as net income (loss) before foreign exchange (gain) loss, financial expenses, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and non-recurring items for a given period. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of our financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA along with other financial performance measures, including net income, and our financial results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently or not at all, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. We understand that although Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by securities analysts, lenders and others in their evaluation of companies, Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; and although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements.\n\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure for analyzing the performance of our core business because it facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period and company to company by backing out potential differences caused by changes in foreign exchange rates that impact financial assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, tax positions (such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates), the age and book depreciation of fixed assets (affecting relative depreciation expense), amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense (because it is a non-cash expense) and non-recurring items as explained below.\n\nThe following is a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented:\n\n**Venus Concept Inc.****Reconciliation of Net loss to Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended September 30,** | **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \n**Reconciliation of net loss to adjusted EBITDA** | **(in thousands)** | **(in thousands)**  \nNet loss | $ | (9,302 | ) | $ | (8,956 | ) | $ | (38,955 | ) | $ | (25,900 | )  \nForeign exchange loss | 57 | 909 | 1,155 | 379  \nLoss on disposal of subsidiaries | — | 1 | — | 77  \nLoss on debt extinguishment | 454 | — | 11,355 | —  \nFinance expenses | 1,665 | 1,605 | 5,785 | 4,666  \nIncome tax (benefit) expense | (31 | ) | (321 | ) | 147 | 103  \nDepreciation and amortization | 971 | 1,010 | 2,924 | 3,042  \nStock-based compensation expense | 239 | 364 | 817 | 1,214  \nCEWS (1) | — | — | 418 | —  \nOther adjustments (2) | 73 | 752 | 1,220 | 2,082  \nAdjusted EBITDA | $ | (5,874 | ) | $ | (4,636 | ) | $ | (15,134 | ) | $ | (14,337 | )  \n_(1) In April 2022, the Canada Revenue Agency (“CRA”) initiated an audit of the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy Claim (“CEWS”) that the Company filed between 2020-2021.
