(NASDAQ:SONN) (the \"Company\" or \"Sonnet\"), a clinical-stage company developing targeted immunotherapeutic drugs, announced today that the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has issued U.S. Patent No. 12,134,635 entitled _“Interleukin 18 (IL-18) Variants and Fusion Proteins Comprising Same,_ ” covering two of its novel drug candidates, SON-1411 (IL-18BPR-FHAB-IL12) and SON-1400 (IL-18BPR-FHAB), each containing a modified version of recombinant human interleukin-18 (IL-18BPR = Binding Protein Resistant). The patent carries a term effective until June 2044.\n\n“The issuance of this intellectual property is an important milestone that we believe provides significant differentiation from competitors trying to tap the full biological potential of IL-18, either alone or in combination with IL-12. IL-18 is a key cytokine that, when combined synergistically with IL-12, has the potential to be an important therapeutic asset for oncology and cell-based therapy,” commented Pankaj Mohan, Ph.D., Sonnet Founder and Chief Executive Officer.\n\nSON-1411 is a proprietary bifunctional fusion protein consisting of IL-18BPR combined with single-chain wild-type IL-12, linked to Sonnet's Fully Human Albumin Binding (FHAB®) platform, which has replaced SON-1410 as a development target. SON-1400 is a monofunctional fusion protein comprising the same IL-18BPR domain linked to the FHAB. FHAB extends the half-life and biological activity of linked molecules by binding native albumin in the serum and targets the tumor microenvironment (TME) through high affinity binding to glycoprotein 60 (gp60) and the Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine (SPARC).\n\nIL-18 can regulate both innate and adaptive immune responses through its effects on natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes, dendritic cells, T cells, and B cells. IL-18 acts synergistically with other pro-inflammatory cytokines to promote interferon-γ (IFN-γ) production by NK cells and T cells. Systemic administration of IL-18 has been shown to have anti-tumor activity in several animal models. Moreover, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) express more IL-18 receptors than other T cells. However, IL-18 clinical trials have shown that, although it is well tolerated, IL-18 has poor efficacy in the treatment of cancers, most likely due in large part to the high co-expression of IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP) in the TME. In particular, IL-18BP serves as a “decoy receptor” that binds to IL-18 with higher affinity, compared with the IL-18Rc complex, thereby causing a negative feedback loop with IL-18 and inhibiting IL-18-mediated TIL activation. Thus, there exists a potential for the discovery of IL-18 variant compositions that could harness the therapeutic potential of IL-18 for the treatment of cancers.\n\nSonnet’s strategy for amino acid modifications to rIL-18 was based on a compilation of literature review, 3D X-ray crystallography structures, and computer modeling analysis. Subsequently, certain IL-18 variant sequences were synthesized, engineered into expression constructs and manufactured at small scale in either CHO cell culture or  _E. coli_. Highly purified milligram quantities of SON-1411 or SON-1400 were analyzed  _in vitro_ for IL-18Rc or IL-18BP binding activities, respectively, using the HEK-Blue™ and Bright-Glo Luciferase™ IL-18Rc reporter assays.  _In vitro_ results for at least one variant of IL-18 showed equivalent binding to the IL-18 Rc, compared to the wild-type IL-18 reference molecule, concomitant with no or reduced binding to IL-18BP.\n\nThe known MOA of IL-18 inhibition by IL-18BP is reviving the importance of clinical applications of IL-18. IL-18BP has been shown to be elevated in cancer patients, thus nullifying the clinical applications of IL-18. Sonnet is developing two novel bifunctional cytokine molecules, IL-18BPR-FHAB-IL12 and IL-18BPR-FHAB, both of which contain a unique IL-18 domain that does not bind the inhibitor IL-18BP but still maintains full IL-18 and IL-12 bioactivity. The clinical application of these mono or bifunctional fusion proteins could potentially expand immunotherapy applications for cancer patients.\n\n**About** **SON-****1411**\n\nSON-1411 is a candidate immunotherapeutic recombinant drug that is closely related to and has replaced SON-1410. SON-1410 links an unmodified single-chain human IL-18 and an unmodified IL-12 with the albumin-binding domain of the single-chain antibody fragment A10m3. The key difference between SON-1410 and SON-1411 is that in the latter, there has been novel modification of the IL-18 domain via mutagenesis to retain wildtype binding to the IL-18 receptor (IL-18 Rc) while inhibiting or abolishing binding to the IL-18 binding protein (IL-18 BP). The A10m3 scFv was selected to bind both at normal pH, as well as at the acidic pH that is typically found in the TME. The FHAB technology targets tumor and lymphatic tissue, providing a mechanism for dose sparing and an opportunity to improve the safety and efficacy profile of IL-18 and IL-12, as well as a variety of potent immunomodulators that can be added using the platform. Interleukin-12 can orchestrate a robust immune response to many cancers and pathogens. Given the types of proteins induced in the TME, such as SPARC and gp60, several types of cancer such as non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma, head and neck cancer, sarcoma, and some gynecological cancers are particularly relevant for this approach. SON-1411 is designed to deliver IL-18BPR and IL-12 to local tumor tissue, turning ‘cold’ tumors ‘hot’ by stimulating IFNγ, which activates innate and adaptive immune cell responses and increases the production of Programed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) on tumor cells.\n\n**About Sonnet BioTherapeutics Holdings, Inc.**\n\nSonnet is an oncology-focused biotechnology company with a proprietary platform for developing targeted biologic drugs with single or bifunctional action. Known as FHAB (Fully Human Albumin Binding), the technology utilizes a fully human single chain antibody fragment (scFv) that binds to and \"hitch-hikes\" on human serum albumin (HSA) for transport to target tissues.

FHAB platform is the foundation of a modular, plug-and-play construct for potentiating a range of large molecule therapeutic classes, including cytokines, peptides, antibodies and vaccines.\n\nSonnet’s lead program, SON-1010, or IL-12-FHAB, is in development for the treatment of solid tumors and ovarian cancer. SON-1010 is being evaluated in an ongoing Phase 1/2a study through a Master Clinical Trial and Supply Agreement, along with ancillary Quality and Safety Agreements, with Roche in combination with atezolizumab (Tecentriq®) for the treatment of Platinum-Resistant Ovarian Cancer (PROC). The Company is also evaluating its second program, SON-1210, an IL12-FHAB-IL15 for solid tumors, in collaboration with the Sarcoma Oncology Center to commence an investigator-initiated and funded Phase 1/2a study for the treatment of Pancreatic Cancer.\n\nThe Company’s SON-080 program is a low dose of rhIL-6 in development for CIPN and DPN. SON-080 demonstrated encouraging results in a Phase 1b/2a clinical trial, being well tolerated with no evidence of a pro-inflammatory cytokine response. Sonnet is currently seeking partnership opportunities to support a Phase 2 trial.\n\n**Forward-Looking** **Statements**\n\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, as amended, including those relating to the outcome of the Company’s clinical trials, the Company's cash runway, the Company's product development, clinical and regulatory timelines, market opportunity, competitive position, possible or assumed future results of operations, business strategies, potential growth opportunities and other statements that are predictive in nature.

The goal of the Phase 1b portion of the SB211 study was to confirm safety and tolerability before continued development in Phase 2. As previously announced in March 2024, a data and safety monitoring board reviewed the unblinded safety and tolerability of SON-080 in the first nine patients and concluded that the symptoms were tolerable in the initial patients and the study could proceed to Phase 2.\n\n_Phase 1b Data Highlights:_\n\n  * SON-080 demonstrated to be well-tolerated at both 20 µg and 60 µg/dose, which was about 10-fold lower than the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for IL-6 that was established in previous clinical evaluations.\n  * Pain and quality of life survey results suggest the potential for rapid improvement of peripheral neuropathy symptoms and post-dosing durability with both doses, compared to placebo controls.\n\n\n\nFor more information about the SB211 study, visit clinicaltrials.gov and reference identifier [NCT05435742](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=GPW3s7IFSKy_Z8liBeWeceHiDaIlVn15gE-TILwx8Rm0GCTO6yPTfrKKsV9LTEzVSKLHdcAZBSrOgiIHtzBJZ74I00MaEZk2pxFuf_7TYBw=).\n\n**SON-080 Upcoming Milestones**\n\n  * Seeking partnership to support initiation of a Phase 2 clinical trial in DPN, a mechanistically synergistic and larger, high-value indication with unmet medical need. \n\n\n\n**Summary of Financial Results for the Third Quarter 2024**\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, Sonnet had $3.6 million cash on hand, which the Company believes is sufficient to fund operations into November 2024.\n\nResearch and development expenses were $1.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $2.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease of $0.7 million was primarily due to cost saving initiatives, as the Company is managing expenses for liquidity purposes and is tightening its focus on the research and development projects it has assessed to have the greatest near-term potential. In addition to transitioning product development activities to cost advantaged locations such as India and Australia, the Company has reduced expenditures on tertiary programs and suspended antiviral development related to SON-1010, as well as programs related to SON-080 and SON-1210 while it seeks potential partnering opportunities.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $1.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $1.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The increase of $0.3 million related primarily to costs incurred in connection with the May 2024 ChEF Purchase Agreement entered into with Chardan Capital Markets LLC and an increase in legal and professional expenses and franchise taxes, partially offset by a decrease in consulting expenses related to licensing.\n\n**About Sonnet BioTherapeutics Holdings, Inc.**\n\nSonnet BioTherapeutics is an oncology-focused biotechnology company with a proprietary platform for innovating biologic drugs of single or bifunctional action.

In addition to transitioning\nproduct development activities to cost advantaged locations such as India and Australia, the\nCompany has reduced expenditures on tertiary programs and suspended antiviral\ndevelopment related to SON-1010, as well as programs related to SON-080 and SON-1210\nwhile it seeks potential partnering opportunities.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $1.8 million for the three months ended June 30,\n2024, compared to $1.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The increase of\n$0.3 million related primarily to costs incurred in connection with the May 2024 ChEF\nPurchase Agreement entered into with Chardan Capital Markets LLC and an increase in\nlegal and professional expenses and franchise taxes, partially offset by a decrease in\nconsulting expenses related to licensing.\nAbout Sonnet BioTherapeutics Holdings, Inc.\nSonnet BioTherapeutics is an oncology-focused biotechnology company with a proprietary\nplatform for innovating biologic drugs of single or bifunctional action.
