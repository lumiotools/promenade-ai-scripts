(Nasdaq: IEP) announced today that it has delivered a proposal to the board of directors of CVR Energy, Inc. (\"CVR\") to acquire additional shares of CVR common stock in a tender offer.\n\nIEP proposed that Icahn Enterprises Holdings L.P. (\"IEH\") (or a subsidiary thereof) would commence a tender offer to acquire up to 15 million additional shares (the \"Maximum Tender Amount\") of common stock, par value $0.01, of CVR, for a purchase price of $17.50 per share. The proposed purchase price represents a premium of approximately 6% to CVR's closing price on November 7, 2024 and a premium of approximately 5% to the volume-weighted average price of CVR's common stock during the last 7 trading days. IEP is proposing the tender offer because it believes that CVR's shares are undervalued in the market and represent an attractive investment opportunity, and that CVR's shareholders will benefit from an opportunity to sell their shares at a premium to their trading price.\n\nIEP's proposal contemplates that IEH (or a subsidiary thereof) would acquire all shares of CVR common stock properly tendered in the tender offer up to the Maximum Tender Amount, and that the tender offer will not be subject to a minimum tender condition. Furthermore, IEP is willing to agree with CVI to certain contractual provisions for the benefit of CVR's public stockholders following completion of the tender offer. It is IEP's expectation that a special committee of independent directors of CVR will consider our proposal and such other terms, and to make a recommendation to CVR's stockholders or determine to remain neutral with respect to the tender offer. IEP currently beneficially owns, directly and indirectly, 66,692,381, or 66.3%, of the outstanding shares of CVR common stock and, if the proposed tender offer were to be fully or over-subscribed, IEP would beneficially own, directly and indirectly, 81,692,381 shares, or 81.3%, of the outstanding shares of CVR common stock.\n\n**Additional Information**\n\nThe tender offer described in this press release has not yet commenced. This press release is provided for informational purposes only and does not constitute an offer to purchase or the solicitation of an offer to sell any securities. At the time the tender offer is commenced, IEP and IEH and one or more subsidiaries intend to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") and deliver to CVR stockholders a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO containing an offer to purchase, a form of letter of transmittal and other documents relating to the tender offer, and CVR will file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the tender offer. Investors and stockholders are urged to read those documents and other relevant documents filed or to be filed with the SEC carefully when they become available as they will contain important information about IEP, CVR, the tender offer and related matters. Those documents as well as IEP's and CVR's other public filings with the SEC may be obtained without charge at the SEC's website at [www.sec.gov](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4297910-1&h=1248018085&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sec.gov%2F&a=www.sec.gov) and on IEP's and CVR's respective websites.\n\n**Icahn Enterprises L.P.**\n\nIcahn Enterprises L.P., a master limited partnership, is a diversified holding company owning subsidiaries currently engaged in the following continuing operating businesses: Investment, Energy, Automotive, Food Packaging, Real Estate, Home Fashion and Pharma.\n\n**Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nCertain statements in this press release, including statements regarding IEP's plans, objectives, expectations and intentions relating to the tender offer, the tender offer's expected contributions to IEP's results, financing and closing of the acquisition, as well as the expected timing and benefits of the acquisition, may contain words considered forward-looking statements or information under applicable securities laws. These statements are based on IEP's current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about the operating environment, economies and markets in which IEP and CVR operate. These statements are subject to important assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict, including market conditions, discussions with CVR and its board of directors, and financing the tender offer, and the actual outcome may be materially different. IEP's assumptions, although considered reasonable by us at the date of this press release, may prove to be inaccurate and consequently actual results could differ materially from the expectations set out herein. For additional information with respect to risks and other factors, which could occur, see IEP's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission including IEP's Annual Report on Form 10-K and its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q under the caption \"Risk Factors,\" as well as the Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO if and when it becomes available. Additionally, there may be other factors not presently known to us or which we currently consider to be immaterial that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Past performance in our Investment segment is not indicative of future performance. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking information, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.\n\n**Investor Contact** :Ted Papapostolou, Chief Financial OfficerIR@ielp.com (800) 255-2737\n\n![Cision](https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=FL51562&sd=2024-11-08) View original content:<https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/icahn-enterprises-lp-announces-proposed-tender-offer-to-acquire-additional-shares-of-cvr-energy-common-stock-302299754.html>\n\nSOURCE Icahn Enterprises L.P.\n\n## Shareholder Tools\n\n[ Printed Materials](/financial-information/printed-materials)\n\n[ Email Alerts](/email-alerts)\n\n[ RSS News Feeds](/rss-news-feeds)\n\n  * [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https://www.ielp.com/news-releases/news-release-details/icahn-enterprises-lp-announces-proposed-tender-offer-acquire&t=Icahn Enterprises - Icahn Enterprises L.P. announces proposed tender offer to acquire additional shares of CVR Energy common stock \"Facebook\")\n  * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/home?status=Icahn Enterprises - Icahn Enterprises L.P. announces proposed tender offer to acquire additional shares of CVR Energy common stock+https://www.ielp.com/news-releases/news-release-details/icahn-enterprises-lp-announces-proposed-tender-offer-acquire \"Twitter\")\n  * [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://www.ielp.com/news-releases/news-release-details/icahn-enterprises-lp-announces-proposed-tender-offer-acquire&title=Icahn Enterprises - Icahn Enterprises L.P. announces proposed tender offer to acquire additional shares of CVR Energy common stock \"LinkedIn\")\n  * [Google+](https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://www.ielp.com/news-releases/news-release-details/icahn-enterprises-lp-announces-proposed-tender-offer-acquire?&t=Icahn Enterprises - Icahn Enterprises L.P. announces proposed tender offer to acquire additional shares of CVR Energy common stock \"GooglePlus\")\n\n\n"

Reports Third Quarter 2020 Financial Results\n\nNovember 6, 2020 at 8:00 AM EST\n\n[PDF Version](/node/14591/pdf)\n\n  * ****Third quarter net loss attributable to Icahn Enterprises of $714 million, or a loss $3.14 per depositary unit****\n  * ****Board approves quarterly distribution of $2.00 per depositary unit****\n\n\n\nSUNNY ISLES BEACH, Fla., Nov. 06, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Icahn Enterprises L.P. (NASDAQ:IEP) is reporting third quarter 2020 revenues of $722 million and net loss attributable to Icahn Enterprises of $714 million, or a loss of $3.14 per depositary unit. For the three months ended September 30, 2019, revenues were $2.3 billion and net loss attributable to Icahn Enterprises was $49 million, or a loss of $0.24 per depositary unit. For the three months ended September 30, 2020, Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Icahn Enterprises was $(550) million compared to $(121) million for the three months ended September 30, 2019. For the three months ended September 30, 2020, Adjusted EBIT attributable to Icahn Enterprises was $(637) million compared to $(209) million for the three months ended September 30, 2019.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2020, revenues were $3.4 billion and net loss attributable to Icahn Enterprises was $1.8 billion, or a loss of $8.12 per depositary unit. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, revenues were $6.4 billion and net loss attributable to Icahn Enterprises was $941 million, or a loss of $4.68 per depositary unit, including a loss of $917 million from continuing operations, or $4.56 per depositary unit. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Icahn Enterprises was $(1.2) billion compared to $(573) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, Adjusted EBIT attributable to Icahn Enterprises was $(1.4) billion compared to $(840) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019.\n\nOn November 4, 2020, the Board of Directors of the general partner of Icahn Enterprises declared a quarterly distribution in the amount of $2.00 per depositary unit, which will be paid on or about December 29, 2020 to depositary unitholders of record at the close of business on November 24, 2020. Depositary unitholders will have until December 17, 2020 to make an election to receive either cash or additional depositary units; if a unitholder does not make an election, it will automatically be deemed to have elected to receive the distribution in cash. Depositary unitholders who elect to receive additional depositary units will receive units valued at the volume weighted average trading price of the units on NASDAQ during the 5 consecutive trading days ending December 24, 2020. No fractional depositary units will be issued pursuant to the distribution payment. Icahn Enterprises will make a cash payment in lieu of issuing fractional depositary units to any unitholders electing to receive depositary units. Any unitholders that would only be eligible to receive a fraction of a depositary unit based on the above calculation will receive a cash payment.\n\nIcahn Enterprises L.P., a master limited partnership, is a diversified holding company engaged in seven primary business segments: Investment, Energy, Automotive, Food Packaging, Metals, Real Estate and Home Fashion.\n\nCaution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\n\nResults for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of results for any full fiscal period.

These include non-GAAP EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, EBIT and Adjusted EBIT. EBITDA represents earnings from continuing operations before interest expense, income tax (benefit) expense and depreciation and amortization. EBIT represents earnings from continuing operations before interest expense and income tax (benefit) expense. We define Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBIT as EBITDA and EBIT, respectively, excluding certain effects of impairment, restructuring costs, certain pension plan expenses, gains/losses on disposition of assets, gains/losses on extinguishment of debt, major scheduled turnaround expenses, certain tax settlements and certain other non-operational charges. We present EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, EBIT and Adjusted EBIT on a consolidated basis and on a basis attributable to Icahn Enterprises net of the effects of non-controlling interests. We conduct substantially all of our operations through subsidiaries. The operating results of our subsidiaries may not be sufficient to make distributions to us. In addition, our subsidiaries are not obligated to make funds available to us for payment of our indebtedness, payment of distributions on our depositary units or otherwise, and distributions and intercompany transfers from our subsidiaries to us may be restricted by applicable law or covenants contained in debt agreements and other agreements to which these subsidiaries currently may be subject or into which they may enter into in the future. The terms of any borrowings of our subsidiaries or other entities in which we own equity may restrict dividends, distributions or loans to us.\n\nWe believe that providing EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, EBIT and Adjusted EBIT to investors has economic substance as these measures provide important supplemental information of our performance to investors and permits investors and management to evaluate the core operating performance of our business without regard to interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization and certain effects of impairment, restructuring costs, certain pension plan expenses, gains/losses on disposition of assets, gains/losses on extinguishment of debt, major scheduled turnaround expenses, certain tax settlements and certain other non-operational charges. Additionally, we believe this information is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies that have issued debt. Management uses, and believes that investors benefit from referring to, these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our operating results, as well as in planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. Adjusting earnings for these charges allows investors to evaluate our performance from period to period, as well as our peers, without the effects of certain items that may vary depending on accounting methods and the book value of assets. Additionally, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, EBIT and Adjusted EBIT present meaningful measures of performance exclusive of our capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired and financed.\n\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, EBIT and Adjusted EBIT have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. For example, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, EBIT and Adjusted EBIT:\n\n·do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures, or contractual commitments; ·do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; and ·do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt.\n\nAlthough depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated or amortized often will have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements. Other companies in the industries in which we operate may calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, EBIT and Adjusted EBIT differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. In addition, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, EBIT and Adjusted EBIT do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations.\n\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, EBIT and Adjusted EBIT are not measurements of our financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. Given these limitations, we rely primarily on our U.S. GAAP results and use EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, EBIT and Adjusted EBIT only as a supplemental measure of our financial performance.\n\n****Use of Indicative Net Asset Value Data****\n\nThe Company uses indicative net asset value as an additional method for considering the value of the Company’s assets, and we believe that this information can be helpful to investors. Please note, however, that the indicative net asset value does not represent the market price at which the depositary units trade. Accordingly, data regarding indicative net asset value is of limited use and should not be considered in isolation.\n\nThe Company's depositary units are not redeemable, which means that investors have no right or ability to obtain from the Company the indicative net asset value of units that they own. Units may be bought and sold on The NASDAQ Global Select Market at prevailing market prices. Those prices may be higher or lower than the indicative net asset value of the depositary units as calculated by management.\n\nSee below for more information on how we calculate the Company’s indicative net asset value.\n\n****September 30 , **** | ****December 31 ,****  \n---|---  \n****2020**** | ****2019****  \n(In millions)(Unaudited)  \n****Market-valued Subsidiaries and Investments:****  \nHolding Company interest in Investment Funds(1) | $ | 4,058 | $ | 4,296  \nCVR Energy(2) | 881 | 2,879  \nTenneco(2) | 204 | 386  \n****Total market-valued subsidiaries and investments**** | ****$**** | ****5,143**** | ****$**** | ****7,561****  \n****Other Subsidiaries:****  \nViskase(3) | $ | 240 | $ | 84  \nReal Estate Holdings(1) | 433 | 474  \nPSC Metals(1) | 144 | 156  \nWestPoint Home(1) | 145 | 147  \nIcahn Automotive Group(1) | 1,654 | 1,750  \n****Total other subsidiaries**** | ****$**** | ****2,616**** | ****$**** | ****2,611****  \nAdd: Other Holding Company net assets(4) | 185 | 186  \n****Indicative Gross Asset Value**** | ****$**** | ****7,944**** | ****$**** | ****10,358****  \nAdd: Holding Company cash and cash equivalents(4) | 987 | 3,006  \nLess: Holding Company debt(4) | (5,812 | ) | (6,297 | )  \n****Indicative Net Asset Value**** | ****$**** | ****3,119**** | ****$**** | ****7,067****  \n  \n__Indicative net asset value does not purport to reflect a valuation of IEP.
