          "content": "Third Quarter 2024\nHighlights\nNovember 7, 2024\nTo Our Stakeholders\n,\nDuring the third quarter, we concluded another successful summer peak season with\nVacasa serving nearly 400,000 guest reservations and generating over $300 million in\nincome for our homeowners. The summer season provides our guests with some of the\nmost meaningful and enjoyable weeks of the year, and we are proud to be able to help\nthem create memories and cherish moments together. The summer season is also a\ndemanding period for our local teams, as they work to meet our guests’ needs, while\nbalancing high occupancy, same-day turnovers, and extensive to-do lists. We are deeply\ngrateful for the dedication of our local team members, who delivered exceptional\nhospitality throughout the summer, and embodied our mission of Bringing Vacations Home.\nWe believe our operational success during summer peak season offers an early proof point\nthat the business transformation we are driving—giving local teams greater autonomy over\nvarious aspects of their markets, including input into the types of homes brought onto our\nplatform, setting and managing expense targets, and moving more approval processes and\naccountability from headquarters to our local teams—is working. We believe these changes\nare delivering a strong hospitality experience for both our homeowners and our guests, as\nwell as improving guest satisfaction and review scores on our channel partners’ websites.\nBy empowering teams to make market-level decisions, we believe we’re also driving\ngreater efficiency in our operations.\nWe’ve also refined our sales approach by aligning our sales executives with our regional\nteams, to allow them to collaborate more closely on home acquisition at the local level. We\nare focusing our sales efforts on not just any home, but on the homes that our local teams\nknow how to service, have guest appeal, and, ultimately, on homes with attractive revenue\npotential.\nOn the product side, we are continuing to develop tools to enhance the owner experience—\nwhether directly in our owner-facing platform or by advancing the tools used by our teams\nwho support our homeowners and their guests. This past quarter, we began leveraging\nartificial intelligence to more efficiently deliver information and context to our owner and\nguest-facing teams, enabling them to resolve issues faster and improve service outcomes.\nThird Quarter 2024 2\nBusiness Update (continued)\nWe are pleased with the progress we’ve made this quarter, as we continue localizing our\noperations to better serve our owners and guests. We’ve reduced our corporate footprint\nand driven efficiency across our local market operations, while increasing guest satisfaction\nand review scores. We believe this is the formula to deliver better results for our owners\nand guests, and we’re committed to that path.\nWhile we are executing well against what we can control, the short-term rental industry\ncontinues to adjust to softening demand for domestic, non-urban vacation rentals, as well\nas increases in the supply of short-term rental units. These trends continue to put real\npressure on our business. Nonetheless, based on our and industry data, we continue to\nbelieve that Vacasa listings are generating more gross bookings per home, on average,\nthan the industry.\nFinancial Discussion\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, Gross Booking Value reached $670 million, down 19%\ncompared to the same quarter last year, driven by a 21% year-over-year decrease in Nights\nSold and a 2% increase in Gross Booking Value per Night Sold. We finished the third\nquarter with approximately 38,000 homes on our platform, down from approximately\n42,000 at the end of the third quarter last year, reflecting the ongoing churn dynamic that\nwe have been seeing.\nRevenue, which consists primarily of our commission on the rents we generate for\nhomeowners, the fees we collect from guests, and Revenue from home care solutions\nprovided directly to our homeowners, was $314 million in the third quarter, a 17%\ndecrease compared to the same quarter last year.\nNet Income was $59 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to a Net Loss of $402\nmillion in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $69 million for the third quarter\nof 2024, compared to $74 million in the same period last year, representing a $5 million\ndecline in Adjusted EBITDA versus a $65 million decline in Revenue, compared to the same\nquarter last year, reflecting our restructuring action in May and expense discipline.\nThird Quarter 2024 3\nOutlook\nWe continue to experience bookings weakness in terms of both price, or GBV per Night\nSold, and utilization, or Nights Sold per Home, in the fourth quarter. The ongoing industry\ndynamics, and their impact on bookings variability and average Gross Booking Value per\nHome, as well as continued elevated churn creates a wide range of potential outcomes for\nRevenue, and in-turn, Adjusted EBITDA. As a result, at this point, it remains difficult to\nprovide guidance for the remainder of 2024.

Forward-\nlooking statements may be identified by the use of words such as \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"expect,\"\n\"estimate,\" \"plan,\" \"outlook,\" and \"project\" and other similar expressions that predict or indicate future\nevents or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. These forward-looking statements reflect\nVacasa's current analysis of existing information and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. As a\nresult, caution must be exercised in relying on forward-looking statements.\nDue to known and unknown risks, actual results may differ materially from Vacasa's expectations and\nprojections. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those\ndescribed in these forward-looking statements: Vacasa's ability to execute its business plan and achieve the\nexpected benefits of its reorganization and other cost saving measures it may take in the future; any\nindebtedness Vacasa may incur from time to time (including the Initial Notes issued on August 7, 2024 and\nany Additional Notes), Vacasa's cash position and its ability to raise additional capital or generate the\nsignificant capital necessary to expand its operations and invest in new offerings, including that additional\nfinancing (including Additional Notes) may not be available on acceptable terms or at all, or could be\ndilutive to Vacasa’s stockholders or impose additional restrictive debt covenants on its activities; Vacasa's\nability to achieve profitability; Vacasa's ability to manage the impacts the reorganization will have on its\nsystems, processes and controls, including its ability to address competitive challenges, manage its\nemployee base, or maintain its corporate culture; Vacasa's past growth not being indicative of its future\nprospects; Vacasa's ability to compete in its industry; Vacasa's ability to attract and retain homeowners and\nguests; Vacasa's ability to provide high-quality customer service; Vacasa's ability to develop new or\nenhanced offerings and services; Vacasa's ability to maintain and enhance relationships with distribution\npartners; Vacasa's ability to cost-effectively drive traffic to its platform; Vacasa's ability to maintain and\nenhance its brand and reputation, and avoid negative publicity that could damage its brand; the safety of\nVacasa's platform; Vacasa's ability to manage its international operations; Vacasa's ability to consummate\nor successfully integrate recent and future acquisitions; Vacasa's ability to attract and retain capable\nmanagement and employees; increased personnel costs or labor shortages; declines or disruptions to the\ntravel and hospitality industries or general economic downturns; the effects of seasonal and other trends on\nVacasa's results of operations; risks related to localized events in states and regions where our managed\nunits are concentrated; Vacasa's ability to obtain adequate insurance coverage for the needs of its business;\nany future impairment of Vacasa's long-lived assets or goodwill; significant fluctuations in Vacasa's results\nof operations from quarter to quarter and year to year as a result of seasonality and other factors;\noperational metrics subject to inherent challenges in measurement and real or perceived inaccuracies;\nupticks or downturns in bookings are not immediately reflected in Vacasa's results of operations; Vacasa's\nability to manage funds held on behalf of customers; Vacasa's expectations regarding its tax liabilities and\nthe adequacy of its reserves; any undetected errors on Vacasa's platform; Vacasa's reliance on third-party\nservice providers in connection with key aspects of its platform and operations; Vacasa's ability to adapt to\nchanges in technology and the evolving demands of homeowners and guests; Vacasa's ability to protect its\nintellectual property and its data; Vacasa's use of \"open source\" software; Vacasa's use of artificial\nintelligence in its business and risks related to cyberattacks, data security breaches, or other security\nincidents; Vacasa's ability to stay in compliance with laws and regulations, including tax laws, that currently\napply or may become applicable to its business both in the United States and internationally and its\nexpectations regarding the impact of various laws, regulations and restrictions that relate to its business;\nand risks related to the ownership of Vacasa's Class A Common Stock, including the significant influence its\nprincipal stockholders and holders of its convertible notes have over Vacasa.\nYou should carefully consider the foregoing factors and the other risks and uncertainties described in the\n\"Risk Factors\" section of Vacasa's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,\n2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), its Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on\nAugust 9, 2024, as well as its other filings with the SEC. These filings identify and address other important\nrisks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those contained\nin the forward-looking statements.\nThird Quarter 2024 11\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis letter includes Adjusted EBITDA, Non-GAAP cost of revenue, Non-GAAP operations and support expense, Non-GAAP\ntechnology and development expense, Non-GAAP sales and marketing expense and Non-GAAP general and administrative\nexpense (collectively, the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures”), which are financial measures that are not defined by or presented in\naccordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). Reconciliation of the Non-GAAP Financial\nMeasures to their most directly comparable GAAP measure is contained in tabular format below. We use the Non-GAAP Financial\nMeasures to evaluate our performance, identify trends, formulate financial projections, and make strategic decisions.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net loss excluding: (1) depreciation and acquisition-related items consisting of amortization of\nintangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets, if applicable; (2) interest income and expense; (3) any other\nincome or expense not earned or incurred during our normal course of business; (4) any income tax benefit or expense; (5) equity-\nbased compensation costs; (6) one-time costs related to strategic business combinations; and (7) restructuring costs, including\nworkforce reduction costs and certain right-of-use asset impairment costs. We calculate each of Non-GAAP costs of revenue, Non-\nGAAP operations and support expense, Non-GAAP technology and development expense, Non-GAAP sales and marketing\nexpenses and Non-GAAP general and administrative expense by excluding, as applicable, the non-cash expenses arising from the\ngrant of equity-based awards, one-time costs related to strategic business combinations, and restructuring costs.\nWe believe these Non-GAAP Financial Measures, when taken together with their corresponding comparable GAAP financial\nmeasures, are useful for analysts and investors. These Non-GAAP Financial Measures allow for more meaningful comparisons of\nour performance by excluding items that are non-cash in nature or when the amount and timing of these items is unpredictable or\none-time in nature, not driven by the performance of our core business operations and/or renders comparisons with prior periods\nless meaningful.\nThe Non-GAAP Financial Measures have significant limitations as analytical tools, should be considered as supplemental in nature,\nand are not meant as a substitute for any financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. We believe the Non-GAAP\nFinancial Measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations,\nare frequently used by these parties in evaluating companies in our industry, and provide useful measures for period-to-period\ncomparisons of our business performance. Moreover, we present the Non-GAAP Financial Measures in this letter because they are\nkey measurements used by our management internally to make operating decisions, including those related to analyzing operating\nexpenses, evaluating performance, and performing strategic planning and annual budgeting.\nThe Non-GAAP Financial Measures have significant limitations as analytical tools, including that:\n• these measures do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual\ncommitments;\n• these measures do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\n• Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense, or the cash required to service interest or principal payments, on our\ndebt;\n• these measures exclude equity-based compensation expense, which has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable\nfuture, a significant recurring expense in our business and an important part of our compensation strategy;\n• Adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP general and administrative expense do not include non-recurring costs related to strategic\nbusiness combinations;\n• Adjusted EBITDA does not include non-recurring impairment charges related to the Company's goodwill and intangible assets;\n• these measures do not reflect restructuring costs, including certain right-of-use asset impairment costs;\n• these measures do not reflect our tax expense or the cash required to pay our taxes; and\n• with respect to Adjusted EBITDA, although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated\nand amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and such measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such\nreplacements.\nThe Non-GAAP Financial Measures are supplemental measures of our performance that are neither required by, nor presented in\naccordance with, GAAP. These Non-GAAP Financial Measures should not be considered as substitutes for GAAP financial\nmeasures such as net loss, operating expenses or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Also, in the\nfuture, we may incur expenses or charges such as those being adjusted in the calculation of these Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\nOur presentation of these Non-GAAP Financial Measures should not be construed as an inference that future results will be\nunaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items, and these Non-GAAP measures may be different from similarly titled metrics or\nmeasures presented by other companies.\nOur guidance may also include Adjusted EBITDA. A reconciliation of the Company’s Adjusted EBITDA guidance to the most\ndirectly comparable GAAP financial measure cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts and is not provided herein because\nof the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliations, including\nadjustments that are made for depreciation and amortization of intangible assets, equity-based compensation expense, business\ncombination costs, restructuring charges and other adjustments reflected in our reconciliation of historical Adjusted EBITDA, the\namounts of which could be material.\nThird Quarter 2024 12\nKey Business Metrics Definitions\nWe collect key business metrics to assess our performance. Our key business metrics include Gross\nBooking Value (“GBV”), Nights Sold, and Gross Booking Value per Night Sold.\nGBV represents the dollar value of bookings from our distribution partners as well as those booked\ndirectly on our platform related to Nights Sold during the period and cancellation fees for bookings\ncancelled during the period (which may relate to bookings made during prior periods). GBV is\ninclusive of amounts charged to guests for rent, fees, and the estimated taxes paid by guests when\nwe are responsible for collecting tax. Changes in GBV reflect our ability to add homes by attracting\nhomeowners through our individual sales approach, and through portfolio transactions or strategic\nacquisitions, to retain homeowners and guests, and to optimize the availability and utilization of the\nhomes on our platform. Changes in GBV also reflect changes in the pricing of rents, fees, and\nestimated taxes paid by guests. Changes in utilization of the homes on our platform and pricing of\nthose homes are generally reflective of changes in guest demand.\nWe define Nights Sold as the total number of nights stayed by guests in homes hosted on our\nplatform in a given period. Nights Sold is a key measure of the scale and quality of homes on our\nplatform and our ability to generate demand and manage yield on behalf of our homeowners. We\nexperience seasonality in the number of Nights Sold. Typically, the second and third quarters of the\nyear each have higher Nights Sold than the first and fourth quarters, as guests tend to travel more\nduring the peak summer travel season.\nGBV per Night Sold represents the dollar value of each night stayed by guests on our platform in a\ngiven period. GBV per Night Sold reflects the pricing of rents, fees, and estimated taxes paid by\nguests. There is a strong relationship between GBV and Nights Sold, and these two variables are\nmanaged in concert with one another.\nThird Quarter 2024 13"

Business\nVacasa, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \"Company\") operate a vertically integrated vacation rental platform. Homeowners utilize the\nCompany’s technology and services to realize income from their rental assets. Guests from around the world utilize the Company’s\ntechnology and services to search for and book Vacasa-listed properties in the United States, Belize, Canada, Costa Rica, and Mexico.\nThe Company collects nightly rent on behalf of homeowners and earns the majority of its revenue from commissions on rent and from\nadditional reservation-related fees paid by guests when a vacation rental is booked directly through the Company’s website or app or\nthrough its distribution partners. The Company conducts its business through Vacasa Holdings LLC (\"Vacasa Holdings\" or \"OpCo\") and\nits subsidiaries. The Company is headquartered in Portland, Oregon.\nNote 2 - Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP and the rules\nand regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"). These condensed consolidated financial statements include the\naccounts of the Company, its wholly-owned or majority-owned subsidiaries, and entities in which the Company is deemed to have a\ndirect or indirect controlling financial interest based on either a variable interest model or voting interest model. All intercompany\nbalances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The financial information as of December 31, 2023 contained in this\nQuarterly Report is derived from the audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company's 2023 Annual\nReport, which should be read in conjunction with these condensed consolidated financial statements. Certain information in footnote\ndisclosures normally included in annual financial statements was condensed or omitted for the interim periods presented in accordance\nwith GAAP. In the opinion of management, the interim data includes all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments,\nnecessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods. The interim results of operations and cash flows are not necessarily\nindicative of those results and cash flows expected for the year.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company held 15,822,273 units of Vacasa Holdings (\"OpCo Units\"), which represented an ownership\ninterest of approximately 70%. The portion of the consolidated subsidiaries not owned by the Company and any related activity is\neliminated through redeemable noncontrolling interests in the condensed consolidated balance sheets and net income (loss) attributable\nto redeemable noncontrolling interests in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nThe Company is an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our\nBusiness Startups Act of 2012 (the \"JOBS Act\"), which permits the Company to take advantage of an extended transition period to\ncomply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. As of January 1, 2022, the Company elected to\nirrevocably opt out of the extended transition period.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the\ncondensed consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.\nSignificant estimates and assumptions reflected in the condensed consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, the\nuseful lives of property and equipment and intangible assets, allowance for credit losses, valuation of assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed in business acquisitions and related contingent consideration, valuation of redeemable convertible preferred units, valuation of\nequity-based compensation, valuation of goodwill, valuation of long-lived assets, and valuation of financial instruments remeasured at\nfair value through earnings. Actual results may differ materially from such estimates. Management believes that the estimates, and\njudgments upon which they rely, are reasonable based upon information available to them at the time that these estimates and\njudgments are made. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, the Company’s\ncondensed consolidated financial statements will be affected.\nRisks and Uncertainties\nLiquidity\nSince the Company's founding, its principal sources of liquidity have been from proceeds received through the issuance of equity and\ndebt financing. The Company has incurred significant operating losses and generated negative cash flows from operations as it has\ninvested to support the growth of the business. To execute on its strategic initiatives, the Company has and will continue to incur\noperating losses and generate negative cash flows from operations on an annual basis now and in the future, and as a result, will require\nand continue to need additional capital resources.\n15\nIndex to Notes\nVacasa, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(unaudited)\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $124.4 million. We experienced more variable and generally weaker\ndemand than is typical in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and, as a result, our cash position did not build as expected in the\nperiod.\nOn May 7, 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a workforce reduction and reorganization plan (the “Reorganization”),\nsee Note 14, Workforce Reductions, which is intended to, among other things, reduce certain fixed costs in the business, promote\ngreater efficiency, and realign its business and strategic priorities as a way to accelerate the transformation of the business to a model\nfocused more on local market accountability and execution. This plan involves significant structural changes to the way the Company\nruns its business, including a significant reduction in our corporate personnel and functions. Although the Company believes the\nReorganization and associated operational changes will improve the long-term efficacy of its business model by empowering the local\nmarkets, streamlining corporate functions, and better position it for profitability and to generate free cash flow over the long term, the\nimplementation and execution of the Reorganization measures are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including whether the\nCompany has targeted the appropriate areas for its cost-saving efforts and at the appropriate scale. If the Reorganization plan is not\nsuccessful, the Company may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits, which could adversely affect the business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations, including its liquidity position and ability to raise additional capital.\nThe Company’s primary requirements for liquidity and capital are to finance working capital requirements, capital expenditures, and other\ngeneral corporate purposes. As a result of the significant fluctuations in the Company's cash position, continued decreases in the\nnumber of homes on our platform, lower guest demand, changes in booking patterns, and the potential impact of the Reorganization on\nthe business, the Company sought opportunities for additional capital. On May 8, 2024, the Company drew $81.0 million under the\nRevolving Credit Facility (defined in Note 8, Debt), which is subject to financial covenants (see Note 8, Debt). On August 7, 2024, a\nsubsidiary of the Company issued $30.0 million of Convertible Notes (as defined in Note 8, Debt) to supplement our cash position.\nThe Company continues to assess its liquidity position and opportunities for additional capital, which may be obtained through additional\nequity offerings, which would dilute the ownership of the Company's existing stockholders, or additional debt financings, which may\ncontain covenants that restrict the operations of the business or otherwise contain terms unfavorable or dilutive to the business and its\nexisting stockholders. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, the Company may not be able to raise the\nfinancing on terms acceptable to the Company or at all. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital when desired, its business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe Company expects to continue to fund operations primarily through use of its cash and cash equivalents, debt financing, and equity\nofferings. The Company believes its existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund operations, working capital requirements, capital\nexpenditures, and service debt obligations for at least the next 12 months as of the date of this filing.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nExcept as identified below, there were no changes to the accounting policies disclosed in Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies of the\nCompany's 2023 Annual Report that had a material impact on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements and related\nnotes.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nThe Company evaluates its long-lived assets or asset groups for indicators of possible impairment by comparing the carrying amount to\nfuture net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by such asset or asset group, including upon its eventual disposal, when\nevents or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If the carrying\namount of the long-lived asset is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, impairment is recognized to the extent that the\ncarrying amount exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated cash flows discounted at a rate\ncommensurate with the risk involved and based on assumptions representative of market participants. The Company recorded long-lived\nasset impairment charges of $84.0 million and $46.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nRefer to Note 6, Intangible Assets, Net and Goodwill, for additional information.\nConvertible Notes\nThe Company determined the Convertible Notes (as defined in Note 8, Debt) were eligible for the fair value option and made such\nelection to account for the Initial Notes (as defined in Note 8, Debt) entirely at fair value. The fair value option may be elected on an\ninstrument-by-instrument basis and is irrevocable unless a new election date occurs. Additional Notes (as defined\n16\nIndex to Notes\nVacasa, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(unaudited)\nin Note 8, Debt) may be issued in subsequent periods where the Company would be able to make a fair value option election upon\nissuance provided eligibility criteria are met. The Company records the portion of the Convertible Notes that are issued and outstanding\nfor accounting purposes at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other income (expense), net in the condensed consolidated\nstatement of operations, except for the portion of the total change in fair value that results from a change in the instrument-specific credit\nrisk of the Convertible Notes, which is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). The fair value option election was made to align\nthe accounting for the Convertible Notes with the Company's financial reporting objectives and reduce operational effort to account for\nembedded features that otherwise would require bifurcation as a separate unit of account.\nPursuant to the fair value option election, direct and incremental debt issuance costs and consideration paid to the lender related to the\nConvertible Notes were expensed as incurred and recorded in other income (expense), net in the condensed consolidated statements of\noperations. Measurement of the change in fair value of the Convertible Notes includes accrued interest, whether paid-in-kind or cash.\nNotes Option Liability\nThe Notes Option (as defined below) granted in conjunction with the Convertible Notes described in Note 8, Debt, is an equity-linked\nfinancial instrument required to be recognized as a liability remeasured through earnings. The Company records the Notes Option\nliability at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other income (expense), net in the condensed consolidated statements of\noperations.\nAccounting Pronouncements Adopted in Fiscal 2024\nThe Company has not adopted any recent accounting pronouncements that have had a material impact on the Company's financial\nposition, results of operations, or cash flows in fiscal 2024.\nAccounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures,\nthat modifies the disclosure and presentation requirements of reportable segments. The new guidance requires the disclosure of\nsignificant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and included within each reported\nmeasure of segment profit and loss. In addition, the new guidance enhances interim disclosure requirements, clarifies circumstances in\nwhich an entity can disclose multiple segment measures of profit or loss, provides new segment disclosure requirements for entities with\na single reportable segment, and contains other disclosure requirements. The update is effective for annual periods beginning after\nDecember 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. We are in\nthe process of evaluating the impact of adopting this new guidance on our consolidated financial statement disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, to improve its income tax disclosure\nrequirements. Under the new guidance, public business entities must annually (1) disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation\nand (2) provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold (if the effect of those reconciling items is\nequal to or greater than 5% of the amount computed by multiplying pretax income (loss) by the applicable statutory income tax rate). The\nnew guidance is effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. We are in the process of\nevaluating the impact of adopting this new guidance on our consolidated financial statement disclosures.\n17\nIndex to Notes\nVacasa, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(unaudited)\nNote 3 - Revenue\nRevenue Disaggregation\nA disaggregation of the Company’s revenues by nature of the Company’s performance obligations is as follows (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nVacation rental platform $ 307,650 $ 372,606 $ 754,852 $ 917,881\nOther services 6,398 6,471 17,644 22,629\nTotal $ 314,048 $ 379,077 $ 772,496 $ 940,510\nContract Liability Balances\nContract liability balances on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets consist of deferred revenue for amounts collected\nin advance of a guest stay, limited to the amount of the booking to which the Company expects to be entitled as revenue. The\nCompany’s deferred revenue balances exclude funds payable to owners and hospitality and sales taxes payable, as those amounts will\nnot result in revenue recognition. Deferred revenue is recognized into revenue over the period in which a guest completes a stay.\nSubstantially all of the deferred revenue balances at the end of each period are expected to be recognized as revenue within the\nsubsequent 12 months.\nCosts to Obtain a Contract\nThe Company capitalizes certain costs it incurs to obtain new homeowner contracts when those costs are expected to be recovered\nthrough revenue generated from that contract. Capitalized amounts are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the\ncustomer through sales and marketing expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Costs to obtain a contract, net\nof accumulated amortization, capitalized as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were $31.8 million and $34.8 million,\nrespectively, and were recorded as a component of prepaid expenses and other current assets and other long-term assets in the\ncondensed consolidated balance sheets. The amount of amortization recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024\nwas $3.7 million and $11.2 million, respectively. The amount of amortization recorded for the three and nine months ended September\n30, 2023 was $2.2 million and $6.0 million, respectively.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company’s allowance for credit losses related to accounts receivable was $13.2\nmillion and $11.7 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized credit loss\nexpense of $0.9 million and $3.0 million, respectively, which was recorded as a component of general and administrative expense in the\ncondensed consolidated statements of operations. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized\ncredit loss expense of $0.9 million and $2.7 million, respectively, which was recorded as a component of general and administrative\nexpense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nNote 4 - Fair Value Measurements\nThe following tables set forth the Company's financial liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis (in thousands):\nAs of September 30, 2024\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nLiabilities\nContingent consideration $ — $ — $ 3,759 $ 3,759\nClass G Common Stock(1) — — 506 506\nConvertible Notes — — 24,460 24,460\nNotes Option Liability — — 315 315\n18\nIndex to Notes\nVacasa, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(unaudited)\nAs of December 31, 2023\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nLiabilities\nContingent consideration $ — $ — $ 8,043 $ 8,043\nClass G Common Stock(1) — — 506 506\n(1) For more information, see Note 13, Equity of our 2023 Annual Report.\nThe carrying amounts of certain financial instruments, including cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts\npayable, and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility (defined in Note 8, Debt) approximate fair value due to their short-term\nmaturities and are excluded from the fair value tables above.\nLevel 3 instruments consist of contingent consideration obligations related to acquired businesses, the liabilities for contingent earnout\nshare consideration represented by the Company's Class G Common Stock, and the Convertible Notes and Notes Option Liability.\nContingent Consideration\nThe contingent consideration obligations are recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other long-term liabilities on\nthe condensed consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the contingent consideration is estimated utilizing an income approach and\nbased on the Company's expectation of achieving the contractually defined homeowner contract conversion and retention targets at the\nacquisition date. The Company assesses the fair value of these obligations at each reporting date thereafter with any changes reflected\nas gains and losses in general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The charges for\nchanges in fair value of the contingent consideration were not material for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023.\nClass G Common Stock\nThe contingent earnout share consideration represented by the Company's Class G Common Stock is recorded in other long-term\nliabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the Class G Common Stock is estimated on a recurring basis\nusing the Monte Carlo simulation method. The fair value is based on the simulated stock price of the Company over the remaining term\nof the shares. Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Class G Common Stock is automatically\nconverted to Class A shares at certain conversion ratios upon the occurrence of their respective triggering events. Inputs used to\ndetermine the estimated fair value of the Class G Common Stock include the remaining contractual term of the shares, the risk-free rate,\nthe volatility of comparable companies over the remaining term, and the price of the Company's Class A Common Stock. The Company\nassesses the fair value of the Class G Common Stock at each reporting date with any changes reflected within other income, net in the\ncondensed consolidated statements of operations. The charges for changes in fair value of the Class G Common Stock were not\nmaterial for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nConvertible Notes and Notes Option Liability\nThe Convertible Notes are valued using a binomial lattice model within a probability-weighted framework with respect to certain\nredemption features. The following assumptions were used in determining the fair value of the Convertible Notes as of the issuance date\nand September 30, 2024:\nAs of September 30,\nAs of August 7, 2024\n2024\nRisk Free Rate 3.95 % 3.95 %\nDiscount Rate 41.58 % 39.58 %\nVolatility 45.00 % 45.00 %\nShare Price $ 3.62 $ 2.81\nThe Notes Option liability is valued using a lattice model that incorporates optionality of the fixed interest rate and conversion price of the\nunderlying convertible debt.\n19\nIndex to Notes\nVacasa, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(unaudited)\nThe following table presents a summary of the change in fair value of Convertible Notes and Notes Option liability:\nConvertible Notes(1) Notes Option(2)\nFair value as of June 30, 2024$ — $ —\nFair value as of the date of issuance$ 27,549 $ 1,701\nChange in fair value measurement$ (3,089) $ (1,386)\nFair value as of September 30, 2024$ 24,460 $ 315\n(1) The Convertible Notes are recorded within long-term debt, net of current portion on the condensed consolidated balance sheets and the change in fair\nvalue measurement associated with the Convertible Notes is recorded within other income, net on the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\n(2) The Notes Option is recorded within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets and the change in\nfair value measurement associated with the Notes Option is recorded within other income, net on the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded long-lived asset impairment charges of $84.0\nmillion and $46.0 million, respectively. The fair value estimate of the Company's homeowner contract assets was classified in Level 3 of\nthe fair value hierarchy due to the significance of unobservable inputs developed using Company-specific information. For more\ninformation on the impairment of long-lived assets, refer to Note 6, Intangible Assets, Net and Goodwill.\nImpairment of Right-of-Use Assets\nThe Company tests long-lived assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying value of\nan asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company took substantive\naction to negotiate certain sublease agreements for portions of the Company's leased corporate office space in Portland, Oregon and\nBoise, Idaho. Based on the sublease negotiations, the Company determined that the respective right-of-use assets had net carrying\nvalues that exceeded their estimated undiscounted future cash flows. The Company then estimated the fair value of the asset groups\nbased on their discounted cash flows. The carrying values of the asset groups exceeded their fair values and, as a result, the Company\nrecorded right-of-use asset impairments of $4.2 million.

The declines are\nattributable to volatile guest demand and guest bookings. Further, the Company continued to experience a sustained decline in stock\nprice. Based on these factors, the Company concluded the events and changes in circumstances indicated an impairment may exist (the\n\"triggering event\") and conducted quantitative impairment assessments of long-lived assets and goodwill as of March 31, 2024. No\ntriggering event was identified as of September 30, 2024.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nThe Company evaluates its long-lived assets or asset groups for indicators of possible impairment by comparing the carrying amount to\nfuture net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by such asset or asset group, including upon its eventual disposal (the\n\"recoverability test\"), when there is a triggering event. The Company determined its long-lived assets represent one asset group for\npurposes of long-lived asset impairment. Based on the results of the recoverability test as of March 31, 2024, the Company concluded\nthe carrying value of the single asset group was not recoverable. To allocate and recognize the impairment charge, the Company\ndetermined the individual fair value of the long-lived assets.\nAs of March 31, 2024, the carrying value of the Company's homeowner contracts exceeded the fair value, resulting in a long-lived asset\nimpairment charge of $84.0 million. No impairment was recognized on the remaining long-lived assets, as their carrying values did not\nexceed their fair values. The Company estimated the fair value of the homeowner contracts based on the present value of estimated\nfuture cash flows, which the Company considers to be a Level 3 unobservable input in the fair value hierarchy. The Company prepared\ncash flow projections based on management's estimates of future revenue and operating margins, taking into consideration the historical\nperformance and the current macroeconomic, industry, and market conditions. The Company based the discount rate on the weighted-\naverage cost of capital considering Company-specific characteristics and changes in the reporting unit's projected cash flows.\nImpairment of Goodwill\nThe Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually, as of the first day of the fourth quarter, and more frequently if events or changes\nin circumstances indicate an impairment may exist. Based on the triggering event identified above, the Company conducted a\nquantitative goodwill impairment assessment as of March 31, 2024. The goodwill impairment assessment did not result in goodwill\nimpairment charges as of March 31, 2024 as the fair value estimate of the Company's single reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount.\nThe fair value estimate of the Company's single reporting unit was derived from a combination of an income approach and a market\napproach. Under the income approach, the Company estimated the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of\nestimated future cash flows, which the Company considers to be a Level 3 unobservable input in the fair value hierarchy. The Company\nprepared cash flow projections based on management's estimates of future revenue and operating margins, taking into consideration the\nhistorical performance and the current macroeconomic, industry, and market conditions. The Company based the discount rate on the\nweighted-average cost of capital considering Company-specific characteristics and changes in the reporting unit's projected cash flows.\nUnder the market approach, the Company estimated the fair value of the reporting unit based on revenue market multiples derived from\ncomparable publicly traded companies with similar characteristics as the reporting unit, as well as an estimated control premium. No\ntriggering event was identified as of September 30, 2024.\nPotential indicators of impairment include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results, significant negative\nindustry or economic trends, or a significant decline in the Company's stock price and/or market capitalization for a sustained period of\ntime. It is reasonably possible that one or more impairment indicators could occur or intensify in the near term, which may result in\nfurther impairment of long-lived assets or goodwill.\n22\nIndex to Notes\nVacasa, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(unaudited)\nNote 7 - Accrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities consisted of the following (in thousands):\nAs of September As of December\n30, 31,\n2024 2023\nEmployee-related accruals $ 25,182 $ 23,834\nHomeowner reserves 8,845 9,198\nCurrent portion of acquisition liabilities(1) 7,396 11,641\nCurrent portion of operating lease liabilities 8,660 8,670\nOther(2) 12,576 9,477\nTotal accrued expenses and other current liabilities $ 62,659 $ 62,820\n(1) The current portion of acquisition liabilities includes contingent consideration and deferred payments to sellers due within one year.\n(2) Other includes legal contingencies.

As of September 30, 2024, the\nCompany's insurance premium financing agreements had lapsed, and no corresponding liability remained.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nIn October 2021, Vacasa Holdings, LLC and its wholly owned subsidiary (the \"Borrower\") and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, the\n\"Guarantors\") entered into a credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the other lenders party thereto from time to time.\nThe credit agreement, as subsequently amended in December 2021, June 2023, and October 2024 (as amended, the \"Credit\nAgreement\"; capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined are used as defined in the Credit Agreement), provides for a senior\nsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $105.0 million (\"Revolving Credit Facility\"). The Revolving Credit\nFacility includes a sub-facility for letters of credit in aggregate face amount of $40.0 million, which reduces borrowing availability under\nthe Revolving Credit Facility. Proceeds may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes.\nThe June 2023 amendment modified the Credit Agreement to replace the LIBOR-based reference rate options with Adjusted Term\nSecured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") based reference rate options. Subsequent to the amendment, any borrowings under the\nRevolving Credit Facility are subject to interest, determined as follows:\n23\nIndex to Notes\nVacasa, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(unaudited)\n• Alternate Base Rate (\"ABR\") borrowings accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to the ABR plus a margin of 1.50%. The ABR\nis equal to the greatest of (i) the Prime Rate, (ii) the New York Federal Reserve Bank Rate plus 0.50%, and (iii) the Adjusted\nTerm SOFR for a one-month interest period plus 1.00%.\n• Term SOFR borrowings accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted Term SOFR plus a margin of 2.50%. Adjusted\nTerm SOFR means, for any Interest Period, an interest rate per annum equal to the Term SOFR for such Interest Period.\nSubsequent to the October 2024 amendment, ABR borrowings accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to the ABR plus a margin of\n2.50%, and Term SOFR borrowings accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted Term SOFR plus a margin of 3.50%.\nBorrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility do not amortize and are due and payable on October 7, 2026. Amounts outstanding\nunder the Revolving Credit Facility may be voluntarily prepaid at any time and from time to time, in whole or in part, without premium or\npenalty. In addition to paying interest on the principal amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Company is required\nto pay a commitment fee on unused amounts at a rate of 0.25% per annum. The Company is also required to pay customary letter of\ncredit and agency fees.\nThe Credit Agreement contains a number of covenants that, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, restrict the ability of\nthe Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries to:\n• create, incur, assume or permit to exist any debt or liens;\n• merge into or consolidate or amalgamate with any other person, or permit any other person to merge into or consolidate with it,\nor liquidate or dissolve;\n• make or hold certain investments;\n• sell, transfer, lease, license or otherwise dispose of its assets, including equity interests (and, in the case of restricted\nsubsidiaries, the issuance of additional equity interests);\n• pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments;\n• substantively alter the character of the business of the Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole; and\n• sell, lease or otherwise transfer any property or assets to, or purchase, lease or otherwise acquire any property or assets from,\nor otherwise engage in any other transactions with, any of its affiliates.\nThe October 2024 amendment, among other things, amended the minimum amount of consolidated revenue and the compliance\nthresholds that are measured on a trailing four-quarter basis, as of the last date of each fiscal quarter. The Borrower and its restricted\nsubsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum amount of consolidated revenue, measured on a trailing four-quarter basis, as of the\nlast date of each fiscal quarter, provided that such covenant will only apply if, on such date, the aggregate principal amount of\noutstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and letters of credit (excluding undrawn amounts under any letters of credit in\nan aggregate face amount of up to $20.0 million and letters of credit that have been cash collateralized) exceeds 35% of the then-\noutstanding revolving commitments. The Borrower is also required to maintain liquidity of at least $15.0 million as of the last date of each\nfiscal quarter beginning on June 30, 2022.\nThe obligations of the Borrower and certain guarantor subsidiaries (the \"Guarantors\") are secured by first-priority liens on substantially all\nof the assets of the Borrower and the Guarantors. As of September 30, 2024, there were $81.0 million in borrowings outstanding under\nthe Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2023, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, there were $23.4 million of letters of credit issued under the Revolving Credit Facility, and $0.6 million was\navailable for borrowings.\nConvertible Notes\nOn August 7, 2024, the Company, and certain of its majority-owned subsidiaries entered into a note purchase agreement (as\nsubsequently amended on October 25, 2024, the “Note Purchase Agreement”) with the purchaser thereof, DK VCSA Lender LLC (the\n\"Purchaser\"), an affiliate of Davidson Kempner Capital Management LP, and certain existing holders of the Company’s Class A Common\nStock. The Note Purchase Agreement provides for the issuance and sale of up to $75.0 million aggregate principal amount of first lien\nsenior secured convertible notes due 2029 (the “Convertible Notes”) to the Purchaser. The Convertible Notes are comprised of: (i) $30.0\nmillion of notes (the \"Initial Notes\") issued on August 7, 2024 (the “Convertible Notes Funding Date”); (ii) up to $20.0 million of notes to\nbe issued pursuant to an option granted by the Company to the Purchaser, which is exercisable at Purchaser’s option within six months\nafter the Convertible Notes Funding Date, on the same terms and conditions as the Initial Notes (the “Notes Option” and the notes in\nrespect thereof the \"DK Option Notes\"); and (iii) up to $25.0 million of notes to be issued pursuant to the mutual agreement of the\nBorrower and the Purchaser any time after the Convertible Notes Funding Date, but before the Convertible Notes Maturity Date (as\ndefined below), on the same terms and conditions as the Initial Notes (the “Mutual Option Notes” and together with the DK Option Notes,\nthe “Additional Notes”). In the event the Purchaser does not exercise the Notes Option, then the Company may issue the DK Option\nNotes to a third-party\n24\nIndex to Notes\nVacasa, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(unaudited)\npurchaser pursuant to the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement. Simultaneously with and pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement,\nthe Company and certain of its majority-owned subsidiaries, also entered into a collateral agreement (the “Collateral Agreement”)\nestablishing a first priority lien on substantially all of the assets of Holdings, the borrower, and other guarantors, and entered into a\nguarantee agreement (the “Guarantee Agreement”) guaranteeing the Convertible Notes. The liens established under the Collateral\nAgreement are pari passu in priority with the liens under the Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, the principal balance\noutstanding of the Convertible Notes, including paid-in-kind interest settlements, was $30.5 million.\nThe Convertible Notes bear interest at an annual rate of 11.25%, which is payable in kind for the first three years, by adding the amount\nof such accrued interest to the principal amount of the Convertible Notes; provided that, at the Borrower’s election, interest may be paid\nin cash at an annual rate of 9.75%. Beginning on August 7, 2027, the Convertible Notes will bear interest at an annual rate equal to\n9.75% payable in cash. The Convertible Notes will mature on August 7, 2029 (the “Convertible Notes Maturity Date”), unless earlier\nrepurchased, redeemed or converted. The Convertible Notes are guaranteed by Holdings and certain other current and future\nsubsidiaries of the Company, and are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of their respective assets (other than certain\nexcluded assets).\nThe Convertible Notes are convertible, in whole and not in part (subject to certain limitations described below), into shares of the\nCompany’s Class A Common Stock at the option of the Purchaser; provided, however, that in the event that any conversion of the\nConvertible Notes would trigger the change of control rules (as defined in the Convertible Notes), then the Convertible Notes shall be\nconverted in part, at the maximum amount permitted without triggering such change of control rules. The initial conversion price of the\nConvertible Notes is $4.16 (the “Conversion Price”), which is subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments.\nFrom and after August 7, 2027, the Company may redeem the Convertible Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to\n102% of the aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, from\nand after August 7, 2027, if the closing price per share of the Class A Common Stock exceeds 225% of the Conversion Price for 20 out\nof 30 consecutive trading days, the Company may redeem all, but not less than all, of the Convertible Notes at a redemption price equal\nto 100% of the principal amount to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Upon the consummation of a Major Transaction (as\ndefined in the Note Purchase Agreement), the Company may also redeem all, but not less than all, of the Convertible Notes then\noutstanding in an amount equal to 130% of the initial principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be redeemed, less all accrued interest\npreviously paid in cash.\nThe Note Purchase Agreement includes customary negative covenants, subject to specified exceptions, including limits on the ability of\nthe Company to incur additional debt. The Note Purchase Agreement also includes customary events of default, the occurrence of which\nmay result in the acceleration of the maturity of the Convertible Notes. In addition, the Company may not permit (i) a certain liquidity\nthreshold (as further defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) to be less than $15.0 million as of the last day of any test period (as\ndefined in the Note Purchase Agreement) commencing with such test period ending on September 30, 2024 and (ii) a certain\nconsolidated EBITDA metric (as further defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) of the Company to be less than $15.0 million as of the\nlast day of any such test period commencing with such test period ending on December 31, 2026.\nOn the Convertible Notes Funding Date, the Company also issued to the Purchaser an aggregate of 174,825 shares of Class A Common\nStock (the “Fee Shares”), representing payment in full of certain amounts payable to the Purchaser in respect of the Initial Notes\npursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement.\nThe October 2024 amendment modified the Note Purchase Agreement to conform the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement to the\nCredit Agreement, as amended, to the extent they apply to the Note Purchase Agreement.\n25\nIndex to Notes\nVacasa, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(unaudited)\nNote 9 - Other Long-Term Liabilities\nOther long-term liabilities consisted of the following (in thousands):\nAs of September 30, As of December 31,\n2024 2023\nClass G Common Stock(1) $ 506 $ 506\nLong-term portion of acquisition liabilities(2) 560 4,682\nLong-term portion of operating lease liabilities 15,354 17,196\nOther 10,702 10,695\nTotal other long-term liabilities $ 27,122 $ 33,079\n(1) For more information, see Note 13, Equity of our 2023 Annual Report.\n(2) The long-term portion of acquisition liabilities includes contingent consideration and deferred payments to sellers due after one year.\nNote 10 - Income Taxes\nThe Company's effective tax rate was a 2% benefit on pre-tax income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and an 0%\nbenefit on pre-tax loss for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The Company's effective tax rate was a 0% expense on pre-tax\nloss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and a 0% benefit on pre-tax loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe effective tax rate differs from our statutory rate in both periods due to the effect of flow-through entity income and losses for which\nthe taxable income or loss is allocated to the Vacasa Holdings, LLC members and due to valuation allowance considerations.\nNote 11 - Equity and Equity-Based Compensation\nEquity-Based Award Activities\nRestricted Stock Units\nA summary of the Restricted Stock Unit (\"RSU\") activity was as follows during the period indicated:\nRestricted Stock\nWeighted Average\nActivity Type Units\nGrant Date Fair Value\n(in thousands)\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2023 833 $ 27.58\nGranted 845 4.60\nVested (302) 22.74\nForfeited (286) 25.95\nOutstanding as of September 30, 2024 1,090 11.53\nAs of September 30, 2024, there was unrecognized compensation expense of $11.5 million related to unvested RSUs, which is expected\nto be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years.\nPerformance Stock Units\nThe Company has granted Performance Stock Units (\"PSUs\") to certain members of its leadership team, which vest based upon the\nachievement of performance criteria and requisite service. The performance criteria are based on the achievement of certain share price\nappreciation targets.

Offering and purchase periods begin on June 1 and December 1 of each year.\nParticipants will be granted the right to purchase shares at a price per share that is 85% of the lesser of the fair market value of the\nshares at (i) the participant’s entry date into the applicable one-year offering period or (ii) the end of each six-month purchase period\nwithin the offering period.\nThe ESPP does not meet the criteria of Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code and is considered a non-qualified plan for federal tax\npurposes. The Company has treated the ESPP as a compensatory plan under GAAP.\nDuring both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no shares of Class A Common Stock purchased under\nthe ESPP. During March 2024, the Company suspended further contributions to the ESPP and refunded all contributions remaining in\nthe plan.

Basic net income (loss) per share is calculated\nby dividing net income (loss) attributable to Vacasa, Inc. by the weighted-average shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding without\nthe consideration for potentially dilutive shares of common stock. Diluted net income (loss) per share represents basic net income (loss)\nper share adjusted to include the potentially dilutive effect of RSUs, PSUs, SARs, stock options, employee equity units, Convertible\nNotes, Notes Option, and Class G Common Stock. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) by\nthe weighted-average number of Class A Common Stock equivalents outstanding for the period determined using the treasury stock\nmethod and if-converted method, as applicable. During periods of net loss, diluted loss per share is equal to basic net loss per share\nbecause the antidilutive effect of potential shares of common stock is disregarded.\nOn August 7, 2024 the Company issued the Convertible Notes, which qualify as participating securities under ASC 260 because the\nholders have participation rights on an as-if-converted basis. Accordingly, basic EPS is determined using the two-class method and\ndiluted EPS is determined using the more dilutive of the two-class method or diluted EPS determined using the treasury stock method\nand if-converted method, as applicable. Determination of the numerator adjustment under the two-class method considers the dilutive\nimpact of income allocable to noncontrolling interest holders because of Vacasa Holdings’ contractual obligation to issue OpCo units to\nVacasa, Inc. upon issuance of Class A Common Stock by Vacasa, Inc.\nThe following is a reconciliation of basic and diluted income (loss) per share of Class A Common Stock for the periods presented (in\nthousands, except per share data):\n29\nIndex to Notes\nVacasa, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(unaudited)\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNumerator for earnings (loss) per share\ncalculation:\nNet income (loss) 59,259 (402,458) (94,755) (451,712)\nNet income attributable to participating\nsecurities(1) (9,399) — — —\nNet (income) loss attributable to\nnoncontrolling interest holders assuming\nallocation to participating securities(1) (14,986) 174,266 41,669 196,607\nNet income (loss) attributable to Class A\nCommon Stockholders, basic 34,874 (228,192) (53,086) (255,105)\nNet income allocated to dilutive securities 20 — — —\nUnrealized gain on change in fair value of\nconvertible notes (1,818) — — —\nNet income attributable to participating\nsecurities assumed converted 8,909 — — —\nNet income (loss) attributable to Class A\nCommon Stockholders, diluted $ 41,985 $ (228,192) $ (53,086) $ (255,105)\nDenominator for earnings (loss) per\nshare calculation:\nWeighted-average shares outstanding,\nbasic(2) 15,706 12,419 14,725 12,108\nEffect of dilutive securities:\nRestricted stock units 39 — — —\nConvertible notes 4,233 — — —\nTotal effect of dilutive securities 4,272 — — —\nWeighted-average shares outstanding,\ndiluted(2) 19,978 12,419 14,725 12,108\nBasic net income (loss) per Class A\ncommon share:\nNet income (loss) attributable to Class A\nCommon Stockholders, basic $ 34,874 $ (228,192) $ (53,086) $ (255,105)\nWeighted-average shares outstanding,\nbasic(2) 15,706 12,419 14,725 12,108\nNet income (loss) per share of Class A\nCommon Stock, basic $ 2.22 $ (18.37) $ (3.61) $ (21.07)\nDiluted net income (loss) per Class A\ncommon share:\nNet income (loss) attributable to Class A\nCommon Stockholders, diluted $ 41,985 $ (228,192) $ (53,086) $ (255,105)\nWeighted-average shares outstanding,\ndiluted(2) 19,978 12,419 14,725 12,108\nNet income (loss) per share of Class A\nCommon Stock, diluted $ 2.10 $ (18.37) $ (3.61) $ (21.07)\n(1) During the three and nine month periods ending September 30, 2024, there were no participating securities.\n(2) Basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding include restricted stock units that have vested but have not yet settled into shares of Class A\nCommon Stock.\n30\nIndex to Notes\nVacasa, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(unaudited)\nShares of the Company's Class B Common Stock and Class G Common Stock do not participate in earnings or losses of the Company\nand are therefore not participating securities.

In the ordinary course of business, we\nenter into renewal periods under these leases, at which time the commitments typically increase to match then current market rental\nrates. For additional information, refer to Note 8, Leases, of the Company's 2023 Annual Report.\nRegulatory Matters and Legal Proceedings\nThe Company’s operations are subject to laws, rules, and regulations that vary by jurisdiction. In addition, the Company has been and is\ncurrently a party to various legal proceedings, including employment and general litigation matters, which arise in the ordinary course of\nbusiness. Such proceedings and claims can require the Company to expend significant financial and operational resources.\nRegulatory Matters\nThe Company’s core business operations consist of the management of short-term vacation rental stays, which are subject to local, city,\nor county ordinances, together with various state, U.S. and foreign laws, rules and regulations. Such laws, rules, and regulations are\ncomplex and subject to change, and in several instances, jurisdictions have yet to codify or implement applicable laws, rules or\nregulations. Other ancillary components of the Company’s business activities include the management of long-term rental stays and\nhomeowner association management. In addition to laws governing these activities, the Company must comply with laws in relation to\ntravel, tax, privacy and data protection, intellectual property, competition, health and safety, consumer protection, employment and many\nothers. These business operations expose the Company to inquiries and potential claims related to its compliance with applicable laws,\nrules, and regulations. Given the shifting landscape with respect to the short-term rental laws, changes in existing laws or the\nimplementation of new laws could have a material impact on the Company’s business.\nTax Matters\nSome states and localities impose transient occupancy, lodging accommodations, and sales taxes (\"Hospitality and Sales Taxes\") on the\nuse or occupancy of lodging accommodations and other traveler services. The Company collects and remits Hospitality\n32\nIndex to Notes\nVacasa, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(unaudited)\nand Sales Taxes collected from guests on behalf of its homeowners. Such Hospitality and Sales Taxes are generally remitted to tax\njurisdictions within a 30-day period following the end of each month, quarter, or year end.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had an obligation to remit Hospitality and Sales Taxes collected from\nguests in these jurisdictions totaling $19.2 million and $14.7 million, respectively. These payables are recorded in hospitality and sales\ntaxes payable on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company’s potential obligations with respect to Hospitality and Sales Taxes could be affected by various factors, which include, but\nare not limited to, whether the Company determines, or any tax authority asserts, that the Company has a responsibility to collect lodging\nand related taxes on either historical or future transactions or by the introduction of new ordinances and taxes that subject the\nCompany’s operations to such taxes. The Company is under audit and inquiry by various domestic tax authorities with regard to\nhospitality and sales tax matters.\nThe Company has estimated liabilities in certain jurisdictions with respect to state, city, and local taxes related to lodging where\nmanagement believes it is probable that the Company has additional liabilities, and the related amounts can be reasonably estimated.\nThese contingent liabilities primarily arise from the Company's transactions with its homeowners, guests, and service contracts and\nrelate to the applicability of transactional taxes (such as sales, value-added and similar taxes) to services provided. As of September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023, accrued obligations related to these estimated taxes, including estimated penalties and interest, totaled\n$9.0 million and $10.7 million, respectively. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters and judicial processes in\ncertain jurisdictions, the final outcomes of such matters may result in obligations that exceed the estimated liabilities recorded.\nThe Company has estimated other contingent non-income tax related liabilities related to domestic and foreign taxing authorities. The\nsubject matter of these contingent liabilities arises from transactions with homeowners and the related information reporting\nrequirements and potential back-up withholding on certain homeowner payments. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\naccrued obligations related to the information reporting requirements, including estimated penalties and interest, totaled $1.7 million and\n$1.9 million, respectively. With respect to potential back-up withholding on certain homeowner payments, any estimated liability is\ninherently subjective due to the complexity and uncertainty of this matter; therefore, any reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot\nbe estimated.\nRefer to Note 10, Income Taxes, for further discussion on other income tax matters.\nLitigation\nThe Company has been and is currently involved in litigation and legal proceedings and subject to legal claims in the ordinary course of\nbusiness. These include legal claims asserting, among other things, commercial, competition, tax, employment, discrimination, wage-\nand-hour, consumer, personal injury, negligence, and property rights.\nHarry Ramsey III, Administrator of the Estates of Katrina Ramsey, Zoey Ramsey, and Emma Ramsey v. Vacasa LLC, W-Acq. Vacation\nRentals North America LLC, Hatteras Realty, LLC, and Vacasa North Carolina LLC, Case No. 23-CVS-26, Dare County Superior Court,\nNorth Carolina (filed Jan. 19, 2023)\nIn January 2023, the Company was served with a complaint filed against multiple subsidiaries of the Company alleging, among other\nthings, wrongful death relating to a fire in 2020 at rental units managed by a subsidiary of the Company. The complaint was filed in Dare\nCounty Superior Court in the State of North Carolina and seeks damages related to the deaths of three individuals. The Company\nbelieves it has meritorious defenses to the allegations in the complaint and will vigorously contest the allegations. The Company has\naccrued an immaterial amount related to this claim and management does not believe this matter will have a material adverse effect on\nthe Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.\nJon Torerk v. Vacasa LLC et al., No.230901578, Third District Court for Salt Lake City, Utah (served May 12, 2023)\nIn March 2023, Jon Torerk filed a complaint alleging the Company was liable for his injuries sustained from a \"slip and fall\" accident while\nat a vacation home managed by the Company, as a result of the Company's alleged duties owed to Mr. Torerk as a business invitee, and\nseeking damages for his injuries. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the allegations in the complaint and will\nvigorously contest the allegations. Based on the nature of the proceedings in this case, the outcome of this matter remains uncertain and\nthe Company cannot estimate the potential impact, if any, on its business or financial statements at this time.\nA.F., by and through her guardian ad litem, et al. v. Vacasa Seasonals LLC et al., CGC-23-609513, Superior Court San Francisco\nCounty, California (filed Oct. 3, 2023)\nIn October 2023, a woman brought a premises liability claim on behalf of herself and her child, alleging that a \"slip and fall\" accident that\noccurred while at a vacation home managed by the Company caused premature labor. In June 2024, the parties\n33\nIndex to Notes\nVacasa, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(unaudited)\nreached an agreement in principle to settle the case and executed a Stipulation of Settlement. As a result, the Company recorded a net\nimpact of $1.0 million in its financial statements. The net charge represents the Company's gross liability of $6.3 million offset by an\ninsurance receivable of $5.3 million. The gross liability amount is recorded within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the\ncondensed consolidated balance sheet. The insurance receivable is recorded within accounts receivable on the condensed consolidated\nbalance sheet.\nThe Company does not believe, based on currently available facts and circumstances, that the final outcome of any pending legal\nproceedings or ongoing regulatory investigations, taken individually or as a whole, will have a material adverse effect on our\nconsolidated financial statements. However, lawsuits may involve complex questions of fact and law and may require the expenditure of\nsignificant funds and other resources to defend. The results of litigation or regulatory investigations are inherently uncertain, and material\nadverse outcomes are possible. From time to time, the Company may enter into confidential discussions regarding the potential\nsettlement of such lawsuits. Any settlement of pending litigation could require us to incur substantial costs and other ongoing expenses.\nDuring the periods presented, other than as disclosed above, no material amounts have been accrued or disclosed in the accompanying\ncondensed consolidated financial statements with respect to loss contingencies associated with any regulatory matter or legal\nproceeding. These matters are subject to many uncertainties, and the ultimate outcomes are not predictable. There can be no\nassurances that the actual amounts required to satisfy any liabilities arising from the regulatory matters and legal proceedings described\nabove will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.\nIndemnification\nAs a matter of ordinary course, the Company agrees to indemnification clauses in commercial agreements where desirable or\nappropriate. As a result, the Company may be obligated to indemnify third parties for losses or damages incurred in connection with the\nCompany’s operations or its non-compliance with contractual obligations. Additionally, the Company has entered into indemnification\nagreements with its officers and directors, and its bylaws contain certain indemnification obligations for officers and directors. It is not\npossible to determine the aggregate maximum potential loss pursuant to the aforementioned indemnification provisions and obligations\ndue to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular situation.\n34\nIndex to Notes\nVacasa, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(unaudited)\nNote 14 – Workforce Reductions\nReorganization\nOn May 7, 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company (the \"Board\") approved a workforce reduction and reorganization plan (the\n“Reorganization”). These changes implemented a reorganization of the Company’s operations to further equip its field teams to locally\nmanage, and be accountable for, their markets, while significantly reducing the Company’s central corporate footprint. The\nReorganization included the elimination of approximately 800 positions across the Company, in both its local operations teams and\ncentral teams, representing approximately 13% of the workforce, or approximately 6% of our field teams and approximately 40% of our\ncorporate and central operations teams.\nIn connection with the Reorganization, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred severance and\nemployee benefits costs of approximately $5.9 million, which are included in operating costs and expenses in the condensed\nconsolidated statement of operations. The Reorganization was substantially complete as of September 30, 2024.\n2024 Plan\nOn February 27, 2024, the Board approved a workforce reduction plan (the “2024 Plan”) designed to align the Company’s expected cost\nbase with its 2024 strategic and operating priorities. The 2024 Plan included the elimination of approximately 320 positions across the\nCompany, in both its local operations teams and central teams, representing approximately 5% of the workforce, or approximately 2% of\nthe local operations teams and approximately 6% of the central team.\nIn connection with the 2024 Plan, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred severance and employee\nbenefits costs of approximately $2.0 million and professional service costs of $1.4 million, which are included in operating costs and\nexpenses in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. The 2024 Plan was substantially complete as of September 30, 2024.\n2023 Plan\nIn January 2023, the Company implemented a workforce reduction plan (the \"2023 Plan\") designed to align the Company’s expected\ncost base with its 2023 strategic and operating priorities. The 2023 Plan included the elimination of approximately 1,300 positions across\nthe Company, in both the Company's local operations teams and central teams, representing approximately 17% of the workforce.\nIn connection with the 2023 Plan, the Company incurred severance and employee benefits costs of approximately $5.1 million during the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023, which are included in operating costs and expenses in the condensed consolidated statements\nof operations.\n35\nTable of Contents\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our condensed\nconsolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and with our audited consolidated\nfinancial statements and notes thereto included in our 2023 Annual Report. This discussion contains predictions, estimates and forward-\nlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, which are made under the safe harbor provisions of Section 21E of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"). Such statements are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and\nprojections of our industry performance and macroeconomic conditions, based on management's judgment, beliefs, current trends and\nmarket conditions, and involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the\nforward-looking statements. We derive most of our forward-looking statements from our operating budgets and forecasts, which are\nbased upon many detailed assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, we caution that it is very difficult to\npredict the impact of known factors, and it is impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results. Accordingly, we\ncaution you not to place undue reliance on these statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from\nour expectations are disclosed under \"Risk Factors\" in Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q, and in other documents we file from time to\ntime with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"). All of the forward-looking statements in this Form 10-Q are qualified in\ntheir entirety by reference to the factors listed above and those discussed under the heading \"Risk Factors\" below. Our historical results\nare not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future. We undertake no intent or obligation to\npublicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as\notherwise required by law.\nOverview\nWe are the leading vacation rental management platform in North America. Our integrated technology and operations platform is\ndesigned to optimize vacation rental income and home care for homeowners, offer guests a seamless, reliable and high-quality\nexperience, and provide distribution partners with a variety of home listings.\nAs a vertically integrated vacation rental manager, we act as an agent on behalf of our homeowners, which allows us to avoid the capital\nrequirements and limitations of owning the underlying real estate. We are equipped to manage all aspects of the vacation rental\nexperience for homeowners, from listing creation and multi-channel distribution to pricing, marketing optimization and end-to-end\nproperty care. We collect nightly rent on behalf of homeowners and earn the majority of our revenue from homeowner commissions and\nservice fees paid by guests and from additional reservation-related fees paid by guests when a vacation rental is booked directly through\nour website or app or through our distribution partners. We also earn revenue from home care solutions offered directly to our\nhomeowners, such as home improvement and repair services for a separately agreed upon fee and from providing real estate brokerage\nservices and residential management services to community and homeowner associations. We are typically the exclusive vacation rental\nmanager for the homes on our platform, and we are able to capture nearly all of the booking for those properties through our direct\nchannel or through our channel distribution partners.\nRecent Developments\nGuest Demand\nWe continued to see significant variability and deviations from historical guest booking and demand patterns in the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, including more fluctuations in demand than is typical, resulting in fewer Nights Sold (as defined\nwithin Key Business Metrics) per home in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding prior year period\nand lower overall levels of bookings for future periods. As a result, our revenue and our cash position did not build as expected in the\nperiod. A significant portion of our field costs and expenses are fixed, and are not variable with the level of guest reservations. We expect\ncontinued softness and variability in guest bookings, which will likely have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nNote Purchase Agreement, Convertible Notes\nOn August 7, 2024, Vacasa, Inc. entered into a note purchase agreement (as subsequently amended on October 25, 2024, the “Note\nPurchase Agreement”) by and among Vacasa, Inc., its subsidiaries Vacasa Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company\n(“Holdings”), as guarantor, and V-Revolver Sub LLC (“Borrower”), a Delaware limited liability company, as borrower, DK VCSA Lender\nLLC (“DK”), an affiliate of Davidson Kempner Capital Management LP and certain existing holders of the Company’s Class A Common\nStock, par value $0.00001 per share (the “Class A Common Stock”), as purchaser, the other purchasers from time to time thereto, and\nAcquiom Agency Services LLC, as administrative agent and collateral agent, providing for the issuance and sale of up to $75.0 million\naggregate principal amount of first lien senior secured convertible notes due\n36\nTable of Contents\n2029 (the “Convertible Notes”) to DK. The Convertible Notes are comprised of: (i)$30.0 million of notes (the \"Initial Notes\") issued on\nAugust 7, 2024 (the “Funding Date”); (ii) up to $20.0 million of notes to be issued pursuant to an option granted by the Borrower to DK,\nwhich is exercisable at DK’s option within six months after the Funding Date, on the same terms and conditions as the Initial Notes (the\n“Notes Option” and the notes in respect thereof the “DK Option Notes”); and (iii) up to $25.0 million of notes to be issued pursuant to the\nmutual agreement of the Borrower and DK any time after the Funding Date, but before the Convertible Notes Maturity Date (as defined\nbelow), on the same terms and conditions as the Initial Notes (the “Mutual Option Notes” and together with the DK Option Notes, the\n“Additional Notes”). In the event DK does not exercise its option to purchase the DK Option Notes, then the Borrower may issue the DK\nOption Notes to a third-party purchaser pursuant to the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement. Simultaneously with and pursuant to the\nNote Purchase Agreement, the Borrower and each guarantor thereunder also entered into a collateral agreement (the “Collateral\nAgreement”) establishing a first priority lien on substantially all of the assets of Holdings, the Borrower and the guarantors, and entered\ninto a guarantee agreement (the “Guarantee Agreement”) guaranteeing the Convertible Notes. The liens established under the Collateral\nAgreement are pari passu in priority with the liens under the Borrower’s existing senior secured revolving credit facility.\nThe Convertible Notes bear interest at an annual rate of 11.25%, which is payable in kind for the first three years, by adding the amount\nof such accrued interest to the principal amount of the Convertible Notes; provided that, at the Borrower’s election, interest may be paid\nin cash at an annual rate of 9.75%. Beginning on August 7, 2027, the Convertible Notes will bear interest at an annual rate equal to\n9.75% payable in cash. The Convertible Notes will mature on August 7, 2029 (the “Convertible Notes Maturity Date”), unless earlier\nrepurchased, redeemed or converted. The Convertible Notes are guaranteed by Holdings and certain other current and future\nsubsidiaries of the Company, and are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of their respective assets (other than certain\nexcluded assets).\nThe Convertible Notes are convertible, in whole and not in part (subject to certain limitations described below), into shares of the\nCompany’s Class A Common Stock, at the option of DK; provided, however, that in the event that any conversion of the Convertible\nNotes would trigger the Change of Control Rules (as defined in the Convertible Notes), then the Convertible Notes shall be converted in\npart, at the maximum amount permitted without triggering such Change of Control Rules. The initial conversion price of the Convertible\nNotes is $4.16 (the “Conversion Price”), which is subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments.\nFrom and after August 7, 2027, the Borrower may redeem the Convertible Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to\n102% of the aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, from\nand after August 7, 2027, if the closing price per share of the Class A Common Stock exceeds 225% of the Conversion Price for 20 out\nof 30 consecutive trading days, the Borrower may redeem all, but not less than all, of the Convertible Notes at a redemption price equal\nto 100% of the principal amount to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Upon the consummation of a Major Transaction (as\ndefined in the Note Purchase Agreement), the Borrower may also redeem all, but not less than all, of the Convertible Notes then\noutstanding in an amount equal to 130% of the initial principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be redeemed, less all accrued interest\npreviously paid in cash.\nThe Note Purchase Agreement includes customary negative covenants, subject to specified exceptions, including limits on the ability of\nthe Borrower to incur additional debt. The Note Purchase Agreement also includes customary events of default, the occurrence of which\nmay result in the acceleration of the maturity of the Convertible Notes. In addition, the Borrower may not permit (i) the Liquidity (as\ndefined in the Note Purchase Agreement) to be less than $15.0 million as of the last day of any Test Period (as defined in the Note\nPurchase Agreement), commencing with the Test Period ending on September 30, 2024 and (ii) the Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in\nthe Note Purchase Agreement) of the Borrower and its subsidiaries to be less than $15.0 million as of the last day of any Test Period,\ncommencing with the Test Period ending on December 31, 2026.\nThe October 2024 amendment modified the Note Purchase Agreement to conform the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement to the\nCredit Agreement, as amended, to the extent they apply to the Note Purchase Agreement.\nWorkforce Reduction Plans\nReorganization\nOn May 7, 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company (the \"Board\") approved a workforce reduction and reorganization plan (the\n\"Reorganization\"), which is expected to reduce the Company's corporate cost base and better enable it to respond to and navigate\nfurther variability in guest demand. Additionally, the Reorganization was designed to more closely align the Company's\n37\nTable of Contents\nresources with its operations, prioritizing investments in our local operations teams, and further harmonizing the work our local\noperations teams do with the support they receive from our corporate support functions.\nThe Reorganization included the elimination of approximately 800 positions across the Company, in both its local operations teams and\ncentral teams, representing approximately 13% of the workforce, or approximately 6% of our field teams and approximately 40% of our\ncorporate and central operations teams.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred severance and employee benefits costs of approximately\n$5.9 million, which are included in operating costs and expenses in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. The\nReorganization was substantially complete as of September 30, 2024.\n2024 Plan\nOn February 27, 2024, the Board approved a workforce reduction plan (the “2024 Plan”) designed to align the Company’s expected cost\nbase with its 2024 strategic and operating priorities. The 2024 Plan included the elimination of approximately 320 positions across the\nCompany, in both its local operations teams and central teams, representing approximately 5% of the workforce, or approximately 2% of\nthe local operations teams and approximately 6% of the central team.\nIn connection with the 2024 Plan, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred severance and employee\nbenefits costs of approximately $2.0 million and professional service costs of $1.4 million, which are included in operating costs and\nexpenses in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. The 2024 Plan was substantially complete as of September 30, 2024.\n2023 Plan\nIn January 2023, the Company implemented a workforce reduction plan (the \"2023 Plan\") designed to align the Company’s expected\ncost base with its 2023 strategic and operating priorities. The 2023 Plan included the elimination of approximately 1,300 positions across\nthe Company, in both the Company's local operations teams and central teams, representing approximately 17% of the workforce.\nIn connection with the 2023 Plan, the Company incurred severance and employee benefits costs of approximately $5.1 million during the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023, which are included in operating costs and expenses in the condensed consolidated statements\nof operations.\nSeasonality\nOur overall business is seasonal, reflecting typical travel behavior patterns over the course of the calendar year. In addition, each market\nwhere we operate may have its own seasonality, local events, and weather that can increase or decrease demand for our offerings.\nCertain holidays, and the timing of those holidays, can have an impact on our revenue by increasing or decreasing Nights Sold on the\nholiday itself or during the preceding and subsequent weekends. Typically, the first and second quarters of the fiscal year are our\nstrongest booking and cash generating quarters, while our second and third quarters have higher revenue due to increased Nights Sold.\nOur Gross Booking Value (\"GBV\") typically follows the seasonality patterns of Nights Sold. Our operations and support costs also\nincrease in the second and third quarters as we increase our staffing to handle increased activity on our platform and service the homes\nwe manage in those periods. See additional information about GBV and Nights Sold under the \"Key Business Metrics and Non-GAAP\nFinancial Measures\" heading below.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of our revenue for these periods.\nThe period-to-period comparisons of our historical results are not necessarily indicative of our future results.\n38\nTable of Contents\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nRevenue $ 314,048 $ 379,077 772,496 $ 940,510\nOperating costs and expenses:\nCost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation\nand amortization shown separately below(1) 126,415 150,789 351,483 417,046\nOperations and support(1) 54,459 64,998 171,937 187,662\nTechnology and development(1) 9,563 16,026 41,504 45,900\nSales and marketing(1) 39,940 57,658 132,526 171,559\nGeneral and administrative(1) 22,127 19,328 64,649 61,402\nDepreciation 4,992 5,204 12,405 15,597\nAmortization of intangible assets 1,965 15,266 13,063 46,143\nImpairment of long-lived assets — 46,000 84,000 46,000\nImpairment of goodwill — 411,000 — 411,000\nTotal operating costs and expenses 259,461 786,269 871,567 1,402,309\nIncome (loss) from operations 54,587 (407,192) (99,071) (461,799)\nInterest income 1,740 2,349 3,707 6,022\nInterest expense (2,892) (561) (3,845) (1,873)\nOther income, net 4,598 1,823 4,793 5,597\nIncome (loss) before income taxes 58,033 (403,581) (94,416) (452,053)\nIncome tax benefit (expense) 1,226 1,123 (339) 341\nNet income (loss) $ 59,259 $ (402,458) $ (94,755) $ (451,712)\n(1) Includes equity-based compensation expense as follows:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nCost of revenue $ 9 $ 29 $ 38 $ 91\nOperations and support 139 390 346 1,117\nTechnology and development 380 647 1,457 1,550\nSales and marketing 74 460 561 2,004\nGeneral and administrative 1,861 2,448 5,240 7,243\nTotal equity-based compensation expense $ 2,463 $ 3,974 $ 7,642 $ 12,005\n39\nTable of Contents\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenue 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 %\nOperating costs and expenses:\nCost of revenue, exclusive of\ndepreciation and amortization shown\nseparately below 40 % 40 % 45 % 44 %\nOperations and support 17 % 17 % 22 % 20 %\nTechnology and development 3 % 4 % 5 % 5 %\nSales and marketing 13 % 15 % 17 % 18 %\nGeneral and administrative 7 % 5 % 8 % 7 %\nDepreciation 2 % 1 % 2 % 2 %\nAmortization of intangible assets 1 % 4 % 2 % 5 %\nImpairment of long-lived assets — % 12 % 11 % 5 %\nTotal operating costs and expenses 83 % 207 % 113 % 149 %\nIncome (loss) from operations 17 % (107)% (13)% (49)%\nInterest income 1 % 1 % — % 1 %\nInterest expense (1)% — % — % — %\nOther income, net 1 % — % 1 % 1 %\nIncome (loss) before income taxes 18 % (106)% (12)% (48)%\nIncome tax benefit (expense) — % — % — % — %\nNet income (loss) 19 % (106)% (12)% (48)%\nComparison of the Three Months and Nine Months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nRevenue\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change 2024 2023 $ Change % Change\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nRevenue $ 314,048 $ 379,077 $ (65,029) (17)% $ 772,496 $ 940,510 $ (168,014) (18)%\nOur revenue is primarily generated from our vacation rental platform and through our channel distribution partners, where we generally\nact as the exclusive agent on the homeowners’ behalf to facilitate the reservation transactions between guests and homeowners. We\nand our channel distribution partners collect nightly rent from guests on behalf of homeowners, and we earn the majority of our revenue\nfrom commissions on rent and from additional reservation-related fees paid by guests when a vacation rental is booked directly through\nour website, app, or through our distribution partners. We also earn revenue from home care solutions provided directly to our\nhomeowners, such as home maintenance and improvement services, linen and towel supply programs, supplemental housekeeping\nservices, and other related services, for a separately agreed-upon fee.\nIn the event a booked reservation is cancelled, we may offer a refund or a future stay credit up to the value of the booked reservation. In\ncertain instances, we may also offer a refund related to a completed stay. We account for refunds as a reduction of revenue. Future stay\ncredits are recognized as a liability on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Revenue from future stay credits is recognized when\nredeemed by guests, net of the portion of the booking attributable to funds payable to owners and hospitality and sales taxes payable.\nWe estimate the portion of future stay credits that will not be redeemed by guests and recognize these amounts as breakage revenue in\nproportion to the expected pattern of redemption or upon expiration.\nIn addition to our vacation rental platform, we provide other offerings such as residential management services to community and\nhomeowner associations. The purpose of these services is to attract and retain homeowners in those associations as customers of our\nvacation rental platform.\n40\nTable of Contents\nWe previously also operated separate real estate buy/sell brokerage services, which we wound down during 2023. We continue to retain\nreal estate brokerage licenses, where required, in order to facilitate our vacation rental management services.\nBooking Patterns\nWe continue to experience evolving and variable guest booking and travel demand patterns. This increases the difficulty of accurately\nforecasting bookings for our owners and, therefore, our results of operations. We have also seen, and continue to see, increased\nhomeowner concerns around their levels of rental income, relative to prior years. We believe these factors are continuing to have a\nnegative effect on homeowner retention, relative to our historical experience. The first quarter and part of the second quarter of the year\nis typically our highest reservation building period in the year and is therefore, one of our highest cash generating periods in the year. We\nexperienced significantly weaker demand than is typical in the first two quarters of 2024, and that pattern continued in the three months\nended September 30, 2024. Fewer guest bookings in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulted in our revenue and\nour cash position not building as expected, relative to the comparative periods in the prior year.\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared with the Same Period in 2023\nRevenue decreased by $65.0 million, or 17%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, driven by a $64.7 million decrease in revenue from our vacation rental platform. The decrease in vacation rental\nplatform revenue was primarily driven by a 21% decrease in Nights Sold (as defined below in Key Business Metrics), primarily due to\nlower guest demand, a decrease in the number of homes available on our platform in the period, and, we believe, increased supply in\nthe market.\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared with the Same Period in 2023\nRevenue decreased by $168.0 million, or 18%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, driven by a $162.9 million decrease in revenue from our vacation rental platform and a $4.5 million decrease in\nrevenue from our real estate buy/sell brokerage services, as a result of our wind down of these services. The decrease in vacation rental\nplatform revenue was mostly driven by a 17% decrease in Nights Sold (as defined below in Key Business Metrics), primarily due to lower\nguest demand, a decrease in the number of homes available on our platform in the period, and, we believe, increased supply in the\nmarket.\nCost of revenue\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change 2024 2023 $ Change % Change\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nCost of revenue $ 126,415 $ 150,789 $ (24,374) (16)% $ 351,483 $ 417,046 $ (65,563) (16)%\nPercentage of revenue 40 % 40 % 45 % 44 %\nCost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, consists primarily of employee compensation costs, which include wages,\nbenefits, and payroll taxes and outside service costs for housekeeping, home maintenance, payment processing fees for merchant fees\nand chargebacks, laundry expenses, and housekeeping supplies, as well as fixed rent payments on certain owner contracts.

We also experienced a $4.0 million decrease in costs related\nto real estate buy/sell brokerage services for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding prior year\nperiod, as a result of the wind down of these services.\nWe expect that cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue may fluctuate from period to period, depending on the number of Nights\nSold, Gross Booking Value per Night Sold, and our ability to realize operational efficiencies.\nOperations and support\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change 2024 2023 $ Change % Change\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nOperations and support $ 54,459 $ 64,998 $ (10,539) (16)% $ 171,937 $ 187,662 $ (15,725) (8)%\nPercentage of revenue 17 % 17 % 22 % 20 %\nOperations and support costs consist primarily of compensation costs, which include wages, benefits, payroll taxes, and equity-based\ncompensation for employees that support our local operations.

These Non-GAAP Financial Measures allow for more meaningful comparisons of our performance\nby excluding items that are non-cash in nature or when the amount and timing of these items is unpredictable or one-time in nature, not\ndriven by the performance of our core business operations or renders comparisons with prior periods less meaningful.\nThe key business metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures have significant limitations as analytical tools, should be considered as\nsupplemental in nature, and are not meant as a substitute for any financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. We believe\nthe Non-GAAP Financial Measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of\noperations, are frequently used by these parties in evaluating companies in our industry, and provide useful measures for period-to-\nperiod comparisons of our business performance. Moreover, we present the key business metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nbecause they are key measurements used by our management internally to make operating decisions, including those related to\nanalyzing operating expenses, evaluating performance, and strategic planning and annual budgeting.\nThe Non-GAAP Financial Measures have significant limitations as analytical tools, including that:\n• these measures do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual\ncommitments;\n• these measures do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\n• Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense, or the cash required to service interest or principal payments, on our\ndebt;\n• these measures exclude equity-based compensation expense, which has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable\nfuture, a significant recurring expense in our business and an important part of our compensation strategy;\n• Adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP general and administrative expense do not include non-recurring costs related to strategic\nbusiness combinations;\n• Adjusted EBITDA does not include non-recurring impairment charges related to the Company's goodwill and intangible assets;\n• these measures do not reflect restructuring costs, including certain right-of-use asset impairment costs;\n• these measures do not reflect our tax expense or the cash required to pay our taxes; and\n• with respect to Adjusted EBITDA, although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated\nand amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and such measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such\nreplacements.\nIn the future, we may incur expenses or charges such as those being adjusted in the calculation of these Non-GAAP Financial\nMeasures. Our presentation of these Non-GAAP Financial Measures should not be construed as an inference that future results will be\nunaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items, and our Non-GAAP Financial Measures may be calculated differently from similarly titled\nmetrics or measures presented by other companies.\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands, except GBV per Night Sold)\nGross Booking Value (\"GBV\") $ 670,135 $ 830,094 $ 1,602,206 $ 1,973,749\nNights Sold 1,624 2,047 4,282 5,168\nGBV per Night Sold $ 413 $ 406 $ 374 $ 382\nGross Booking Value\nGBV represents the dollar value of bookings from our distribution partners as well as those booked directly on our platform related to\nNights Sold during the period and cancellation fees for bookings cancelled during the period (which may relate to bookings made during\nprior periods). GBV is inclusive of amounts charged to guests for rent, fees, and the estimated taxes paid by guests when we are\nresponsible for collecting tax.\n47\nTable of Contents\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, GBV decreased by 19%, to $670.1 million, compared to the same period in 2023. The\ndecrease was primarily driven by a decrease in the number of homes on our platform, lower guest demand, and, we believe, increased\nsupply in the market.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, GBV decreased by 19%, to $1,602.2 million, compared to the same period in 2023.\nThe decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in the number of homes on our platform, lower guest demand, and, we believe,\nincreased supply in the market.\nChanges in GBV reflect our ability to add homes by attracting homeowners, retain homeowners and guests, and optimize the availability\nand utilization of the homes on our platform. Changes in GBV also reflect changes in the pricing of rents, fees, and estimated taxes paid\nby guests. Changes in utilization of the homes on our platform and pricing of those homes are generally reflective of changes in guest\ndemand.\nNights Sold\nWe define Nights Sold as the total number of nights stayed by guests in homes hosted on our platform in a given period. Nights Sold is a\nkey measure of the scale and quality of homes on our platform and our ability to generate demand and manage yield on behalf of our\nhomeowners. We experience seasonality in the number of Nights Sold. Typically, the second and third quarters of the year each have\nhigher Nights Sold than the first and fourth quarters, as guests tend to travel more during the peak summer travel season.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, Nights Sold decreased by 21%, to 1.6 million, compared to the same period in 2023.\nThe decrease in Nights Sold was primarily due to a decrease in the number of homes on our platform, lower guest demand, and, we\nbelieve, increased supply in the market, in combination with the impact of our pricing decisions.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Nights Sold decreased by 17%, to 4.3 million, compared to the same period in 2023.\nThe decrease in Nights Sold was primarily due to a decrease in the number of homes on our platform, lower guest demand, and, we\nbelieve, increased supply in the market.\nNights Sold in any period will be affected by changes to the number of homes on our platform, guest demand, supply in the market, and\nhow we optimize the combination of pricing and utilization of the homes on our platform.\nGross Booking Value per Night Sold\nGBV per Night Sold represents the dollar value of each night stayed by guests on our platform in a given period. GBV per Night Sold\nreflects the pricing of rents, fees, and estimated taxes paid by guests.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, GBV per Night Sold increased slightly by 2%, to $413, compared to the same period in\n2023. The increase in GBV per Night Sold was due primarily to the impact of our pricing decisions, partially offset by fewer Nights Sold.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, GBV per Night Sold decreased slightly by 2%, to $374, compared to the same period in\n2023. The decrease in GBV per Night Sold was primarily a result of lower GBV and fewer Nights Sold.\nThere is a strong correlation between GBV and Nights Sold, and these two variables are managed in concert with one another. Our\npricing algorithms and methodologies are continually evaluating the trade-offs between price and utilization to seek to optimize the mix of\nNights Sold and GBV per Night Sold. Future changes in GBV per Night Sold will be determined by how we optimize the combination of\npricing and utilization of the homes on our platform.\nAdjusted EBITDA\n48\nTable of Contents\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) excluding: (1) depreciation and acquisition-related items consisting of amortization of\nintangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets, if applicable; (2) interest income and expense; (3) any other income\nor expense not earned or incurred during our normal course of business; (4) any income tax benefit or expense; (5) equity-based\ncompensation costs; (6) one-time costs related to strategic business combinations; and (7) restructuring costs, including workforce\nreduction costs and certain right-of-use asset impairment costs. We believe this measure is useful for analysts and investors as this\nmeasure allows for a more meaningful period-to-period comparison of our business performance. The above items are excluded from\nour Adjusted EBITDA measure because these items are non-cash in nature or the amount and timing of these items is unpredictable or\nnon-recurring in nature, not driven by the performance of our core business operations and renders comparisons with prior periods less\nmeaningful. Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Revenue is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA for a period by Revenue for the\nsame period.\nSeasonal trends in our Nights Sold impact Adjusted EBITDA for any given quarter. Typically, the second and third quarters of the year\nhave higher Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue, as fixed costs are allocated across a larger number of\nguest reservations. We expect Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue to fluctuate in the near term due to\nthis seasonality and improve over the medium to long term as we achieve greater operating leverage from scale.\nIn the three months ended September 30, 2024, Adjusted EBITDA was $69.1 million, compared to $74.3 million in the same period in\n2023. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA is a reflection of the changes in our revenue and operating costs and expenses, as discussed\nabove. Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Revenue was 22% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 20% for\nthe three months ended September 30, 2023.\nIn the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Adjusted EBITDA was $35.0 million, compared to $78.5 million in the same period in\n2023. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA is a reflection of the changes in our revenue and operating costs and expenses, as discussed\nabove. Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Revenue was 5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 8% for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe following table reconciles net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nNet Income (loss) $ 59,259 $ (402,458) $ (94,755) $ (451,712)\nAdd back:\nDepreciation and amortization of\nintangible assets 6,957 20,470 25,468 61,740\nImpairment of long-lived assets — 46,000 84,000 46,000\nImpairment of goodwill — 411,000 — 411,000\nInterest income (1,740) (2,349) (3,707) (6,022)\nInterest expense 2,892 561 3,845 1,873\nOther income, net (4,598) (1,823) (4,793) (5,597)\nIncome tax (benefit) expense (1,226) (1,123) 339 (341)\nEquity-based compensation 2,463 3,974 7,642 12,005\nBusiness combination costs(1) 61 60 180 179\nRestructuring(2) 5,023 3 16,737 9,326\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 69,091 $ 74,315 $ 34,956 $ 78,451\nAdjusted EBITDA as a percentage of\nRevenue 22 % 20 % 5 % 8 %\n(1) Represents certain insurance costs from the strategic acquisition of TurnKey that are expected to be amortized through the first quarter of 2027.\n(2) Represents costs associated with workforce reductions, consulting costs associated with our restructuring efforts, and certain right-of-use asset\nimpairment costs related to the Company's leased corporate office space in Portland, Oregon and Boise, Idaho.\n49\nTable of Contents\nNon-GAAP Operating Expenses\nWe calculate Non-GAAP cost of revenue, Non-GAAP operations and support expense, Non-GAAP technology and development\nexpense, and Non-GAAP sales and marketing expense by excluding the non-cash expenses arising from the grant of equity-based\nawards and restructuring costs.

We have incurred significant operating losses and generated negative cash flows from operations as we have invested to\nsupport the growth of our business. To execute on our strategic initiatives and our Reorganization, on an annual basis, we have incurred\nand will continue to incur operating losses and generate negative cash flows from operations now and in the future, and as a result, we\nrequire and will continue to need additional capital resources. These capital resources\n50\nTable of Contents\nmay be obtained through drawing on our existing Revolving Credit Facility, which is discussed in more detail below, additional equity\nofferings, which would dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders, or additional debt financings, which may contain covenants that\nrestrict the operations of our business. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to\nraise the financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $124.4 million. We experienced more variable and generally weaker\ndemand in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As a result, our cash position did not build as expected in the period. Our\nprimary requirements for liquidity and capital are to finance working capital requirements, capital expenditures and other general\ncorporate purposes. On May 8, 2024, we drew $81.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below), and on August 7,\n2024, a subsidiary of the Company issued $30.0 million of Convertible Notes (as defined below) to supplement our cash position. Refer\nto Note 8, Debt, for further details. Significant fluctuations in our cash position, continued decreases in the number of homes on our\nplatform, lower guest demand and variable booking patterns, the impact of the Reorganization on our business and other adverse\nchanges impacting the Company may result in us seeking additional financing opportunities as the Company continues to evaluate its\nliquidity needs. In the future, we expect to need cash to make payments under our tax receivable agreement with the holders of Vacasa\nHoldings' equity prior to the business combination (the \"Tax Receivable Agreement\"). However, until the Company achieves profitability,\nsignificant amounts are unlikely to become payable under the Tax Receivable Agreement. For more details regarding the Tax Receivable\nAgreement, see our 2023 Annual Report. We expect our operations will continue to be financed primarily by equity offerings, debt\nfinancing, and cash and cash equivalents. We believe our existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund operations, working capital\nrequirements, capital expenditures, and debt service obligations for at least the next 12 months.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, our growth, our ability to attract and retain new\nhomeowners and guests that utilize our services, guest demand and booking patterns, booking channel mix, the impact of the\nReorganization on our business, the continuing market acceptance of our offerings, the timing and extent of spending to enhance our\ntechnology, and the expansion of sales and marketing activities. Further, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in\nbusinesses, products, services, and technologies in the future.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nIn October 2021, we entered into a credit agreement, which, as subsequently amended in December 2021 and June 2023 (as amended,\nthe \"Credit Agreement\"), provides for a senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $105.0 million\n(\"Revolving Credit Facility\"). The Revolving Credit Facility includes a sub-facility for letters of credit in an aggregate face amount of $40.0\nmillion, which reduces borrowing availability under the Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, there were $81.0 million in\nborrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, $23.4 million of letters of credit were issued under\nthe Revolving Credit Facility, and $0.6 million was available for borrowings.\nBorrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are subject to interest, determined as follows:\n• Alternate Base Rate (\"ABR\") borrowings accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to the ABR plus a margin of 1.50%. The ABR\nis equal to the greatest of (i) the Prime Rate, (ii) the New York Federal Reserve Bank Rate plus 0.50%, and (iii) the Adjusted\nTerm SOFR for a one-month interest period plus 1.00%.\n• Term SOFR borrowings accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted Term SOFR plus a margin of 2.50%. Adjusted\nTerm SOFR means, for any Interest Period, an interest rate per annum equal to the Term SOFR for such Interest Period.\nIn addition to paying interest on the principal amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, we are required to pay a\ncommitment fee on unused amounts at a rate of 0.25% per annum. We are also required to pay customary letter of credit and agency\nfees.\nThe Credit Agreement contains customary covenants. In addition, we are required to maintain a minimum amount of consolidated\nrevenue, measured on a trailing four-quarter basis, as of the last date of each fiscal quarter, provided that such covenant will only apply\nif, on such date, the aggregate principal amount of outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and letters of credit\n(excluding undrawn amounts under any letters of credit in an aggregate face amount of up to $20.0 million and letters of credit that have\nbeen cash collateralized) exceeds 35% of the then-outstanding revolving commitments. We are also required to maintain liquidity of at\nleast $15.0 million as of the last date of each fiscal quarter.\nSee Note 8, Debt to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nAmendment to Revolving Credit Facility\n51\nTable of Contents\nSubsequent to quarter end, on October 25, 2024, Vacasa Holdings, the Company, certain of its subsidiaries, each lender party thereto\nfrom time to time and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, collateral agent and issuing bank, entered into Amendment\nNo. 3 (the “Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement.\nThe Amendment, among other things, amended the minimum amount of consolidated revenue and the compliance thresholds that are\nmeasured on a trailing four-quarter basis, as of the last date of each fiscal quarter, that the borrower and its restricted subsidiaries are\nrequired to achieve if the aggregate principal amount of outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and letters of credit\n(excluding undrawn amounts under any letters of credit in an aggregate face amount of up to $20.0 million and letters of credit that have\nbeen cash collateralized) exceeds 35% of the then-outstanding revolving commitments. Subsequent to the Amendment, any borrowings\nunder the Revolving Credit Facility are subject to amended interest rate, determined as follows:\n• Alternate Base Rate (\"ABR\") borrowings accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to the ABR plus a margin of 2.50%. The ABR\nis equal to the greatest of (i) the Prime Rate, (ii) the New York Federal Reserve Bank Rate plus 0.50%, and (iii) the Adjusted\nTerm Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) for a one month interest period plus 1.00%.\n• Term SOFR borrowings accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted Term SOFR plus a margin of 3.50%. Adjusted\nTerm SOFR means, for any interest period, an interest rate per annum equal to (a) the Term SOFR for such interest period.\nThe Amendment also amended certain other provisions of the Credit Agreement as more fully set forth therein.\nThe foregoing descriptions of the Credit Agreement and the Amendment do not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by\nreference to the Amendment, a copy of which is incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report.\nConvertible Notes and Notes Option Liability\nNote Purchase Agreement, Convertible Notes\nFor a discussion of the key economic terms of the Convertible Notes see Recent Developments - Note Purchase Agreement, Convertible\nNotes. DK will have certain preemptive rights with respect to certain issuances of shares of Class A Common Stock and certain rights of\nfirst offer with respect to certain debt issuances by the Company, Borrower or any of their direct or indirect subsidiaries.\nPursuant to the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement, Vacasa, Inc. intends to seek to obtain stockholder approval under Nasdaq rules\nwith respect to the issuance of Conversion Shares (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) in excess of the limitations imposed by\nsuch rules at the Company’s next annual meeting of stockholders following the Funding Date.\nIn addition, the Company granted certain rights to DK to designate certain individuals (each such individual, a “Nominee”) to the\nCompany’s Board and the committees thereof. Pursuant to the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement, following the Funding Date, (A)\nfor so long as DK continues to beneficially own at least 50% of the number of shares of Class A Common Stock (on an as-converted\nbasis) that it held on the Funding Date, then DK will have the right to designate two Nominees, and (B) for so long as DK continues to\nbeneficially own less than 50% but at least 25% of the number of shares of Class A Common Stock (on an as-converted basis) that it\nheld on the Funding Date, then DK will have the right to designate one Nominee to the Board. In the event the full $45.0 million\naggregate principal amount of Additional Notes is issued to DK, then upon the purchase by DK of such Additional Notes, for so long as\nDK continues to beneficially own at least 67% of the number of Conversion Shares underlying the Convertible Notes on an as-converted\nbasis as of the Funding Date (including the purchase of such Additional Notes as if it occurred on the Funding Date), then DK will have\nthe right to designate three Nominees. If, following the issuance of such Additional Notes, DK at any time owns less than 67% of the\nnumber of Conversion Shares underlying the Convertible Notes on such as-converted basis, then DK will have the right to designate the\napplicable number of Nominees as described in the second sentence of this paragraph. In addition, in the event the Borrower and its\nsubsidiaries fail to comply with the requirements of the Home Churn Covenant (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) as of the\nlast day of any applicable Test Period of the Borrower, commencing with the Test Period ending on December 31, 2025, DK will have the\nright to designate up to two additional Nominees (provided that in no event will DK have the right to designate more than four Nominees\nat any given time). As of the Funding Date, DK has designated, and Vacasa, Inc. has appointed, two Nominees to its Board. At the\nFunding Date, DK has the right to designate, and has designated, one Nominee to be appointed to the Compensation Committee of the\nBoard, one Nominee to be appointed to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board, and two Nominees to be\nappointed to the Strategy and Finance Committee of the Board, and the Board has appointed such Nominees to such committees. DK\nalso has the right to designate one Nominee to be appointed to\n52\nTable of Contents\nany committee of the Board formed after the Funding Date. The rights described in this paragraph are subject to certain exceptions and\nlimitations set forth in the Note Purchase Agreement.\nOn the Funding Date, the Company also issued to DK an aggregate of 174,825 shares of Class A Common Stock (the “Fee Shares”),\nrepresenting payment in full of certain amounts payable to DK in respect of the Initial Notes pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement.\nIn addition, on October 25, 2024, Vacasa Holdings, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into Amendment No. 1 (the “NPA\nAmendment”) to the note purchase agreement, dated as of August 7, 2024. The amendments made under the NPA Amendment were\nmade to conform the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement to the Credit Agreement, as amended, to the extent they apply to the Note\nPurchase Agreement.\nThe foregoing descriptions of the Note Purchase Agreement (as amended by the NPA Amendment), Convertible Notes, the Collateral\nAgreement and the Guarantee Agreement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Note\nPurchase Agreement (as amended), the Form of Note, the Collateral Agreement, the Guarantee Agreement and the NPA Amendment,\ncopies of which are incorporated by reference into the Quarterly Report.\nVoting Agreement\nOn August 7, 2024, Vacasa, Inc. entered into a Voting Agreement (the “Voting Agreement”) with certain existing investors of the\nCompany affiliated with Silver Lake, Riverwood Capital and Level Equity Management (collectively, the “Stockholders”). Pursuant to the\nVoting Agreement, each Stockholder agreed with the Company to vote all shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock and Class B\nCommon Stock, par value $0.00001 per share, owned or held of record by such Stockholder at each annual or special meeting of the\nCompany’s stockholders (and at every adjournment or postponement thereof) at which Stockholder Approval (as defined below) is\nsought, in favor of such Stockholder Approval, until such time as such Stockholder Approval has been obtained. “Stockholder Approval”\nis defined in the Voting Agreement as such approval as may be required by the Nasdaq Global Market (or, if applicable, any such other\ntrading market on which the Class A Common Stock may subsequently be primarily listed and quoted for trading) from the stockholders\nof the Company under Rule 5635(b) and Rule 5635(d) of the listing rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC with respect to the issuance\nof the shares of Class A Common Stock underlying the Convertible Notes.\nThe foregoing description of the Voting Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the\nVoting Agreement, a copy of which is incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report.\nAmended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement\nOn August 7, 2024, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement (the “A&R Registration Rights\nAgreement”) with DK, certain related parties of DK (together with DK, the “DK Holders”), and certain existing investors of the Company\n(the “Existing Investors”). The A&R Registration Rights Agreement amends and restates the Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of\nDecember 6, 2021 (the “Original Registration Rights Agreement”), by and among the Company and the Existing Investors. The material\nterms of the A&R Registration Rights Agreement are substantially the same as those of the Original Registration Rights Agreement,\nwhich are described in the Company’s Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A, filed by the Company with the Securities and\nExchange Commission (“SEC”) on April 8, 2024 (the “Proxy Statement”), under the heading “Certain Relationships and Related Person\nTransactions—Registration Rights Agreement.”\nIn addition, pursuant to the A&R Registration Rights Agreement, the Company granted the DK Holders registration rights consistent with\nthose of the other Major Investors (as defined therein). The Company also agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to file, within\n30 days after the Funding Date or the date of any issuance of Additional Notes, a registration statement on Form S-3 (or such other form\nof registration statement as is then available to effect a registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”)),\npermitting the offer and resale from time to time with respect to all of the registrable securities then held by the DK Holders, including all\nshares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Convertible Notes then held by the DK Holders.\nThe foregoing description of the A&R Registration Rights Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by\nreference to the A&R Registration Rights Agreement, a copy of which is incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report.\nCash Flows\n53\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nNet cash (used in) provided by operating activities $ (60,596) $ 28,435\nNet cash used in investing activities (6,210) (10,349)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities 98,176 (23,366)\nEffect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash (266) (762)\nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ 31,104 $ (6,042)\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $60.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to a net loss of\n$94.8 million, partially offset by $124.2 million of non-cash items, including depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, impairment of\nlong-lived assets, reduction in the carrying amount of operating lease right-of-use assets, and equity-based compensation expense.\nAdditional sources of cash flows resulted from changes in working capital, including a $59.6 million decrease in funds payable to owners,\na $31.9 million decrease in deferred revenue and future stay credits, a $7.5 million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities,\nand a $9.0 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $28.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily attributable to a net\nloss of $451.7 million, offset by $539.1 million of non-cash items,including depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, impairment of\ngoodwill, impairment of long-lived assets, impairment of right-of-use assets, reduction in the carrying amount of operating lease right-of-\nuse assets, fair value adjustment on derivative liabilities, and equity-based compensation expense. Additional sources of cash flows\nresulted from changes in working capital, including a $50.2 million decrease in funds payable to owners and an $22.7 million decrease in\ndeferred revenue and future stay credits, partially offset by a $10.4 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $6.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to $4.7 million of\ncash paid for capitalized internally developed software costs and $1.5 million of cash paid for purchases of property and equipment.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $10.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to $5.7 million of\ncash paid for capitalized internally developed software costs and $4.0 million of cash paid for purchases of property and equipment.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $98.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to an $81.0\nmillion draw under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Convertible Notes issuance of $30.0 million, partially offset by $8.1 million of\ncash payments for business combinations and $4.0 million of repayment of financed insurance premiums.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $23.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily attributable to $19.5\nmillion of cash payments for business combinations and $4.4 million of repayment of financed insurance premiums.\nMaterial Cash Requirements from Contractual and Other Obligations\nAs of September 30, 2024, there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business to the contractual obligations from\nthe information disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report, except as disclosed below.\nRevolving Credit Facility\n54\nTable of Contents\nIn October 2021, we entered into the credit agreement, which, as subsequently amended in December 2021, June 2023, and October\n2024 (as amended, the \"Credit Agreement\"), provides for borrowings in an aggregate principal amount of up to $105.0 million, which\namount may be borrowed and repaid from time to time. As of September 30, 2024, there were $81.0 million in borrowings outstanding\nunder the Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, there were $23.4 million of letters of credit issued under the Revolving\nCredit Facility, and $0.6 million was available for borrowings. See Liquidity and Capital Resources — Revolving Credit Facility and\nAmendment to Revolving Credit Facility for additional information.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs, and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we\nevaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nThere have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from those disclosed in our 2023 Annual\nReport, except as disclosed below. For a description of our critical accounting policies, see Item 7. \"Management's Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" in our 2023 Annual Report.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nDescription\nAs discussed in Note 6, Intangible Assets, Net and Goodwill to our condensed consolidated financial statements, we performed a long-\nlived impairment assessment as of March 31, 2024, which resulted in homeowner contract asset impairment charges of $84.0 million.\nThe fair value estimate of our homeowner contracts was based on the income approach calculated using the present value of estimated\nfuture cash flows. We prepared cash flow projections based on management's estimates of future revenue and operating margins, taking\ninto consideration the historical performance and the current macroeconomic, industry, and market conditions. We based the discount\nrate on the weighted-average cost of capital considering company-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting\nunit's ability to execute on the projected cash flows.\nJudgments and Uncertainties\nFuture revenue, homeowner retention, and the discount rate applied were the significant assumptions used in the income approach used\nto determine the fair value of our homeowner contract assets. The fair value calculation is highly sensitive to changes in these\nassumptions.\nEffect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions\nIf the actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and judgments we have made in determining the fair value of the Company's\nlong-lived assets, our actual impairment losses could vary from our estimated impairment losses. In the event that our estimates vary\nfrom actual results, we may record additional impairment losses, which could be material to our results of operations.\nImpairment of Goodwill\nDescription\nAs discussed in Note 6, Intangible Assets, Net and Goodwill to our condensed consolidated financial statements, we performed a\nquantitative goodwill impairment assessment as of March 31, 2024. The goodwill impairment assessment did not result in goodwill\nimpairment charges as of March 31, 2024 as the fair value estimate of the Company's single reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount.\nThe fair value estimate of our single reporting unit was derived from a combination of an income approach and a market approach.\nUnder the income approach, we estimated the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows.\nWe prepared cash flow projections based on management's estimates of future revenue and operating margins, taking into consideration\nthe historical performance and the current macroeconomic, industry, and market conditions. We based the discount rate on the\nweighted-average cost of capital considering Company-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting unit's ability to\nexecute on the projected cash flows. Under the market approach, we estimated the fair value of the reporting unit based on revenue\nmarket multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar characteristics as the reporting unit, as well as an\nestimated control premium.\nJudgments and Uncertainties\n55\nTable of Contents\nFuture revenue, operating profit margins, and the discount rate applied were the significant assumptions used in the income approach\nused to determine the fair value of our single reporting unit. The forecasted revenue, comparable publicly traded companies selected,\nand estimated control premium were the significant assumptions used in the market approach. The concluded fair value of our single\nreporting unit, based on a combination of the income and market approach, was reconciled to our market capitalization. The excess of\nthe concluded fair value over our market capitalization represents an implied control premium, which we reviewed for reasonableness by\ncomparison to observed transaction premiums, premium studies, and consideration of specific attributes of the Company. The fair value\nconclusion is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. Changes in the significant assumptions used to determine the fair value\nof our homeowner contracts assets would also impact the carrying value of our single reporting unit and the resulting goodwill\nimpairment charge.\nEffect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions\nIf the actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and judgments we have made in determining the fair value of our single\nreporting unit, an impairment loss may result. In the event that our estimates vary from actual results, we may record impairment losses,\nwhich could be material to our results of operations.\nConvertible Notes\nWe have elected the fair value option to account for the Convertible Notes that were issued on August 7, 2024, and amended in October\n2024, and recorded them at fair value with changes in fair value recorded within other income, net on the condensed consolidated\nstatements of operations. This election was made because of operational efficiencies in valuing and reporting for these debt instruments\nin their entirety at each reporting date.\nAs a result of applying the fair value option, direct costs and fees related to the Convertible Notes are expensed as incurred and not\ndeferred. Values are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall\nfair value measurement, including a risk-adjusted discount rate and equity volatility. Our assessment of the significance of a particular\ninput to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires management to make judgments and consider factors specific to the\nConvertible Notes. Considerable judgment is necessary to interpret market data and determine an estimated fair value. The use of\ndifferent market assumptions or valuation methods may have a material effect on the estimated fair values. The valuation of such\ninstruments is subject to change, predominantly driven by changes in the market\nprice of a share of our Class A Common Stock.\nAs of August 7, 2024 and September 30, 2024, we have used a binomial lattice model that factors in potential outcomes being\nconsummated. All of these scenarios take into consideration the terms and conditions of the underlying Convertible Notes plus potential\nchanges in the underlying value of our Class A Common Stock. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we\nrecognized an unrealized loss of $3.1 million for the change in fair value of the Convertible Notes.\nJOBS Act Accounting Election\nWe meet the definition of an emerging growth company under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (\"JOBS Act\"), which\npermits the Company to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable\nto public companies. As of January 1, 2022, we elected to irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report for a\ndescription of recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted.\n56\nTable of Contents\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks\nWe are exposed to market risks in connection with our business, which primarily relate to inflation and fluctuations in interest rates.\nInflation Risk\nIn recent periods, inflation has increased in the United States and other markets in which we operate. To date, we do not believe these\nincreases have had a material impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition. The prospective impact of\ninflation on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition is uncertain and will depend on future developments\nthat we may not be able to accurately predict.\nInterest Rate Fluctuation Risk\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk on our investment portfolio. Changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on our total cash,\ncash equivalents, and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities.\nOn May 8, 2024, we drew $81.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility, which is susceptible to interest rate risk, with interest\nexpense increasing or decreasing as the applicable rate of interest on outstanding borrowings increases or decreases. A hypothetical\n100 basis point increase in interest rates on our indebtedness outstanding during the three months ended September 30, 2024 would not\nhave had a material impact on our interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024. On August 7, 2024, our subsidiary\nissued $30.0 million of Convertible Notes, which bear interest at a fixed rate of interest. If we engage in additional financing\nopportunities, such financing may also expose the Company to interest rate risk.\nOur cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of cash deposits and marketable securities. We do not enter into investments for trading\nor speculative purposes. Because our cash equivalents generally have short maturities, the fair value of our portfolio is relatively\ninsensitive to interest rate fluctuations. Due to the short-term nature of our investments, we have not been exposed to, nor do we\nanticipate being exposed to, material risks to our short-term investments due to changes in interest rates.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\nIn designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no\nmatter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition,\nthe design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is\nrequired to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated, as of the end of the\nperiod covered by this Quarterly Report, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and\n15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded\nthat, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange\nAct, during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting.\n57\nTable of Contents\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nThe information set forth under Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies to our condensed consolidated financial statements included\nin Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report, is incorporated herein by reference.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business, operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could\nmaterially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and the trading price of our Class A Common Stock.\nThe following material factors, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical results and those\nexpressed in forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf in filings with the SEC, press releases, communications with\ninvestors, and oral statements. If any of the following risks, or others not specified below, materialize, our business, financial condition\nand results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our Class A Common Stock could\ndecline, and you could lose all or part of your investment in our Class A Common Stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe may not successfully execute or achieve the expected benefits of the Reorganization and other cost-saving measures we\nmay take in the future, and our efforts may result in further actions and/or negatively impact our cash flows and profitability\nand adversely affect our business.\nIn May 2024, we announced the Reorganization, which was intended to, among other things, reduce certain fixed costs in our business,\naccelerate the transformation of our business to a model focused more on local market accountability and execution, and promote\ngreater efficiency and realign our business and strategic priorities. The Reorganization has resulted in significant structural changes to\nthe way we run our business, including a significant reduction in our corporate and central operations personnel and functions. The\nReorganization has resulted in our local operations teams assuming more of the management and business responsibilities of their\nmarkets, including marketing and unit acquisition, which are new or more significant responsibilities for these teams. Our local operations\nteams may not be successful in managing and growing their markets or in retaining homeowners and attracting guests to the platform.\nAdditionally, our local operations teams may have difficulty attracting and retaining the personnel needed to run the necessary\noperations. Such implementation risks could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. As a\nresult of the Reorganization, we have significantly reduced the size of our central sales team, and reorganized the sales force to more\nclosely align with individual markets. Similarly, we have reduced and realigned other central office support teams, including product and\ntechnology, finance and accounting, legal, human resources and marketing. The Reorganization has also resulted in more targeted sales\nand marketing efforts and a shift in technology strategy from only proprietary in-house development to consideration of third-party off-the-\nshelf solutions along with targeted proprietary development of differentiating technology. The implementation and execution of the\nReorganization measures are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including whether we have targeted the appropriate areas for\nour cost-saving efforts and at the appropriate scale. As such, the Reorganization may not be successful in yielding our intended results\nand may not appropriately address either or both of the short-term and long-term strategy for our business. Implementation of the\nReorganization may be costly and disruptive to our business; we may not realize the expected benefits from our change in technology\nstrategy; the expected costs and charges may be greater than we have forecasted; and the estimated cost savings may be lower than\nwe have forecasted. If we are unable to successfully implement our Reorganization, we may not realize all or any of the anticipated\nbenefits thereof, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, including our profitability, cash\nflow and liquidity needs and availability.\nAdditionally, certain aspects of the Reorganization, such as severance costs associated with reducing our headcount, have negatively\nimpacted our cash flows and may continue to do so in the future. Our initiatives have resulted, and could in the future result in, personnel\nattrition beyond our planned reduction in headcount or reduced employee morale, which could in turn adversely impact productivity,\nincluding through a loss of continuity, loss of accumulated knowledge and/or inefficiency during transitional periods, or our ability to\nattract highly skilled employees, any of which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, disclosure controls and\nprocedures and financial condition. Unfavorable publicity or negative perceptions about us or any of our strategic initiatives, including the\nReorganization, could result in reputational harm and could diminish confidence in, and the use of, our products and services, which\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, the Reorganization may result in negative\nperceptions among homeowners and our distribution partners regarding our business and financial condition. See “— Maintaining and\nenhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our future growth, and negative publicity could damage our brand and thereby harm our\nability to\n58\nTable of Contents\ncompete effectively, and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.” The\nReorganization has required, and may continue to require, a significant amount of management’s and other employees’ time and focus,\nwhich may divert attention from effectively operating and growing our business. See Part I, Item 2, “Management’s Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —Recent Developments—Workforce Reduction Plans.”\nAny indebtedness we may incur from time to time could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund\noperations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from meeting our financial\nobligations.\nAs described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report under Part I, Item 2. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\nResults of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Revolving Credit Facility,” in October 2021, we entered into a Revolving\nCredit Facility, which, as subsequently amended in December 2021, June 2023, and October 2024, provides for senior secured\nborrowings in an aggregate principal amount of up to $105.0 million, which amount may be borrowed and repaid from time to time. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, $81.0 million in borrowings were outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, $23.4 million of letters of credit\nwere issued under the Revolving Credit Facility, and $0.6 million was available for borrowings. In addition, as described elsewhere in this\nQuarterly Report under Part I, Item 2. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —\nSubsequent Events,” in August 2024, the Company entered into the Note Purchase Agreement, providing for the issuance and sale of up\nto $75.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured convertible notes due 2029 (\"Convertible Notes\"), as subsequently\namended in October 2024, of which, as of the date hereof, $30.0 million has been issued and is outstanding.\nIf we cannot generate sufficient cash flows from operations to service the amounts borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility, any\namounts due under the Convertible Notes, or to maintain our ongoing operations, we may need to refinance, dispose of assets, issue\nequity to obtain necessary funds, or seek additional sources of liquidity. We do not know whether we will be able to do any of this on a\ntimely basis, on terms satisfactory to us, or at all. While the Note Purchase Agreement provides for the issuance of up to an additional\n$45.0 million of Convertible Notes in certain circumstances and upon certain conditions, there can be no guarantee that any additional\nConvertible Notes will be issued. In addition, any additional indebtedness could have important consequences, including, but not limited\nto:\n• our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements,\nacquisitions and general corporate or other purposes may be limited;\n• any cash flows from operations that we use to repay principal and interest on our debt will not be available for other purposes,\nsuch as funding our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;\n• for borrowings at variable rates of interest, we will be exposed to the risk of increased or elevated interest rates;\n• our ability to adjust to changing market conditions may be limited and may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to\nless-leveraged competitors; and\n• we may be more vulnerable during a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business.\nIn addition, the agreements governing our Revolving Credit Facility and the Convertible Notes contain, and any agreements evidencing\nor governing other future indebtedness may also contain, certain restrictive covenants that limit or otherwise restrict our ability to do\ncertain things:\n• create, incur, assume or permit to exist any debt or liens;\n• merge into or consolidate with any other person, or liquidate or dissolve;\n• make or hold certain investments;\n• sell, transfer, lease, license or otherwise dispose of our assets, including equity interests;\n• pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments;\n• substantively alter the character of our business; and\n• sell, lease or otherwise transfer any property or assets to, or purchase, lease or otherwise acquire any property or assets from,\nor otherwise engage in any other transactions with affiliates.\nThe agreements governing the Revolving Credit Facility and the Convertible Notes also contain, and any agreements evidencing or\ngoverning other future indebtedness may also contain, certain financial covenants and financial reporting and other requirements, as\ndescribed elsewhere in this Quarterly Report under Part I, Item 2. under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\nand Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Revolving Credit Facility and — Subsequent Events.” Our ability to\ncomply with these covenants and requirements may be affected by events and factors beyond our control. We may not be able to\ngenerate sufficient revenue or maintain sufficient liquidity to meet the financial covenants (at such time as we are required to do so) or\npay any principal and interest due under the Revolving Credit Facility or Convertible Notes when required. If we fail to make payments or\notherwise experience an event of default thereunder, the lending banks would be permitted to take certain actions, including terminating\nall outstanding commitments and declaring all amounts to be immediately due and payable and would have the right to proceed against\nthe collateral granted to them, which\n59\nTable of Contents\nincludes substantially all of our assets. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nresults of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, future working capital, borrowings, or equity financing could be unavailable to\nrepay or refinance amounts borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility or the Convertible Notes. In the event of a liquidation, our\nlenders would be repaid all outstanding principal and interest prior to distribution of assets to unsecured creditors, and the holders of our\nClass A Common Stock would receive a portion of any liquidation proceeds only if all of our creditors, including our lenders, were first\nrepaid in full.\nWe have incurred net losses in each year since inception, and we may not be able to achieve profitability.\nWe incurred net losses of $528.2 million, $332.1 million, and $154.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021,\nrespectively. Historically, we have invested significantly in efforts to grow our homeowner base, both through our individual and portfolio\nstrategies, as well as through strategic acquisitions, to grow our guest community and to improve our platform technology.\nAs a result of the Reorganization, we have significantly reduced the size of our central sales team, and reorganized the sales force to\nmore closely align with individual markets. Similarly, we have reduced and realigned other central office support teams, including product\nand technology, finance and accounting, legal, human resources and marketing. While these actions are expected to reduce the\nCompany's total operating expenses, if our revenue continues to decline, it may not be enough to offset our current and future operating\nexpenses, we will not achieve profitability in future periods and our net losses may increase. Additionally, the reduction in the size of our\nsales force may reduce the number of units onboarded to our platform, which may slow potential growth in revenue.\nRevenue may continue to decline for a number of possible reasons, many of which are beyond our control, including slowing demand for\nour offerings, listing growth constraints, increasing competition, changing travel patterns or any of the other factors discussed in this\n“Risk Factors” section and the \"Risk Factors\" section of the 2023 Annual Report. Certain types of homes and certain regions in which we\noperate result in listings with lower commission rates and/or lower service fees, which could have a materially negative impact on our\noverall operating margins. We have experienced, and in the future may experience, fluctuations and high volatility in operating costs and\nexpenses. We incurred operating costs and expenses of $1,655.3 million, $1,578.9 million and $1,014.5 million for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. In addition, we have changed, and may in the future reduce, our commission rates\nand service fees for strategic or competitive reasons. Failure to increase our revenue or manage the increase in our operating expenses\ncould prevent us from achieving or sustaining profitability as measured by net income, operating income, or Adjusted EBITDA at all or on\na consistent basis, or could significantly impair our future outlook or cash position, which would cause our business, results of operations\nand financial condition to suffer and the market price of our Class A Common Stock to decline.\nOur business and operations experienced rapid historical growth, which strained our resources, and the Reorganization may\nfurther limit our ability to maintain or improve our systems, processes and controls, which could adversely affect our\nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nThe rapid historical growth and expansion of our business has placed a continuous and significant strain on our management,\noperational, financial and other resources. As part of the Reorganization, we have reduced and realign our central corporate teams,\nwhich may limit our ability to maintain or continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our\nsecurity and compliance requirements, our operating and administrative systems, our customer service and support capabilities, our\nrelationships with various distribution partners and other third parties, and our ability to manage operations, headcount and processes.\nWe may not be able to sustain the pace of improvements to our platform and services, or successfully develop and introduce new\nofferings or implement systems, processes, and controls in an efficient or timely manner or in a manner that does not negatively affect\nour results of operations. Our failure to maintain and improve our systems, processes, and controls, or their failure to operate in the\nintended manner, may result in our inability to manage our business and to forecast our revenue, expenses, and net income (loss)\naccurately, or to prevent losses.\nIn addition, we may find it difficult to maintain our corporate culture while managing our workforce. Any failure to manage our workforce\nor organizational changes and resulting employee concerns in a manner that preserves our culture could result in unwanted employee\nattrition and negatively impact future growth and achievement of our business objectives. Additionally, our productivity and the quality of\nour offerings may be adversely affected if we do not integrate and train our new employees\n60\nTable of Contents\nquickly and effectively. Failure to manage growth, effectively could result in increased costs, negatively affect homeowner and guest\nsatisfaction and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects.\nOur past growth may not be indicative of our future prospects, and revenue has decreased and may continue to decrease in\nthe future. Our historical growth also makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects and may increase\nthe risk that we will not be successful.\nOur past growth may not be indicative of our future prospects, and revenue has decreased and may continue to decrease in the future.\nOur past growth also makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects and may increase the risk that we will not be\nsuccessful. Our total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $772.5 million and $940.5 million,\nrespectively, representing a decrease in revenue of 18%. Our ability to avoid further declines in our revenue depends on maintaining our\nexisting homes on our platform, the growth of supply of new homes for our platform and demand for vacation rentals on our and our\ndistribution partners platforms. Our business is also affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide, as well as trends\nin the global travel and hospitality industries, all of which can adversely impact our growth. In addition, we believe that our revenue\ngrowth depends upon a number of additional factors, including other risks described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and the 2023\nAnnual Report.\nA softening of demand for our offerings or our accommodations category, whether caused by events outside of our control, such as a\npandemic, epidemic or outbreak of infectious disease, changes in homeowner and guest preferences, any of the other factors described\nelsewhere in this Quarterly Report and the 2023 Annual Report or otherwise, may impair our ability to grow our revenue. If our revenue\ncontinues to decline, or our growth rates do not meet expectations, we may not achieve profitability, and our business, results of\noperations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, our historical growth has made and may continue to make it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects.\nOur ability to forecast our future results of operations is subject to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to effectively plan for\nand model future growth. We have encountered in the past, and may encounter in the future, risks and uncertainties frequently\nexperienced by growing companies in changing industries that may prevent us from achieving the objectives discussed elsewhere in this\nQuarterly Report and the 2023 Annual Report. If we fail to achieve the necessary level of efficiency in our organization, or if we are not\nable to accurately forecast future growth or decline, our business would be adversely affected. Moreover, if the assumptions that we use\nto plan our business are incorrect or change in reaction to changes in our industry and the markets in which we operate, or if we are\nunable to maintain consistent revenue or revenue growth, the market price of our Class A Common Stock may continue to be volatile,\nand it may be difficult to achieve and maintain profitability.\nThe business and industry in which we participate are highly competitive, and we may be unable to compete successfully with\nour current or future competitors.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment and face significant competition in attracting and retaining homeowners and guests.\nHomeowners primarily choose between self-managing their homes or using a local vacation rental management business to list and care\nfor their homes and in some cases adopt a hybrid approach using a third-party provider to help with guest demand generation, pricing,\nbooking and support, while the owner takes care of the home. Homeowners who self-manage are able to list on third-party sites such as\nAirbnb, Booking.com, Evolve, and Vrbo and may choose to leverage additional third-party software tools to handle aspects of the\nprocess such as pricing or scheduling, or homeowners may fully self-manage. We compete for homeowners based on many factors,\nincluding the volume and pricing of bookings generated by guests on our platform and those of our distribution partners; ease of\nonboarding onto our platform; the service fees and commissions we charge; the owner protections we offer, such as our accommodation\nprotection programs; our cancellation policies; and the strength of our brand. We also compete to retain homeowners who are currently\nusing our platform, as homeowners can choose to discontinue their contractual arrangements with us at any time.\nWe also compete to attract guests to our platform. Guests have a wide range of options for finding and booking accommodations, and as\nsuch, we compete with other forms of accommodations including hotels, other vacation rental companies, and serviced apartment\nproviders, both online and offline. We also compete for traffic and demand generation through our direct booking channel, with Airbnb,\nBooking.com, Vrbo, regional booking sites, and online travel agencies, and, to a lesser degree, urban and corporate travel rental sites,\nvacation clubs, timeshares, and niche programs such as fractional ownership programs. We compete for guests based on many factors,\nincluding the uniqueness, quality, safety and cleanliness of\n61\nTable of Contents\nour homes and the availability of homes; the value and all-in cost of our offerings relative to other options; our brand; and the ease of use\nof our platform.\nAs a publicly traded company, we are required to make certain public disclosures about our business, strategy, and financial results that\nother property managers are not required to make, and which may provide them with insights into our business and our strategy that\nwould not otherwise be available to them. This may, in turn, allow them to compete more effectively against us for homeowners.\nAdditionally, such disclosures may result in negative perceptions among homeowners regarding our business and financial condition,\nwhich may make it more difficult for us to retain homeowners than for our competitors who are not required to make similar disclosures.\nSome of our competitors are adopting aspects of our business model, while others, such as local property managers, are increasingly\nusing third-party vacation rental software for aspects of their business, including pricing, booking, housekeeping and maintenance, all of\nwhich could affect our ability to differentiate our offerings from theirs. Increased competition could reduce demand for our platform from\nhomeowners and guests, slow our growth, and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nMany of our current and potential competitors are larger and have greater financial, technical and other resources that provide\nsubstantial competitive advantages, such as greater brand name recognition, longer operating histories, larger marketing budgets and\nestablished marketing relationships, and significantly greater resources for the development of their offerings. In addition, many of our\ncurrent and potential competitors have access to larger user bases and/or inventory for accommodations, and may provide multiple\ntravel products, including flights. As a result, our competitors may be able to provide consumers with a better or more complete product\nexperience and respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, or\nhomeowner and guest requirements or preferences. The global travel industry has also experienced significant consolidation, and we\nexpect this trend may continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in a highly competitive industry.\nConsolidation amongst our competitors will give them increased scale and may enhance their capacity, abilities, and resources, and\nlower their cost structures. In addition, emerging start-ups may be able to innovate and focus on developing a new product or service\nfaster than we can or may foresee consumer need for new offerings or technologies before us.\nSome of our competitors and potential competitors have more established or varied relationships with consumers than we do, and they\ncould use these advantages in ways that could affect our competitive position, including by entering the travel and accommodations\nbusinesses. For example, some competitors and potential competitors are creating “super-apps” where consumers can use many online\nservices without leaving that company’s app. If any of these platforms are successful in offering services to consumers that are similar to\nours, or if we are unable to offer our services to consumers within these super-apps, our customer acquisition efforts could be less\neffective and our customer acquisition costs, including our brand and performance marketing expenses, could increase, any of which\ncould materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe also face increasing competition from search engines, including Google. The way Google presents travel search results, and its\npromotion of its own travel meta-search services, such as Google Travel and Google Vacation Rental Ads, or similar actions from other\nsearch engines, and their practices concerning search rankings, could decrease our search traffic, increase traffic acquisition costs,\nand/or disintermediate our platform. These parties can also offer their own comprehensive travel planning and booking tools, or refer\nleads directly to suppliers, other favored partners, or themselves, which could also disintermediate our platform. In addition, if Google or\nApple use their own mobile operating systems or app distribution channels to favor their own or other preferred travel service offerings,\nor impose policies that effectively disallow us to continue our full product offerings in those channels, it could materially adversely affect\nour ability to engage with homeowners and guests who access our platform via mobile apps or search, which would negatively impact\nour business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to maintain our market share, attract new vacation rental homeowners to our platform and maintain\nrelationships with existing vacation rental homeowners, or if homeowners reduce the availability of their homes on our\nplatform, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected.\nOur business depends on our ability to maintain our market share, attract new vacation rental homeowners to our platform, maintain\nrelationships with our existing homeowner base, and on homeowners allowing us to make their homes available for rent through our\nservice. If our sales personnel are unable to accurately identify and convert a sufficient number of prospective homeowners, if they fail to\naccurately predict the rental revenue of these homeowners’ properties on our platform, or if our sales and marketing efforts are otherwise\nunsuccessful, our revenue and growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected. Such risks may be exacerbated as a result\nof the Reorganization. Our company and the broader vacation rental industry have seen elevated levels of homeowners changing\nproperty managers or moving to self-management in recent\n62\nTable of Contents\nperiods. We have also recently seen an increase in the supply of rental units available, in a number of markets, which have reduced and\ncould continue to reduce demand for the units we manage and put pressure on our revenue per available night. The number of homes\nwe manage on our platform decreased by approximately 5% during the year ended December 31, 2023. If we do not maintain existing\nhomeowners and the availability of their homes on our platform, and maintain or increase our market share, our revenue and growth\nprospects could be materially and adversely affected. Homeowners can also limit the number of nights available through our services,\nand these practices are outside of our direct control. If homeowners do not establish or maintain availability of their vacation rentals, or if\nthe number of Nights Sold declines for a particular period, then our revenue would decline and our business, results of operations, and\nfinancial condition would be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, homeowners may, at any time, elect to terminate their contractual arrangements with us, if we cannot attract prospective\nguests to our platform, generate sufficient guest bookings and create attractive returns to homeowners. If we are unable to retain or add\nhomeowners, we may be unable to offer a sufficient supply of properties to attract guests to our platform. If we are unable to attract and\nretain individual homeowners in a cost-effective manner, or at all, our business, results of operations, and financial condition and cash\nflows would be materially adversely affected. The announced Reorganization may also impact service levels or perceived service levels,\nfrom local and/or corporate functions, which may further impact our ability to attract and retain homeowners.\nWe also work with certain homeowner associations to manage their association activities, and we often manage vacation rental\nproperties for homeowners within these associations. If our fee structure and payment terms are not as competitive as those of our\ncompetitors, these homeowner associations may choose to end their business relationships with us, thereby reducing the number of\nhomeowners using our platform and vacation rentals listed with our service.\nA number of factors affecting homeowners could cause homeowner attrition, including: changes to, or the enforcement or threatened\nenforcement of, laws and regulations, including short-term occupancy and tax laws; homeowners’, condominium and neighborhood\nassociations adopting and enforcing governing documents or contracts that prohibit or restrict short-term rental activities; regulations that\npurport to ban or otherwise restrict short-term rentals; homeowners opting for long-term rentals of their properties outside of our service;\nperceptions of the value or quality of our services; economic, social, and political factors; perceptions of trust and safety on and off our\nplatform and within our homes; or negative experiences with guests, including guests who damage homeowner property, hold\nunauthorized parties, or engage in violent and unlawful acts, or the occurrence of a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of infectious\ndisease. Our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if our homeowners are unable\nor unwilling to allow us to list and manage their properties.\nWe believe that our accommodation protection program, provided via a third-party insurer, is integral to retaining and acquiring\nhomeowners. Our homeowner protection program offers specified vacation rental liability and damage protection to homeowners. If this\nprogram were to become unavailable for any reason, including if the third-party insurance provider ceases to provide coverage, or if the\ncost of the program rises significantly, then the number of homeowners who list with us may decline.\nIf we are unable to attract new guests or retain existing guests, our business, results of operations, and financial condition\nwould be materially adversely affected.\nOur success depends significantly on existing and new guests continuing to book homeowners’ vacation rentals through the Vacasa\nplatform or those of our distribution partners. Our ability to attract and retain guests could be materially adversely affected by a number\nof factors, including, among others:\n• homes failing to meet guests’ expectations;\n• increased competition and use of our competitors’ platforms and services;\n• our failure to provide differentiated, high-quality, and an adequate supply of homes at competitive prices;\n• guests not receiving timely or adequate customer support from us;\n• declines or inefficiencies in our marketing efforts;\n• negative associations with, or reduced awareness of, our brand;\n• issues with our distribution partners or their platforms;\n• negative perceptions of the trust and safety on our platform or in our homeowners’ homes;\n• macroeconomic and other conditions outside of our control affecting travel and hospitality industries generally, including inflation\nand elevated interest rates;\n• the occurrence of events beyond our control, such as a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of infectious disease, increased or\ncontinuing restrictions on travel and immigration, trade disputes, economic downturns or recession,\n63\nTable of Contents\nsignificant labor shortages, political, civil or social unrest, and the impact of climate change on travel (including fires, floods,\nsevere weather and other natural disasters) and seasonal destinations; and\n• other risks described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report.\nIn addition, for guests who book directly with us, if our platform is not easy to navigate, guests have an unsatisfactory experience on our\nplatform, the listings and other content provided on our platform are not displayed effectively to guests, we fail to make our brand known\nto guests during their rental experience or we fail to provide a rental experience in a manner that meets rapidly changing demand, each\nof which may be exacerbated as a result of the Reorganization, then we could fail to convert first-time guests into repeat customers,\nwhich would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur customer support function is critical to the success of our platform, and any failure to provide high-quality service could\naffect our ability to retain our existing homeowners and guests and attract new ones.\nOur ability to provide high-quality support to our homeowners and guests is important for the growth of our business and any failure to\nmaintain such standards of customer support, or any perception that we do not provide high-quality service, could adversely affect our\nability to retain and attract homeowners and guests. Meeting the customer support expectations of our homeowners and guests requires\na substantial customer support team and significant investment in staffing, technology, including automation and machine learning to\nimprove efficiency, infrastructure, policies, and customer support tools. The failure to develop or invest in the appropriate technology,\ninfrastructure, policies, and customer support tools, or to manage or properly train our local operations or customer support teams, could\ncompromise our ability to resolve questions and complaints quickly and effectively. Growth in the number of homeowners and guests\nusing our platform will put additional pressure on our customer support and on our technology organizations. Our service is staffed\nbased on business forecasts. Any volatility in those forecasts could lead to staffing gaps that could impact the quality of our service. We\nhave in the past experienced and may in the future experience substantial delays or other issues in responding to requests for customer\nsupport, which may reduce our ability to effectively retain homeowners and guests.\nWe also help to mediate disputes between homeowners and guests. We rely on information provided by homeowners and guests and\nare at times limited in our ability to provide adequate support or help homeowners and guests resolve disputes due to our lack of\ninformation or control. To the extent that homeowners and guests are not satisfied with the quality or timeliness of our customer support,\nwe may not be able to retain homeowners or guests, and our reputation as well as our business, results of operations, and financial\ncondition could be materially adversely affected.\nWhen a homeowner or guest has a poor experience on our platform or with our service, we may issue refunds or future stay credits, or\nmake other payments, such as in respect of lost or damaged property, all of which reduce our revenue. A robust customer support effort\nis costly, and we expect such costs to continue to rise in the future. If we incur such increases in costs without a corresponding increase\nin revenue, this could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nBookings through our distribution partners account for a significant portion of our revenue, and if we are unable to maintain\nour relationships with them or develop and maintain successful relationships with additional distribution partners, our\nbusiness, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected. These relationships also\nsubject us to certain risks.\nThe growth of our business depends, in part, on our ability to maintain our relationships with our existing distribution partners and to\nidentify, develop, and maintain strategic relationships with additional distribution partners, particularly as we continue to grow our brand\nrecognition and our own booking platform. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we generated approximately 60%,\n70%, and 70%, respectively, of our GBV through our distribution partners. The impairment or termination of any of these relationships,\nthe failure of our distribution partners to effectively market our listings and provide satisfactory user experiences, or service disruptions,\noutages, and other technical performance problems experienced by our distribution partners or on their platforms could materially and\nadversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our agreements with our existing distribution partners are\nnon-exclusive, meaning our distribution partners can and do provide guests looking for vacation rentals with access to listings other than\nours. Our distribution partners are not required to continue to market our listings, and may take actions that promote their or other third-\nparty listings above ours. Additionally, our relationships with, or presentation of our units by our distribution partners may be adversely\naffected due to negative perceptions of our business or financial condition, or of the homes we manage. In addition, certain of these\ncompanies are now, or may in the future become, competitors of ours. While we view our distribution partners more as partners than\ncompetitors and believe our relationships with these parties are mutually beneficial, we cannot guarantee that our distribution partners\nwill continue to share this view. If our distribution partners view us as competitive, they could limit our access to their platforms,\n64\nTable of Contents\nallow access only at an unsustainable cost, or make changes to their platforms that make our listings less desirable to users or harder to\naccess.\nIn addition, bookings through Airbnb, Booking.com, and Vrbo account for a significant portion of our GBV. For the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, GBV generated through Airbnb, Booking.com, and Vrbo together accounted for approximately\n90%, 90%, and 95%, respectively, of the GBV generated through all of our distribution partners. The loss of any one or more of these\nkey distribution partners, or a material reduction in the number of stays booked through their platforms, would adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur efforts to create new offerings and initiatives are costly, and if such offerings and initiatives are unsuccessful, we may fail\nto grow, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected.\nWe invest in developing new offerings and initiatives that we expect will differentiate us from our competitors and help grow our\nbusiness. Developing and deploying new offerings and initiatives is challenging and increases our expenses and our organizational\ncomplexity, and they may not deliver the benefits we expect.\nOur new offerings and initiatives have a high degree of risk, as they may involve significant investment and upfront costs. For example,\nwe have invested, and expect to continue investing, in the deployment of smart home technology across our portfolio. There can be no\nassurance that homeowner demand for such technology or other offerings and initiatives we may develop will exist or sustain at the\nlevels that we anticipate, that we will be able to successfully manage the delivery of such offerings and initiatives, or that any of these\nofferings or initiatives will generate sufficient revenue to offset associated expenses or liabilities. It is also possible that offerings\ndeveloped by others will render our offerings and initiatives noncompetitive or obsolete. Further, these efforts will divert capital and other\nresources from our more established offerings and geographic regions, may result in increased legal and regulatory compliance\nexpenses, and could distract management from our core business operations. Even if we are successful in developing new offerings and\ninitiatives, regulatory authorities may implement new rules, taxes, or restrictions or more aggressively enforce existing rules, taxes, or\nrestrictions that could increase our expenses or otherwise prevent us from successfully commercializing these initiatives. If we do not\nrealize the expected benefits of these investments, we may fail to grow, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition\nwould be materially adversely affected.\nWe rely on traffic to our platform to grow revenue, and if we are unable to drive traffic cost-effectively to our platform, it would\nmaterially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe believe that awareness of our brand among potential homeowners and guests is an important aspect of our efforts to increase traffic\non our platform and grow our revenue. We have historically invested considerable resources to drive homeowner and guest acquisition\nand increase awareness regarding our brand; however, following the Reorganization, we expect to reduce our investment in sales and\nmarketing activities, in favor of allowing local operations teams to drive more sales and marketing in their respective markets. Our\nchanges to our marketing efforts may not be cost-effective or successful. If our competitors spend more on marketing efforts or are more\neffective in such efforts, we may not be able to maintain or grow traffic to our platform. Accordingly, our brand awareness and traffic on\nour platform may suffer and our revenue may be adversely impacted. Additionally, changes our channel mix, as a result of our marketing\nefforts or otherwise, may impact the percentage of GBV generated by our distribution partners, as compared to the percentage\ngenerated directly through our platform, which could make our short- term cash flows more volatile and negatively impact our cash\nposition and overall financial condition.\nA critical factor in attracting homeowners and guests to our platform is how prominently listings are displayed in response to search\nqueries for key search terms. The success of vacation rentals and the alternative accommodation industry has led to increased costs for\nrelevant keywords as our competitors competitively bid on our keywords. We may not be successful at our efforts to drive traffic growth\ncost-effectively. If we need to increase our performance marketing spend in the future, including in response to increased spend on\nperformance marketing from our competitors, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely\naffected.\nDigital performance marketing is increasingly subject to strict regulation, and regulatory or legislative changes could adversely impact the\neffectiveness of our performance marketing efforts and, as a result, our business. Many countries have adopted, or are adopting,\nregulations governing the use of cookies and similar technologies, and individuals may be required to “opt-in” to the placement of web\nbrowser cookies used for purposes of marketing. For example, to the extent we send direct electronic marketing communications to\nEU/UK residents and/or place cookies on their electronic devices, we may be subject to evolving EU privacy laws on cookies and e-\nmarketing. If we are required to change our marketing practices as a result, this could lead to substantial costs, require significant\nsystems changes, limit the effectiveness of our marketing activities, divert the attention of our technology personnel, adversely affect our\nmargins, increase costs, and subject us to additional liabilities. Widespread\n65\nTable of Contents\nadoption of such regulations could adversely affect our ability to market effectively to current and prospective homeowners and guests,\nand thus materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe focus on search engine optimization (\"SEO\") on unpaid channels to drive traffic to our platform. SEO involves developing our\nplatform in a way that enables a search engine to rank our platform prominently for search queries for which our platform’s content may\nbe relevant. Changes to search engine algorithms or similar actions are not within our control, and could adversely affect our search-\nengine rankings and traffic to our platform. To the extent that our brand and platform are listed less prominently or fail to appear in search\nresults for any reason, we would need to increase our paid marketing spend, which would increase our overall customer acquisition\ncosts and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If Google or Apple uses its own mobile\noperating systems or app distribution channels to favor its own or other preferred travel service offerings, or impose policies that\neffectively disallow us to continue our full product offerings in those channels, there could be an adverse effect on our ability to engage\nwith homeowners and guests who access our platform via mobile apps or search.\nMoreover, as guests increase their booking search activity across multiple travel sites or compare offerings across sites, our marketing\nefficiency and effectiveness is adversely impacted, which could cause us to increase our sales and marketing expenditures in the future,\nwhich may not be offset by additional revenue, and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial\ncondition. In addition, any negative publicity or public complaints, including those that impede our ability to maintain positive brand\nawareness through our marketing and consumer communications efforts, could harm our reputation and lead to fewer homeowners and\nguests using our platform, and attempts to replace this traffic through other channels will require us to increase our sales and marketing\nexpenditures.\nMaintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our future growth, and negative publicity could damage our\nbrand and thereby harm our ability to compete effectively, and could materially adversely affect our business, results of\noperations, and financial condition.\nMaintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our ability to attract homeowners, guests, and employees, to compete\neffectively, to maintain relationships with our distribution partners, to preserve and deepen the engagement of our existing homeowners,\nguests, and employees, to maintain and improve our standing in the communities where our homeowners operate (including our\nstanding with community leaders and regulatory bodies), and to mitigate legislative or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, and government\ninvestigations. As our brand awareness grows, we depend more heavily on the perceptions of homeowners and guests who use our\nplatform and our services to help make word-of-mouth recommendations.\nAny incident, whether actual or rumored, involving the safety or security of vacation rental homes, homeowners, guests, or other\nmembers of the public, fraudulent transactions, or incidents that are mistakenly attributed to Vacasa, and any resulting media coverage,\ncould create a negative public perception of our platform, which would adversely impact our ability to attract homeowners and guests. In\naddition, when homeowners cancel reservations or if we fail to provide timely refunds to guests in connection with cancellations, guest\nperception of the value of our platform is adversely impacted and may cause guests to not use our platform in the future. The impact of\nthese issues may be more pronounced if we are seen to have failed to provide prompt and appropriate customer support or if our\nplatform policies are perceived to be too permissive or restrictive, or as providing homeowners and/or guests with unsatisfactory\nresolutions, each of which may be exacerbated as a result of the Restructuring. We have been the subject of media reports, social media\nposts, blog posts, and content in other forums that contain allegations about our business or activity on our platform that create negative\npublicity. As a result of these complaints and negative publicity, some homeowners have refrained from, and may in the future refrain\nfrom, listing with us, and some guests have refrained from, and may in the future refrain from, using our platform, which could materially\nadversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur brand and reputation could be also harmed if we fail to act responsibly or are perceived as not acting responsibly, or if we fail to\ncomply with regulatory requirements, in a number of areas, such as safety and security, data security, privacy practices, provision of\ninformation about users and activities on our platform, sustainability, human rights, diversity, non-discrimination, and support for\nemployees and local communities. Media, legislative, or government scrutiny around our company, including the perceived impact on\naffordable housing and over-tourism, neighborhood nuisance, privacy practices, provision of information as requested by certain\ngovernments or agencies thereof, content on our platform, business practices and strategic plans, impact of travel on the environment,\npublic health policies that may cause geopolitical backlash, our business partners, and our practices relating to our platform, offerings,\nemployees, competition, litigation, and response to regulatory activity, could adversely affect our brand and our reputation with our\nhomeowners, guests, and communities. Social media compounds the potential scope of the negative publicity that could be generated\nand the speed with which such negative publicity may\n66\nTable of Contents\nspread. Any resulting damage to our brand or reputation could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and\nfinancial condition.\nWe rely on our homeowners and guests to provide trustworthy reviews and ratings that our homeowners or guests may rely upon to help\ndecide whether or not to book a particular listing or accept a particular booking. We, and our distribution partners, also use these reviews\nand ratings to uphold quality standards. Our homeowners and guests may be less likely to rely on reviews and ratings if they believe that\nour review system does not generate trustworthy, reliable reviews and ratings. We have procedures in place to combat fraud or abuse of\nour review system, but we cannot guarantee that these procedures are, or will be, effective.\nIf potential homeowners or guests disregard these reviews and ratings, our systems that use reviews and ratings to enforce quality\nstandards would be less effective, which could reduce trust within our customer-base and damage our brand and reputation, and could\nmaterially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOwner, guest, or third-party actions that are criminal, violent, inappropriate, dangerous, or fraudulent, may undermine the\nsafety or the perception of safety of our services, affect our ability to attract and retain homeowners and guests, and materially\nadversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nFraudulent or criminal activity could occur in connection with the use of our services, as we do not have complete control over, or the\nability to predict, the actions of our users and other third parties, such as neighbors or invitees, either during the guest’s stay, or\notherwise, and therefore, we cannot guarantee the safety of our employees, homeowners, guests, and third parties. The actions of\nhomeowners, guests, and other third parties have resulted, and can result in further, fatalities, injuries, other bodily harm, fraud, invasion\nof privacy, property damage, discrimination, and brand and reputational damage, which have created, and could continue to create\npotential legal or other liabilities for us. We do not verify the identity of all of our homeowners and guests nor do we verify or screen third\nparties who may be present during a reservation made through our platform. Our identity verification processes rely on, among other\nthings, information provided by homeowners and guests, and our ability to validate that information and the effectiveness of third-party\nservice providers that support our verification processes may be limited.\nCertain verification processes may be less reliable than others. These processes are also currently minimal and subject to limitations,\nincluding laws and regulations that prohibit or limit our ability to conduct effective background checks in some jurisdictions, the\nunavailability of information, and the inability of our systems to detect all suspicious activity. There can be no assurances that the\nmeasures we take will significantly reduce criminal or fraudulent activity on our platform or in the homes we manage.\nIn addition, we may not adequately police the safety, suitability, location, quality, availability of recreational items or other amenities,\ncompliance with our policies or standards, and legal compliance, such as fire code compliance or the presence of carbon monoxide\ndetectors, of all our homeowners’ properties. We have in the past taken steps to investigate issues raised by guests and homeowners\nand endeavor to require our local home care staff, including maintenance and housekeeping teams, to do periodic compliance checks,\nbut we cannot ensure that these are consistently performed. We have created policies and standards to respond to issues reported with\nproperties, but some vacation rentals may pose heightened safety risks to individual guests because those issues have not been\nreported to us, because our local operations team has not taken the requisite action based on our policies, or because guests or third\nparties disregard safety measures. We rely, in part, on reports of issues from homeowners, guests and employees to investigate and\nenforce many of our policies and standards. In addition, our policies may not contemplate certain safety risks posed by rental homes or\nindividual homeowners or guests or may not sufficiently address those risks. For example, we have been in the past, and may be in the\nfuture, subject to legal claims and potential liability relating to injuries or other damages sustained in connection with guests’ use of\nrecreational items and other amenities on our homeowners’ properties. Though we typically seek to obtain waivers from liabilities\nassociated with guest use of these items, homeowners do not always inform us that such items are present on their properties and, in\nany event, we cannot guarantee that any waiver we are able to obtain will be found to be enforceable.\nWe have also faced civil litigation, regulatory investigations, and inquiries involving allegations of, among other things, unsafe or\nunsuitable rental homes, discriminatory policies, data processing, practices or behavior on and off our platform or by homeowners,\nguests, and third parties, general misrepresentations regarding the safety or accuracy of offerings on our platform, and other\nhomeowner, guest, or third-party actions that are criminal, violent, inappropriate, dangerous, or fraudulent. Our policies, tools, and\nprocedures to protect homeowners, guests, and the communities in which our homeowners operate may not be successful. Similarly,\nlistings that are inaccurate, of a lower than expected quality, or that do not comply\n67\n\nTable of Contents\nwith our policies may harm guests and public perception of the quality and safety of rental homes on our platform and materially\nadversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIf homeowners, guests, or third parties engage in criminal activity, or misconduct, including fraudulent, negligent, or inappropriate\nconduct or use our platform as a conduit for criminal activity, consumers may not consider our platform and the listings on our platform\nsafe, and we may receive negative media coverage, or be subject to involvement in a government investigation concerning such activity,\nwhich could adversely impact our brand and reputation, and lower the adoption rate of our platform. For example:\n• there have been shootings and other criminal or violent acts on properties booked on our platform, including as a result of\nunsanctioned house parties;\n• there have been undisclosed hidden cameras and claims of invasion of privacy at properties; and\n• there have been incidents of homeowners and guests engaging in criminal, fraudulent, or unsafe behavior and other misconduct\nwhile using our platform.\nThe methods used by perpetrators of fraud and other misconduct are complex and constantly evolving, and our trust and security\nmeasures have been, and may currently or in the future be, insufficient to detect and help prevent all fraudulent activity and other\nmisconduct. For example, there have been incidents where guests have caused substantial property damage to listings or\nmisrepresented the purpose of their stay and used listings for unauthorized or inappropriate conduct including parties, drug-related\nactivities, or to perpetrate criminal activities.\nIn addition, certain regions where we operate have higher rates of violent crime or more relaxed safety standards, which can lead to\nmore safety and security incidents, and may adversely impact the adoption of our platform and services in those regions and elsewhere.\nIf criminal, inappropriate, fraudulent, or other negative incidents continue to occur due to the conduct of homeowners, guests, or third\nparties, our ability to attract and retain homeowners and guests would be harmed, and our business, results of operations, and financial\ncondition would be materially adversely affected. Such incidents have prompted, and may in the future prompt, stricter regulations or\nregulatory inquiries into our platform, policies and business practices. Further, claims have been asserted against us from our\nhomeowners, guests, and third parties for compensation due to accidents, injuries, assaults, theft, property damage, privacy and security\nissues, and other incidents that are caused by other homeowners, guests, or third parties while using homes booked on our platform.\nThese claims subject us to potentially significant liability, increase our operating costs, and could materially adversely affect our\nbusiness, results of operations, and financial condition. We have obtained third-party insurance, which is subject to certain conditions\nand exclusions, for claims and losses incurred based on incidents related to bookings on our platform. Even where we do have third-\nparty insurance, such insurance may be inadequate to fully cover alleged claims of liability, investigation costs, defense costs, and/or\npayouts. Even if these claims do not result in liability, we could incur significant time and cost investigating and defending against them. If\nthe quantity or severity of incidents increases, our insurance rates and our financial exposure will grow, which would materially adversely\naffect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe are subject to payment-related fraud, and an increase in or failure to deal effectively with fraud, fraudulent activities,\nfictitious transactions, or illegal transactions would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and\nfinancial condition.\nWe process a significant volume and dollar value of transactions on a daily basis. We have incurred and will continue to incur losses\nfrom claims by homeowners, fraudulent bookings and fraudulent refund requests, and these losses may be substantial. Such instances\nhave and can lead to the reversal of payments received by us for such bookings, referred to as a “chargeback.” For the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, total chargeback expense was $4.7 million, $5.1 million, and $2.8 million, respectively. Our ability\nto detect and combat fraud, which has become increasingly common and sophisticated, could be adversely impacted by the adoption of\nnew payment methods, the emergence and innovation of new technology platforms, including mobile and other devices, and our growth\nin certain regions, including in regions with a history of elevated fraudulent activity. We expect that technically knowledgeable criminals\nwill continue to attempt to circumvent our anti-fraud systems. In addition, the payment card networks have rules around acceptable\nchargeback ratios. If we are unable to effectively identify fraudulent bookings on our platform, combat the use of fraudulent credit cards,\nor otherwise maintain or lower our current levels of chargebacks, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees or processors\nholding significant reserves against us, be required to post collateral or be unable to continue to accept card payments because payment\ncard networks\n68\n\nTable of Contents\nhave revoked our access to their networks, any of which would materially adversely impact our business, results of operations, and\nfinancial condition.\nMeasures that we are taking to improve the trust and safety of our platform may cause us to incur significant expenditures and\nmay not be successful.\nWe have taken and continue to take measures to improve the trust and safety of the community on our platform, combat fraudulent\nactivities and other misconduct and improve community trust, such as terminating the management contracts of homeowners who fail to\ncomply with our policies. However, some of these measures increase friction on our platform by increasing the number of steps required\nto list or book, which reduces homeowner and guest activity on our platform, and could materially adversely affect our business, results\nof operations, and financial condition. Implementing these trust and safety initiatives, which include, among other things, limited\nverification of homeowners and listings, restrictions on “party” houses, manual screening of high-risk reservations, restrictions on certain\ntypes of bookings, and providing rental home neighbors with the contact information for our local staff, or other initiatives, has caused\nand will continue to cause us to incur significant ongoing expenses and may result in fewer listings and bookings or reduced homeowner\nand guest retention, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We have\ninvested and plan to continue to invest significantly in the trust and safety of our platform and services, but there can be no assurances\nthat these measures will significantly reduce criminal or fraudulent activity on or off our platform, or be sufficient to protect our reputation\nin the event of such activity.\nIf we are unable to manage the risks presented by our international operations, our business, results of operations, and\nfinancial condition would be materially adversely affected.\nCurrently, we provide vacation rental management services in the United States, Belize, Canada, Costa Rica, and Mexico. We also have\ndesign and technology activities in Chile and the Czech Republic, and, until July 2024, in New Zealand. As of December 31, 2023, we\nhad approximately 500 employees outside the United States. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, approximately,\n2%, 2%, and 1% of our revenue, respectively, was generated from vacation rental management activities outside of the United States.\nManaging an international organization is difficult, time-consuming, and expensive, and requires significant management attention. In\naddition, conducting international operations subjects us to risks, which include:\n• operational and compliance challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences;\n• the cost and resources required to localize our platform and services, including translation of our platform into foreign languages\nand adaptation of our platform and services for local practices and regulatory requirements;\n• differing, more restrictive and conflicting laws and regulations, including those governing Internet activities, short-term and long-\nterm rentals, tourism, taxes, licensing, payments processing, messaging, marketing activities, registration and/or verification of\nguests, ownership and protection of intellectual property, content, data collection\n69\nTable of Contents\nand privacy, security, data localization, data transfer and government access to personal information, and the lack of familiarity\nand the burden of complying with them;\n• uncertainty in the enforceability of legal rights, and uneven application of laws and regulations to businesses, in particular to\nU.S. companies;\n• competition with companies that understand local markets better than we do, or that have a local presence and pre-existing\nrelationships with potential homeowners and guests in those markets;\n• differing levels of social acceptance of our brand and offerings;\n• legal uncertainty regarding our liability for the listings, services, and content provided by homeowners, guests, and other third\nparties and uncertain resolutions of litigation or regulatory inquiries;\n• variations in, and increased operational complexity around, payment activity between us, homeowners and guests, and inability\nto offer local payment forms like cash or country-specific digital forms of payment;\n• potentially adverse tax consequences, including resulting from the complexities of foreign corporate income tax systems, value\nadded tax (\"VAT\") regimes, tax withholding rules, lodging taxes, and other indirect taxes, tax collection or remittance obligations,\nand restrictions on the repatriation of earnings;\n• difficulties in managing and staffing international operations, including due to differences in legal, regulatory, and collective\nbargaining processes;\n• fluctuations in currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar;\n• regulations governing the control of local currencies and their impact on our ability to collect and remit funds to homeowners in\nthose currencies or to repatriate cash into the United States;\n• oversight by foreign government agencies whose approach to privacy or human rights may be inconsistent with those taken in\nother countries;\n• increased financial accounting and reporting burdens, and complexities and difficulties in implementing and maintaining\nadequate internal controls in an international operating environment;\n• political, social, and economic instability abroad, terrorist attacks, and security concerns in general; and\n• operating in countries that are more prone to crime, or have lower safety standards, or have higher risk of corruption.\nAny further international expansion of our business could exacerbate these risks and may not be successful. Increased operating\nexpenses, decreased revenue, negative publicity, negative reaction from our homeowners and guests and other stakeholders, or other\nadverse impacts from any of the above factors or other risks related to our international operations, could materially adversely affect our\nbrand, reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition, and growth prospects.\nOur growth strategy has included and may in the future include strategic acquisitions and dispositions. We may not be able to\nconsummate future acquisitions or successfully integrate past or future acquisitions.\nA portion of our growth has been due to acquisitions of strategic businesses. We may make strategic acquisitions in the future to\nenhance our market position and broaden our product offerings. Our ability to successfully effectuate acquisitions in the future subject to\na variety of risks, including:\n• Our ability to identify acceptable acquisition candidates;\n• The impact of increased competition for acquisitions, which may increase acquisition costs, affect our ability to consummate\nacquisitions on favorable terms, and result in us assuming a greater portion of the seller’s liabilities;\n• Successfully integrating acquired businesses, including integrating the management, technological and operational processes,\nprocedures and controls of the acquired businesses with those of our existing operations;\n• Adequate financing for acquisitions being available on terms acceptable to us;\n• Unexpected losses of key employees, customers and suppliers of acquired businesses;\n• Mitigating assumed, contingent and unknown liabilities, including ongoing lawsuits or liabilities that could subject us to lawsuits;\n• Acquiring goodwill and other non-amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing and potential\nimpairment charges;\n• The impact of amortization expense related to certain intangible assets, which would increase our expenses and working\ncapital; and\n• Challenges in managing the increased scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations.\nThe process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may\nrequire additional financial resources and attention from management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or\nexpansion of our existing operations. There can be no assurance that pre-acquisition due diligence will have identified all material issues\nthat might arise with respect to such acquired business. Furthermore, even if successfully integrated, the acquired business may not\nachieve the results we expected or produce expected benefits in the time frame planned. From time to time, we may also divest or wind\ndown portions of our business, both acquired or otherwise, that are no\n70\nTable of Contents\nlonger strategically important, which could materially affect our cash flows and results of operations. Failure to continue with our\nacquisition strategy or the successful integration of acquired businesses could have an adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur failure to raise additional capital or generate the significant capital necessary to expand our operations and invest in new\nofferings could reduce our ability to compete and could adversely affect our business.\nWe have incurred significant operating losses and generated negative cash flows from operations as we have been investing to support\nour business, and expect to continue to do so in the future as we execute on our strategic initiatives to return to growth in our business.\nOur future capital requirements and needs for additional financing will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to\nexecute on our Reorganization plan, our growth, our ability to attract and retain new homeowners and guests that utilize our services, the\nextent and profitability of any strategic transactions we enter into, the continuing market acceptance of our offerings, the timing and\nextent of spending to enhance our technology, the extent of our sales and marketing activities, and our cash flows, cash position and\nliquidity requirements. Our need for additional financing may also be impacted by the seasonality of our business. Our cash and working\ncapital tends to be highest in the second quarter and lowest in the fourth quarter of the year. On May 8, 2024, the Company drew $81.0\nmillion under the Revolving Credit Facility, and on August 7, 2024, we issued $30.0 million of Convertible Notes, to supplement our cash\nposition. We will continue to evaluate our liquidity needs in light of market conditions and expected cash flows. If our working capital\nreserves are inadequate, we may be required to evaluate additional financing opportunities, and our ability to obtain financing will\ndepend, among other things, on our development efforts, business plans, operating performance, and the condition of the capital\nmarkets at the time. Additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms when required, or at all. If we raise additional\nfunds through future issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, such as the Convertible Notes, our existing stockholders could\nsuffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those of\nholders of our Class A Common Stock. In addition, our stockholders will experience additional dilution when stock appreciation rights\nholders and option holders exercise their rights to purchase our Class A Common Stock under our equity incentive plans, any restricted\nstock units or performance stock units we may grant from time to time vest and settle, we issue equity awards to our employees under\nour equity incentive plans, or we otherwise issue additional equity interests.\nIf we are unable to raise additional funds when we need them and on terms that are acceptable to us, our ability to continue to develop\nor enhance our platform, products or services, support and grow our business and operations, respond to business challenges and\nopportunities, and execute our growth strategy would be significantly limited, and our business, results of operations, and financial\ncondition would be materially adversely affected.\nOur business depends on our ability to attract and retain capable management and employees, and if we lose any of our key\npersonnel, or if we are unable to attract, retain and motivate a sufficient number of skilled personnel, our business, results of\noperations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected, and we may be unable to execute our growth\nstrategy.\nOur future success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain high-quality management and employees. Our CEO, CFO\nand other members of our senior management team, as well as other employees, may terminate their employment with us at any time.\nLosing the services of members of our senior management team could materially harm our business until a suitable replacement is\nfound, and such replacement may not have equal experience and capabilities. In addition, we have not purchased life insurance on any\nmembers of our senior management team. Furthermore, given the importance of our key executives to our business, we are also\nvulnerable to the risk that they may take actions, either within or outside the scope of their duties, that intentionally or unintentionally\ntarnish our brand and reputation or otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, in\n2023 and 2024, we implemented significant reductions in our employee base. Such reductions could negatively impact our ability to\nattract, retain, and motivate employees.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will be able to attract and retain the personnel we need. Our business requires highly skilled personnel,\nincluding executive-level employees, who are in high demand and are often subject to competing offers. Competition for qualified\nemployees and executive-level employees is intense in our industry. We have experienced the turnover of key employees, including\namong the senior management team, and may experience employee and management transitions in future. The loss of qualified\nemployees, or an inability to attract, retain, and motivate employees would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations,\nand financial condition and impair our ability to grow.\nTo attract and retain key personnel, we use various measures, including both cash and equity incentive programs. As we continue to\nmature, the incentives to attract, retain, and motivate employees provided by our programs or by future arrangements may not be\neffective. We have a number of current employees who hold equity in our company. It may be difficult for us to continue to retain and\nmotivate these employees, and the value of their holdings could affect their decisions\n71\nTable of Contents\nabout whether or not they continue to work for us. Our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees may be adversely affected by\ndeclines in our stock price. If we issue significant equity to attract employees or to retain our existing employees, we would incur\nsubstantial additional equity-based compensation expense and the ownership of our existing stockholders would be further diluted.\nWe may face increased personnel costs or labor shortages that could slow our growth and adversely affect our business,\nresults of operations, and financial condition.\nPersonnel costs are a primary component of our operating expenses. If we face labor shortages or increased personnel costs because\nof increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover rates, increases in the federally-mandated or state-mandated\nminimum wage, changes in exempt and non-exempt status, or other employee benefits costs (including costs associated with health\ninsurance coverage or workers’ compensation insurance), our operating expenses could increase and our growth could be adversely\naffected.\nWe have a substantial number of employees who are paid wage rates near, at or based on the applicable federal or state minimum\nwage, including workers who are paid on a piece-work basis, and increases in the applicable minimum wage will increase our personnel\ncosts. As federal, state or other applicable minimum wage and overtime rates increase, we may be required to increase not only the\nwage rates of minimum wage employees, but also the wages paid to our other hourly employees. Additionally, the U.S. Department of\nLabor has recently issued regulations significantly increasing the minimum salary threshold for employees \"exempt\" from receiving\novertime pay, effective January 1, 2025. If challenges to these regulations are not successful and the changes go into effect, they will\nresult in substantial increases in our personnel costs. It may not be possible to increase prices in order to pass future increased\npersonnel costs on to homeowners and guests, in which case our margins would be negatively affected. Even if we are able to increase\nprices to cover increased personnel costs, the higher prices could result in lower revenue, which may also reduce margins. In addition,\nwe face risks related to the costs associated with compliance, or failure to comply with, with varying minimum wage laws.\nWe may face shortages of skilled labor from time to time in the various markets in which we operate. Furthermore, adequate staffing can\nbe particularly challenging during peak season in certain markets, when we are required to hire a large number of seasonal workers in\norder to scale our local operations networks. Shortages of skilled labor may make it increasingly difficult and expensive to attract, train\nand retain the services of a sufficient number of qualified employees, which could adversely affect homeowner and guest satisfaction\nand impair our ability to attract new homeowners and guests and retain our relationships with our existing homeowners and guests.\nFurthermore, competition for qualified employees, particularly in markets where such shortages exist, could require us to pay higher\nwages, which could result in higher personnel costs. Certain Canadian employees of one of our Canadian subsidiaries are under\ncollective bargaining agreements which regulate certain aspects of our employment terms, including compensation, for such individuals.\nAlthough none of our U.S. employees are currently covered under collective bargaining agreements, we cannot guarantee that our U.S.\nemployees will not elect to be represented by labor unions in the future. If a significant number of our employees were to become\nunionized and collective bargaining agreement terms were significantly different from our current compensation arrangements, it could\nincrease our costs and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we are subject to a number of other federal, state, local, and foreign laws regulating employment and employee working\nconditions, including employment dispute and employee bargaining processes, collective and representative actions, and other\nemployment compliance requirements. Compliance with these regulations is costly and requires significant resources, and we may suffer\nlosses from, or incur significant costs to defend, claims alleging non-compliance with these regulations. In addition, immigration reform\ncontinues to attract significant attention in the public arena and the U.S. Congress. If new immigration legislation is enacted, such laws\nmay contain provisions that could increase our costs in recruiting, training and retaining employees.\nAny decline or disruption to the travel and hospitality industries or economic downturn, natural disasters, local and global\npublic health emergencies, geopolitical conflicts, or other catastrophic events or other events outside of our control would\nmaterially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur financial performance is dependent on the strength of the travel and hospitality industries and macroeconomic conditions. Events\nbeyond our control, such as unusual or extreme weather or natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, tsunamis, floods,\nsignificant snow storms, other severe weather, droughts, volcanic eruptions, and pandemics or health epidemics, such as the COVID-19\npandemic, restrictions related to travel, trade or immigration policies, wars or regional hostilities (such as the Ukraine-Russia and Israel-\nHamas conflicts and any escalations thereof), terrorist attacks, political uncertainty, protests, foreign policy changes, systemic financial\nsystem or banking failures, imposition of taxes or surcharges by regulatory authorities, changes in regulations, policies, or conditions\nrelated to sustainability, including climate change, work stoppages, labor unrest or travel-related accidents can disrupt travel globally or\notherwise result in declines in travel demand.\n72\nTable of Contents\nBecause these events or concerns, and the full impact of their effects, are largely unpredictable, they can dramatically and suddenly\naffect travel behavior by consumers, and therefore reduce demand for our platform and services, which would materially adversely affect\nour business, results of operations, and financial condition. Increasing awareness around the impact of air travel on climate change and\nthe impact of over-tourism may also adversely impact the travel and hospitality industries and demand for our platform and services.\nAdditionally, these factors could affect our business infrastructure and the rental homes that we manage. To the extent climate change\ncauses changes in weather patterns, our coastal destinations could experience increases in storm intensity and rising sea levels causing\ndamage to our homeowners’ properties and result in a reduced number of listings in these areas. Short-term, extreme weather patterns,\nsuch as the recent hurricanes in North Carolina and Florida, may also make it unsafe or impractical for guests, or employees or\ncontractors providing home care services, to travel to affected locations, which may, in turn, result in homeowners choosing not to rent\ntheir properties during certain times and reduce the overall number of nights available. Climate change may also affect our business by\nincreasing the cost of, or making unavailable, property insurance on terms our homeowners find acceptable in areas most vulnerable to\nsuch events, increasing operating costs for our homeowners, including the cost of water or energy, and requiring our homeowners to\nexpend funds as they seek to repair and protect their properties in connection with such events. As a result of the foregoing and other\nclimate-related issues, our homeowners may decide to remove their listings from our platform. If we are unable to provide vacation\nrentals for booking in certain areas due to climate change, we may lose both homeowners and guests, which could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur financial performance is also subject to global economic conditions and their impact on levels of discretionary consumer spending.\nSome of the factors that have an impact on discretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions, worldwide or regional\nrecessions, unemployment, consumer debt, reductions in net worth, fluctuations in exchange rates, wage inflation, residential real estate\nand mortgage markets, taxation, energy prices, interest rates, consumer confidence, tariffs, and other macroeconomic factors.\nConsumer preferences tend to shift to lower-cost alternatives during recessionary periods and other periods in which disposable income\nis adversely affected, which could lead to a decline in the bookings and prices for rentals through our platform and an increase in\ncancellations, and thus result in lower revenue. Leisure travel in particular, which accounts for a substantial majority of our current\nbusiness, is dependent on discretionary consumer spending levels. Downturns in worldwide or regional economic conditions, such as\nthe downturn experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, led to a general decrease in leisure travel and travel spending, and similar\ndownturns in the future may materially adversely impact demand for our platform and services. Such a shift in consumer behavior would\nmaterially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nA significant number of the units that we manage are concentrated in certain states and regions, which exposes us to risks\nand potential adverse impacts arising from localized events in those areas.\nCertain states or regions account for a significant percentage of the units that we manage and of our net revenue. For example, units\nlocated in the state of Florida, which has experienced, and may continue to experience, extreme weather (such as the recent Hurricane\nMilton, and its effects), accounted for approximately 20% of our net revenue and our units under management for the nine-month period\nended September 30, 2024 and as of September 30, 2024, respectively. As a result, we may experience material adverse business and\nfinancial impacts arising from localized occurrences in those geographies, such as extreme weather, local real estate market trends or\nstate-wide short-term rental regulations, to the extent they adversely impact the number of units available, the rates at which we are able\nto rent them, and our costs to service and maintain units in those regions.\nThe coverage afforded under our insurance policies may be inadequate for the needs of our business or our third-party\ninsurers may be unable or unwilling to meet our coverage requirements, which could materially and adversely affect our\nbusiness, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance to manage the exposures related to our business operations. We\nsupport our homeowners by maintaining an accommodation protection program. Our business, results of operations, and financial\ncondition would be materially adversely affected if (i) cost per claim, premiums or the number of claims significantly exceeds our\nexpectations; (ii) we experience a claim in excess of our coverage limits; (iii) our insurance providers become insolvent or otherwise fail\nto pay on our insurance claims; (iv) we experience a claim for which coverage is not provided; or (v) the number of claims under our\ndeductibles or self-insured retentions differs from historical averages. Our overall spend on insurance has increased as our business and\nrisk exposure have grown and losses from covered claims have increased. Premiums have increased as a result, and we have\nexperienced and expect to continue to experience increased difficulty in obtaining appropriate policy limits and levels of coverage at a\nreasonable cost and with reasonable terms and conditions. Our\n73\nTable of Contents\ncosts for obtaining these policies will continue to increase as our business grows and risk exposures continue to evolve. Furthermore, as\nour business continues to develop and diversify, we may experience difficulty in obtaining insurance coverage for new and evolving\nofferings and tiers, which could require us to incur greater costs and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and\nfinancial condition. Additionally, if we fail to comply with insurance regulatory requirements in the regions where we operate, or other\nregulations governing insurance coverage, our brand, reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition could be\nmaterially adversely affected.\nAccommodation Protection Program\nAs an additional benefit to our homeowners and in order to comply with certain short-term rental regulatory requirements, we enroll\nhomeowners in our accommodation protection program, which provides protection for claims of guest-caused property damage or guest\nbodily injury arising from the reservation. The accommodation protection program is subject to certain terms, conditions and exclusions,\nand homeowners may opt out of the program, if the homeowner provides documentation of sufficient alternative coverage through their\nhomeowners insurance. Our homeowners may also benefit from protection provided through our distribution partners when bookings of\nVacasa rental homes are made through their platforms.\nHowever, these programs may not provide protection for certain types of claims and may be insufficient to fully cover costs of\ninvestigation, costs of defense, and payments or judgments arising from covered claims. In addition, extensive or costly claims could\nlead to rate increases or difficulty securing coverage, which may result in increased financial exposure and an inability to meet regulatory\nrequirements. Increased claim frequency and severity and increased fraudulent claims could result in greater payouts, premium\nincreases, and/or difficulty securing coverage. Further, disputes with homeowners as to whether a protection program applies to alleged\nlosses or damages and the increased submission of fraudulent payment requests could require significant time and financial resources.\nCorporate Insurance\nWe procure insurance policies to cover various operations-related risks, including general business liability, workers’ compensation,\ncyber liability and data breaches, crime, directors and officers liability, and property insurance. We do not have sufficient coverage for\ncertain catastrophic events, including certain business interruption losses, such as those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAdditionally, certain policies may not be available to us and the policies we have and obtain in the future may not be sufficient to cover all\nof our business exposure.\nRisks Related to Accounting, Tax and Financial Statement Matters\nA future impairment of our long-lived assets or goodwill could adversely affect our results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nWe evaluate our long-lived assets or asset groups for indicators of possible impairment by comparing the carrying amount to future net\nundiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by such asset or asset group and its eventual disposal when events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of the long-lived\nasset or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying\nvalue exceeds its fair value. We review goodwill for impairment by initially considering qualitative factors to determine whether it is more\nlikely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, as a basis for determining\nwhether it is necessary to perform a quantitative analysis. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the\nreporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative analysis is performed to identify goodwill impairment.\nPotential indicators of impairment include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results, significant negative\nindustry or economic trends, or a significant decline in the Company's stock price and/or market capitalization for a sustained period of\ntime. If one or more of these impairment indicators occur or intensify, this could result in an impairment of long-lived assets or further\nimpairment of goodwill. The Company performed a quantitative impairment assessment as of September 30, 2023, which resulted in\nlong-lived asset and goodwill impairment charges of $46.0 million and $411.0 million,\n74\nTable of Contents\nrespectively. Additionally, the Company performed a quantitative impairment assessment as of March 31, 2024, which resulted in long-\nlived asset impairment charges of $84.0 million. No material impairment charges were taken as of September 30, 2024.\nFuture impairment of our long-lived assets or goodwill could be material and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nWe may experience significant fluctuations in our results of operations from quarter to quarter and year to year as a result of\nseasonality and other factors, which make it difficult to forecast our future results.\nOur results of operations may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year and are not an indication of our future\nperformance. Our overall business is seasonal, reflecting typical travel behavior patterns over the course of the calendar year. In\naddition, each market where we operate has unique seasonality, events, and weather that can increase or decrease demand for our\nofferings. Certain holidays can have an impact on our revenue by increasing Nights Sold on the holiday itself or during the preceding and\nsubsequent weekends. Typically, our second and third quarters have higher revenue due to increased Nights Sold. Our GBV typically\nfollows the seasonality patterns of Nights Sold. Our operations and support costs also increase in the second and third quarters as we\nincrease our hourly staffing to handle increased activity on our platform in those periods. Our business is also subject to fluctuations in\navailable working capital. Our cash and working capital tends to be highest in the second quarter and lowest in the fourth quarter of the\nyear. Fluctuations or changes in these seasonal patterns may adversely affect our financial results and business condition, including our\nposition. On May 8, 2024, we drew $81.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility, and on August 7, 2024, we issued $30.0 million of\nConvertible Notes, to supplement our cash position. If our working capital reserves are inadequate, we may be required to seek\nadditional sources of capital, which may not be available or may come with undesirable terms. In such event, our ability to support our\nbusiness and return our operations to growth, respond to business challenges and opportunities, and execute our growth strategy would\nbe significantly limited, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected.\nAs our business matures, other seasonal trends may develop, or these existing seasonal trends may become more extreme. In addition\nto seasonality, our results of operations may fluctuate as a result of a variety of other factors, many of which are beyond our control, may\nbe difficult to predict, and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business, including:\n• reduced travel and cancellations due to other events beyond our control, such as the COVID-19 pandemic or other epidemics,\nincreased or continuing restrictions on travel and immigration, trade disputes, economic downturns, significant labor shortages,\npolitical, civil or social unrest, armed hostilities and the impact of climate on travel (including fires, floods, severe weather and\nother natural disasters) or law enforcement demands and other regulatory actions;\n• periods with increased investments in our platform for existing offerings, new offerings and initiatives, marketing, and the\naccompanying growth in headcount;\n• the impacts of the Reorganization and our ability to execute on this plan;\n• our ability to grow our business and effectively manage that growth;\n• increased competition;\n• our ability to expand our operations in new and existing regions;\n• changes in governmental or other regulations affecting our business;\n• changes to our internal policies or strategies;\n• harm to our brand or reputation; and\n• other risks described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and the 2023 Annual Report.\nAs a result, it may be more difficult to accurately forecast our results of operations and, if our forecasts are not accurate, we may fail to\nmeet the expectations of investors and securities analysts, which could cause the trading price of our Class A Common Stock to fall\nsubstantially and potentially subject us to costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits. Moreover, we base our expense levels\nand investment plans on estimates for revenue that may turn out to be inaccurate. A significant portion of our expenses and investments\nare fixed, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our revenue is less than expected or if costs are higher than\nexpected, resulting in losses that exceed our expectations. If our assumptions regarding the risks and uncertainties that we use to plan\nour business are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our results of operations could differ materially\nfrom our expectations and our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe track certain operational metrics, which are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived\ninaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and materially adversely affect our stock price, business, results of\noperations, and financial condition.\nWe track certain operational metrics, including metrics such as GBV, Nights Sold, and GBV per Night Sold, which may differ from\nestimates or similar metrics published by third parties due to differences in sources, methodologies, or the assumptions on\n75\nTable of Contents\nwhich we rely. Our internal systems and tools are subject to a number of limitations, and our methodologies for tracking these and other\nmetrics may change over time, which could result in unexpected changes to our metrics, including the those we publicly disclose. If the\ninternal systems and tools we use to track these metrics undercount or overcount performance or contain algorithmic or other technical\nerrors, the data we report may not be accurate. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our\nmetrics for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring how our platform is used across\npopulations globally. The calculation of GBV and Nights Sold requires the ongoing collection of data on new offerings that are added to\nour platform over time. Our business is complex, and the methodology used to calculate GBV and Nights Sold may require future\nadjustments to accurately represent the full value of new offerings.\nLimitations or errors with respect to how we measure data or with respect to the data that we measure may affect our understanding of\ncertain details of our business, which could affect our long-term strategies. If our operational metrics are not accurate representations of\nour business, or if investors do not perceive these metrics to be accurate, or if we discover material inaccuracies with respect to these\nfigures, our reputation may be significantly harmed, our stock price could decline, we may be subject to stockholder litigation, and our\nbusiness, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nBecause we recognize revenue during the guest stay and not at booking, upticks or downturns in bookings are not\nimmediately reflected in our results of operations.\nWe experience a difference in timing between when a booking is made and when we recognize revenue, which is at the time of the stay.\nThe effect of significant downturns in bookings in a particular quarter may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future\nperiods because of this timing in revenue recognition. We have issued, and may continue to issue, future stay credits to guests who\nchoose to cancel within our enhanced cancellation policy. Such future stay credits are recognized as a liability on our consolidated\nbalance sheets. Alternatively, in certain instances, we may offer a refund in lieu of a future stay credit. We account for these refunds as\nvariable consideration, which results in a reduction to revenue.\nOur failure to properly manage funds held on behalf of customers could materially adversely affect our business, results of\noperations, and financial condition.\nWhen a guest books and pays for a stay on our platform, we do not recognize the amount the guest has paid until the stay occurs, at\nwhich time we recognize our commission and fees as revenue and (other than in certain locations in which the homeowner is paid upon\nbooking) initiate the process to remit the payment to the homeowner, which occurs monthly following the stay, barring any alterations or\ncancellations which may result in funds being returned to the guest. Accordingly, at any given time, we hold on behalf of our homeowners\nand guests a substantial amount of funds, which are generally held in bank deposit accounts and in U.S. treasury bills and recorded on\nour consolidated balance sheets as funds receivable and amounts held on behalf of customers. In certain jurisdictions, we are required\nto either safeguard customer funds in bankruptcy-remote bank accounts, or hold such funds in eligible liquid assets, as defined by the\nrelevant regulators in such jurisdictions, equal to at least 100% of the aggregate amount held on behalf of customers. Our ability to\nmanage and account accurately for the cash underlying our customer funds, and comply with related trust-accounting regulations\nrequires a high level of operational and internal controls. As our business continues to grow and we expand our offerings and tiers, we\nmust continue to strengthen our associated internal controls. Our success requires significant public confidence in our ability to handle\nlarge and growing transaction volumes and amounts of customer funds. Any failure to maintain the necessary controls or to manage the\nassets underlying our customer funds accurately could result in reputational harm, lead customers to discontinue or reduce their use of\nour platform and services, and result in significant penalties and fines from regulators, each of which could materially adversely affect our\nbusiness, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe rely on third-party payment service providers to process payments made by guests and certain payments made to\nhomeowners on our platform. If these third-party payment service providers become unavailable or we are subject to\nincreased fees, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe rely on a number of third-party payment service providers, including payment card networks, banks, payment processors, and\npayment gateways, to link us to payment card and bank clearing networks to process payments made by our guests and to\n76\nTable of Contents\nremit payments to homeowners on our platform. We have agreements with these providers, some of which are the sole providers we rely\non for their particular service.\nIf these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us on acceptable terms or at all, our business may be\ndisrupted, we would need to find alternate payment service providers, and we may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such\npayment service providers in an acceptable time frame.\nIf we are forced to migrate to other third-party payment service providers for any reason, the transition would require significant time and\nmanagement resources, and may not be as effective, efficient, or well-received by our homeowners and guests. Any of the foregoing\ncould cause us to incur significant losses and, in certain cases, require us to make payments to homeowners out of our funds, which\ncould materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIn addition, the software and services provided by our third-party payment service providers may fail to meet our expectations, contain\nerrors or vulnerabilities, be compromised, or experience outages. Any of these risks could cause us reputational harm or cause us to\nlose our ability to accept online payments or other payment transactions or make timely payments to homeowners on our platform, which\ncould make our platform less convenient and desirable to customers and adversely affect our ability to attract and retain homeowners\nand guests.\nMoreover, our agreements with payment service providers allow, and in the future may allow, these companies, under certain conditions,\nto hold an amount of our cash as a reserve. They may be entitled to a reserve or suspension of processing services upon the occurrence\nof specified events, including material adverse changes in our business, results of operations, and financial condition. An imposition of\nadditional reserves or a suspension of processing services by one or more of our processing companies could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIf we fail to invest adequate resources into the payment processing infrastructure on our platform, or if our investment efforts are\nunsuccessful or unreliable, our payments activities may not function properly or keep pace with competitive offerings, which could\nadversely impact their usage. Further, our ability to expand our payments activities into additional countries is dependent upon the third-\nparty providers we use to support these activities. If we expand the availability of our payments activities to additional geographic regions\nor begin to offer new payment methods to our homeowners and guests in the future, we may become subject to additional regulations\nand compliance requirements, and exposed to heightened fraud risk, which could lead to an increase in our operating expenses.\nFor certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, and such fees result in significant\ncosts. Payment card network costs have increased, and may continue to increase in the future, the interchange fees and assessments\nthat they charge for each transaction that accesses their networks, and may impose special fees or assessments on any such\ntransaction. Our payment card processors have the right to pass any increases in interchange fees and assessments on to us. Credit\ncard transactions result in higher fees to us than transactions made through debit cards. Any material increase in interchange fees in the\nUnited States or other geographic regions, including as a result of changes in interchange fee limitations imposed by law in some\ngeographic regions, or other network fees or assessments, or a shift from payment with debit cards to credit cards could increase our\noperating costs and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe are subject to payment network rules and any material modification of our payment card acceptance privileges could have\na material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe loss of our credit and debit card acceptance privileges or the significant modification of the terms under which we obtain card\nacceptance privileges would significantly limit our business model since a vast majority of our guests pay using credit or debit cards. We\nare required by our payment processors to comply with payment card network operating rules, including the Payment Card Industry\n(\"PCI\") Data Security Standard (the \"PCI DSS\"). Under the PCI DSS, we are required to adopt and implement internal controls over the\nuse, storage, and transmission of card data to help prevent credit card fraud. If we fail to comply with the rules and regulations adopted\nby the payment card networks, including the PCI DSS, we would be in breach of our contractual obligations to payment processors and\nmerchant banks. Such failure to comply may damage our relationship with payment card networks, subject us to restrictions, fines,\npenalties, damages, and civil liability, and could eventually prevent us from processing or accepting payment cards, which would have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nMoreover, the payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or reinterpret existing rules that we or our payment\nprocessors might find difficult or even impossible to comply with, or costly to implement. As a result, we could lose our ability to give\nconsumers the option of using payment cards to make their payments or the choice of currency in which they\n77\nTable of Contents\nwould like their payment card to be charged. Further, there is no guarantee that, even if we comply with the rules and regulations\nadopted by the payment card networks, we will be able to maintain our payment card acceptance privileges. We also cannot guarantee\nthat our compliance with network rules or the PCI DSS will prevent illegal or improper use of our payments platform or the theft, loss, or\nmisuse of the credit or debit card data of customers or participants, or a security breach. We are also required to submit to periodic\naudits, self-assessments, and other assessments of our compliance with the PCI DSS. If an audit, self-assessment, or other assessment\nindicates that we need to take steps to remediate any deficiencies, such remediation efforts may distract our management team and\nrequire us to undertake costly and time-consuming remediation efforts, and we could lose our payment card acceptance privileges.\nWe are also subject to network operating rules and guidelines promulgated by the National Automated Clearing House Association\n(\"NACHA\") relating to payment transactions we process using the Automated Clearing House (\"ACH\") Network. Like the payment\nnetworks, NACHA may update its operating rules and guidelines at any time, which can require us to take more costly compliance\nmeasures or to develop more complex monitoring systems.\nUncertainty in the application of taxes to our homeowners, guests, or platform could increase our tax liabilities and may\ndiscourage homeowners and guests from conducting business on our platform.\nWe are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the United States (federal, state, and local) and several foreign\njurisdictions. New or revised foreign, federal, state, or local tax regulations may subject us or our homeowners and guests to additional\nindirect taxes, such as lodging, hotel, sales and use, privilege, excise, VAT, goods and services, harmonized sales, business, and gross\nreceipt (together, “indirect taxes”), income, and other taxes, and, depending upon the jurisdiction, could subject us or our homeowners\nand guests to significant monetary penalties and fines for non-payment of taxes. Any additional tax expenses and other liabilities to\nwhich we or our homeowners and/or guests are subject would likely increase the cost of doing business for our homeowners, increase\nthe price paid by guests, and may discourage homeowners and guests from using our platform, which could lead to a decline in revenue.\nAs a result, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by additional taxes of this\nnature or additional taxes or penalties resulting from our failure to comply with any reporting, collection, and payment obligations. We\naccrue a reserve for such taxes, and upon examination or audit, such reserves may be insufficient. We are currently subject to tax audit\nin several states and local jurisdictions.\nThe application of taxes, particularly indirect taxes, to activities such as ours and to our homeowners and guests is a complex and\nevolving issue. Laws and regulations relating to taxes as applied to our platform, and to our homeowners and guests, vary greatly among\njurisdictions, and it is difficult or impossible to predict how such laws and regulations will be applied. We devote significant resources,\nincluding management time, to the application and interpretation of tax laws and working with various jurisdictions to clarify whether\ntaxes are applicable and the amount of taxes that apply. The application of indirect taxes to our homeowners, guests, and our platform\nsignificantly increases our operational expenses as we build the infrastructure and tools to capture data and to report, collect, and remit\ntaxes. The lack of uniformity in the laws and regulations relating to indirect taxes as applied further increases the operational and\nfinancial complexity of our systems and processes, and introduces potential for errors or incorrect tax calculations, all of which are costly\nto our business and results of operations. In addition, certain regulations may be so complex as to make it infeasible for us to be fully\ncompliant. As our business operations expand or change, including as a result of introducing new or enhanced offerings, tiers or\nfeatures, or due to acquisitions, the application of indirect taxes to our business and to our homeowners and guests will further change\nand evolve, and could further increase our liability for taxes, discourage homeowners and guests from using our platform, and materially\nadversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nThe application of domestic and international income and non-income tax laws, rules and regulations to our business is subject to\ninterpretation by the relevant taxing authorities. Given a focus on revenue generation, taxing authorities have become more aggressive\nin their enforcement of such laws, rules and regulations, resulting in increased audit activity and audit assessments, and legislation.\nWe are subject to regular review and audit by U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign tax authorities. As such, potential tax liabilities may\nexceed our current tax reserves or may require us to modify our business practices and incur additional cost to comply, any of which\nmay have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management, and\nthere are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our provision for income\n78\nTable of Contents\ntaxes is also determined by the manner in which we operate our business, and any changes to such operations or laws applicable to\nsuch operations may affect our effective tax rate.\nOur tax positions or tax returns are subject to change, and therefore we cannot accurately predict whether we may incur material\nadditional tax liabilities in the future, which would materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe tax regimes we are subject to or operate under, including income and non-income (including indirect) taxes, are unsettled and may\nbe subject to significant change. Changes in tax laws or tax rulings, or changes in interpretations of existing laws, could materially\nadversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and\nDevelopment (\"OECD\") has announced an accord commonly referred to as “Pillar Two” to set a minimum global corporate tax rate of\n15%, which has been, is being or may be implemented in many jurisdictions. The OECD is also issuing guidelines that are different, in\nsome respects, than current international tax principles. If countries amend their tax laws to adopt all or part of the OECD guidelines, this\nmay increase tax uncertainty and increase taxes applicable to us. We cannot predict whether the U.S. Congress or any other\ngovernmental body, whether in the United States or in other jurisdictions, will enact new tax legislation (including increases to tax rates),\nwhether the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or any other tax authority will issue new regulations or other guidance, whether the OECD or\nany other intergovernmental organization will publish any guidelines on global taxation or whether member states will implement such\nguidelines, nor can we predict what effect such legislation, regulations, or international guidelines might have. However, changes to\nexisting laws and regulations could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIn addition, we are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the United States (federal, state, and local) and\nnumerous foreign jurisdictions. A number of jurisdictions have proposed or implemented new tax laws or interpreted existing laws to\nexplicitly apply various taxes to businesses like ours, and are increasing their enforcement actions with respect to such laws. Laws and\nregulations relating to taxes vary greatly among jurisdictions, and it is difficult or impossible to predict how such laws and regulations will\nbe applied. The application of indirect taxes to activities such as ours is a complex and evolving issue, and responding to tax audits and\nother tax-related inquiries can be time consuming and expensive.\nWe may recognize additional tax expenses and be subject to additional tax liabilities, and our business, results of operations, and\nfinancial condition could be materially adversely affected by additional taxes of this nature or additional taxes or penalties resulting from\nour failure to comply with any reporting, collection, and payment obligations. We accrue a reserve for such taxes when the likelihood is\nprobable that such taxes apply to us, and upon examination or audit, such reserves may be insufficient. Additional taxes imposed in\nconnection with our business could have the effect of increasing the prices paid by guests and could discourage guests from using our\nproperties, and lead to a decline in revenue, and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nWe expect to have material net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. As of December 31, 2023,\nour federal net operating loss carryforwards were approximately $218.6 million. Realization of tax savings from these net operating loss\ncarryforwards will depend on our future taxable income, and there is a risk that some of our existing carryforwards could expire unused\nand be unavailable to offset future taxable income, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial\ncondition. In addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"), if a corporation\nundergoes an “ownership change,” generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership by significant\nstockholders or groups of stockholders over a three-year period, the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss\ncarryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes, to offset its post-change taxable income or tax liabilities may be limited. Similar rules\nmay apply under state tax laws. We expect that our net operating losses will be subject to limitations under these rules, and we may\nexperience ownership changes in the future because of shifts in our stock ownership, many of which may be outside of our control. Our\nability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset future U.S. federal taxable income may be\nsubject to limitations, which could result in increased future tax liability to us. In addition, tax benefits that we derive from certain tax\nattributes, including net operating losses, that are allocable to us as a result of the transactions undertaken in connection with the\n79\nTable of Contents\nBusiness Combination (as defined below) are subject to the terms of, and may give rise to payments that we will be required to make\nunder, the Tax Receivable Agreement (as defined below).\nWe are a holding company and our principal asset is our indirect equity interests in OpCo and, accordingly, we are dependent\nupon distributions from OpCo to pay taxes and other expenses.\nWe are a holding company and our principal asset is our 57.7% indirect ownership of Vacasa Holdings LLC (\"OpCo\"). We have no\nindependent means of generating material revenue. As the initial sole manager of OpCo, we generally intend to cause OpCo to make\ndistributions to its equity holders in amounts sufficient to cover the taxes on their allocable share of the taxable income of OpCo,\nincluding for this purpose, any payments we are obligated to make under the Tax Receivable Agreement (as defined below) and other\ncosts or expenses, but we may be limited in our ability to cause OpCo to make distributions to its equity holders (including for purposes\nof paying corporate and other overhead expenses and dividends) by our contractual arrangements, including the terms of our Revolving\nCredit Facility and any additional debt facilities that we may enter into in the future. In addition, certain laws and regulations may result in\nrestrictions on OpCo’s ability to make distributions to Vacasa, Inc., or the ability of OpCo’s subsidiaries to make distributions to it.\nTo the extent that we need funds and OpCo or its subsidiaries are restricted from making such distributions, under applicable law or\nregulation or otherwise, we may not be able to obtain such funds on terms acceptable to us or at all and, as a result, could suffer an\nadverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition. In certain situations, including where OpCo does not have sufficient cash to make\ntax distributions to all of its members in the full amounts that may be payable in connection with the Fourth Amended and Restated\nLimited Liability Company Agreement of OpCo (the \"OpCo LLC Agreement\") (or where tax distributions to the members of OpCo would\nmaterially exceed a set percentage of our aggregate taxable income), tax distributions to the equity holders of OpCo may be reduced\n(such that each member of OpCo may not receive tax distributions sufficient to cover its tax liability). Tax distributions will generally be\ntreated as advances of other distributions made under the OpCo LLC Agreement.\nAlthough OpCo may not always make such distributions, under the OpCo LLC Agreement, we generally expect OpCo, from time to time,\nto make distributions in cash to its equity holders in amounts sufficient to cover the taxes on their allocable share of the taxable income\nof OpCo (in addition, Vacasa, Inc. may receive certain non-pro rata distributions from OpCo to cover certain overhead and other\nexpenses, as provided in the OpCo LLC Agreement). As a result of (i) potential differences in the amount of net taxable income indirectly\nallocable to us and to OpCo’s other equity holders, (ii) the lower tax rate applicable to corporations as opposed to the assumed tax rate\nfor making such distributions in the OpCo LLC Agreement, (iii) the favorable tax benefits that we anticipate from Vacasa, Inc.’s\nacquisition of common units of OpCo (\"OpCo Units\"), in exchange for, at our election, either cash (based on the market price of a share\nof our Class A Common Stock) or shares of our Class A Common Stock and payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement and (iv) the\nfact that tax distributions made in respect of OpCo Units will generally be made pro rata in respect of such Units as described in the\nOpCo LLC Agreement, we expect that these tax distributions may be in amounts that exceed our tax liabilities. Our Board will determine\nthe appropriate uses for any excess cash so accumulated, which may include, among other uses, the payment of obligations under the\nTax Receivable Agreement and the payment of other expenses. We will have no obligation to distribute such cash (or other available\ncash) to our stockholders. No adjustments to the exchange ratio for OpCo Units will be made as a result of any cash distribution by us or\nany retention of cash by us. To the extent we do not distribute such cash as dividends on our Class A Common Stock and instead, for\nexample, hold such cash balances, or lend them to OpCo, this may result in shares of our Class A Common Stock increasing in value\nrelative to the value of OpCo Units. The holders of OpCo Units (the \"OpCo Unitholders\") may benefit from any value attributable to such\ncash balances if they acquire shares of our Class A Common Stock in exchange for their OpCo Units. In addition, our payment of tax\ndistributions to the members of OpCo could result in the distribution of cash out of OpCo that is in excess of what is required for such\nmembers (or their direct or indirect equity holders) to pay their tax liabilities attributable to their direct or indirect ownership of OpCo,\nwhich could have an adverse effect on our liquidity.\nWe may incur certain tax liabilities attributable to the Blockers as a result of the Business Combination.\nOn December 6, 2021, we consummated the business combination (the \"Business Combination\") contemplated by that certain business\ncombination agreement, dated as of July 28, 2021 (as amended, the \"Business Combination Agreement\"), by and among TPG Pace,\nVacasa Holdings, Turnkey Vacations, Inc., a Vacasa Holdings equity holder (\"TK Newco\"), certain other Vacasa Holdings equity holders\n(together with TK Newco, the \"Blockers\"), us, and certain other parties, pursuant to which, among other things, TPG Pace merged with\nand into us, following which the separate corporate existence of TPG Pace ceased, and we became the surviving corporation. As the\nsuccessor to these merged entities, Vacasa, Inc. has generally succeeded to and is responsible for any outstanding or historical tax\nliabilities of the merged entities, including any liabilities that might be incurred as a result of the mergers described in the previous\nsentence. The pre-Business Combination owners of the Blockers will not\n80\nTable of Contents\nindemnify Vacasa, Inc. for any such liabilities, and such liabilities could have an adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.\nWe may bear certain tax liabilities that are attributable to audit adjustments for taxable periods (or portions thereof) ending\nprior to the Business Combination, or that are disproportionate to our ownership interest in OpCo in the taxable period for\nwhich the relevant adjustment is imposed.\nPursuant to certain provisions of the Code enacted as part of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (such provisions, the “Partnership Tax\nAudit Rules”), partnerships (and not the partners of the partnerships) can be liable for U.S. federal income taxes (and any related interest\nand penalties) resulting from adjustments made pursuant to an IRS audit or judicial proceedings to the items of income, gain, loss,\ndeduction, or credit shown on the partnership’s tax return (or how such items are allocated among the partners), notwithstanding the fact\nthat liability for taxes on partnership income is generally borne by the partners rather than the partnership.\nUnder the Partnership Tax Audit Rules, a partnership’s liability for taxes resulting from adjustments made pursuant to an IRS audit or\njudicial proceedings may be reduced or avoided in certain circumstances depending on the status or actions of its partners. For example,\nif partners agree to amend their tax returns and pay the resulting taxes, the partnership’s liability can be reduced. Partnerships also may\nbe able to make elections to “push out” the tax liability resulting from the adjustment to the persons who were partners in the prior\ntaxable year that is the subject of the adjustment, and, as a result, avoid having the relevant liability paid at the partnership-level and\ninstead be borne by the persons who are partners at the time the relevant liability is paid.\nA representative of the holders of Vacasa Holdings' equity prior to the Business Combination (including, for this purpose, the owners of\nthe Blockers with respect to their indirect interest in Vacasa Holdings equity and the holders of vested Vacasa Holdings unit appreciation\nrights and the holders of vested options to purchase shares of TK Newco common stock) existing prior to the Business Combination (the\n\"Existing VH Holders\") will be entitled to direct whether or not OpCo or its subsidiaries will make the “push out” election described above\nfor adjustments attributable to taxable periods (or portions thereof) ending on or prior to the date of the Business Combination, and\nwhether any such entity will pay any applicable liability at the entity level. The provisions of the OpCo LLC Agreement prohibit OpCo from\nseeking indemnification or other recoveries from the Existing VH Holders in respect of such liabilities. With respect to the\nrepresentative’s exercise of this authority, its interests will generally differ from the interests of our other equity holders. Moreover, with\nrespect to taxable periods beginning after the Business Combination, there is no requirement that OpCo or any of its subsidiaries make\nany “push out” election. We accordingly may be required to bear a share of any taxes, interest, or penalties associated with any\nadjustments to applicable tax returns that exceeds our proportionate share of such liabilities based on our ownership interest in OpCo in\nthe taxable period for which such adjustments are imposed (including periods prior to the effective date of the Business Combination\nduring which we had no interest in OpCo), which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nVacasa, Inc. will be required to pay the TRA Parties for certain tax benefits it may claim (or is deemed to realize) in the future,\nand the amounts it may pay could be significant.\nIn connection with the Business Combination, Vacasa, Inc. acquired existing equity interests from certain Existing VH Holders in\nexchange for the issuance of shares of Class A Common Stock and rights to receive payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement (as\ndefined below). As a result of these acquisitions, Vacasa, Inc. has succeeded to certain tax attributes of the Blockers and will receive the\nbenefit of tax basis in assets of OpCo and its subsidiaries. In addition, redemptions or exchanges of OpCo Units in exchange for shares\nof our Class A Common Stock or cash may produce favorable tax attributes that would not be available to Vacasa, Inc. in the absence of\nsuch redemptions or exchanges. Such transactions are also expected to result in increases in Vacasa, Inc.’s allocable share of the tax\nbasis in OpCo’s tangible and intangible assets. These increases in tax basis may increase (for income tax purposes) depreciation and\namortization deductions and therefore reduce the amount of income or franchise tax that Vacasa, Inc. would otherwise be required to\npay in the future had such sales and exchanges never occurred.\nWe have entered into the tax receivable agreement (the \"Tax Receivable Agreement\") with the Existing VH Holders (other than the\nholders of Vacasa Holdings unit appreciation rights and other than holders of options to purchase shares of TK Newco common stock,\nbut including, for this purpose, current and former members of management that hold interests in Vacasa Holdings indirectly through a\nmanagement holding vehicle), which we refer to in this Quarterly Report collectively as the “TRA Parties,” that provides for the payment\nby Vacasa, Inc. to such TRA Parties (or their transferees or assignees) of 85% of the net cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and\nlocal income tax or franchise tax that Vacasa, Inc. realizes (determined by using certain assumptions) in periods after the Business\nCombination as a result of (i) certain increases in tax basis that occur as a result of (A) any acquisition of OpCo Units from certain\nExisting VH Holders in the Business Combination, (B) exercises of the redemption rights under the OpCo LLC Agreement (the\n\"Redemption Rights\") by certain OpCo Unitholders to exchange their\n81\nTable of Contents\nOpCo Units for shares of Class A Common Stock of or cash, and (C) payments made under the Tax Receivable Agreement; (ii) any net\noperating losses or certain other tax attributes that become available to Vacasa, Inc. to offset income or gain realized after the Blocker\nMergers; (iii) any existing tax basis associated with assets of OpCo or its subsidiaries, the benefit of which is allocable to Vacasa, Inc. as\na result of the exchanges of OpCo Units for Class A Common Stock of Vacasa, Inc. or cash; and (iv) tax benefits related to imputed\ninterest deemed to be paid by Vacasa, Inc. as a result of any payments that Vacasa, Inc. makes under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nThe Tax Receivable Agreement makes certain simplifying assumptions regarding the determination of the cash savings that Vacasa, Inc.\nrealizes or is deemed to realize from the covered tax attributes, which may result in payments pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement\nin excess of those that would result if such assumptions were not made.\nThe actual tax benefit, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, will vary depending\nupon a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the timing of the redemptions of OpCo Units, the price of Class A Common Stock\nat the time of each redemption, the extent to which such redemptions are taxable transactions, the amount of tax basis associated with\nOpCo Units of the redeeming holder at the time of the relevant redemption, the depreciation and amortization periods that apply to the\ntax basis covered by the Tax Receivable Agreement, the amount, character, and timing of taxable income Vacasa, Inc. generates in the\nfuture, the timing and amount of any earlier payments that Vacasa, Inc. may have made under the Tax Receivable Agreement, the\nincome tax rates then applicable to Vacasa, Inc., and the portion of Vacasa, Inc.’s payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement that\nconstitute imputed interest or give rise to depreciable or amortizable tax basis. The payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement are\nnot conditioned upon any TRA Party continuing to own an equity interest in us. To the extent that we are not able to make payments\nunder the Tax Receivable Agreement when due, then (subject to the other provisions of the Tax Receivable Agreement, including those\ndescribed below regarding the potential acceleration of obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement) such payments will generally\naccrue interest until paid.\nIn addition, the TRA Parties (or their transferees or assignees) will not reimburse Vacasa, Inc. for any payments previously made if any\ncovered tax benefits are subsequently disallowed, except that any excess payments made to any TRA Party (or its transferees or\nassignees) will be netted against future payments that would otherwise be made under the Tax Receivable Agreement, if any, after the\ndetermination of such excess. Vacasa, Inc. could make payments to the TRA Parties under the Tax Receivable Agreement that are\ngreater than its actual cash tax savings and may not be able to recoup those payments, which could negatively impact its liquidity.\nFinally, the Tax Receivable Agreement provides that, in the case of a change in control (as defined in the Tax Receivable Agreement),\nthe Tax Receivable Agreement will automatically terminate, and in the case of a material breach of Vacasa, Inc.’s obligations under the\nTax Receivable Agreement and certain other events, Vacasa, Inc. may be required to make a payment to the TRA Parties in an amount\nequal to the present value of future payments (calculated using a discount rate equal to the lesser of 6.50% and a benchmark floating\ninterest rate plus 150 basis points, which may differ from our, or a potential acquirer’s, then-current cost of capital) under the Tax\nReceivable Agreement, which payment would be based on certain assumptions, including those relating to Vacasa, Inc.’s future taxable\nincome. In these situations, Vacasa, Inc.’s obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement could have a substantial negative impact on\nits, or a potential acquirer’s, liquidity and could have the effect of delaying, deferring, modifying, or preventing certain mergers, asset\nsales, other forms of business combinations, or other changes of control. These provisions of the Tax Receivable Agreement may result\nin situations where the TRA Parties have interests that differ from or are in addition to those of our other stockholders. In addition,\nVacasa, Inc. could be required to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement that are due in advance of any actual realization\nof such further tax benefits, that are in excess of Vacasa, Inc.’s (or a potential acquirer’s) actual cash tax savings, and which could\nnegatively impact our liquidity.\nRisks Related to Information Technology, Data Security and Data Privacy\nIf we fail to comply with federal, state, and foreign laws relating to privacy and data protection, we may face potentially\nsignificant liability, negative publicity, an erosion of trust, and increased regulatory scrutiny, any of which could materially\nadversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nPrivacy and data protection laws, rules, and regulations are complex, and their interpretation is rapidly evolving, making implementation\nand enforcement, and thus compliance requirements, ambiguous, uncertain, and potentially inconsistent. Compliance with such laws\nmay require changes to our data collection, use, transfer, disclosure, other processing, and certain other related business practices and\nmay thereby increase compliance costs or have other material adverse effects on our business. We receive, store, handle, transmit, use\nand otherwise process business information and information related to individuals, including from and about actual and prospective\ncustomers, as well as our employees and service providers. As part of homeowner and guest registration and business processes, we\nmay collect and use personal data, such as names, dates of birth, email addresses, phone numbers, and, in some cases, identity\nverification information (for example, government-issued\n82\nTable of Contents\nidentification or passport information), as well as payment card or other financial information that homeowners and guests provide to us\nfor such purposes. The laws of many states and countries require businesses which maintain such personal data to implement\nreasonable security measures to keep such information secure and otherwise restrict the ways in which such information can be\ncollected, processed, disclosed, transferred and used.\nNumerous states have enacted or are in the process of enacting state-level data privacy laws and regulations governing the collection,\nuse, and processing of state residents’ personal data. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act provides rights to California\nresidents related to their personal information, places limitations on data uses, creates new audit requirements for higher risk data, and\nestablishes a regulatory agency dedicated to enforcement. Similar laws have taken effect in or will take effect in the future in other\nstates. The effects of these laws, and the enactment of any other state or federal privacy laws, are and will continue to be significant and\nmay require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and may thereby increase compliance costs (and our potential\nliability) or have other material adverse effects on our business.\nAs of March 31, 2021, or shortly thereafter, we ceased all property management operations in the EU. Further, we ceased all direct\nmarketing and advertising campaigns directed at EU audiences, stopped offering EU currency and language customization options on\nour website, and stopped offering all EU member state dedicated addresses and phone numbers that an EU resident could use to\ncontact us. We therefore take the position that we no longer target the EU market. To the extent we have employees and offices in the\nEU, or are otherwise subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (the \"GDPR\"), we remain obligated to handle and safeguard all\npersonal data collected from EU residents in accordance with the GDPR for as long as we retain such personal data. This obligation\nextends to compliance with laws, rules, and regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data. Failure to comply with the\nGDPR may result in fines of up to 20 million Euros or up to 4% of the annual global revenue of the infringer, whichever is greater. It may\nalso lead to civil litigation, with the risks of damages or injunctive relief, or regulatory orders adversely impacting the ways in which our\nbusiness can use personal data. To the extent we send direct electronic marketing communications to EU residents and/or place cookies\non electronic devices used by EU or UK residents within the EU/UK, we may also be subject to evolving EU and UK privacy laws on\ncookies and e-marketing. Canada also maintains data privacy legislation, which may lead to additional costs and increase our overall\nrisk exposure.\nFurther, we are subject to the PCI DSS, which is a standard designed to protect credit and debit card data as mandated by payment card\nindustry entities. As a ‘level 2’ vendor, we self-attest to PCI compliance. We perform certain internal compliance activities and also rely\non vendors to manage PCI compliance. Despite our compliance efforts, we may become subject to claims that we have violated the PCI\nDSS based on past, present, and future business practices. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with the PCI DSS can subject us to\nfines, termination of banking relationships, and increased transaction fees.\nIf any jurisdiction in which we operate adopts new laws or changes its interpretation of its laws, rules, or regulations relating to data\nresidency or localization such that we are unable to comply in a timely manner or at all, we could risk losing our rights to operate in such\njurisdictions. The GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations around the world expose us to the possibility of material penalties,\nsignificant legal liability, changes in how we operate or offer our products, and interruptions or cessation of our ability to operate in key\ngeographic regions, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nAny failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, and regulations could result\nin investigations or enforcement proceedings or private actions against us by individuals (including class actions), consumer rights\ngroups, government agencies, or others. We could incur significant costs in investigating and defending such claims and, if found liable,\npay significant damages or fines or be required to make costly changes to our business. Further, these proceedings and any subsequent\nadverse outcomes may subject us to significant negative publicity and an erosion of trust. If any of these events were to occur, our\nbusiness, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nIf we or our third-party service providers experience cyberattacks, data security breaches, or other security incidents, there\nmay be damage to our brand and reputation, material financial penalties, and legal liability, along with a decline in use of our\nplatform, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe rely on the proper functioning, availability, integrity, confidentiality and security of sophisticated software applications, systems, and\ncomputing infrastructure (\"IT Systems\"). While we own or manage many of these IT Systems, we also increasingly rely on third-party IT\nSystems that are critical to our operations. The security and confidentiality of data and availability of our technology when engaging in e-\ncommerce is essential to maintaining consumer and travel service provider confidence in our platform and services. There are risks of\nsecurity breaches to our IT Systems and those of services providers we rely on as we increase the types of technology we use to\noperate our platform, including mobile apps and third-party payment processing providers, and as we collaborate with third parties that\nmay need to process our homeowner, guest, employee or contractor data or have access to our IT Systems. An increasing number of\ncompanies, including those with significant online operations,\n83\nTable of Contents\nhave recently disclosed cyberattacks and breaches of their security, some of which involved sophisticated tactics and techniques (for\nexample, ransomware) allegedly attributable to criminal enterprises or nation-state actors, following a trend of cyberattacks increasing in\nfrequency and magnitude on a global basis. These risks are likely to increase as we expand our offerings, integrate our products and\nservices, utilize third-party products and services, and store and process more data, including personal information as well as proprietary\nbusiness information.\nWhile we have taken measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our systems and our sensitive, proprietary, and\nconfidential information and to guard against the type of activity that can lead to data breaches, we cannot ensure that every third party\nand service provider we utilize has taken similar measures, or that the measures that we or the third parties and service providers we\nwork with have implemented are sufficient security safeguards or that any implemented measures, including policies and procedures, or\nthat such measures will always be followed, fully implemented and/or be effective against current or future security threats. In addition,\nwe cannot ensure that any process for vetting the security of service providers will identify all risks to the confidentiality, availability,\nsecurity or integrity of their IT Systems. We face evolving cybersecurity risks that threaten the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of\nour IT Systems and data from diverse threat actors, such as state-sponsored organizations, opportunistic hackers and hacktivists, as\nwell as through diverse attack vectors, such as social engineering/phishing, malware (including ransomware), malfeasance by insiders,\nhuman or technological error, and as a result of bugs, misconfigurations or exploited vulnerabilities in software or hardware.\nWe have in the past experienced cyberattacks and security incidents, none of which have, to date, had a material impact on our\nbusiness, and we expect to continue experiencing such attacks and incidents in the future. Cyberattacks are becoming increasingly\nsophisticated, with attackers utilizing tools, including artificial intelligence, designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection and obfuscate\nevidence, which means that we may be unable to identify, investigate or remediate cybersecurity incidents in a timely or effective\nmanner. Further, the techniques used by threat actors to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems\nchange frequently and often are unknown until launched against a target. As such, we and our service providers may be unable to\nanticipate these tactics and techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.\nCertain of our third-party providers provide smart lock hardware and related control software that we use to secure physical access to\nmany of the properties we manage. We rely on these third-party providers to ensure adequate security measures for these services. Any\ncompromise or interruption in the services provided by these third parties could impair our ability to provide guests, owners, and\nhousekeepers/maintenance staff with access to homes, which could result in breaches of contract, litigation, or loss of business. A\nsecurity breach or material failure on the part of one of these providers could also result in providing a threat actor with access to one or\nmore of our managed properties, therefore compromising the physical security of such properties. Any such delay or breach may harm\nour reputation or our ability to retain the confidence of existing homeowners, protect the safety of our guests, or attract new homeowners\nor guests.\nFurther, with a large geographically disparate employee base, we are not immune from the possibility of a malicious insider\ncompromising our information systems and infrastructure. This risk has grown in light of the greater adoption of remote work as a\nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic and will continue for the foreseeable future. We also have a distributed customer support\norganization, including third-party providers that have access to personal and proprietary business information. There can be no\nassurance that any measures implemented can fully safeguard against a sufficiently determined and skilled insider threat.\nIn addition, threat actors have targeted and will continue to target us and our homeowners, guests, partners, vendors and other third\nparties directly with attempts to breach the security of our and their IT Systems, including email accounts or management systems, such\nas through phishing attacks where a third party attempts to infiltrate our IT Systems or acquire information by posing as a legitimate\ninquiry or electronic communication, which are fraudulent identity theft schemes designed to appear as legitimate emails from us or from\nour homeowners or guests, partners, or vendors or other third parties that we do business with. We have experienced and have seen\nmany instances of our homeowners, guests, and other parties we do business with falling prey to such schemes, which result in\naccounts being taken over by fraudsters intent on perpetrating fraud. Threat actors may employ other schemes aimed at defrauding us,\nour homeowners or guests in ways that we may not anticipate or be able to adequately guard against. Computer circumvention\ncapabilities, new discoveries or advances or other developments, including our own acts or omissions, could result in a compromise or\nbreach of consumer data. For example, third parties have attempted, and may continue to attempt, to fraudulently induce employees,\ntravel partners and other service providers or consumers to disclose usernames, passwords or other sensitive information, or to make\npayments to fraudulent accounts. As such, even if phishing and spamming attacks and other fraud schemes are not carried out through\nour systems, victims may nevertheless seek recovery from us. In addition, we may not always be able to fully recover any payments\nmade through such fraud. Because of our prominence, we believe that we are a particularly attractive target for such attacks. Though it\nis difficult to determine what, if any, harm may directly result from any specific scheme or attack, any failure to maintain performance,\nconfidentiality, integrity, reliability, security, and availability of our offerings, services, and IT Systems may harm our reputation\n84\nTable of Contents\nand our ability to retain existing homeowners and guests and attract new homeowners and guests. The ability of fraudsters to directly\ntarget our homeowners and guests with fraudulent communications, or cause an account takeover, exposes us to significant financial\nfraud risk, including costly litigation, which is difficult to fully mitigate. Such an incident may also require us to incur significant expense\nand expend material resources to investigate and correct the issue and to prevent recurrence, and expose us to legal liabilities, including\nregulatory enforcement and indemnity obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or\nresults of operations.\nWe have acquired and may continue to acquire companies that are vulnerable to security breaches, and we may be liable in the event of\nany security breaches of these acquired companies. Such companies may also introduce malware or other security issues if the systems\nof such companies become integrated with our IT Systems. While we conduct due diligence of these companies, we do not have access\nto the full operating history of the companies and cannot be certain there have not been security breaches prior to our acquisition. In\naddition, our diligence may not discover all issues with the security safeguards, policies, and procedures of such acquired companies,\nand it may take time and require significant investment to improve the security safeguards, policies and procedures of such companies,\nso we cannot be certain that there will not be a security breach after our acquisition.\nOur existing general liability and cyber liability insurance policies may not cover, or may cover only a portion of, any potential claims\nrelated to security breaches to which we are exposed or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all or any portion of liabilities that may\nbe imposed. We also cannot be certain that our existing insurance coverage will continue to be available on economically reasonable\nterms, or at all, or in amounts sufficient to cover the potentially significant losses that may result from a security breach, or that the\ninsurer will not deny coverage of any future claim. Security breaches also could harm our reputation and result in litigation against us.\nAny of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe expend, and expect to continue to expend, significant resources to protect against security-related incidents and address problems\ncaused by such incidents. Even if we were to expend more resources, regulators and complainants may not deem our efforts sufficient,\nand regardless of the expenditure, the risk of security related incidents cannot be fully mitigated. Any actual or alleged security breaches\nor alleged violations of federal, state, or foreign laws or regulations relating to privacy and data security could result in mandated user\nnotifications, litigation, government investigations or enforcement actions, significant fines, and expenditures; divert management’s\nattention from operations; deter people from using our platform; damage our brand and reputation; force us to cease operations for some\nlength of time; and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Defending against claims or\nlitigation based on any security breach or incident, regardless of their merit, will be costly and may cause reputational harm. The\nsuccessful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, denial of coverage as to any\nspecific claim, or any change or cessation in our insurance policies and coverages, including premium increases or the imposition of\nlarge deductible requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe rely primarily on Amazon Web Services to host and deliver our platform, and on a number of other third-party service\nproviders in connection with other key aspects of our platform and operations, and any interruptions or delays in services\nfrom these third parties could impair the delivery of our platform and services, and our business, results of operations, and\nfinancial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe rely primarily on Amazon Web Services (\"AWS\") to host and deliver our platform. Third parties also provide services to key aspects\nof our operations, including Internet connections and networking, data storage and processing, trust and safety, security infrastructure,\nsource code management, and software testing and deployment. In addition, we rely on third parties for many aspects of our payments\nprocessing platform, and a significant portion of our customer support operations are conducted by third parties at their facilities. We also\nrely on third-party services for maps and location data that are core to the functionality of our platform, and we integrate applications,\ncontent, and data from third parties to deliver our platform and services.\nWe do not control the operation, physical security, or data security of any of these third-party providers. Despite our efforts to use\ncommercially reasonable diligence in the selection and retention of such third-party providers, such efforts may be insufficient or\ninadequate to prevent or remediate such risks. Our third-party providers, including our cloud computing providers and our payment\nprocessing providers, may be subject to intrusions, computer viruses, denial-of-service attacks, sabotage, ransomware attacks, acts of\nvandalism, acts of terrorism, and other misconduct. Our third-party providers are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from power\nloss, telecommunications failures, fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, and similar events, and they may be subject to\nfinancial, legal, regulatory, and labor issues, each of which may impose additional costs or requirements on us or prevent these third\nparties from providing services to us or our customers on our behalf. In addition, these third parties may breach their agreements with\nus, disagree with our interpretation of contract terms or applicable laws and regulations, refuse to continue or renew these agreements\non commercially reasonable terms or\n85\nTable of Contents\nat all, fail to or refuse to process transactions or provide other services adequately, take actions that degrade the functionality of our\nplatform and services, increase prices, impose additional costs or requirements on us or our customers, or give preferential treatment to\nour competitors. If we are unable to procure alternatives in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be\nsubject to business disruptions, losses, or costs to remediate any of these deficiencies. Our systems currently do not provide complete\nredundancy of data storage or processing, including payment processing. Although we are in the process of developing comprehensive\nbusiness continuity and disaster recovery plans for all of our operations, there is no guarantee that such plans will be effective. The\noccurrence of any of the above events could result in homeowners or guests ceasing to use our platform, reputational damage, legal or\nregulatory proceedings, or other adverse consequences, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and\nfinancial condition.\nOur platform is highly complex, and any undetected errors could materially adversely affect our business, results of\noperations, and financial condition.\nOur platform is a complex system composed of many interoperating components and software. Our business is dependent upon our\nability to prevent system interruption on our platform. Our software, including open source software that is incorporated into our code,\nmay, now or in the future, contain undetected errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities. Some errors in our software code have not been and may\nnot be discovered until after the code has been released. We have, from time to time, found defects or errors in our system and software\nlimitations that have resulted in, and may discover additional issues in the future that could result in, platform unavailability or system\ndisruption. For example, defects or errors have resulted in and could result in the delay in making payments to homeowners or\noverpaying or underpaying homeowners, which would impact our cash position and may cause homeowners to lose trust in our payment\noperations. Any errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities discovered in our code or systems released to production or found in third-party software,\nincluding open source software that is incorporated into our code, any misconfigurations of our systems, or any unintended interactions\nbetween systems could result in poor system performance, an interruption in the availability of our platform, incorrect payments, negative\npublicity, damage to our reputation, loss of existing and potential homeowners and guests, loss of revenue, liability for damages, a failure\nto comply with certain legal, regulatory or tax reporting obligations, and regulatory inquiries or other proceedings, any of which could\nmaterially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nSystem capacity constraints, system or operational failures, or denial-of-service or other attacks could materially adversely\naffect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nSince our founding, we have experienced rapid growth in consumer traffic to our platform. If our systems and network infrastructure\ncannot be expanded or are not scaled to cope with increased demand or fail to perform, we could experience unanticipated disruptions\nin service, slower response times, decreased customer satisfaction, and delays in the introduction of new offerings and tiers. It may be\nparticularly difficult for us to manage these issues as a large portion of our employees continue to work remotely.\nOur corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain other critical business\noperations are located on the West Coast of the United States. Our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption\nfrom human error, computer viruses, earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, and similar events. A catastrophic event that results in the\ndestruction or disruption of our third-party cloud facilities or our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect\nour ability to conduct normal business operations and result in lengthy interruptions or delays of our platform and services.\nOur systems and operations are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, terrorism, and similar misconduct\nfrom external sources and malicious insiders. Our existing security measures may not be successful in preventing attacks on our\nsystems, and any such attack could cause significant interruptions in our operations. For instance, from time to time, we have\nexperienced denial-of-service attacks on our systems that have made portions of our platform slow or unavailable for periods of time.\nThere are numerous other potential forms of attack, such as phishing, account takeovers, malicious code injections, ransomware, and\nthe attempted use of our platform to launch a denial-of-service attack against another party, each of which could cause significant\ninterruptions in our operations or involve us in legal or regulatory proceedings. Accordingly, reductions in the availability and response\ntime of our online platform could cause loss of substantial business volumes during the occurrence of any such attack on our systems\nand measures that we may take to divert suspected traffic in the event of such an attack could result in the diversion of bona fide\ncustomers. These issues are likely to become more difficult to manage as we expand the number of places where we operate and the\nvariety of services we offer, and as the tools and techniques used in such attacks become more advanced and available. Successful\nattacks could result in negative\n86\n\nTable of Contents\npublicity and damage to our reputation, and could prevent consumers from booking or visiting our platform during the attack, any of\nwhich could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIn the event of certain system failures, we may not be able to switch to back-up systems immediately and the time to full recovery could\nbe prolonged. We have experienced system failures from time to time, which have not only placed increased burdens on our engineering\nstaff, but these outages can create, and have created, a significant amount of consumer questions and complaints that need to be\naddressed by our customer support team. Any unscheduled interruption in our service could result in an immediate and significant loss of\nrevenue, an increase in customer support costs, and harm to our reputation, and could result in some consumers switching to our\ncompetitors. If we experience frequent or persistent system failures, our brand and reputation could be permanently and significantly\nharmed, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. While we have taken and\ncontinue to take steps to increase the reliability and redundancy of our systems, these steps are expensive and may not be completely\neffective in reducing the frequency or duration of unscheduled downtime. We do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to\ncompensate us for all losses that may occur.\nIn addition, we use both internally developed systems and third-party systems to operate our platform, including transaction and payment\nprocessing, and financial and accounting systems. If the number of consumers using our platform increases substantially, or if critical\nthird-party systems stop operating as designed, we may need to significantly upgrade, expand, or repair our transaction and payment\nprocessing systems, financial and accounting systems, and other infrastructure. We may not be able to upgrade our systems and\ninfrastructure to accommodate such conditions in a timely manner, and depending on the systems affected, our transaction and payment\nprocessing and financial and accounting systems could be impacted for a meaningful amount of time, which could materially adversely\naffect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur business depends on the performance and reliability of the Internet, mobile, telecommunications network operators, and other\ninfrastructures that are not under our control. As consumers increasingly turn to mobile devices, we also become dependent on\nconsumers’ access to the Internet through mobile carriers and their systems. Disruptions in Internet access, whether generally, in a\nspecific region or otherwise, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe continued proliferation of devices and platforms other than desktop computers creates challenges. If we are unable to\noperate effectively on these platforms, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially\nadversely affected.\nWe anticipate that consumer use of mobile devices and platforms other than desktop computers will continue to grow and that usage of\ndesktop computers will continue to decline. The functionality and user experiences associated with these alternative devices, such as a\nsmaller screen size or lack of a screen, may make the use of our platform through such devices more difficult than through a desktop\ncomputer, lower the use of our platform, and make it more difficult for our homeowners to upload content to our platform. In addition,\nconsumer purchasing patterns can differ on alternative devices, and it is uncertain how the continued proliferation of mobile devices will\nimpact the use of our platform and services. Mobile consumers may also be unwilling to download multiple apps from multiple\ncompanies providing similar services and may opt to use one of our competitors’ services instead of ours. As a result, brand recognition\nand the consumer experience with our mobile app will likely become increasingly important to our business. In addition, these new\nmodalities create opportunities for device or systems companies, such as Amazon, Apple, and Google, to control the interaction with our\nconsumers and disintermediate existing platforms such as ours.\nWe need to provide solutions for consumers who are limited in the size of the app they can support on their mobile devices and address\nlatency issues in countries with lower bandwidth for both desktop and mobile devices. Because our platform contains data-intensive\nmedia, these issues are exacerbated. As new devices, operating systems, and platforms continue to be released, it is difficult to predict\nthe problems we may encounter in adapting our offerings and features to them, and we may need to devote significant resources to the\ncreation, support, and maintenance of our offerings and features.\nOur success will also depend on the interoperability of our offerings with a range of third-party technologies, systems, networks,\noperating systems, and standards, including iOS and Android; the availability of our mobile apps in app stores and in “super-app”\nenvironments; and the creation, maintenance, and development of relationships with key participants in related industries, some of which\nmay also be our competitors. In addition, if accessibility of various apps is limited by executive order or other government actions, the full\nfunctionality of devices may not be available to our customers. Moreover, third-party platforms, services and offerings are constantly\nevolving, and we may not be able to modify our platform to assure its compatibility with those of third parties. If we lose such\ninteroperability, we may experience difficulties or increased costs in integrating our offerings into alternative devices or systems, or\nmanufacturers or operating systems elect not to include our offerings, make changes that degrade the functionality of our offerings, or\ngive preferential treatment to competitive products,\n87\nTable of Contents\nthe growth of our community and our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. This\nrisk may be exacerbated by the frequency with which consumers change or upgrade their devices. In the event consumers choose\ndevices that do not already include or support our platform or do not install our mobile apps when they change or upgrade their devices,\nour traffic and homeowner and guest engagement may be harmed.\nIf we are unable to adapt to changes in technology and the evolving demands of homeowners and guests, our business, our\nbrand, market share, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nThe industries in which we compete are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, consolidation,\nfrequent new offering announcements, introductions, and enhancements, and changing consumer demands and preferences. Our future\nsuccess will depend, in part, on our ability to adapt our platform and services to evolving industry standards and local preferences and to\ncontinually innovate and improve the performance, features, and reliability of our platform and services in response to competitive\nofferings and the evolving demands of homeowners and guests. We believe our future success will also depend on our ability to adapt to\nemerging technologies. As a result, we intend to continue to spend significant resources maintaining, developing, and enhancing our\ntechnologies and platform; however, these efforts may be more costly than expected and may not be successful. For example, we may\nnot make the appropriate investments in new technologies, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations,\nand financial condition. Further, technological innovation often results in unintended consequences such as bugs, vulnerabilities, and\nother system failures. Any such bug, vulnerability, or failure, especially in connection with a significant technical implementation or\nchange, could result in lost business, harm to our brand or reputation, consumer complaints, and other adverse consequences, any of\nwhich could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nFurthermore, in the future, the competitive pressure to innovate could encompass a wider range of services and technologies, including\nservices and technologies that may be outside of our historical core business, and our ability to keep pace may slow. Our current and\npotential competitors range from large and established companies to emerging start-ups. Emerging start-ups may be able to innovate\nand focus on developing a new product or service faster than we can or may foresee consumer need for new services or technologies\nbefore we do. Some of our larger competitors or potential competitors have more resources or more established or varied relationships\nwith consumers than we have, and they could use these advantages in ways that could affect our competitive position, including by\nmaking acquisitions, entering or investing in travel reservation businesses, investing in research and development and competing\naggressively for highly skilled employees.\nIn addition, the widespread adoption of new internet, networking or telecommunications technologies or other technological changes\ncould require us to incur substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our services or infrastructure to these new technologies, which\ncould adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Any failure to implement or adapt to new technologies\nin a timely manner or at all could adversely affect our ability to compete, increase our consumer acquisition costs or otherwise adversely\naffect our business, and therefore adversely affect our brand, market share, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIf we do not adequately protect our intellectual property rights and our data, our business, results of operations, and financial\ncondition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe hold a broad collection of intellectual property rights, including registered domain names, registered and unregistered trademarks,\nservice marks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets and other forms of intellectual property rights in the United States and in certain other\ncountries. In the future, we may acquire or license additional patents or patent portfolios, or other intellectual property assets and rights,\nfrom third parties, which could require significant cash expenditures.\nWe rely on a combination of trademark, copyright, trade secret and patent laws, international treaties, our terms of service, other\ncontractual provisions, user policies, restrictions on disclosure, technological measures, and confidentiality and inventions assignment\nagreements with our employees and consultants to protect our intellectual property assets from infringement and misappropriation. We\nalso rely on unpatented proprietary technology. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to\ncopy aspects of our technology or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. It is possible that others will independently\ndevelop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technology. To protect our trade secrets and other\nproprietary information, we require employees, consultants, and independent contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements.\nHowever, such agreements may not be enforceable in full or in part in all jurisdictions and any breach could have a negative effect on\nour business and our remedy for such breach may be limited. If we are unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies, our\nbusiness would be materially adversely affected.\nFurthermore, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we operate or intend to operate our\nbusiness. As such, there can be no assurance that others will not offer technologies, products, services, features, or\n88\nTable of Contents\nconcepts that are substantially similar to ours and compete with our business, or copy or otherwise obtain, disclose and/or use our\nbrand, content, design elements, creative, editorial, and entertainment assets, or other proprietary information without authorization.\nWe may be unable to prevent third parties from seeking to register, acquire, or otherwise obtain or maintain trademarks, service marks,\ndomain names, or social media handles that are similar to, infringe upon, violate, or diminish the value of our trademarks, service marks,\ncopyrights, and our other proprietary rights. Third parties have also obtained or misappropriated certain of our data through website\nscraping, robots, aggregating our data for their internal use, or by featuring or providing our data through their respective websites,\nand/or launched businesses monetizing this data. While we routinely employ technological, operational, and legal measures in an\nattempt to divert, halt, or mitigate such operations, we may not always be able to detect or halt the underlying activities as technologies\nused to accomplish these operations continue to rapidly evolve.\nWe believe our intellectual property assets and rights are essential to our business. If the protection of our proprietary rights and data is\ninadequate to prevent unauthorized infringement, use, violation or misappropriation by third parties, the value of our brand and other\nintangible assets may be diminished and competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our branding, technologies, offerings, or\nfeatures or methods of operations. Even if we do detect infringements, violations or misappropriations and decide to enforce our rights,\nlitigation may be necessary to enforce our rights, and any enforcement efforts we undertake could be time-consuming and expensive,\ncould divert our management’s attention, and may result in a court determining that certain of our intellectual property rights are\nunenforceable. If we fail to protect our intellectual property and data in a cost-effective and meaningful manner, our competitive standing\ncould be harmed; our homeowners, guests, other consumers, and corporate and community partners could devalue the content of our\nplatform; and our brand, reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe have been, and may in the future be, subject to claims that we or others violated certain third-party intellectual property\nrights, which, even where meritless, can be costly to defend and could materially adversely affect our business, results of\noperations, and financial condition.\nWe have received in the past, and may receive in the future, communications from third parties, including practicing and non-practicing\nentities, claiming that we have infringed, misused, or otherwise misappropriated their intellectual property rights, including alleged patent\ninfringement. Additionally, we have been, and may in the future be, involved in claims, suits, regulatory proceedings, and other\nproceedings involving alleged infringement, misuse, or misappropriation of third-party intellectual property rights, or relating to our\nintellectual property holdings and rights. Like many other companies in the Internet and technology industries, we enter into agreements\nwhich include indemnification provisions related to intellectual property which can subject us to costs and damages in the event of a\nclaim against an indemnified party.\nClaims involving intellectual property could subject us to significant liability for damages and could result in our having to stop using\ncertain technologies, content, branding, domain names or business methods or practices found to be in violation of another party’s\nrights. We might be required or may opt to seek a license for rights to intellectual property held by others, which may not be available on\ncommercially reasonable terms, or at all. Even if a license is available, we could be required to pay significant royalties, which would\nincrease our operating expenses. We may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, content, branding, business\nmethods, or practices. The development of alternative non-infringing technology or practices could require significant effort and expense\nand make us less competitive, or may not be technically feasible. Any of these results could materially adversely affect our ability to\ncompete and our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nFurthermore, our exposure to risks associated with various intellectual property claims may increase as a result of acquisitions of other\ncompanies. Third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired a company or technology that had\nnot been asserted prior to the acquisition. As a result, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially and\nadversely affected as a result of the occurrence of any of the foregoing.\nOur use of “open source” software could adversely impact the value or enforceability of our intellectual property in proprietary\nsoftware, and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition, and affect our ability to\noffer our platform and services and subject us to costly litigation and other disputes.\nWe have in the past incorporated and may in the future incorporate “open source” software into our codebase as we continue to develop\nour platform and services. Certain open source software licenses require a user who intends to distribute the open source software as a\ncomponent of the user’s software to disclose publicly part or all of the source code to the user’s software. The use and distribution of\nopen source software may entail greater risks than the use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not\nprovide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. Open source software is\ngenerally licensed by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses.\n89\nTable of Contents\nBy the terms of such open source licenses, we could also be required to release the source code of our proprietary products or services,\nand to make our proprietary products or services available under open source licenses, if we combine and/or distribute our proprietary\nsoftware with such open source software in a manner that triggers the obligation of the license. In addition to using open source\nsoftware, we also license to others some of our software through open source projects. We could be subject to suits by parties claiming\nownership of what we believe to be open source software or claiming noncompliance with open source licensing terms, including claims\nfor infringement of intellectual property rights or for breach of contract. If we receive an allegation that we have violated an open source\nlicense, we may incur significant legal expenses, be subject to damages, be required to redesign our product to remove the open source\nsoftware, or be required to publicly release certain portions of our proprietary source code, all of which could have a material impact on\nour business. Even in the absence of a claim, if we discover the use of open source software inconsistent with our practices, we could\nexpend significant time and resources to replace the open source software or obtain a commercial license, if available. All of these risks\nare heightened by the fact that the ownership of or disclosure requirements regarding open source software can be uncertain, leading to\nlitigation, and many of the licenses applicable to open source software have not been interpreted by courts, and these licenses could be\nconstrued to impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products. Any use of open source\nsoftware inconsistent with our policies or licensing terms could harm our business and financial position.\nWhile we employ practices designed to monitor our compliance with the licenses of third-party open source software and protect our\nproprietary source code, there is a risk that we may incorporate open source software with unfavorable licensing terms, including the\nobligation to make our source code available for others to use or modify without compensation to us, or inadvertently use open source\nsoftware, which is fairly common in software development in the Internet and technology industries. Such inadvertent use of open source\nsoftware could expose us to claims of non-compliance with the applicable terms of the underlying licenses, which could lead to\nunforeseen business disruptions, including being restricted from offering parts of our product that incorporate the software, being\nrequired to publicly release proprietary source code, being required to re-engineer parts of our code base to comply with license terms,\nor being required to extract the open source software at issue. Our exposure to these risks may be increased as a result of evolving our\ncore source code base, introducing new offerings, integrating acquired-company technologies, or making other business changes,\nincluding in areas where we do not currently compete. Any of the foregoing could adversely impact the value or enforceability of our\nintellectual property, and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe are subject to risks related to our use of artificial intelligence, or AI, in our business.\nWe believe that the use of AI and machine learning tools in our business, and the insights and functionality they can provide us, will\nbecome increasingly important to the efficiency of our business and to the value that our solutions deliver to our homeowners and\nguests. These emerging technologies are in the early stages of commercial use, and they present a number of risks inherent in their use,\nincluding public perception or reputational harm, inaccuracies, unintended biases and discriminatory outcomes, as well as potential legal\nconcerns such as intellectual property protection and infringement, regulatory compliance and data security. While we are in the initial\nstages of using these technologies in our business, their use may result in liability and could cause us to incur additional costs to resolve\nsuch issues, which may harm our business and results of operations. Potential government regulation related to AI use and ethics may\nalso increase the burden and cost of research and development in this area, and failure to properly remediate AI usage or ethics issues\nmay cause public confidence in AI to be undermined, which could slow adoption of AI in our offerings. The rapid evolution of AI will\nrequire the application of resources to develop, test and maintain our products and services to help ensure that AI is implemented\nethically in order to minimize unintended, harmful impact. In addition, we cannot predict future developments in AI and related impacts on\nour business and our industry. If we are unable to successfully adapt to new developments related to AI, our business, results of\noperations, and financial position could be negatively impacted.\nRisks Related to Other Legal and Regulatory Matters\nLaws, regulations, and rules that affect the short-term rental business have limited, and may continue to limit, the ability or\nwillingness of homeowners to rent through Vacasa and expose our homeowners or us to significant penalties, which have had,\nand could continue to have, a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThere have been and continue to be legal and regulatory developments that affect the short-term rental business. Hotels and groups\naffiliated with hotels have engaged and will likely continue to engage in various lobbying and political efforts for stricter regulations\ngoverning our business model in both local and national jurisdictions. Other private groups, such as homeowners, landlords, and\ncondominium and neighborhood associations, have adopted contracts or regulations that purport to ban or otherwise restrict short-term\nor seasonal vacation rentals, and third-party lease agreements between landlords and tenants, home insurance policies, and mortgages\nmay prevent or restrict the ability of homeowners to list their spaces. These groups and others cite concerns around affordable housing\nand over-tourism in major cities, and some state and local governments have implemented or have considered implementing rules,\nordinances, or regulations governing the short-term rental of\n90\nTable of Contents\nproperties. Such regulations include ordinances that restrict or ban homeowners from short-term rentals, set annual caps on the number\nof days homeowners can share their homes, require homeowners to register with the municipality or city, or require homeowners to\nobtain permission before offering short-term rentals. In addition, some jurisdictions regard short-term rental as “hotel use” and claim that\nsuch use constitutes a conversion of a residential property to a commercial property requiring a permitting process.\nAdditionally, any adoption or amendments to any rules, regulations or laws requiring the Company to modify its guest fee structure or the\nway it presents its fees to guests could be difficult or costly to implement, and such implementation could negatively impact our site\nconversion rate, and those of our distribution partners, and, therefore, our revenue.\nMacroeconomic pressures and public policy concerns could continue to lead to new laws and regulations, or interpretations or\nreinterpretations of existing laws and regulations, that limit the ability of homeowners to rent out their homes. If laws, regulations, rules,\nor agreements significantly restrict or discourage homeowners in certain jurisdictions from renting their properties, it would have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWhile a number of cities and counties have implemented legislation to address short-term rentals, there are many others that have not\naddressed or are not yet explicitly enforcing short-term rental laws, and could follow suit and enact or enforce regulations. New laws,\nregulations, government policies, or changes in their interpretations or changes in enforcement of laws in the markets where we operate\ncould present significant challenges and uncertainties. In the event of any such changes, we may be unable to operate in some\njurisdictions, our short-term rental properties could be limited, current and future rental listings and bookings could decline significantly,\nand our relationship with our homeowners and guests could be negatively impacted, which would have a materially adverse effect on our\nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition and reputation.\nCertain jurisdictions have adopted laws and regulations that seek to impose lodging taxes, often known as transient or occupancy taxes,\non our guests, collection and remittance obligations on our homeowners and/or us, and withholding obligations on us, as more fully\ndescribed in our risk factor titled “Uncertainty in the application of taxes to our homeowners, guests, or platform could increase our tax\nliabilities and may discourage homeowners and guests from conducting business on our platform.” In addition, we are subject to\nregulations with respect to short-term rentals, owner registration, licensing, and other requirements for the listing of accommodations,\nsuch as real estate broker or agent real estate licenses and travel agency licenses in some jurisdictions. We have been, and may\ncontinue to be, subject to audits and inquiries relating to these activities, and we could be held liable, incur financial and potential\ncriminal penalties or be prohibited from operating in certain jurisdictions if we are found to have not complied with any of these\nrequirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIn addition, we expect there will be increasing regulation, disclosure-related and otherwise, with respect to environmental, social and\ngovernance matters, and increased regulatory scrutiny as a result, which will likely lead to increased compliance costs and many of the\nother the risks identified above.\nWe have historically taken a very limited role in advocacy but we may in the future determine that it is necessary for us to increase our\nefforts to defend against the application of laws and regulations that limit our ability to do business and we cannot guarantee we would\nbe successful in those efforts. Further, if we or our homeowners and guests were required to comply with laws and regulations,\ngovernment requests, or agreements with government agencies that adversely impact our relations with homeowners and guests, our\nbusiness, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. Moreover, if we enter an agreement with a\ngovernment or governmental agency to resolve a dispute, the terms of such agreement will likely be publicly available and could create a\nprecedent that may put us in a weaker bargaining position in future disputes with other governments.\nWe are subject to a wide variety of complex, evolving, and sometimes inconsistent and ambiguous laws and regulations that\nmay adversely impact our operations and discourage homeowners and guests from using our services, and that could cause\nus to incur significant liabilities, including fines and criminal penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, results of operations, and financial condition.\nComplying with the laws and regulations of different jurisdictions that impose varying standards and requirements is burdensome for\nbusinesses like ours, imposes added cost, increases potential liability to our business, and makes it more difficult to realize business\nefficiencies and economies of scale. For example, we incur significant operational costs to comply with requirements of jurisdictions and\ncities that have disparate requirements around tax collection, tax reporting, owner registration, limits on lengths of stays, landlord-tenant\nlaws and other regulations, each of which require us to dedicate significant resources to provide the infrastructure and tools needed on\nand outside our platform for our homeowners to meet these legal requirements and for us to fulfill any obligations we may have. The\ncomplexity of our services and changes required\n91\nTable of Contents\nto comply with the large number of disparate and constantly evolving requirements can lead to compliance gaps if our internal resources\ncannot keep up with the pace of regulatory change and new requirements imposed on our platform or services, or if our platform does\nnot work as intended or has errors or bugs, or if the manual processes we put in place to comply with certain requirements are not\nfollowed properly or at all.\nWhile we endeavor to monitor the changing legal landscape relating to short-term rentals and longer seasonal rentals, it may be difficult\nor impossible for us to investigate or evaluate laws or regulations in all cities, countries, and regions in which we do business. The\napplication of existing laws and regulations to our business and platform can be unclear, may be difficult for homeowners, guests, and us\nto understand and apply, and are subject to change, as governments or government agencies seek to apply legacy systems of laws or\nadopt new laws to new online business models in the travel and accommodations industries, including ours. Uncertain and unclear\napplication of such laws and regulations to homeowner and guest activity and our platform and services could cause and has caused\nsome homeowners and guests to leave or choose not to use our platform, reduce supply and demand for our platform and services,\nincrease the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations, and increase the threat of litigation or enforcement actions related to\nour platform and services, all of which would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. See\nalso our risk factor titled “We could face liability for information or content on, or accessible through, our platform.”\nThere are laws that apply to us, and there are laws that apply to our homeowners and/or guests, and we have limited means of enforcing\nor ensuring the compliance of our homeowners and guests with all applicable legal requirements. Certain governments have attempted,\nand may attempt in the future, to hold us responsible for laws that apply to our homeowners and/or guests. Whether applicable to us, our\nhomeowners, and/or our guests, the related consequences arising out of such laws and regulations, including costs of complying with\naudits, and penalties for violations of and costs to maintain compliance with such laws and regulations, have had and could continue to\nhave a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe take certain measures to comply and to help homeowners comply with laws and regulations, such as requiring registration numbers\nto be displayed on a listing profile for listings in some jurisdictions where such registration is required. These measures, changes to\nthem, and any future measures we adopt could increase friction on our platform, and reduce the number of listings available on our\nplatform from homeowners and bookings by guests, and could reduce the activity of homeowners and guests on our platform. We may\nbe subject to additional laws and regulations which could require significant changes to our platform that discourage homeowners and\nguests from using our platform.\nIn addition to laws and regulations directly applicable to the short-term rental and longer seasonal business as discussed in our risk\nfactor titled “Laws, regulations, and rules that affect the short-term rental business have limited, and may continue to limit, the ability or\nwillingness of homeowners to rent through Vacasa and expose our homeowners or us to significant penalties, which have had, and could\ncontinue to have, a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition,” we are subject to laws and\nregulations governing our business practices, the Internet, e-commerce, and electronic devices, including those relating to taxation,\nprivacy and data collection, data protection and security, pricing, content, advertising, discrimination, consumer protection, protection of\nminors, copyrights, distribution, messaging, mobile communications, electronic device certification, electronic waste, electronic contracts,\ncommunications, Internet access, competition, and unfair commercial practices. We are also subject to laws and regulations governing\nthe provision of online payment services, the design and operation of our platform, and the operations, characteristics, and quality of our\nplatform and services.\nTo address the COVID-19 pandemic, many jurisdictions adopted laws, rules, regulations, and/or decrees, including implementing travel\nrestrictions, restricting access to city centers, limiting accommodation offerings in surrounding areas, or limiting social mobility and\ngatherings. Governments, corporations, and other authorities may implement similar restrictions or policies in response to future events\nthat could restrict the ability of our homeowners and guests to participate on our platform.\nThere is increased governmental interest in regulating technology companies in a number of areas including privacy, tax, mandatory fees\nand consumer pricing, data localization and data access, algorithm-based discrimination, and competition. In addition, climate change\nand greater emphasis on sustainability could lead to regulatory efforts to address the carbon impact of housing and travel. In addition,\nwe could face risks related to compliance with insurance regulations. As a result, governments may enact new laws and regulations\nand/or view matters or interpret laws and regulations differently than they have in the past, and in a manner that could materially\nadversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nAny new or existing laws and regulations applicable to existing or future business areas, including amendments to or repeal of existing\nlaws and regulations, or new interpretations, applications, or enforcement of existing laws and regulations, could expose us to\nsubstantial liability, including significant expenses necessary to comply with such laws and regulations, and materially adversely impact\nbookings on our platform, thereby materially adversely affecting our business, results of operations,\n92\nTable of Contents\nand financial condition. Our current and future efforts to influence legislative and regulatory proposals have an uncertain chance of\nsuccess, could be limited by laws regulating lobbying or advocacy activity in certain jurisdictions, and even if successful, could be\nexpensive and time consuming, and could divert the attention of management from our core business operations.\nWe rely on a mix of independent contractors and employees to provide operational services to us, and any potential\nreclassification of independent contractors as deemed employees could adversely affect our business, results of operations,\nand financial condition.\nWe rely on a mix of independent contractors and employees to provide operational services to our business. The state of the law\nregarding independent contractor status varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and is subject to change based on court decisions and\nregulation. Regulatory authorities and other parties have increasingly asserted within several industries that certain independent\ncontractors should be classified as employees. As a result, there is significant uncertainty regarding the future of the worker classification\nregulatory landscape. It is possible that legislative, judicial and regulatory (including tax) authorities may introduce proposals or assert\ninterpretations of existing rules and regulations that would change the classification of a significant number of independent contractors\ndoing business with us from independent contractor to employee. In addition, we could also be involved in lawsuits and claims that\nassert that certain independent contractors should be classified as our employees. Adverse determinations regarding the status of any of\nour independent contractors, or the enactment of rules and regulations (or changes in the interpretations of existing rules and\nregulations) that lead to the reclassification of such independent contractors as employees, would result in a significant increase in\nemployment-related costs, such as wages, benefits and taxes, and may subject us to potential penalties, any of which would adversely\naffect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe are subject to regulatory audits, inquiries, litigation, and other disputes from time to time which have in the past materially\nadversely affected, and may in the future materially adversely affect, our business, results of operations, and financial\ncondition.\nWe have been, and expect to continue to be, a party to various legal and regulatory claims, litigation or pre-litigation disputes, and\nproceedings arising in the normal course of business, and as a result of actions such as the Reorganization. The number and\nsignificance of these claims, disputes, and proceedings have increased as our company has grown larger, the number of bookings has\nincreased, awareness of our brand has grown, our presence on well-known platforms has increased, and the scope and complexity of\nour business has expanded, and we expect the number and significance of these claims, disputes and proceedings will continue to\nincrease in the future.\nWe have been, and expect to continue to be, subject to various government audits, inquiries, investigations, and proceedings related to\nlegal and regulatory requirements such as compliance with laws related to short-term rentals, tax, consumer protection, pricing,\nadvertising, discrimination, data protection, data sharing, payment processing, trust compliance, privacy, and competition. In many\ncases, these inquiries, investigations, and proceedings can be complex, time consuming, costly to investigate, and require significant\ncompany and management attention. For certain matters, we are implementing recommended changes to our products, operations, and\ncompliance practices and removal of noncompliant listings and homes from our service. We are unable to predict the outcomes and\nimplications of such audits, inquiries, investigations, and proceedings on our business, and such audits, inquiries, investigations, and\nproceedings could result in large fines and penalties, require changes to our products and operations, restrict our ability to operate in\ncertain regions and materially adversely affect our brand, reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition. In some\ninstances, applicable laws and regulations do not yet exist or are being adapted and implemented to address certain aspects of our\nbusiness, and such adoption or change in their interpretation could further alter or impact our business and subject us to future\ngovernment audits, inquiries, investigations, and proceedings.\nLegal claims have been asserted against us for alleged discriminatory conduct undertaken by homeowners against certain guests (such\nas conduct relating to acceptance of service animals), and for our own platform policies or business practices. Changes to the\ninterpretation of the applicability of fair housing, civil rights or other statutes to our business or the conduct of our users could materially\nadversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We may also become more vulnerable to third-party claims\nas U.S. laws such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (\"DMCA\") and the Stored Communications Act, and non-U.S. laws such as the\nEuropean E-Commerce Directive, are interpreted by the courts or otherwise modified or amended, as our platform and services to our\nhomeowners and guests continue to expand, and if we expand geographically into jurisdictions where the underlying laws with respect to\nthe potential liability of online intermediaries such as ourselves are either unclear or less favorable.\nIn addition, we face claims and litigation relating to fatalities, shootings, other violent acts, illness (including COVID-19), cancellations\nand refunds, personal injuries, property damage, carbon monoxide incidents, homeowner disputes, and privacy\n93\nTable of Contents\nviolations that occurred in connection with a rental through our platform. We also have faced putative class action litigation and\ngovernment inquiries, and could face additional litigation and government inquiries and fines relating to our business practices,\ncancellations and other consequences due to natural disasters or other unforeseen events beyond our control such as wars, regional\nhostilities, health concerns, including epidemics and pandemics such as COVID-19, or law enforcement demands and other regulatory\nactions.\nIn addition, in the ordinary course of business, we have been party to disputes that allege we have infringed third parties’ intellectual\nproperty or in which we agree to provide indemnification to third parties with respect to certain matters, including losses arising from our\nbreach of such agreements or from intellectual property infringement claims, or where we make other contractual commitments to third\nparties. We also have indemnification agreements with certain of our directors and executive officers that require us, among other things,\nto indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. We may be subject\nto litigation stemming from these obligations.\nAdverse results in any regulatory audit, inquiry, litigation, legal proceedings, or claims may include awards of potentially significant\nmonetary damages, including statutory damages for certain causes of action in certain jurisdictions, penalties, fines, injunctive relief,\nroyalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain services in a region or state. Moreover, many regulatory\naudits, inquiries, litigation, legal proceedings, or claims are resolved by settlements that can include both monetary and non-monetary\ncomponents. Adverse results or settlements may result in changes in our business practices in significant ways, increased operating and\ncompliance costs, and a loss of revenue. In addition, any litigation or pre-litigation claims against us, whether or not meritorious, are time\nconsuming, require substantial expense, and could result in the diversion of significant operational resources. We use various software\nplatforms that, in some instances, have limited functionality, which may impede our ability to retrieve records in the context of a\ngovernmental audit, inquiry or litigation. In addition, our insurance may not cover all potential claims to which we are exposed and may\nnot be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed. We expect regulatory audits, inquiries, litigation, legal proceedings,\nand other claims will continue to consume significant company resources and adverse results in future matters could materially\nadversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe could face liability for information or content that is on, or accessible through, our platform.\nWe could face claims relating to information or content that is published or made available on our platform. We generally manage the\ncontent that is posted on our site as part of our vacation rental management services. As such, we are exposed to potential claims of\ndefamation, disparagement, negligence, warranty, personal harm, intellectual property infringement, and other alleged damages that\ncould be asserted against us, in addition to our homeowners and guests.\nWhile we rely on a variety of statutory and common-law frameworks and defenses, including those provided by the DMCA and the fair-\nuse doctrine in the United States, differences among statutes, limitations on immunity, requirements to maintain immunity, and\nmoderation efforts in the many jurisdictions in which we operate may affect our ability to rely on these frameworks and defenses, or may\ncreate uncertainty regarding liability for information or content on our platform. Moreover, regulators in the United States and in other\ncountries may introduce new regulatory regimes that increase potential liability for information or content available on our platform.\nBecause liability often flows from information or content on our platform and/or services accessed through our platform, as we continue\nto expand our offerings, tiers, and scope of business, both in terms of the range of offerings and services and geographical operations,\nwe may face or become subject to additional or different laws and regulations. Our potential liability for information or content created by\nthird parties and posted to our platform could require us to implement additional measures to reduce our exposure to such liability, may\nrequire us to expend significant resources, may limit the desirability of our platform to homeowners and guests, may cause damage to\nour brand and reputation, and may cause us to incur time and costs defending such claims in litigation, thereby materially adversely\naffecting our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIn the European Union, the Consumer Rights Directive and the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive harmonized consumer rights\nacross the EU member states. If consumer protection regulators find that we are in breach of consumer protection laws, we may be fined\nor required to change our terms and processes, which may result in increased operational costs. Consumers and certain consumer\nprotection associations may also bring individual claims against us if they believe that our terms and/or business practices are not in\ncompliance with local consumer protection laws. Currently, class actions may also be brought in\n94\nTable of Contents\ncertain countries in the European Union, and the Collective Redress Directive will extend the right to collective redress across the\nEuropean Union.\nWe are subject to governmental economic and trade sanctions laws and regulations that limit the scope of our offering.\nAdditionally, failure to comply with applicable economic and trade sanctions laws and regulations could subject us to liability\nand negatively affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe are required to comply with economic and trade sanctions administered by governments where we operate, including the U.S.\ngovernment (including, without limitation, regulations administered and enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"OFAC\") and\nthe U.S. Department of State). These economic and trade sanctions prohibit or restrict transactions to or from or dealings with certain\nspecified countries, regions, their governments and, in certain circumstances, their nationals, and with individuals and entities that are\nspecially designated, such as individuals and entities included on OFAC’s List of Specially Designated Nationals or other sanctions\nmeasures. Any future economic and trade sanctions imposed in jurisdictions where we have significant business could materially\nadversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our ability to track and verify transactions and otherwise\ncomply with these regulations require a high level of internal controls, and we cannot guarantee that we have not engaged in dealings\nwith persons sanctioned under applicable sanctions laws. Any non-compliance with economic and trade sanctions laws and regulations\nor related investigations could result in claims or actions against us and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations,\nand financial condition. As our business continues to grow and regulations change, we may be required to make additional investments\nin our internal controls or modify our business.\nWe have operations in countries known to experience high levels of corruption and any violation of anti-corruption laws could\nsubject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") and other laws in the United States and elsewhere that prohibit\nimproper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials, political parties, state-owned or controlled\nenterprises, and/or private entities and individuals for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have operations in and deal\nwith countries known to experience corruption. Our activities in these countries create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of\npayments by one of our employees, contractors, agents, or users that could be in violation of various laws, including the FCPA and anti-\nbribery laws in these countries. We have implemented policies, procedures, systems, and controls designed to ensure compliance with\napplicable laws and to discourage corrupt practices by our employees, consultants, and agents, and to identify and address potentially\nimpermissible transactions under such laws and regulations; however, our existing and future safeguards, including training programs to\ndiscourage corrupt practices by such parties, may not prove effective, and we cannot ensure that all such parties, including those that\nmay be based in or from countries where practices that violate U.S. or other laws may be customary, will not take actions in violation of\nour policies, for which we may be ultimately responsible. Additional compliance requirements may require us to revise or expand our\ncompliance programs, including the procedures we use to monitor international and domestic transactions. Failure to comply with any of\nthese laws and regulations may result in extensive internal or external investigations as well as significant financial penalties and\nreputational harm, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation provides that the doctrine of “corporate opportunity” will not apply with respect to any director\nor stockholder who is not employed by us or our subsidiaries.\nThe doctrine of corporate opportunity generally provides that a corporate fiduciary may not develop an opportunity using corporate\nresources, acquire an interest adverse to that of the corporation or acquire property that is reasonably incident to the present or\nprospective business of the corporation or in which the corporation has a present or expectancy interest, unless that opportunity is first\npresented to the corporation and the corporation chooses not to pursue that opportunity. The doctrine of corporate opportunity is\nintended to preclude officers, directors and other fiduciaries from personally benefiting from opportunities that belong to the corporation.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation provides that the doctrine of “corporate opportunity” does not apply with respect to any stockholder or\ndirector (other than any director who is also an officer) of Vacasa, Inc. (each, an “Exempted Person”).\nThe Exempted Persons will therefore have no duty to communicate or present corporate opportunities to us, and will have the right to\neither hold any corporate opportunity for their own account and benefit or to recommend, assign or otherwise transfer such corporate\nopportunity to persons other than us, including to any other director or stockholder who is not employed by us or our subsidiaries.\nAs a result, the Exempted Persons will generally not be prohibited from operating or investing in competing businesses. We therefore\nmay find ourselves in competition with any one or more of these parties, and we may not have knowledge of, or be\n95\nTable of Contents\nable to pursue, transactions that could potentially be beneficial to us. To the extent we find ourselves in competition with Exempted\nPersons, we may lose a corporate opportunity or suffer competitive harm, which could negatively impact our business, results of\noperations, financial condition, or prospects.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Class A Common Stock\nOur focus on the long-term best interests of our company and our consideration of all of our stakeholders, including our\nstockholders, homeowners, guests, employees, the communities in which we operate, and other stakeholders that we may\nidentify from time to time, may conflict with short- or medium-term financial interests and business performance, which may\nnegatively impact the value of our Class A Common Stock.\nWe believe that focusing on the long-term best interests of our company and our consideration of all of our stakeholders, including our\nstockholders, homeowners, guests, employees, the communities in which we operate, and other stakeholders we may identify from time\nto time, is essential to the long-term success of our company and to long-term stockholder value. Therefore, we have made decisions,\nand may in the future make decisions, that we believe are in the long-term best interests of our company and our stockholders, even if\nsuch decisions may negatively impact the short- or medium-term performance of our business, results of operations, and financial\ncondition or the short- or medium-term performance of our Class A Common Stock. Our commitment to pursuing long-term value for the\ncompany and its stockholders, potentially at the expense of short- or medium-term performance, may materially adversely affect the\ntrading price of our Class A Common Stock, including by making owning our Class A Common Stock less appealing to investors who are\nfocused on returns over a shorter time horizon. Our decisions and actions in pursuit of long-term success and long-term stockholder\nvalue, which may include changes to our platform to enhance the experience of our homeowners, guests, and the communities in which\nwe operate, including by improving the trust and safety of our platform, changes in the manner in which we deliver customer support,\ninvesting in our relationships with our homeowners, guests, and employees, investing in and introducing new products and services, or\nchanges in our approach to working with local or national jurisdictions on laws and regulations governing our business, or the\nReorganization, may not result in the long-term benefits that we expect, in which case our business, results of operations, and financial\ncondition, as well as the trading price of our Class A Common Stock, could be materially adversely affected.\nOur principal stockholders and holders of the Convertible Notes have significant influence over us, including over decisions\nthat require the approval of stockholders, and their interests may conflict with the interests of other stockholders.\nOn June 7, 2023, we entered into four individual director designation agreements (collectively, the \"Director Designation Agreements\"\nand each a \"Director Designation Agreement\") with (i) SLP Venice Holdings, L.P. and SLP V Venice Feeder I, L.P. (together with their\naffiliates, the \"Silver Lake Stockholders\"); ; (ii) RW Vacasa AIV LP, RW Industrious Blocker LP, Riverwood Capital Partners II (Parallel-B)\nL.P., RCP III Vacasa AIV, L.P., RCP III Blocker Feeder LP, Riverwood Capital Partners III (Parallel-B) L.P., RCP III (A) Blocker Feeder LP\nand RCP III (A) Vacasa AIV L.P. (together with their affiliates, the “Riverwood Stockholders”); (iii) LEGP I VCS, LLC, LEGP II VCS, LLC,\nLevel Equity Opportunities Fund 2015, L.P., Level Equity Opportunities Fund 2018, L.P., Level Equity - VCS Investors, LLC and LEGP II\nAIV(B), L.P. (together with their affiliates, the “Level Equity Stockholders”); and (iv) Mossytree Inc. (together with its affiliates, the “EB\nStockholders”). The Director Designation Agreement with the EB Stockholders terminated on February 15, 2024 in accordance with its\nterms, as the EB Stockholders ceased to beneficially own the requisite amount of Shares (as defined therein).\nIn the aggregate, as of September 30, 2024, the Silver Lake Stockholders, the Riverwood Stockholders, and the Level Equity\nStockholders controlled approximately 46% of the combined voting power of our Common Stock as a result of their ownership of Class A\nCommon Stock and Class B Common Stock. The Director Designation Agreements contain director nominations rights so long as each\nholder continues to hold prescribed amounts of our Common Stock. Based on a Form 13D/A filed by DK on August 9, 2024, DK\nbeneficially owned shares of our Class A Common Stock, representing approximately 19.99% of our Class A Common Stock outstanding\nas of June 30, 2024 after giving effect to the Change of Control Rules as defined in that filing, which percentage includes shares of Class\nA Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Convertible Notes . As a result, these stockholders and their affiliates have\nsignificant influence over the management and affairs of our company and, if they were to decide to act together, would have the ability\nto control the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and the approval of\nsignificant corporate transactions, including any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and the issuance or\nredemption of equity interests in certain circumstances. The interests of one or more of these stockholders may not always coincide with,\nand in some cases may conflict with, our interests and the interests of our other stockholders. For instance, these stockholders could\nattempt to delay or prevent a change in control of our company, even if such change in control would benefit our other stockholders,\nwhich could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock. This concentration of ownership\nmay also affect\n96\nTable of Contents\nthe prevailing market price of our common stock due to investors’ perceptions that conflicts of interest may exist or arise. As a result, this\nconcentration of ownership may not be in the best interests of other stockholders.\nIn addition, because the Silver Lake Stockholders, the Riverwood Stockholders, and the Level Equity Stockholders hold part of their\neconomic interest in our business through OpCo, rather than through Vacasa, Inc., and may hold rights to receive payments under the\nTax Receivable Agreement, their interests may further conflict with the interests of holders of Class A Common Stock. For example, such\nholders may have different tax positions from us, which could influence their decisions regarding whether and when we should dispose\nof assets or incur new or refinance existing indebtedness, and whether and when we should undergo certain changes of control within\nthe meaning of the Tax Receivable Agreement or terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement. In addition, the structuring of future\ntransactions may take into consideration these tax or other considerations even where no similar benefit would accrue to us. These\nholders’ significant ownership in and influence over us may discourage someone from making a significant equity investment in us, or\ncould discourage transactions involving a change in control, including transactions in which holders of shares of our Class A Common\nStock might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over the then-current market price.\nThe trading price of the shares of our Class A Common Stock may be volatile, and holders of the Class A Common Stock could\nincur substantial losses.\nOur stock price has been, and may continue to be, volatile. The stock market has experienced extreme volatility that has often been\nunrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, investors may not be able to sell our Class A\nCommon Stock at or above the price paid for the shares. The market price for our Class A Common Stock may be influenced by many\nfactors, including:\n• actual or anticipated variations in our operating results;\n• changes in financial estimates by us or by any securities analysts who might cover our stock;\n• conditions or trends in our industry;\n• stock market price and volume fluctuations of comparable companies;\n• announcements by us or our competitors of new product or service offerings, significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships or\ndivestitures;\n• announcements of investigations or regulatory scrutiny of our operations or lawsuits filed against us;\n• investors’ general perception of our company and our business, including as a result of the Reorganization;\n• changes in financial markets or general economic conditions, including the effects of a recession or slow economic growth in the\nU.S. or abroad, interest rates, fuel prices, currency fluctuations, corruption, political instability, acts of war, including impacts\nfrom the Ukraine-Russia and Israel-Hamas conflicts and escalations thereof, or similar macroeconomic conditions and\nconcerns;\n• conversions of the Convertible Notes into shares of Class A Common Stock;\n• recruitment or departure of key personnel; and\n• sales of our Class A Common Stock, including sales by our directors and officers or specific stockholders.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a company’s securities, securities class action\nlitigation has often been instituted against these companies. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a\ndiversion of our management’s attention and resources.\nFuture sales of our Class A Common Stock in the public market could cause the market price of our Class A Common Stock to\ndecline significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nThe ownership of a substantial amount of our Class A Common Stock is concentrated with limited number of holders. Furthermore, the\nholders (\"OpCo Unitholders\") of common units of OpCo (\"OpCo Units\"), other than Vacasa, Inc., have the right, pursuant to the Fourth\nAmended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of OpCo, to cause OpCo to acquire all or a portion of their vested OpCo\nUnits, which may be settled for, at our election, shares of Class A Common Stock at a redemption ratio of one share of Class A Common\nStock for each OpCo Unit redeemed (subject to conversion rate adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends and reclassification) or an\nequivalent amount of cash and, in each case, the cancellation of an equal number of shares of such OpCo Unitholder's Class B\nCommon Stock. In addition, the Convertible Notes are convertible at the option of the holders thereof into shares of our Class A Common\nStock, and any conversions of the Convertible Notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders. Any shares of Class A\nCommon Stock we may issue in connection with such redemptions or conversions will also be eligible for sale in the public market,\nsubject to compliance with applicable securities laws. The market price of our Class A Common Stock could decline significantly if the\nholders of these shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them. These sales, or the possibility that these\nsales may occur, might also\n97\nTable of Contents\nmake it more difficult for us to raise capital through the issuance and sale of equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we\ndeem appropriate.\nWe are an “emerging growth company” within the meaning of the Securities Act, and as a result of the reduced disclosure and\ngovernance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, our Class A Common Stock may be less attractive to\ninvestors.\nWe are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (\"JOBS Act\"), and we may take\nadvantage of certain exemptions and relief from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not\n“emerging growth companies.” In particular, while we are an “emerging growth company,” we will not be required to comply with the\nauditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; we are exempt from any rules that could be adopted by the\nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board requiring mandatory audit firm rotations or a supplement to the auditor’s report on financial\nstatements; we are subject to reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy\nstatements; and we are not required to hold non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation.\nWe may be an “emerging growth company” until December 31, 2026, though we may cease to be an “emerging growth company” earlier\nunder certain circumstances, including: (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which (a) we have total annual gross revenue of at least\n$1.235 billion, or (b) the market value of our common equity that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day\nof our most recently completed second fiscal quarter; and (ii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.00 billion in non-\nconvertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.\nThe exact implications of the JOBS Act are subject to interpretation and guidance by the SEC and other regulatory agencies, and we\ncannot ensure that we will be able to take advantage of all of the benefits of the JOBS Act. In addition, investors may find our Class A\nCommon Stock less attractive to the extent we rely on the exemptions and relief granted by the JOBS Act. If some investors find our\nClass A Common Stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our Class A Common Stock and our\nstock price may decline or become more volatile.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our Class A Common Stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. In addition, the terms of our\nRevolving Credit Facility restrict our ability to pay dividends, and the terms of any future debt agreements we may enter into are likely to\ncontain similar restrictions. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our Class A Common Stock will be the sole source of gain for the\nforeseeable future.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nNone.\nItem 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities\nNone.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\nItem 5. Other Information\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, no director or officer of the Company adopted or terminated a “Rule 10b5-1 trading\narrangement” or “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” as each term is defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K.\nItem 6.
