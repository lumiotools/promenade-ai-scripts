Announces Sale of Shortline Rail and Bulk Handling Infrastructure; Partnership with GCM Grosvenor and Mobil Grain Ltd.\n\n  * November 20, 2024\n\n\n\nREGINA, Saskatchewan, Nov. 20, 2024 — AGT Food and Ingredients Inc. (“**AGT** “) is pleased to announce the sale of all shares of AGT’s shortline rail and bulk handling infrastructure, comprising Mobil Grain Ltd., (“**MobilGrain** “) to GCM Grosvenor (**NASDAQ: GCMG**), a global alternative asset management firm, through the firm’s Infrastructure Advantage Strategy. Financial terms and details of the sale and subsequent agreement have not been disclosed. Northborne Partners acted as the sole lead advisor to AGT on the transaction.\n\nThe sale includes MobilGrain and its operating subsidiaries: Last Mountain Rail, with 140 kms (87 miles) running from the Regina Plains to Central Saskatchewan, including 160 kms (100 miles) of running rights on CN; Big Sky Rail, with 431 kms (258 miles) running from Central Saskatchewan through West Central Saskatchewan; MobilEx Terminal Ltd., a port and loading facility for grain and potash located in Thunder Bay, Ontario; and Intermobil, a privately-operated, state-of-the-art intermodal terminal located in Regina, SK, featuring CN service to the Atlantic, Pacific and Gulf Coasts and CN’s intermodal terminals. Bulk loading infrastructure includes Saskatchewan facilities in Condie, Aylesbury, Delisle, Dinsmore, Lucky Lake, Beechy, Elrose, Kyle, Eston and Laporte for the receiving of grains, canola and pulses from farmers in the region.\n\nThe assets included in the sale of shares to GCM Grosvenor are critical infrastructure for the growth of the Saskatchewan agricultural sector, with transportation of agri-products from the Regina Plains, West Central and Central Saskatchewan regions, an area that is one of the most important grain, canola and pulse growing regions of the world. This infrastructure connects to CN main rail lines, moving Saskatchewan agri-products to coastal ports and markets around the globe. To ensure that the rail and bulk infrastructure included in this sale continues to grow and improve for producers and communities along the line and corridor, AGT has signed a 20-year agreement with MobilGrain to continue to utilize this infrastructure for its global origination and supply chain programs for export, providing Saskatchewan farmers options for marketing their grains, canola and pulses to world markets through this critical and unique collection of community-based assets.\n\n“AGT is thrilled to enter this partnership with GCM Grosvenor, a key infrastructure investor who wants to hold the infrastructure for the long term, improve and grow it to build on the work that MobilGrain and AGT have done over the past two decades operating these assets. With the planned Lake Diefenbaker Irrigation Project adding growth to the already strong Regina Plains, West Central and Central growing regions, there are great opportunities ahead for all involved, including GCM Grosvenor, AGT, CN and farmers and producers who depend on this rail service. This sale returns significant capital to AGT, which presently generates over $3 billion in revenue annually. We will continue building on the strength of our partnership with Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd. in creating a global agriculture growth story, including expanding our global packaged foods business. The long-term agreement with GCM Grosvenor and MobilGrain means AGT will remain a mainstay in the communities along the railway in which we operate today,” said Murad Al-Katib, President and CEO of AGT.\n\n“This transaction underscores Saskatchewan’s essential role in the global economy as a key producer of critical minerals and agricultural products. Integrating MobilGrain’s shortline rail with CN’s network creates significant growth potential, while Intermobil and MobilEx terminals will continue supporting agricultural and potash exports. In line with GCM Grosvenor’s responsible contracting principles, all employees at these facilities will remain with MobilGrain. We look forward to supporting Kent Affleck and his team’s growth plans,” said Matthew Rinklin, Managing Director, Infrastructure at GCM Grosvenor. “In addition, partnering with Bluejay Capital Partners, whose transportation and shortline rail expertise is vital, will further strengthen MobilGrain’s future success.” \n\n“CN is pleased with the long and successful partnership with AGT and MobilGrain in this important Saskatchewan shortline railway corridor. We look forward to building on this successful collaboration to grow our business by working with GCM Grosvenor and MobilGrain to further improve first-mile service, and to bring more of Saskatchewan’s potash and agricultural products to the world,” said Remi G. Lalonde, Executive Vice-President and Chief Commercial Officer at CN.\n\nThe transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions and is expected to close in late 2024 or early 2025.\n\n**About AGT Food and Ingredients Inc.**\n\nAGT Food and Ingredients Inc.

CGIF has an innovative interval fund structure that allows individual investors, through their financial advisors, access to GCM Grosvenor’s institutional private infrastructure platform. \n\nThe Fund expects to launch with approximately $300 million of seed capital sourced from a major institutional investor. Before commencing distribution, the Fund anticipates merging with a seasoned portfolio of $220 million in committed net assets that is broadly diversified and includes the traditional infrastructure sectors of transportation, digital, energy and energy transition, as well as new infrastructure sectors including supply chain and logistics and infrastructure adjacencies. This seed portfolio is expected to be accompanied by an additional cash commitment of approximately $80 million. \n\nCION and GCM Grosvenor believe infrastructure is a compelling investment opportunity at the beginning of a multi-decade growth cycle. Tremendous amounts of public and private investment capital are necessary for infrastructure to successfully meet the upgrades and buildouts required to keep pace with global climate, demographic and technological change. This persistent, high demand for investment capital creates an attractive long-term environment for investment opportunities in infrastructure.\n\nFor investors, infrastructure can provide capital appreciation and income and has distinct characteristics that can help them construct portfolios with potential to meet long term goals. These features can include transparent cash flows, high barriers to entry, inflation protection potential, low correlations to other private and public assets, and lower potential volatility.\n\nMichael A. Reisner and Mark Gatto, co-CEOs of CION, said: “Private assets have always been our focus, and we believe that within private market, infrastructure is in a particularly compelling position for growth. Infrastructure as an asset class is only a couple decades old, and GCM Grosvenor was one of the first institutional managers to see the potential in the opportunity. The firm has built a strong track record, a differentiated and flexible sourcing network, and has an approach to investment selection that focuses on increasing alpha.” \n\nMichael Sacks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of GCM Grosvenor, said, “We believe that the infrastructure space presents a compelling investment opportunity and that GCM Grosvenor’s platform is uniquely positioned to deliver solutions for investors. Our approach to infrastructure has consistently been about building a well-diversified portfolio, across multiple factors including geography, asset concentration, and sector exposure. We focus on utilizing our powerful sourcing network to see, evaluate and onboard infrastructure assets from multiple different fronts.”\n\n**ABOUT CION INVESTMENTS**\n\nCION Investments is a leading open-source provider of alternative investments designed to redefine the way individual investors can build their portfolios and meet their long-term investment goals. CION Investments currently sponsors, among other products, CION Investment Corporation (NYSE: CION), a leading publicly listed business development company that currently manages approximately $2 billion in assets, and also sponsors CION Ares Diversified Credit Fund, a globally diversified interval fund that currently manages approximately $6 billion in assets.\n\nFor more information, please visit [www.cioninvestments.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=8hvw03UmpZi5xrw95BlawJ7TocPp_pTF8M51lU_DfcNeekQSMIdPkd9UQiJi-GInw1A-GygMKtwMFgLl1-tGfHiWYF9YU0kHs_-6bqAG56tO-2tupcbUcDLfLCCZdvBDULHOkzhHLPuM0Cd34ZaibNDVR8vVuSetgZg883m1xKL77MnGKddsTpmJqlXLz77yuGlEsOiH8KBNtte8AByqKlVgGmomVJtJCzbgKr3pzkkCKHk8Ski_vYYWec_JdLGyeoW_D2cAT2tsTlRWcd7kw4SiciaOburZN6KvkPchDRYmlNPPyEYVHs7MBQNoNJn0xUPiK5JT0YBYKCHL8P0PsLVhaejfSEXTHAePOwTI24UWVGr43Sx9sIyMlRaa0dQbLId7Fch2ZSUAU2r4G6t6HuLVAdjVqR5VqXW5nFz8B40O5Jo2Fe1444HIOLqJUvIK). \n\n**ABOUT GCM GROSVENOR**\n\nGCM Grosvenor (Nasdaq: GCMG) is a global alternative asset management solutions provider with approximately $80 billion in assets under management across private equity, infrastructure, real estate, credit, and absolute return investment strategies.

Today I am\njoined by GCM Grosvenor’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Michael Sacks; President\nJon Levin; and Chief Financial Officer Pam Bentley.\nBefore we discuss this quarter’s results, a reminder that all statements made on this call that do\nnot relate to matters of historical fact should be considered forward-looking statements. This\nincludes statements regarding our current expectations for the business, our financial\nperformance and projections.\nThese statements are neither promises nor guarantees. They involve known and unknown risks,\nuncertainties, and other important factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially\nfrom those indicated by the forward-looking statements on this call. Please refer to the factors\nin the Risk Factors section of our 10-K, our other filings with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and our earnings release, all of which are available on the Public Shareholders\nSection of our website.\nWe'll also refer to non-GAAP measures that we view as important in assessing the performance\nof our business. A reconciliation of non-GAAP metrics to the nearest GAAP metric can be found\nin our earnings presentation and earnings supplement, both of which are available on our\nwebsite.\nOur goal is to continually improve how we communicate with and engage with our shareholders\nand in that spirit, we look forward to your feedback.\nThank you again for joining us, and with that, I'll turn the call over to Michael.\nMichael Sacks: Thanks, Stacie and good morning, everyone.\nWe are pleased to report another strong quarter on our way to a strong full year of growth in\n2024.\nOn a year-to-date basis our Fee-Related Earnings increased 18% and Adjusted Net Income\nincreased 24% over the same period in 2023. Our Fee-Related Earnings margin was 41% for\nthe quarter compared to 31% at the end of 2020, and we continue to believe that we have\nmargin expansion opportunity.\nWe believe that “we succeed when our clients succeed”, and this quarter we again delivered\nvalue to our clients. Performance across our business was solid in all investment verticals.\nAbsolute Return Strategies performance has been particularly strong, with our multi-strategy\ncomposite generating a 12.5% gross rate return over the last 12 months. We similarly enjoyed\nportfolio appreciation year-over-year across Private Equity and Infrastructure strategies. Real\nEstate valuations have largely stabilized and the environment there is good with regard to\ninvestment opportunities.\nCapital formation activity continues to improve across the business, and we are seeing signs of\nimprovement in realization activity. We raised $1.4 billion of new capital in the quarter, bringing\nour year-to-date fundraising total to $4.8 billion, a 34% increase year-over-year. We have seen\ntremendous growth in late-stage pipeline opportunities, which are up over 70% today from a\nyear ago with every investment strategy showing real pipeline growth. We continue to expect\nfundraising in the second half of the year to exceed the $3.4 billion we raised in the first half of\nthe year, and we see strong fundraising momentum heading into 2025.\nThe composition of our recent fundraising highlights the key business drivers we’ve discussed\non recent calls – the shift to private markets, the shift to direct oriented investment strategies,\nthe power of our separate account model, and the particularly strong tailwinds behind\ninfrastructure and private credit.\nOver the last three years, 89% of the $20 billion of capital we have raised was for private\nmarkets strategies, and nearly 50% was for direct oriented strategies. Today, 71% of our AUM is\nin private markets strategies and 40% in direct oriented strategies. Both of those numbers will\ncontinue to increase based on recent fundraising trendlines. Notably, the financial performance\nof our Absolute Returns Strategies has stabilized as expected.\nEarlier this year Jon discussed the stability and growth embedded in our separate account\nbusiness. The re-up cycle of separate accounts is a powerful foundation of our growth. 42% of\nour year-to-date fundraising has been in Private Equity, largely driven by separate account re-\nups. Our separate accounts are programmatic in nature and are core exposures inside of our\nclients’ portfolios. We have a considerable re-up pipeline looking out over the next year.\nInvestors continue to increase allocations to Infrastructure and Private Credit, and we are well\npositioned to be part of the solution for them. You may have seen analyst reports about a sell-\nside event we hosted last quarter spotlighting the competitive advantages of our infrastructure\nplatform – we are experienced, we are global, our track record is good, we can implement all\ndifferent types of investments, and our sourcing engine is powerful. These differentiators have\nled to success with our Infrastructure AUM doubling over the last 4 years. We see further growth\nin the future.\nIn the case of Private Credit, we are positioned to provide holistic solutions for client portfolios.\nThat includes serving as a single point of entry for the entirety of a client’s private credit\nallocation and providing complementary credit co-investment and secondaries exposures.\nInvestors continue to grow and evolve their private credit allocations, so the growth potential to\nscale with them is significant. Credit was our fastest growing vertical by AUM over the last year,\nand we expect continued momentum there.\nWe remain confident in our 5-year growth target of doubling 2023 Fee-Related Earnings by\n2028, and this year’s anticipated growth puts us on pace to achieve that goal. At the same time,\nwe see significant latent earnings power in our incentive fee opportunity which will benefit\ngrowth in Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income to an even greater degree.\nAnd with that, I will turn it over to Jon.\nJon Levin: Thank you, Michael.\nThe individual investor channel, for good reason, is quite topical in our industry these days. And\nwe have a lot going on in this area at GCM. So that will be the focus of my comments today.\nIndividual investors account for roughly half of the total global AUM, so approximately $150\ntrillion. And this AUM is significantly under allocated to alternatives. Even if individual investors\njust get to a 15% allocation, which is around half of a typical institutional target, that is still\ntrillions of dollars, so the opportunity is massive.\nThe individual investor channel is not a singular, homogenous group. It’s a broad spectrum of\nindividuals in terms of asset and accreditation levels, who are reached through a broad\nspectrum of distribution channels. Success requires a sophisticated and multi-faceted approach\nto delivering solutions to these individuals.\nFor the past several years, we’ve focused on strengthening our presence on wirehouse\ndistribution platforms. We’ve raised capital via a range of vehicles, including registered funds,\nqualified purchaser specialized funds and custom solutions for single individual investors as well\nas for advisors who may use a single tailored solutions for multiple clients. We’ve raised capital\nin the US, Europe, and Australia across absolute return strategies as well as private market\nstrategies. We’ve raised over $3.1 billion since 2020 from individual investors, comprising nearly\n10% of our fundraising over that time period.\nThe next stage of our growth plan is centered around launching a suite of interval fund private\nmarket products for both accredited and non-accredited individual investors. It will be sold\nthrough a broader range of distribution partners, including RIAs, independent broker dealers,\nand the wirehouses. Success in this market hinges on a strong investment strategy, a well-\ndesigned product, and robust distribution resources.\nThis quarter, we reached two significant milestones in our growth strategy, both centered on\nforming new partnerships around new registered products. First, we announced that we will\nserve as a core independent manager to the Axxes Private Markets Fund. We will be Axxes’\ninvestment partner, focused on sourcing and executing a diversified portfolio of private equity\nco-investments and secondaries.\nSecond, we announced a new strategic partnership with CION Investments focused on\ninfrastructure. CION has a long track record of successfully raising capital from the individual\ninvestor channel, and we’re excited to partner with them to distribute a product to a broader\naudience. As you may recall from our second quarter call, we secured a $300 million anchor\ncommitment for this effort. Such an anchor commitment is a great advantage in this market, as it\nprovides immediate scale at launch.\nWhile both of these partnerships are in their early stages, we’re very excited for their potential\ngrowth over the coming years. We also look forward to continuing to expand our suite of\nproducts and distribution capabilities. We are excited to update you on future calls about our\nachievements in this area.\nAnd with that, I’ll turn the call over to Pam.\nPam Bentley: Thanks, Jon.\nWe are pleased with our strong results in the third quarter, which built on the momentum we\nenjoyed over the first half of the year. Year-to-date Fee-Related Earnings grew 18%, Adjusted\nEBITDA grew 21%, and Adjusted Net Income grew 24% over the same period in 2023.\nAssets under management were at a record high of $80 billion as of quarter-end, a 5% increase\nfrom a year ago, and Fee-Paying AUM also increased 5% year over year, ending the quarter at\na record $64 billion. Contracted-Not-Yet-Fee-Paying AUM ended the quarter at $7.9 billion, an\n11% increase from a year ago due to stronger fundraising. As a reminder, our Contracted-Not-\nYet-Fee-Paying AUM typically converts to Fee-Paying AUM over the next few years and\nprovides a tailwind to our top-line growth.\nPrivate markets was once again a key growth driver in the quarter, with private markets Fee-\nPaying AUM growing by 7% year-over-year. Our private markets business now represents 71%\nof total AUM and 66% of our Fee-Paying AUM.\nPrivate markets management fees grew 6% for the quarter and 8% year-to-date compared to\nthe prior year. For the full year ‘24, we expect total private markets management fee growth to\nbe 9-11% over the prior year. Where we fall in this range will depend on the exact timing and\namount of specialized fund closings in the fourth quarter.\nAt the beginning of the year, we spoke about our expectation that our Absolute Return\nStrategies management fees would stabilize in ’24, and we are on track to meet that goal. Third\nquarter ARS management fees increased 2% year-over-year, and consistent with our prior\nguidance we expect full year ’24 ARS management fees to be stable relative to last year.\nTurning to our expenses, our compensation philosophy is to align and incentivize our greatest\nasset, our talent, through a combination of annual and long-term awards, including FRE-related\ncompensation, incentive fee-related compensation, and equity awards. We remain disciplined in\nmanaging compensation expenses, and third quarter FRE-related compensation with $37\nmillion. Stock-based compensation was $4 million in the quarter, and consistent with last year\nwe expect a seasonal uptick in the fourth quarter relative to Q3. We plan to continue to use our\nbuyback program to manage dilution from our equity compensation awards.\nNon-GAAP General and Administrative and other expenses were $19 million in the quarter, and\ndue to some seasonality, were down slightly on a sequential basis. We do expect those levels to\nincrease next quarter.\nPulling together these factors, on a year-over-year basis Fee-Related Earnings grew a healthy\n9% in the quarter and 18% year-to-date. As Michael noted, consistent with our long-term\nguidance, we expect to enjoy FRE growth this year consistent with our 5-year guidance to\ndouble FRE from 2023-2028.\nTurning to incentive fees, we realized $23 million in the quarter, comprised of nearly $3 million of\nARS performance fees, and more than $20 million of carried interest. As Michael noted, ARS\ninvestment performance has been very strong, positioning us to generate meaningful\nperformance fees this year. As of quarter end we had $26 million of accrued, unrealized annual\nperformance fees, which are incremental to the $13 million of annual performance fees we’ve\nrealized year-to-date.\nARS investment performance has continued to be strong thus far in Q4. Our gross unrealized\ncarried interest grew approximately 5% year-over-year to $816 million as of quarter end. We\nbelieve our incentive fees provide significant, embedded earnings potential, which we look\nforward to being unlocked as the capital markets strengthen and M&A activity accelerates.\nOur balance sheet is strong, and we are maintaining a healthy, quarterly dividend of 11 cents\nper share. There is room for future dividend growth as we enjoy positive momentum in our\nearnings. We also continue to repurchase shares under our buyback program, and year-to-date\nwe’ve repurchased $33 million of stock, leaving $32 million remaining in our share repurchase\nplan as of quarter end.\nTo close, we have confidence in our 2024 and long-term financial objectives and look forward to\nthe opportunities ahead to deliver value to our clients and shareholders.\nThank you again for joining us, and we’re now happy to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Dial-in instructions] Our first question is coming from Crispin Love with\nPiper Sandler.\nCrispin Love: Thank you. Good morning everyone. Just first off on fundraising. Michael, you\nreiterated that fundraising in the second half should be higher than the first. But just in order to\ndo that, you're going to need the best quarter of the year with over 2 billion of fundraising. First,\ncan you just speak to your confidence there? And if there is anything specific driving that that's\nworth calling out, whether it's infrastructure picking back up, continued strength in PE or just\nother areas. Thank you.\nMichael Sacks: Thank you. Thanks for the question. We wouldn't have said that with a quarter\nto go or less than a quarter to go if we weren't confident and we included what we call the near-\nterm pipeline, some of which includes opportunities where you've already won but you haven't\nfinished contracting yet and gotten going. We tried to give you an image of how significantly that\npipeline has grown from a year ago. That's something that particularly when you're talking about\nnear-term pipeline we're tracking very closely, and there are names next to numbers and that\nsort of thing.\nWe do have confidence that we are going to deliver on that. And that's a good, solid quarter of\nfundraising. It certainly wouldn't be necessarily the best quarter we ever had. We think it's\ndoable and we reiterated that because we do have confidence. And importantly, I think we also\ntried to touch on this in the prepared remarks, but it really is when you look at near-term pipeline\nverbal and in finals, like real pipeline, very near-term high visibility, it's every strategy where that\npipeline is larger than it was a year ago. Every one of our strategies.\nThe fundraising environment has improved. This is going to be an up year from a fundraising\nperspective relative to last year, and we expect it will continue to improve into next year. And\nwe're very happy about that.\nCrispin Love: Thank you, Michael. I appreciate that. Just one that's a little bit of a longer-term\nquestion. But when you think about your revenue and FRE makeup over the intermediate terms\nnext few years, can you just provide some just general thoughts here? Fee-related revenues\nhas been about 80% or so of revenues in what's been a tepid deal market. But with your carried\ninterest earnings potential and then also just following the election which has renewed some\noptimism in deal activity, would you expect that 80% share to decrease over the coming years? I\nknow it's difficult with time, but just curious on your general thoughts here.\nMichael Sacks: Well, I think a little bit that's why we talk about things the way that we do. So\nwe want to run a management fee-centric business that has good, solid top line organic growth\nand then has some margin opportunity. And we're getting very good fee-related earnings\ngrowth. As we've said and reiterated on this call, doubling from the end of '23 FRE is a goal of\nours and we think we are well on our way to that goal this year and wee are standing by our\nconfidence and our belief that we can do that. That necessitates and we believe we have real\nopportunities for solid management fee growth going forward and growth in fee-related\nearnings.\nWe also have tried to make it clear that because of the unique nature of our particular carry and\nthe history evolution of our particular carry and the macro environment where transactions were\ndepressed, we think we have very significant earnings power inside of that carry asset. We\nincluded a couple of new pieces of information in the earnings deck. We try to help you see that.\nAnd we think we have significant earnings power there. We would anticipate that our adjusted\nEBITDA and adjusted net income actually grow faster than our fee-related earnings grow over\nthe next four years or so, which we also feel very good about.\nWith regard to your comment on the election, I think the one thing that we do think is highly\nlikely as a result of the election is that transaction activity picks up and you do see more\ntransactions and that is good for the carry line and it's good for deployment. And we do think\nthat's a likely outcome of the election.\nCrispin Love: Great. Thank you and appreciate you taking my questions.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Bill Katz with TD Cowen.\nBill Katz: Okay. Thank you very much. And we did notice the extra disclosures. So thank you.\nSo maybe just coming back to the algorithm to drive toward your doubling of FRE growth. It\nsounds like you're softening up your guidance a little bit for this year from double digits down to\na 9 to 11, depending upon timing. So that would suggest a little more margin expansion. As you\nlook out over the next several years, can you unpack where you think you can get to in terms of\nthe revenue growth for FRE versus the margin? The margin looked like it improved pretty\nsignificantly quarter on quarter, including very good leverage on comp. I'm just trying to\nunderstand the algorithm as we look ahead to the next few years.\nMichael Sacks: Sure. I think that what we want to do over that time period, and obviously it's\nnot linear, but we believe you can drive. And I want to put a pin for a second in the individual\ninvestor market in answering this question. But we believe our core business, with our core\ncompetencies and capabilities now that we can drive private market management fee growth\n10% or better. We believe we get compounding and keep capital, frankly, if performance keeps\nup in ARS will at some point we'll actually see some capital come into that strategy. And so you\ncan compound your ARS. And we can see that top-line management fee growth at that 10%,\nhopefully 10% plus range over that entire period of time.\nIt'll ebb and flow in there. We'll have some years where it's higher and some years, but that's\nwhat we believe. We believe we have margins still on the FRE line. And then as we've said in\nthe script and already answering the first question, the incentive fee line for us has a lot of\nupside and it has upside in it from the asset that exists today at NAV and it has upside in it from\nall the capital that's come into the firm over the last few years that has significant carry that isn't\nyet in the money.\nThat new slide that we included, that you noted what we were trying to show you there was how\nyou had an asset, you collected most of the value of that asset as of a certain date, the assets\nmuch larger today than it was at that date despite your collections. And we have a lot of power\nbehind that asset today that you don't see yet and so we feel very good about that.\nWe're committed to getting that FRE growth through a combination of good solid top-line\norganic revenue growth and from continued margin. And then we think the adjusted EBITDA\nand adjusted net income grow faster.\nBill Katz: Okay. Very good. And then maybe one for yourself or Jon just highlighted the retail\nopportunity set. I was wondering if you could maybe expand a little bit on, I think you mentioned\na suite of services coming down the pike. I'm curious if you can talk about that. And then,\nrelatedly, maybe it's already embedded in your prepared remarks, should we assume any\nincremental expenditures needed to drive that growth? Or do you think you have the right\nresources allocated to that opportunity? Thank you.\nJon Levin: Yeah. Maybe I'll start with actually the last part of your question first, Bill, which is\nthat embedded in all the commentary Michael made with regard to our plans for the future and\nour goals with respect to the doubling of FRE in 28 as compared to '23. All of that contemplates\nin our minds whatever spending we need to do in our business to achieve those goals.\nThe reality of our business is that, and it's true, frankly, for other businesses in the space, is you\nhave the ability to, based on the top line dynamics, you have the ability to keep your existing\npool of talent happy on a year-over-year basis and invest in the business and still achieve\noperating leverage and margin expansion. And so every year we're investing in the business for\nvarious initiatives, individual investor being one of them. But that is not something that takes us\naway from the financial goals that we've laid out.\nWith regard to the broader opportunity, in individual investor, we laid out some more slides on\nthat in our presentation. We commented on it obviously in the call. And so I know that's all hard\nto digest right away, and hopefully, you'll find some of that information valuable. But the bottom\nline from our standpoint was to make a few points. The point one being we've raised over $3\nbillion of capital from the individual investor over the last few years. So it's a real business today.\nWe've raised that capital for all of our different investment verticals. We've raised it globally. And\nwe've raised it in a bunch of different types of forms already today, meaning we have registered\nfund, for example in the absolute return strategies space. We have raised it for qualified\npurchaser or institutional closed-end funds capital from individual investors that are able to buy\nthat type of product.\nWe've actually done separate account business in the individual investor channel. We've done\nthat both for individual high net worth investors, but we've also actually done it for advisors or\nadvisory firms, custom solutions that they can use for multiple clients. It's been a very active\narea of the business for us, but there's a lot more to do.\nTo your specific question, what we highlighted on today's call and really actually highlighted\nearlier in the quarter were two specific registered products that have launched or are in the\nprocess of launching - one around private equity and one around infrastructure and we're\nexcited about the prospects for both of those as well. Hopefully, that answers your question, but\nhappy to dive into any more detail on that Bill.\nBill Katz: Okay. I did pick all that up. I was intrigued by the suite of products that you had\nmentioned, but we can follow up offline. Thank you for taking the questions.\nOperator: And again, if anyone would like to ask the question, it is star one on your telephone\nkeypad. Our next question is coming from Ken Worthington with JP Morgan.\nKen Worthington: Hi. Good morning. Jon just wanted to continue the discussion on wealth\nmanagement. How do the economics work with the partnerships compared to what they might\nlook like if you sold directly through the wirehouse or RIA channel? Thinking about this on a\ndollar of AUM basis, because we assume that the partnerships will probably accelerate the\ndollar growth. Should we look at these partnerships like sub-advisor relationships so there's sort\nof an ongoing revenue share, or is it different?\nJon Levin: Yeah. Thanks, Ken. I think it's a good question. Maybe I'll make a broad comment\non it first and then can make some specific comments on the two particular partnerships we\ntalked about on today's call. I think in a broader sense of things, the idea that you can distribute\nthrough partnerships and the idea that you can distribute with your own internal distribution.\nOne, are not mutually exclusive concepts.\nYou've actually seen, I'm sure, a lot of the big brand name alts of firms that have very successful\nbusinesses in the individual investor space pursue both of those types of options\nsimultaneously. I think that the comparison of the net revenue or the net margin, whether you\nuse internal distribution or do it through partnerships, is not like a perfect science honestly. I\nthink, roughly speaking the way you can think about it is that either you have to pay for\ndistribution no matter what you do, and you can pay for distribution through partnership, or you\ncan pay through distribution through internal, and that the mass of both of those is a good\noutcome when you get to scale.\nI think I would argue that the difference between them is a little bit negligible or certainly not\nsomething that someone could do scientifically to make a clear conclusion. But I think the\nbroader point is we're going to pursue both strategies and that's been something that's worked\nout well.\nThe other point to Bill's questions was we're going to be methodical on how we invest for that\ngrowth and that it still allows us to achieve our targets. I think specifically to the partnerships\ntoday, there actually can operate all differently. So in one particular case, we're a core\nindependent manager, like a subadvisor. In that particular case, Ken, it’s kind of just like running\na separate account almost. You're running a separate account for a pool of capital that you have\na partner that is raising capital for you, obviously supporting them in that distribution process\nthrough your technical knowledge and through your manufacturing knowledge.\nYou can think about it as similar to just running a separate account. In one of the other cases,\nit's more of a call to think of it as a JV, where a dollar comes in, and you're sharing that dollar\nbetween the manufacturing and the distribution, and that speaks a little bit to the other point I\nwas making, which is you're effectively \"paying for the distribution through giving up some of the\nshares of the JV.\" But that's instead of paying your own internal distribution. And I think the math\nof it is still very good math from an asset management perspective, which is why you've seen\nothers pursue that kind of hybrid strategy. Hopefully, that gets to your question. But if there's\nanything else on that, please follow up.\nKen Worthington: Yes. That helps a lot. And then maybe just as a follow-up, you have a\nhandful of specialized funds in market. You had closes in the third quarter. You'll have more\ncloses in the fourth quarter. Can you just maybe inform us what actually had closes in 3Q and\nacknowledging anything expected 4Q can slip into 1Q depending on just sort of timing of stuff?\nWhat, at least, is the hope or expectation for which of the handful are more likely that closes in\n4Q?\nMichael Sacks: Hey, Ken, it's Michael. We're going to have closes in most of the funds and\nmarket in Q4. On our private markets full-year management fee growth rate that Pam\nreferenced, really the determining factor for where we land in that is going to be directly related\nto Q4 closes for two of our funds, specifically Elevate and IAF. As you know, every fund that we\nhave successor fund that we've brought, with the exception of one fund that was $40 million\nless than the prior series, every fund that we've brought has been higher and bigger than the\nprior series of fund.\nAs I mentioned or tried to mention, our pipeline for our specialized funds in all of our strategies\nand for our separate accounts in all of our strategies is really up significantly. And that's that\nnear-term pipeline. We plan to have Q4 closes that will help us to make those numbers that\nPam talked about and then funds continue on into next year. The only fund that we might have a\nfinal close for would be Elevate. And so otherwise, everything else is still rocking and rolling.\nAnd we feel very good about the pipeline. We feel good about our track record of growing these\nspecialized fund franchises and that's where we are on that.\nKen Worthington: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Stephanie Ma with Morgan Stanley.\nStephanie Ma: Great. Good morning. Just wanted to get your latest thoughts on the private\ncredit industry outlook, particularly after the outcome of the election. If banks now have more\nappetite to step in again, how do you think this changes the competitive dynamics in private\ncredit, and how are you thinking about implications and positioning for your business? Thanks.\nMichael Sacks: Maybe, Jon, I'll try to take a little bit of that and then you jump in if I don't don't\nget to something. But I think that the private credit space is growing. Just the conversation, the\ntrajectory is up and to the right. It's coming for very good reason. The demand is coming from\neverywhere in terms of type of client, geography of client, channel, etc. We don't think that's\nchanging. And so can growth rates move a little bit based on risk-off, risk on and appetite. Sure.\nPrivate credit space in general, which is not just one strategy. And we talked in our remarks\nabout different implementation methods that we're bringing to clients. That's just going to\ncontinue to grow. And it's just going to continue to grow. It's that we think it's a long-term trend.\nIt's not a short-term trend that's going to stop and start. It may accelerate a little and decelerate\na little, but it's going up and to the right, and it's going to go for a while. And we see it being a\nbigger and more important part of our revenue stream over time.\nJon Levin: Yeah. That's where I was going to go. Michael, I agree with that completely, which is\nI think there's, Stephanie, like cyclical aspects maybe of credit obviously like interest rates and\nthings like that. But the secular trends for the private credit evolution are far more powerful than\nanything cyclical. I think when people focus on the secular trends, a lot of times they focus on\nthe bank pullback. And the bank pullback is certainly something that we saw begin this trend\nafter the GFC. But I actually don't think that's the most powerful secular driver.\nI think the most powerful secular driver of the private credit evolution is the demand of the\ncapital. We saw it happen with public equity to private equity. We've seen it obviously happen in\nother private markets asset classes. It's that the capital would rather invest in a way where you\ndon't have the same amounts of day-to-day volatility. It might be there inherently, but it's not\nobserved. And that's a feature, not a bug of the industry. I think that that shift for where the\ncapital would rather have its money deployed in the credit markets generally is the most\npowerful trend. And that's a one-way train to the point Michael's making.\nI think there's two areas where you're still just scratching the surface. We talk a lot about\ncorporate sponsor-backed direct lending when we talk about private credit. But there's an entire\narea of credit markets outside of that that is still in the very early stages.\nThen to Michael's point, on an implementation basis, getting to a place where it looks more like\nprivate equity, looks more like infrastructure, where you have co-investing, where you have\nsecondary investing. That's going to be a huge part of the evolution and frankly, a huge part of\nwhere for in particular for GCM Grosvenor there's a tremendous amount of opportunity.\nMichael Sacks: The last thing I would just add is in terms of sort of short term, and this is not\nabout short term for us at all as both Jon and I have said. But if you believe that transaction\nactivity writ large is likely to pick up in part as a result of the election, that's not going to shrink\ndemand for private credit in the short term.\nStephanie Ma: Great. Thanks for that color.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Bill Katz with TD Cowen.\nBill Katz: Great. Thanks for taking the extra question. Just thinking through the opportunity set\non the realizations, particularly for carried interest. I'm just looking through some of your\ndisclosures. It looked like there was a reversal within the comp line. So, your comp I think was\naround 50-51% as a payout. Just wondering A, what was the reversal? And then B as you go\nforward, particularly given that the vast majority of the residual net accrued carried to GCMG is\nrising at a higher percentage of the total, how should we think about that payout ratio looking\nahead? Thank you.\nMichael Sacks: Yeah. I think that payout ratio, the idea that we're holding half of that or we're\nholding 45% of that. Without us talking to you about a change in comp philosophy, I think those\nhistoric ratios are perfectly comfortable for planning and for modeling.\nThe reality of that, depends a little bit on how robust the revenues are. I don't think just being\ncandid, it's perfectly linear. And so, that ratio can improve for the firm and improve in direction\nfor the firm if and when we see the revenues grow frankly, back to where we saw them a couple\nof years ago and in line with the very clear promise that they hold now. It's almost as the\nrevenues increase, which we expect and which we've tried to walk people through, I feel like we\nhave margin opportunity in that line absent a change in compensation philosophy, which would\nthen benefit the FRE line.\nObviously, if we were ever to talk about that, that would be a change in philosophy. But I don't\nthink what you're seeing here is just anything other than margin moving around a little bit based\non revenue level and trying to accrue throughout the year to where we think we're going to end\nup for the year. I think we have more upside opportunity in that margin, as these revenues grow,\nwhich we anticipate them growing at a fast rate. We have upside opportunity in that margin.\nAgain, absent us making some announcement like some others have, which is not something\nwe're focused on.\nBill Katz: Thank you again.\nOperator: And it appears there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the\nconference back to the company for any additional or closing remarks.\nStacie Selinger: Thank you. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today and taking the time and\nfor all of the questions. We are very happy to follow up with any additional questions or if not,\nwe look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Have a great weekend."

Of the $7.9 billion CNYFPAUM as of September 30, 2024, approximately $3.1 billion is subject to an agreed upon fee ramp in schedule that will result in management fees being charged on\napproximately $0.3 billion of such amount in the remainder of 2024, approximately $1.1 billion of such amount in 2025, and remaining approximately $1.7 billion in 2026 and beyond. With\nrespect to approximately $4.8 billion of the $7.9 billion, management fees will be charged as such capital is invested, which will depend on a number of factors, including the availability of\neligible investment opportunities.\n2. Excludes fund reimbursement revenue.\n3. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income per share are non-GAAP financial measures. See Appendix for the reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable\nGAAP metric.\n4. Reflects a corporate and blended statutory tax rate of 24.7% and 24.2% applied to Adjusted Pre-Tax Income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. The 24.7% and 24.2% are based on a federal statutory rate of 21.0% and a combined state, local and foreign rate net of federal benefits of 3.7% and 3.2%, respectively.\n5. Represents consolidated view, including all NCI and compensation related awards.\n6. Run-Rate Annual Performance Fees reflect the potential annual performance fees generated by performance fee-eligible AUM before any loss carryforwards, if applicable, at an 8% gross\nreturn for both multi-strategy and credit strategies, and a 10% gross return for specialized opportunity strategies, and before cash-based incentive fee related compensation. The majority of\nrun-rate annual performance fees relate to ARS.\n7. For Private Markets customized separate accounts from January 1, 2018 through September 30, 2024.\n8. Based on 50 largest clients by AUM as of September 30, 2024.\n9. Fundraising from December 31, 2020 through September 30, 2024.\n10. Employee data as of October 1, 2024. Individuals with dual responsibilities are counted only once.\n11. Sustainable / Impact and Alternative Credit Investments overlap with investments in other strategies.\n14. Re-up % for Private Markets customized separate accounts from January 1, 2018 through September 30, 2024.\n15. Average increase on each re-up for Private Markets customized separate accounts from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2023. Updated annually.\n16. Based on 25 largest clients firm-wide by AUM as of September 30, 2024\n17. Cumulative selected private market specialized fund closings from 2008 to 2018\n19. Sustainable and Impact Investments AUM as of September 30, 2024. AUM related to certain Sustainable and Impact investments includes mark-to-market changes for funds that charge\nmanagement fees based on commitments. Such increases in AUM do not increase FPAUM or revenue. The data regarding sustainable themes presented above and otherwise contained\nherein is based on the assessment of each such investment by GCM Grosvenor investment team members. The relevant investments are placed into categories that are generally consistent\nwith the categories presented in the UN PRI Impact Investing Market Map. Primary fund assessments are based on whether a significant part of the expected strategy of the primary fund falls\ninto a sustainable category. Co-investment categorizations are based either on categories represented by the co-investment sponsor or the underlying portfolio company. Diverse Manager\ninvestments include investments managed by or sponsored by a diverse manager, based on GCM Grosvenor’s definition of a diverse manager, which is determined by thresholds of manager\neconomic ownership by diverse parties (race, gender, sexual orientation, veterans, disabled persons). There is significant subjectivity in placing an investment in a particular category, and\nconventions and methodologies used by GCM Grosvenor in categorizing investments and calculating the data presented may differ from those used by other investment managers. Additional\ninformation regarding these conventions and methodologies is available upon request.\n20. Some investments are counted in more than one sustainable category.\n25. Excludes severance expenses of $1.1 million, $0.6 million and $0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2024, respectively, and\n$5.9 million and $1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2024, respectively.\nGCM GROSVENOR | 35\nNotes (Continued)\n26.

Since 2007.\nGCM GROSVENOR | 36\nCertain Definitions and Use of Non-GAAP Financials and\nKey Performance Indicators\nAdjusted Net Income is a non-GAAP measure that we present on a pre-tax and after-tax basis to evaluate our profitability. Adjusted Pre-Tax Income represents\nnet income attributable to GCM Grosvenor Inc. including (a) net income (loss) attributable to GCMH, excluding (b) provision (benefit) for income taxes, (c) changes in\nfair value of derivatives and warrant liabilities, (d) amortization expense, (e) partnership interest-based and non-cash compensation, (f) equity-based compensation,\nincluding cash-settled equity awards (as we view the cash settlement as a separate capital transaction), (g) unrealized investment income, (h) changes in tax receivable\nagreement liability, (i) certain other items that we believe are not indicative of our core performance, including charges related to corporate transactions, employee\nseverance, office relocation costs and loss on extinguishment of debt. Adjusted Net Income represents Adjusted Pre-Tax Income fully taxed at each period's\nblended statutory tax rate.\nAdjusted Net Income Per Share is a non-GAAP measure that is calculated by dividing Adjusted Net Income by adjusted shares outstanding. Adjusted shares\noutstanding assumes the hypothetical full exchange of limited partnership interests in GCMH into Class A common stock of GCM Grosvenor Inc., the dilution from\noutstanding warrants for Class A common stock of GCM Grosvenor Inc. and the dilution from outstanding equity-based compensation. We believe adjusted net\nincome per share is useful to investors because it enables them to better evaluate per-share performance across reporting periods.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure which represents Adjusted Net Income excluding (a) adjusted income taxes, (b) depreciation and amortization expense\nand (c) interest expense on our outstanding debt. Adjusted EBITDA Margin represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of our total operating revenues, net of\nfund expense reimbursements.\nWe believe Adjusted Pre-Tax Income, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA are useful to investors because they provide additional insight into the\noperating profitability of our core business across reporting periods. These measures (1) present a view of the economics of the underlying business as if GCMH\nEquityholders converted their interests to shares of Class A common stock and (2) adjust for certain non-cash and other activity in order to provide more comparable\nresults of the core business across reporting periods. These measures are used by management in budgeting, forecasting and evaluating operating results.\nFee-Related Revenue (\"FRR\") is a non-GAAP measure used to highlight revenues from recurring management fees and administrative fees. FRR represents total\noperating revenues less (a) incentive fees and (b) fund reimbursement revenue. We believe FRR is useful to investors because it provides additional insight into our\nrelatively stable management fee base separate from incentive fee revenues, which tend to have greater variability.\nFee-Related Earnings (“FRE”) is a non-GAAP measure used to highlight earnings from recurring management fees and administrative fees. FRE represents\nAdjusted EBITDA further adjusted to exclude (a) incentive fees and related compensation and (b) other non-operating income, and to include depreciation expense. We\nbelieve FRE is useful to investors because it provides additional insights into the management fee driven operating profitability of our business. FRE Margin represents\nFRE as a percentage of our management fee and other operating revenue, net of fund expense reimbursements.\nNet Incentive Fees Attributable to GCM Grosvenor is a non-GAAP measure used to highlight fees earned from incentive fees that are attributable to GCM\nGrosvenor. Net incentive fees represent incentive fees excluding (a) incentive fees contractually owed to others and (b) cash-based incentive fee related compensation.\nNet incentive fees provide investors useful information regarding the amount that such fees contribute to the Company’s earnings and are used by management in\nmaking compensation and capital allocation decisions.\nGCM GROSVENOR | 37\nCertain Definitions and Use of Non-GAAP Financials and\nKey Performance Indicators (continued)\nFee-Paying Assets Under Management (“FPAUM” or “Fee-Paying AUM\") is a key performance indicator we use to measure the assets from which we earn\nmanagement fees. Our FPAUM comprises the assets in our customized separate accounts and specialized funds from which we derive management fees. We\nclassify customized separate account revenue as management fees if the client is charged an asset-based fee, which includes the vast majority of our discretionary\nAUM accounts. The FPAUM for our private market strategies typically represents committed, invested or scheduled capital during the investment period and\ninvested capital following the expiration or termination of the investment period. Substantially all of our private markets strategies funds earn fees based on\ncommitments or net invested capital, which are not affected by market appreciation or depreciation. Our FPAUM for our absolute return strategy is based on net\nasset value.\nOur calculations of FPAUM may differ from the calculations of other asset managers, and as a result, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures\npresented by other asset managers. Our definition of FPAUM is not based on any definition that is set forth in the agreements governing the customized separate\naccounts or specialized funds that we manage.\nContracted, Not Yet Fee-Paying AUM (“CNYFPAUM”) represents limited partner commitments which are expected to be invested and begin charging fees\nover the ensuing five years.\nNew Capital Raised is new limited partner commitments where fees are charged immediately at the initial commitment date.\nAssets Under Management (“AUM”) reflects the sum of (a) FPAUM, (b) CNYFPAUM and (c) other mark-to-market, insider capital and non-fee-paying assets\nunder management.\nGCM Grosvenor refers to the combined accounts of (a) Grosvenor Capital Management Holdings, LLLP (\"LLLP\" or \"GCMH\"), an Delaware limited liability limited\npartnership, and its consolidated subsidiaries and (b) GCM, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company.\nGCM Grosvenor Inc. is a Delaware corporation listed on the Nasdaq under the symbol \"GCMG\"\nNM Not Meaningful\nLTM Last Twelve Months\nGCM GROSVENOR | 38\nDisclosures\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe non-GAAP financial measures contained in this presentation are not GAAP measures of GCM Grosvenor’s financial performance or liquidity and should not be\nconsidered as alternatives to net income (loss) as a measure of financial performance or cash flows from operations as measures of liquidity, or any other performance\nmeasure derived in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of such non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measure is included elsewhere in\nthis presentation. You are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment to non-GAAP financial measures and the reasons management considers it appropriate for\nsupplemental analysis. Our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-\nrecurring items. In addition, these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in our industry or across different industries.\nThis presentation includes certain projections of non-GAAP financial measures including fee-related earnings. Due to the high variability and difficulty in making\naccurate forecasts and projections of some of the information excluded from these projected measures, together with some of the excluded information not being\nascertainable or accessible, GCM Grosvenor is unable to quantify certain amounts that would be required to be included in the most directly comparable GAAP\nfinancial measures without unreasonable effort. Consequently, no disclosure of estimated comparable GAAP measures is included and no reconciliation of the forward\nlooking non GAAP financial measures is included.\nShare Repurchase Plan Authorization\nGCMG’s Board of Directors previously authorized a share repurchase plan, which may be used to repurchase outstanding Class A common stock and warrants in\nopen market transactions, in privately negotiated transactions including with employees or otherwise, as well as to retire (by cash settlement or the payment of tax\nwithholding amounts upon net settlement) equity-based awards granted under the Company’s Amended and Restated 2020 Incentive Award Plan (or any successor\nequity plan thereto). The Company is not obligated under the terms of plan to repurchase any of its Class A common stock or warrants, and the size and timing of\nthese repurchases will depend on legal requirements, price, market and economic conditions and other factors. The plan has no expiration date and the plan may be\nsuspended or terminated by the Company at any time without prior notice. Any outstanding shares of Class A common stock and any warrants repurchased as part\nof this plan will be cancelled. As of September 30, 2024, the total share repurchase plan authorization is $140.0 million.\nGCM GROSVENOR | 39"

You are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment to non-GAAP financial\nmeasures and the reasons management considers it appropriate for supplemental analysis. Our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be\nunaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. In addition, these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in our industry or across different industries.\nAdjusted Net Income is a non-GAAP measure that we present on a pre-tax and after-tax basis to evaluate our profitability. Adjusted Pre-Tax Income represents net income attributable to GCM\nGrosvenor Inc. including (a) net income (loss) attributable to GCMH, excluding (b) provision (benefit) for income taxes, (c) changes in fair value of derivatives and warrant liabilities, (d) amortization\nexpense, (e) partnership interest-based and non-cash compensation, (f) equity-based compensation, including cash-settled equity awards (as we view the cash settlement as a separate capital\ntransaction), (g) unrealized investment income, (h) changes in tax receivable agreement liability and (i) certain other items that we believe are not indicative of our core performance, including charges\nrelated to corporate transactions, employee severance, New York office relocation costs and loss on extinguishment of debt. Adjusted Net Income represents Adjusted Pre-Tax Income fully taxed\nat each period’s blended statutory tax rate.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure which represents Adjusted Net Income excluding (a) adjusted income taxes, (b) depreciation and amortization expense and (c) interest expense on our\noutstanding debt.\nWe believe Adjusted Pre-Tax Income, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA are useful to investors because they provide additional insight into the operating profitability of our core\nbusiness across reporting periods. These measures (1) present a view of the economics of the underlying business as if GCMH Equityholders converted their interests to shares of Class A common\nstock and (2) adjust for certain non-cash and other activity in order to provide more comparable results of the core business across reporting periods. These measures are used by management in\nbudgeting, forecasting and evaluating operating results.\nAdjusted Net Income Per Share is a non-GAAP measure that is calculated by dividing adjusted net income by adjusted shares outstanding. Adjusted shares outstanding assumes the hypothetical\nfull exchange of limited partnership interests in GCMH into Class A common stock of GCM Grosvenor Inc., the dilution from outstanding warrants for Class A common stock of GCM Grosvenor Inc.\nand the dilution from outstanding equity-based compensation. We believe adjusted net income per share is useful to investors because it enables them to better evaluate per-share performance\nacross reporting periods.\nFee-Related Revenue (“FRR”) is a non-GAAP measure used to highlight revenues from recurring management fees and administrative fees. FRR represents total operating revenues less (a)\nincentive fees and (b) fund reimbursement revenue. We believe FRR is useful to investors because it provides additional insight into our relatively stable management fee base separate from incentive\nfee revenues, which tend to have greater variability.\nFee-Related Earnings (“FRE”) is a non-GAAP measure used to highlight earnings from recurring management fees and administrative fees. FRE represents Adjusted EBITDA further adjusted to\nexclude (a) incentive fees and related compensation and (b) other non-operating income, and to include depreciation expense. We believe FRE is useful to investors because it provides additional\ninsights into the management fee driven operating profitability of our business.\nNet Incentive Fees Attributable to GCM Grosvenor is a non-GAAP measure used to highlight fees earned from incentive fees that are attributable to GCM Grosvenor. Net incentive fees represent\nincentive fees excluding (a) incentive fees contractually owed to others and (b) cash-based incentive fee related compensation. Net incentive fees provide investors useful information regarding the\namount that such fees contribute to the Company’s earnings and are used by management in making compensation and capital allocation decisions.\n20\nCertain Definitions and Use of Non-GAAP Financials and Key\nPerformance Indicators (continued)\nFee-Paying Assets Under Management (“FPAUM” or “Fee-Paying AUM\") is a key performance indicator we use to measure the assets from which we earn management fees. Our FPAUM\ncomprises the assets in our customized separate accounts and specialized funds from which we derive management fees. We classify customized separate account revenue as management fees if\nthe client is charged an asset-based fee, which includes the vast majority of our discretionary AUM accounts. The FPAUM for our private market strategies typically represents committed, invested or\nscheduled capital during the investment period and invested capital following the expiration or termination of the investment period. Substantially all of our private markets strategies funds earn fees\nbased on commitments or net invested capital, which are not affected by market appreciation or depreciation. Our FPAUM for our absolute return strategy is based on net asset value.\nOur calculations of FPAUM may differ from the calculations of other asset managers, and as a result, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers.\nOur definition of FPAUM is not based on any definition that is set forth in the agreements governing the customized separate accounts or specialized funds that we manage.\nContracted, Not Yet Fee-Paying AUM (“CNYFPAUM”) represents limited partner commitments which are expected to be invested and begin charging fees over the ensuing five years.\nNew Capital Raised is new limited partner commitments where fees are charged immediately at the initial commitment date.\nAssets Under Management (“AUM”) reflects the sum of (a) FPAUM, (b) CNYFPAUM and (c) other mark-to-market, insider capital and non-fee-paying assets under management.\nGCM Grosvenor refers to the combined accounts of (a) Grosvenor Capital Management Holdings, LLLP (\"LLLP\" or \"GCMH\"), an Delaware limited liability limited partnership, and its consolidated\nsubsidiaries and (b) GCM, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company.\nGCM Grosvenor Inc. is a Delaware corporation listed on the Nasdaq under the symbol \"GCMG\"\n21"
