Our Credit Agreement defines Adjusted EBITDA (which we call “Credit Adjusted EBITDA”) as net income before (i) interest expense, (ii) interest income, (iii) provision for income taxes, (iv) depreciation and amortization expense, (v) impairment charges, (vi) stock-based compensation, (vii) contingent consideration, (viii) acquisition and related expenses, and (ix) certain other items. We calculate Credit Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Credit Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenues.\n\nCredit Adjusted EBITDA and Credit Adjusted EBITDA Margin as calculated herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies within the industry and are not determined in accordance with GAAP. Our presentation of Credit Adjusted EBITDA and Credit Adjusted EBITDA Margin should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or unexpected items.\n\n**RECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME TO CREDIT ADJUSTED EBITDA**  \n---  \n**(In millions)**  \n**Three months ended September 30,** | **Nine months ended September 30,**  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \n**Net income** | $ | 39.3 | $ | 37.9 | $ | 178.9 | $ | 197.7  \nProvision for income taxes | 24.4 | 26.9 | 80.0 | 107.0  \nInterest expense and other, net | 33.8 | 25.2 | 77.4 | 76.9  \nDepreciation and amortization | 39.2 | 38.4 | 117.1 | 116.0  \n**EBITDA** | 136.7 | 128.4 | 453.4 | 497.6  \nStock-based compensation(1) | 23.6 | 28.0 | 70.2 | 82.5  \nImpairment charge | 29.3 | 41.6 | 36.3 | 51.3  \nChanges in estimated value of contingent consideration | (2.4 | ) | — | (15.8 | ) | —  \nAcquisition and related expenses(2) | 7.0 | 5.6 | 9.7 | 8.7  \nOther items(3) | 3.0 | 2.0 | 20.0 | 3.2  \n**Credit Adjusted EBITDA** | $ | 197.2 | $ | 205.6 | $ | 573.8 | $ | 643.3  \n**Net income margin** | 6.3 | % | 6.0 | % | 9.4 | % | 10.2 | %  \n**Credit Adjusted EBITDA margin** | 31.8 | % | 32.6 | % | 30.2 | % | 33.3 | %  \n**_________**  \n(1) Reflects, for all periods, stock-based compensation expense related to the issuance of equity awards to our employees.  \n(2) Includes costs incurred to evaluate and pursue acquisition activities as well as costs incurred by the Company in connection with the evaluation of strategic alternatives.  \n(3) The amounts for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 consists primarily of $2.0 million and $16.7 million, respectively, incurred by the Company for severance.
