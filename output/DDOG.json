Governance](https://imgix.datadoghq.com/img/esg-report/esg-lp-cover-desktop.png?ch=Width,DPR,Save-Data&fm=png&auto=format&fit=max)\n\n# Environmental, Social, and Governance\n\n[READ THE REPORT](https://www.datadoghq.com/pdf/dd-esg-report-241023-3.pdf)\n\nThe 2023 Environmental, Social, and Governance Report addresses those ESG topics that we believe our investors, employees, customers, vendors, and other stakeholders consider the most important. We look forward to reporting our progress as we further integrate sustainability into our operations.\n\n![Photo of Bits mascot with recycling bins](https://imgix.datadoghq.com/img/esg-report/bits-photo-alt.jpg?ch=Width,DPR,Save-Data&fm=jpg&auto=format&fit=max&w=562&h=338)\n\nEnvironment\n\nWe expanded our carbon footprint assessment, and are sharing our Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions for 2023. In addition, we are establishing a commitment to offset 100% of our residual Scope 1 and 2 emissions for 2023 and future years. To do so, we plan to power more of our leased offices with renewable energy, where available, and to source renewable energy credits or carbon removal credits for all remaining Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.\n\nGovernance\n\nESG is a key priority at Datadog, with direct oversight from the Board of Directors and management. Our board as a whole and through its committees oversees ESG governance, and is advised by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (NCG Committee), which oversees the company’s ESG programs. Our Audit Committee oversees financial reporting risks, including internal controls, enterprise risk assessment, cybersecurity and privacy, and our Compensation Committee oversees company risks and policies related to compensation, recruiting, talent development, retention and diversity of our global workforce.\n\nDiversity, Equity & Inclusion\n\nAt Datadog, diversity means making a conscious effort to reflect the many experiences and identities of the world outside while treating each other with fairness and without bias. Inclusion is the choice we make everyday to foster an environment where people of all backgrounds not only belong, but excel, so that we can succeed together as a company.\n\n## 50%\n\nof our board is composed of racially/ethnically diverse members\n\n## >$1.1M\n\ndonated by Datadog Cares, together with our employees in 2023\n\n## >80%\n\nEmployee survey participation and favorability scores\n\n## Giving Back\n\nAt Datadog we believe in using our resources to support our global communities. We accomplish this through our philanthropy program, Datadog Cares. We held an end of year giving campaign called the All Pack Give Back where employees allocated funds given to them by Datadog to one or more of our outlined causes. Led by our employees, this campaign alone resulted in over $500,000 given to over 75 organizations in 2023.\n\n![giving back team photo](https://imgix.datadoghq.com/img/esg-report/group-photo.jpg?ch=Width,DPR,Save-Data&fm=jpg&auto=format&fit=max&w=562&h=338)\n\nOur commitment to reduce or offset our Scope 1 and 2 emissions is a “forward-looking” statement. See the Appendix to our ESG Report for important information regarding this commitment.\n\n![Learn more in our 2023 ESG Report](https://imgix.datadoghq.com/img/esg-report/cta-background.png?ch=Width,DPR,Save-Data&fm=png&auto=format&fit=max)\n\n## Learn more in our 2023 ESG Report\n\n[READ THE REPORT](https://www.datadoghq.com/pdf/dd-esg-report-241023-3.pdf)\n\n###### Request a personalized demo with a Datadog engineer\n\n×\n\n*\n\nFirst Name*\n\n*\n\nLast Name*\n\n*\n\nBusiness Email*\n\n*\n\nCompany*\n\n*\n\nJob Title*\n\n*\n\nPhone Number\n\n*\n\nHow are you currently monitoring your infrastructure and applications?\n\nBy submitting this form, you agree to the [Privacy Policy](https://www.datadoghq.com/legal/privacy/) and [Cookie Policy.](https://www.datadoghq.com/legal/cookies/)\n\nRequest a Demo\n\nGet Started with Datadog\n\nGet Started with Datadog\n\n×\n"

(NASDAQ: DDOG), the monitoring and security platform for cloud applications, today announced the launch of Kubernetes Active Remediation, which builds on Datadog's automated troubleshooting capabilities to provide curated remediation guidance, best practices and end-to-end issue management for Kubernetes organizations.\n\n[ ![Datadog logo \\(PRNewsfoto/Datadog, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1730117/Datadog_logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1730117/Datadog_logo.html)\n\nTraditional monitoring tools track health and performance based on metrics, but teams need deeper insights and guidance to navigate the complexities of Kubernetes environments. Teams are also often slowed down by the limited availability of their organization's internal Kubernetes experts. Without actionable recommendations, diagnosing the root cause of issues can be time consuming and resource intensive, leading to prolonged downtime and decreased operational efficiency.\n\nKubernetes Active Remediation offers the deeper insights at scale that teams need by providing a comprehensive overview of cluster-level resource problems ranked by their importance and relevance. After a problematic cluster or workload has been identified, teams can view consolidated troubleshooting information, including root cause analysis and recommended fixes. They can then directly trigger deployment patches for the key issues from within the Datadog platform.\n\n\"Today's announcement builds on our launch of _[Kubernetes Autoscaling at DASH](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4299808-1&h=3388839094&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.datadoghq.com%2Fabout%2Flatest-news%2Fpress-releases%2Fdatadog-announces-kubernetes-autoscaling-to-help-teams-intelligently-optimize-resources-and-cloud-costs%2F&a=Kubernetes+Autoscaling+at+DASH)_ to empower users to detect issues, gain contextual insights and make changes to their Kubernetes resources directly from Datadog's unified platform,\" said Yrieix Garnier, VP of Product at Datadog. \"Customers are looking for help to identify an issue, curate data about it and take steps to solve it. Kubernetes Active Remediation will help customers do just that so they can resolve issues faster.\"\n\nKubernetes Active Remediation helps organizations:\n\n  * **Automate root-cause analysis and detection** : Recommendations are automatically issued with full contextual data and triaged to the correct owner. Curated remediation actions can also be pre-approved by the DevOps or security teams to automate the process downstream.\n  * **Directly repair Kubernetes environments** : Explanations and suggestions are provided based on troubleshooting patterns that are commonly seen in Kubernetes environments. Once the user has the full context and recommended next steps, they can directly trigger deployment patches from within Datadog to remediate the issue.\n  * **Improve troubleshooting and remediation speed** : By accelerating a user's time to detect and resolve an issue, Datadog helps application development teams be more efficient, understand root causes and automate their remediation processes.\n\n\n\nKubernetes Active Remediation is now in preview.

Datadog's DEM solution includes Synthetic Monitoring and Testing, Real User Monitoring (RUM), Product Analytics, Session Replay, and Error Tracking capabilities for browser and mobile applications. \n  * Released its _State of Cloud Security 2024_ report. The report found that long-lived credentials continue to be a major risk for organizations across all cloud providers. \n  * Announced the General Availability of Datadog Monitoring for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, which provides visibility into Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, on-premises and other cloud environments. \n  * Named a Leader in the 2024 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Observability Platforms.

Accordingly, reconciliation is not available without unreasonable effort, although it is important to note that these factors could be material to Datadog's results computed in accordance with GAAP.\n\n**Conference Call Details:**\n\n  * **What:** Datadog financial results for the third quarter of 2024 and outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year 2024 \n  * **When:** November 7, 2024 at 8:00 A.M.

These forward-looking statements are based on Datadog's current assumptions, expectations and beliefs and are subject to substantial risks, uncertainties, assumptions and changes in circumstances that may cause Datadog's actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statement.\n\nThe risks and uncertainties referred to above include, but are not limited to (1) our recent rapid growth may not be indicative of our future growth; (2) our history of operating losses; (3) our limited operating history; (4) our dependence on existing customers purchasing additional subscriptions and products from us and renewing their subscriptions; (5) our ability to attract new customers; (6) our ability to effectively develop and expand our sales and marketing capabilities; (7) risk of a security breach; (8) risk of interruptions or performance problems associated with our products and platform capabilities; (9) our ability to adapt and respond to rapidly changing technology or customer needs; (10) the competitive markets in which we participate; (11) risks associated with successfully managing our growth; and (12) general market, political, economic, and business conditions including concerns about reduced economic growth and associated decreases in information technology spending. These risks and uncertainties are more fully described in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including in the section entitled \"Risk Factors\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 24, 2024. Additional information will be made available in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and other filings and reports that we may file from time to time with the SEC. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, achievements, or events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will occur. Forward-looking statements represent our beliefs and assumptions only as of the date of this press release. We disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements.\n\n**About Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nDatadog discloses the following non-GAAP financial measures in this release and the earnings call referencing this press release: non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses (research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative), non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) per diluted share, non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic share, free cash flow and free cash flow margin. Datadog uses each of these non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes, for short- and long-term operating plans, and to evaluate Datadog's financial performance. Datadog believes they are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, in evaluating its operational performance, as further discussed below. Datadog's non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in its industry, as other companies in its industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently, particularly related to non-recurring and unusual items. In addition, there are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and exclude expenses that may have a material impact on Datadog's reported financial results.\n\nNon-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the historical non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included below in this press release.\n\nDatadog defines non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses (research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative), non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP net income (loss) as the respective GAAP balances, adjusted for, as applicable: (1) stock-based compensation expense; (2) the amortization of acquired intangibles; (3) employer payroll taxes on employee stock transactions; (4) amortization of issuance costs; and (5) an assumed provision for income taxes based on our long-term projected tax rate. Our estimated long-term projected tax rate is subject to change for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in Datadog's geographic earnings mix, or other changes to our strategy or business operations. We will re-evaluate our long-term projected tax rate as appropriate. Datadog defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, minus capital expenditures and minus capitalized software development costs, if any. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these historical non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\n\nManagement believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and others in assessing Datadog's operating performance due to the following factors:\n\n_Stock-based compensation._ Datadog utilizes stock-based compensation to attract and retain employees. It is principally aimed at aligning their interests with those of its stockholders and at long-term retention, rather than to address operational performance for any particular period. As a result, stock-based compensation expenses vary for reasons that are generally unrelated to financial and operational performance in any particular period.\n\n_Amortization of acquired intangibles._ Datadog views amortization of acquired intangible assets as items arising from pre-acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition. While these intangible assets are evaluated for impairment regularly, amortization of the cost of acquired intangibles is an expense that is not typically affected by operations during any particular period.\n\n_Employer payroll taxes on employee stock transactions._ Datadog excludes employer payroll tax expense on equity incentive plans as these expenses are tied to the exercise or vesting of underlying equity awards and the price of Datadog's common stock at the time of vesting or exercise. As a result, these taxes may vary in any particular period independent of the financial and operating performance of Datadog's business.\n\n_Amortization of issuance costs._ In June 2020, Datadog issued $747.5 million of convertible senior notes due 2025, which bear interest at an annual fixed rate of 0.125%. Debt issuance costs, which reduce the carrying value of the convertible debt instrument, are amortized as interest expense over the term. The expense for the amortization of debt issuance costs is a non-cash item, and we believe the exclusion of this interest expense will provide for a more useful comparison of our operational performance in different periods.\n\nAdditionally, Datadog's management believes that the non-GAAP financial measure free cash flow is meaningful to investors because it is a measure of liquidity that provides useful information in understanding and evaluating the strength of our liquidity and future ability to generate cash that can be used for strategic opportunities or investing in our business. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities, reduced by capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs, if any. The reduction of capital expenditures and amounts capitalized for software development facilitates comparisons of Datadog's liquidity on a period-to-period basis and excludes items that management does not consider to be indicative of our liquidity.\n\n**Operating Metrics**\n\nDatadog's number of customers with ARR of $100,000 or more is based on the ARR of each customer, as of the last month of the quarter.\n\nWe define the number of customers as the number of accounts with a unique account identifier for which we have an active subscription in the period indicated. Users of our free trials or tier are not included in our customer count. A single organization with multiple divisions, segments or subsidiaries is generally counted as a single customer. However, in some cases where they have separate billing terms, we may count separate divisions, segments or subsidiaries as multiple customers.\n\nWe define ARR as the annualized revenue run-rate of subscription agreements from all customers at a point in time. We calculate ARR by taking the monthly recurring revenue, or MRR, and multiplying it by 12. MRR for each month is calculated by aggregating, for all customers during that month, monthly revenue from committed contractual amounts, additional usage, usage from subscriptions for a committed contractual amount of usage that is delivered as used, and monthly subscriptions. ARR and MRR should be viewed independently of revenue, and do not represent our revenue under GAAP on a monthly or annualized basis, as they are operating metrics that can be impacted by contract start and end dates and renewal rates. ARR and MRR are not intended to be replacements or forecasts of revenue.\n\n**Datadog, Inc.**  \n---  \n**Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations**  \n(In thousands, except per share data; unaudited)  \n**Three Months Ended****September 30 ,**| **Nine Months Ended****September 30 ,**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nRevenue| $ 690,016| $ 547,536| $ 1,946,548| $ 1,538,710  \nCost of revenue (1)(2)(3)| 137,756| 103,319| 371,353| 305,079  \nGross profit| 552,260| 444,217| 1,575,195| 1,233,631  \nOperating expenses:  \nResearch and development (1)(3)| 291,802| 240,225| 836,389| 709,197  \nSales and marketing (1)(2)(3)| 187,772| 156,870| 548,658| 449,296  \nGeneral and administrative (1)(3)| 52,408| 51,352| 145,256| 136,344  \nTotal operating expenses| 531,982| 448,447| 1,530,303| 1,294,837  \nOperating income (loss)| 20,278| (4,230)| 44,892| (61,206)  \nOther income:  \nInterest expense (4)| (1,574)| (1,303)| (4,425)| (5,010)  \nInterest income and other income, net| 37,432| 29,833| 109,647| 69,184  \nOther income, net| 35,858| 28,530| 105,222| 64,174  \nIncome before provision for income taxes| 56,136| 24,300| 150,114| 2,968  \nProvision for income taxes| 4,439| 1,670| 11,962| 8,393  \nNet income (loss)| $ 51,697| $ 22,630| $ 138,152| $ (5,425)  \nNet income (loss) per share - basic| $ 0.15| $ 0.07| $ 0.41| $ (0.02)  \nNet income (loss) per share - diluted| $ 0.14| $ 0.06| $ 0.39| $ (0.02)  \nWeighted average shares used in calculating net income (loss) per share:  \nBasic| 337,562| 325,557| 334,779| 322,395  \nDiluted| 357,635| 351,309| 357,331| 322,395  \n(1) Includes stock-based compensation expense as follows:  \nCost of revenue| $ 6,249| $ 4,570| $ 18,169| $ 12,452  \nResearch and development| 90,507| 79,174| 266,025| 229,607  \nSales and marketing| 30,749| 26,159| 88,481| 75,057  \nGeneral and administrative| 14,685| 13,211| 39,200| 37,063  \nTotal| $ 142,190| $ 123,114| $ 411,875| $ 354,179  \n(2) Includes amortization of acquired intangibles as follows:  \nCost of revenue| $ 1,230| $ 1,974| $ 4,538| $ 6,054  \nSales and marketing| 208| 208| 618| 617  \nTotal| $ 1,438| $ 2,182| $ 5,156| $ 6,671  \n(3) Includes employer payroll taxes on employee stock transactions as follows:  \nCost of revenue| $ 118| $ 107| $ 378| $ 276  \nResearch and development| 6,316| 5,260| 23,724| 15,213  \nSales and marketing| 1,060| 2,980| 3,821| 5,008  \nGeneral and administrative| 1,621| 1,342| 5,199| 3,450  \nTotal| $ 9,115| $ 9,689| $ 33,122| $ 23,947  \n(4) Includes amortization of issuance costs as follows:  \nInterest expense| $ 912| $ 848| $ 2,672| $ 2,539  \nTotal| $ 912| $ 848| $ 2,672| $ 2,539  \n  \n**Datadog, Inc.**  \n---  \n**Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets**  \n(In thousands;

As organizations face economic slowdown, it has become very important for them to provide the best digital experience to customers, so they don't switch brands due to a bad experience.\" (Gartner, Market Guide for Digital Experience Monitoring, Mrudula Bangera, Gregg Siegfried, Padraig Byrne, November 20, 2023).\n\nDatadog's Digital Experience Monitoring tools offer deep, actionable insights into the availability, performance and quality of the user experience to empower organizations like Redzone QAD, which uses _[Datadog Synthetic Monitoring](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4285595-1&h=1768867717&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.datadoghq.com%2Fproduct%2Fsynthetic-monitoring%2F&a=Datadog+Synthetic+Monitoring)_ , with actionable insights that help ensure seamless and reliable digital experiences.\n\n\"We can create tests without writing any code, easily debug issues with step-by-step screenshots for each test run and have all of our end-to-end testing in one place, which makes it easy to bring more people into the testing process,\" said Ronald Davis, SVP of Product Engineering at Redzone QAD.\n\nThe _2024 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Digital Experience Monitoring_ is now available for download here: _[https://www.datadoghq.com/resources/gartner-magic-quadrant-digital-experience-monitoring-2024/](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4285595-1&h=3889039610&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.datadoghq.com%2Fresources%2Fgartner-magic-quadrant-digital-experience-monitoring-2024%2F&a=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.datadoghq.com%2Fresources%2Fgartner-magic-quadrant-digital-experience-monitoring-2024%2F)_.
