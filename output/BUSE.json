Adjusted net income1, which excludes the impact of acquisition and restructuring expenses, was $33.5 million, or $0.58 per diluted common share, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $29.0 million, or $0.50 per diluted common share, for the second quarter of 2024 and $30.7 million or $0.55 per diluted common share for the third quarter of 2023. Annualized return on average assets and annualized return on average tangible common equity1 were 1.06% and 12.80%, respectively, for the third quarter of 2024. Annualized adjusted return on average assets1 and annualized adjusted return on average tangible common equity1 were 1.11% and 13.41%, respectively, for the third quarter of 2024.\n\nThird quarter results included $0.8 million in net securities gains, nearly all of which were unrealized, as well as immaterial follow-on adjustments from the mortgage servicing rights sale previously announced in the first quarter of 2024. Excluding these items, adjusted noninterest income1 was $35.1 million, or 29.9% of operating revenue1, during the third quarter of 2024, compared to $33.9 million, or 29.1% of operating revenue, for the second quarter of 2024 and $31.3 million, or 28.7% of operating revenue, for the third quarter of 2023. Further adjusted net income1 was $32.9 million for the third quarter of 2024 with these items excluded, equating to further adjusted earnings1 of $0.57 per diluted common share.\n\nPre-provision net revenue1 was $41.7 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $41.1 million for the second quarter of 2024 and $38.1 million for the third quarter of 2023. Pre-provision net revenue to average assets1 was 1.38% for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 1.37% for the second quarter of 2024, and 1.24% for the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted pre-provision net revenue1 was $44.1 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $42.6 million for the second quarter of 2024 and $40.5 million for the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted pre-provision net revenue to average assets1 was 1.46% for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 1.42% for the second quarter of 2024 and 1.32% for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nOur fee-based businesses continue to add revenue diversification. Total noninterest income was $36.0 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $33.8 million for the second quarter of 2024 and $31.0 million for the third quarter of 2023. Busey’s Wealth Management and FirsTech operating segments contributed $16.2 million and $5.6 million, respectively, to our noninterest income for the third quarter of 2024, representing 60.4% of noninterest income on a combined basis.\n\nBusey views certain non-operating items, including acquisition-related expenses and restructuring charges, as adjustments to net income reported under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). Non-operating pretax adjustments for acquisition and restructuring expenses1 were $1.9 million in the third quarter of 2024. Busey believes that its non-GAAP measures (which are identified with the endnote labeled as 1) facilitate the assessment of its financial results and peer comparability. For more information and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures in tabular form, see _\"_Non-GAAP Financial Information_ \"_.\n\nWe remain deliberate in our efforts to prudently manage our expense base and operating efficiency given the economic outlook. Noninterest expense was $75.9 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $75.5 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $70.9 million in the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted core expense1, which excludes the amortization of intangible assets and new markets tax credits, acquisition and restructuring expenses, and the provision for unfunded commitments, was $71.0 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $71.1 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $66.0 million in the third quarter of 2023. The year-over-year comparable period growth in adjusted core expense can be attributed primarily to the acquisition of M&M and general inflationary pressures on compensation and benefits and to a lesser extent certain other expense categories.\n\nQuarterly pre-tax expense synergies resulting from our acquisition of Merchants and Manufacturers Bank Corporation (the “M&M acquisition”) are anticipated to be $1.6 million to $1.7 million per quarter when fully realized. Quarterly run-rate savings are projected to be achieved by the first quarter of 2025. During the third quarter of 2024, we achieved approximately 79% of the full quarterly savings. We expect to continue to prudently manage our expenses and to realize increased rates of M&M acquisition synergies during the final quarter of 2024.\n\n_**Planned Partnership with CrossFirst**_\n\nOn August 26, 2024, Busey and CrossFirst Bankshares, Inc. (“CrossFirst”) entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the “merger agreement”) pursuant to which CrossFirst will merge with and into Busey (the “merger”) and CrossFirst’s wholly-owned subsidiary, CrossFirst Bank, will merge with and into Busey Bank. This partnership will create a premier commercial bank in the Midwest, Southwest, and Florida, with 77 full-service locations across 10 states—Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas—and approximately $20 billion in combined assets, $17 billion in total deposits, $15 billion in total loans, and $14 billion in wealth assets under care.\n\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement, CrossFirst stockholders will have the right to receive for each share of CrossFirst common stock 0.6675 of a share of Busey’s common stock. Upon completion of the transaction, Busey’s stockholders will own approximately 63.5% of the combined company and CrossFirst’s stockholders will own approximately 36.5% of the combined company, on a fully-diluted basis. Busey common stock will continue to trade on the Nasdaq under the “BUSE” stock ticker symbol.\n\nCompletion of the merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval of both Busey and CrossFirst stockholders and the regulatory approvals for the merger and the bank merger. With approvals, the parties expect to close the merger in the first or second quarter of 2025. The combined holding company will continue to operate under the First Busey Corporation name and the combined bank will operate under the Busey Bank name. It is anticipated that CrossFirst Bank will merge with and into Busey Bank in mid-2025. At the time of the bank merger, CrossFirst Bank locations will become banking centers of Busey Bank. In connection with the merger, Busey incurred one-time pretax acquisition-related expenses of $1.3 million during the third quarter of 2024.\n\nFor further details on the merger, see [_Busey’s Current Report on Form 8‑K_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=-2PyC25oLeE471kGkEPaiwPO8nV1rp2FRg6ApdQVbxh1K97HQycFYALixb2bPC8PMgu0tatoMyqlo_UxFerSFfO04zR31QmT0KsSAVOs17b7Nh3ih9QvpCxvLW1M4os6hplD_QuCuWj0HT9K1QZCsq3VoQ95MeV2-Z7SrDlTlfA_f3wsirbLz49J83lB7Tr_rRtAdkXsm9kYuDh6XGvDpQ==) announcing the merger, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on August 27, 2024.\n\n_**Busey’s Conservative Banking Strategy**_\n\nBusey’s financial strength is built on a long-term conservative operating approach. That focus will not change now or in the future.\n\nThe quality of our core deposit franchise is a critical value driver of our institution. Our granular deposit base continues to position us well, with core deposits1 representing 96.5% of our deposits as of September 30, 2024. Our retail deposit base was comprised of more than 253,000 accounts with an average balance of $22 thousand and an average tenure of 16.7 years as of September 30, 2024. Our commercial deposit base was comprised of more than 33,000 accounts with an average balance of $97 thousand and an average tenure of 12.6 years as of September 30, 2024. We estimate that 29% of our deposits were uninsured and uncollateralized2 as of September 30, 2024, and we have sufficient on- and off-balance sheet liquidity to manage deposit fluctuations and the liquidity needs of our customers.\n\nAsset quality remains strong by both Busey’s historical and current industry trends. Non-performing assets decreased to $8.3 million during the third quarter of 2024, representing 0.07% of total assets. Busey’s results for the third quarter of 2024 include an insignificant provision expense for credit losses and a $0.4 million provision expense for unfunded commitments. The allowance for credit losses was $85.0 million as of September 30, 2024, representing 1.09% of total portfolio loans outstanding, and providing coverage of 10.34 times our non-performing loan balance. Busey recorded net charge-offs of $0.2 million in the third quarter of 2024. As of September 30, 2024, our commercial real estate loan portfolio of investor-owned office properties within Central Business District3 areas was minimal at $2.1 million. Our credit performance continues to reflect our highly diversified, conservatively underwritten loan portfolio, which has been originated predominantly to established customers with tenured relationships with our company.\n\nThe strength of our balance sheet is also reflected in our capital foundation. In the third quarter of 2024, our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio4 was 13.78% and our Total Capital to Risk Weighted Assets ratio4 was 18.19%. Our regulatory capital ratios continue to provide a buffer of more than $580 million above levels required to be designated well-capitalized. Our Tangible Common Equity ratio1 increased to 8.96% during the third quarter of 2024, compared to 8.36% for the second quarter of 2024 and 7.06% for the third quarter of 2023. Busey’s tangible book value per common share1 increased to $18.19 at September 30, 2024, from $16.97 at June 30, 2024, and $15.07 at September 30, 2023, reflecting a 20.7% year-over-year increase. During the third quarter of 2024, we paid a common share dividend of $0.24.\n\n_**Community Banking**_\n\nIn July 2024—based on their community involvement and academic achievements—Busey awarded 10 deserving students from across Busey’s footprint in Illinois, Missouri, Florida, and Indiana, a $2,500 scholarship to support their continuing education and bright futures. With 70 applications received, and a record number of eligible applicants, the students with the top scores, as determined by Busey’s Scholarship Committee, averaged a 4.16 GPA. Since the inception of the Busey Bank Bridge Scholarship program in 2022, Busey has awarded 30 scholarships to deserving students for a total $75,000. Full details on the scholarship’s eligibility criteria and application process can be found at https://www.busey.com/busey/busey-bank-bridge-scholarship.\n\nAs we build upon Busey’s forward momentum and our strategic growth plans, we are grateful for the opportunities to consistently earn the business of our customers, based on the contributions of our talented associates and the continued support of our loyal shareholders. With our strong capital position, an attractive core funding base, and a sound credit foundation, we remain confident that we are well positioned as we move into the final quarter of 2024 and into 2025. We are mindful of the evolving economic outlook and remain focused on balance sheet strength, profitability, and growth, in that order. The pending CrossFirst transaction fits with our acquisition strategy and we are excited to welcome our CrossFirst colleagues into the Busey family.\n\nVan A.

Total assets were $11.99 billion as of September 30, 2024, compared to $11.97 billion as of June 30, 2024, and $12.26 billion as of September 30, 2023.\n\nWe remain steadfast in our conservative approach to underwriting and disciplined approach to pricing, particularly given our outlook for the economy in the coming quarters, and this approach has impacted loan growth as predicted. Portfolio loans totaled $7.81 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to $8.00 billion at June 30, 2024, and $7.86 billion at September 30, 2023.\n\nAverage portfolio loans were $7.87 billion for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $8.01 billion for the second quarter of 2024 and $7.83 billion for the third quarter of 2023. Average interest-earning assets were $10.94 billion for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $10.99 billion for the second quarter of 2024, and $11.12 billion for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nTotal deposits were $9.94 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to $9.98 billion at June 30, 2024, and $10.33 billion at September 30, 2023. Average deposits were $10.00 billion for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $10.07 billion for the second quarter of 2024 and $10.14 billion for the third quarter of 2023. Deposit fluctuations over the last several quarters were driven by a number of elements, including (1) seasonal factors, including ordinary course public fund flows and fluctuations in the normal course of business operations of certain core commercial customers, (2) the macroeconomic environment, including prevailing interest rates and inflationary pressures, (3) depositors moving some funds to accounts at competitors offering above-market rates, and (4) deposits moving within the Busey ecosystem between deposit accounts and our wealth management group. Core deposits1 accounted for 96.5% of total deposits as of September 30, 2024. Cost of deposits was 1.85% in the third quarter of 2024, which represents an increase of 10 basis points from the second quarter of 2024. Excluding time deposits, Busey’s cost of deposits was 1.50% in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 14 basis points from the second quarter of 2024. Non-maturity deposit cost of funds has increased as Busey Bank continues to offer savings account specials to customers with larger account balances, with the intention of migrating maturing CDs to these managed rate products. Pressure on non-interest bearing deposits along with some elevated balances of higher rate seasonal business and public funds accounts also contributed to increases in overall deposit funding cost during the quarter. Spot rates on total deposit costs, including noninterest bearing deposits, increased by 5 basis points from 1.75% at June 30, 2024, to 1.80% at September 30, 2024. Spot rates on interest bearing deposits increased by 1 basis point from 2.45% at June 30, 2024 to 2.46% at September 30, 2024.\n\nThere were no short term borrowings as of September 30 or June 30, 2024, compared to $12.0 million at September 30, 2023. We had no borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) at the end of the third quarter of 2024, the second quarter of 2024, or the third quarter of 2023. We have sufficient on- and off-balance sheet liquidity5 to manage deposit fluctuations and the liquidity needs of our customers. As of September 30, 2024, our available sources of on- and off-balance sheet liquidity totaled $6.37 billion. We have executed various deposit campaigns to attract term funding and savings accounts at a lower rate than our marginal cost of funds. New certificate of deposit production in the third quarter of 2024 had a weighted average term of 8.1 months at a rate of 4.18%, 67 basis points below our average marginal wholesale equivalent-term funding cost during the quarter. Furthermore, our balance sheet liquidity profile continues to be aided by the cash flows we expect from our relatively short-duration securities portfolio. Those cash flows were approximately $81.1 million in the third quarter of 2024. For the remainder of 2024, cash flows from our securities portfolio are expected to be approximately $97.1 million with a current book yield of 2.18%.\n\n**ASSET QUALITY**\n\nCredit quality continues to be strong. Loans 30-89 days past due totaled $10.1 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $23.5 million as of June 30, 2024, and $5.9 million as of September 30, 2023. The decrease in loans that were 30-89 days past due is primarily attributable to a single commercial real estate loan in the second quarter that is no longer past due as of September 30, 2024. Non-performing loans were $8.2 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $9.1 million as of June 30, 2024, and $12.0 million as of September 30, 2023. Continued disciplined credit management resulted in non-performing loans as a percentage of portfolio loans of 0.11% as of both September 30, 2024, and June 30, 2024, and 0.15% as of September 30, 2023. Non-performing assets were 0.07% of total assets for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 0.08% for the second quarter of 2024 and 0.10% for the third quarter of 2023. Our total classified assets were $89.0 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $95.8 million at June 30, 2024, and $59.6 million at September 30, 2023. Our ratio of classified assets to estimated bank Tier 1 capital4 and reserves remains low by historical standards, at 5.9% as of September 30, 2024, compared to 6.4% as of June 30, 2024, and 4.1% as of September 30, 2023.\n\nNet charge-offs were $0.2 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $9.9 million for the second quarter of 2024, and $0.3 million for the third quarter of 2023. Charge-offs in the second quarter of 2024 were primarily in connection with a single commercial and industrial credit relationship that also experienced a partial charge-off during the first quarter of 2024. The allowance as a percentage of portfolio loans was 1.09% as of September 30, 2024, compared to 1.07% as of June 30, 2024, and 1.17% as of September 30, 2023. The ratio was impacted in 2024 by the acquisition of M&M’s Life Equity Loan® portfolio, as Busey did not record an allowance for credit loss for these loans due to no expected credit loss at default, as permitted under the practical expedient provided within the Accounting Standards Codification 326-20-35-6. The allowance coverage for non-performing loans was 10.34 times as of September 30, 2024, compared to 9.36 times as of June 30, 2024, and 7.64 times as of September 30, 2023.\n\nBusey maintains a well-diversified loan portfolio and, as a matter of policy and practice, limits concentration exposure in any particular loan segment.\n\n**ASSET QUALITY** _**(unaudited)**_  \n---  \n_(dollars in thousands)_  \n**As of**  \n**September 30,****2024**| **June 30,****2024**| **September 30,****2023**  \n**Total assets**|  $| 11,986,839| $| 11,971,416| $| 12,258,250  \n**Portfolio loans**|  7,809,097| 7,998,912| 7,856,160  \nLoans 30 – 89 days past due| 10,141| 23,463| 5,934  \nNon-performing loans:  \nNon-accrual loans| 8,192| 8,393| 11,298  \nLoans 90+ days past due and still accruing| 25| 712| 709  \nNon-performing loans| $| 8,217| $| 9,105| $| 12,007  \nNon-performing loans, segregated by geography:  \nIllinois / Indiana| $| 3,981| $| 5,793| $| 7,951  \nMissouri| 3,530| 3,089| 3,747  \nFlorida| 706| 222| 309  \nOther non-performing assets| 64| 90| 96  \nNon-performing assets| $| 8,281| $| 9,195| $| 12,103  \n**Allowance for credit losses**|  $| 84,981| $| 85,226| $| 91,710  \n**RATIOS**  \nNon-performing loans to portfolio loans| 0.11| %| 0.11| %| 0.15| %  \nNon-performing assets to total assets| 0.07| %| 0.08| %| 0.10| %  \nNon-performing assets to portfolio loans and other non-performing assets| 0.11| %| 0.11| %| 0.15| %  \nAllowance for credit losses to portfolio loans| 1.09| %| 1.07| %| 1.17| %  \nCoverage ratio of the allowance for credit losses to non-performing loans| 10.34 x| 9.36 x| 7.64 x  \n  \n**NET CHARGE-OFFS (RECOVERIES) AND PROVISION EXPENSE (RELEASE)**_**(unaudited)**_  \n---  \n_(dollars in thousands)_  \n**Three Months Ended**| **Nine Months Ended**  \n**September 30,****2024**| **June 30,****2024**| **September 30,****2023**| **September 30,****2024**| **September 30,****2023**  \nNet charge-offs (recoveries)| $| 247| $| 9,856| $| 293| $| 15,319| $| 1,842  \nProvision expense (release)| 2| 2,277| 364| 7,317| 1,944  \n  \n**NET INTEREST MARGIN AND NET INTEREST INCOME**\n\nNet interest margin1 was 3.02% for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 3.03% for the second quarter of 2024 and 2.80% for the third quarter of 2023. Excluding purchase accounting accretion, adjusted net interest margin1 was 2.97% for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 3.00% in the second quarter of 2024 and 2.79% in the third quarter of 2023. Net interest income was $82.5 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $82.4 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $77.8 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nAfter raising federal funds rates by a total of 525 basis points between March 2022 and July 2023, the Federal Open Market Committee (“FOMC”) lowered rates by 50 basis points in September 2024. In anticipation of the FOMC pivot to an easing cycle, we limited our exposure to term funding structures and intentionally priced savings specials to encourage maturing CD balances to migrate to managed rate non-maturity products. During September we began lowering rates on special priced deposit accounts and other managed rate products to benefit from the FOMC rate cuts. In addition, approximately 6% of our deposit portfolio is indexed and immediately repriced with the rate cuts by the FOMC. With our short duration CD balances comprising only 15% of the deposit funding base, we also have the ability to quickly reprice the book at lower market rates. We continue to offer CD specials with shorter term structures as well as offering attractive premium savings rates to encourage rotation of maturing CD deposits into nimble pricing products. Components of the 1 basis point decrease in net interest margin1 during the third quarter of 2024 include:\n\n  * Increased cash and securities portfolio yield contributed +3 basis points\n\n  * Increased loan portfolio and held for sale loan yields contributed +2 basis points\n\n  * Increased purchase accounting contributed +2 basis points\n\n  * Reduced borrowing expense +2 basis points\n\n  * Reduced time deposit funding costs contributed +1 basis point\n\n  * Increased non-maturity deposit funding costs contributed -11 basis points\n\n\n\n\nBased on our most recent Asset Liability Management Committee (“ALCO”) model, a +100 basis point parallel rate shock is expected to increase net interest income by 2.1% over the subsequent twelve-month period. Busey continues to evaluate off-balance sheet hedging and balance sheet restructuring strategies as well as embedding rate protection in our asset originations to provide stabilization to net interest income in lower rate environments. Time deposit and savings specials have provided funding flows, and we had excess earning cash during the third quarter of 2024. Since the onset of the current FOMC tightening cycle that began in the first quarter of 2022, our cumulative interest-bearing non-maturity deposit beta peaked at 41%. Our total deposit beta for the completed tightening cycle was 34%. Deposit betas were calculated based on an average federal funds rate of 5.43% during the third quarter of 2024. The average federal funds rate decreased by 7 basis points compared to the average rate of 5.50% in the second quarter of 2024.\n\n**NONINTEREST INCOME**\n\nNoninterest income was $36.0 million for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to $33.8 million for the second quarter of 2024 and $31.0 million for the third quarter of 2023. Excluding the impact of net securities gains and losses and immaterial follow-on adjustments from the previously announced mortgage servicing rights sale, adjusted noninterest income1 was $35.1 million, or 29.9% of operating revenue1, during the third quarter of 2024, $33.9 million, or 29.1% of operating revenue, for the second quarter of 2024, and $31.3 million, or 28.7% of operating revenue, for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nConsolidated wealth management fees were $15.4 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $15.9 million for the second quarter of 2024 and $14.2 million for the third quarter of 2023. Wealth management fees for the third quarter of 2024 declined by 3.4% compared to the second quarter of 2024 primarily based on seasonal tax preparation fees. On a segment basis, Wealth Management generated $16.2 million in revenue during the third quarter of 2024, a 12.7% increase over revenue of $14.4 million for the third quarter of 2023. Approximately $0.8 million of revenue attributed to the wealth segment is reported on a consolidated basis as part of other noninterest income. Third quarter of 2024 results marked a new record high reported quarterly revenue for the Wealth Management operating segment. The Wealth Management operating segment generated net income of $5.6 million in both the third quarter of 2024 and the second quarter of 2024, compared to $4.8 million in the third quarter of 2023. Busey’s Wealth Management division ended the third quarter of 2024 with $13.69 billion in assets under care, compared to $13.02 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2024 and $11.55 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2023. Our portfolio management team continues to focus on long-term returns and managing risk in the face of volatile markets and has outperformed its blended benchmark6 over the last three and five years.\n\nPayment technology solutions revenue was $5.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $5.9 million for the second quarter of 2024 and $5.2 million for the third quarter of 2023. Excluding intracompany eliminations, the FirsTech operating segment generated revenue of $5.6 million during the third quarter of 2024, compared to $6.2 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $5.7 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nNoninterest income generated from our Wealth Management and FirsTech operating segments comprised 60.4% of our total noninterest income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, providing a balance to spread-based revenue from traditional banking activities.\n\nFees for customer services were $8.2 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $7.8 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $7.5 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nNet securities gains were $0.8 million for the third quarter of 2024, comprised primarily of unrealized gains on equity securities.\n\nOther noninterest income was $4.8 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $2.3 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $3.0 million in the third quarter of 2023. Revenue associated with certain wealth management activities reported as other noninterest income on a consolidated basis was $0.8 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $0.2 million for the second quarter of 2024 and $0.1 million for the third quarter of 2023. Fluctuations in other noninterest income are primarily attributable to increases in venture capital investments, referral fees, and swap origination fees, partially offset by decreases in commercial loan sales gains. Increases for the year also reflect the addition of Life Equity Loan® servicing income beginning in the second quarter of 2024.\n\n**OPERATING EFFICIENCY**\n\nNoninterest expense was $75.9 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $75.5 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $70.9 million for the third quarter of 2023. The efficiency ratio1 was 62.1% for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 62.3% for the second quarter of 2024, and 62.4% for the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted core expense1 was $71.0 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $71.1 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $66.0 million in the third quarter of 2023. The adjusted core efficiency ratio1 was 60.2% for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 60.9% for the second quarter of 2024, and 60.2% for the third quarter of 2023. We expect to continue to prudently manage our expenses and to realize increased rates of M&M acquisition synergies during the final quarter of 2024.\n\nNoteworthy components of noninterest expense are as follows:\n\n  * Salaries, wages, and employee benefits expenses were $44.6 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $43.5 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $39.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. Busey recorded $0.1 million of non-operating salaries, wages, and employee benefit expenses in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $1.1 million in the second quarter of 2024 and none in the third quarter of 2023. The increase in the third quarter of 2024 over the second quarter of 2024 was primarily attributable to performance metrics tied to bonus and equity compensation. Our associate-base consisted of 1,510 full-time equivalents as of September 30, 2024, compared to 1,520 as of June 30, 2024, and 1,484 as of September 30, 2023. The increase in our associate-base in the second quarter of 2024 was largely due to the M&M acquisition.\n\n  * Data processing expense was $6.9 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $7.1 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $5.9 million in the third quarter of 2023. Busey recorded $0.1 million of non-operating data processing expenses in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $0.3 million in the second quarter of 2024 and none in the third quarter of 2023. Busey has continued to make investments in technology enhancements and has also experienced inflation-driven price increases.\n\n  * Professional fees were $3.1 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $2.5 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $1.5 million in the third quarter of 2023. Busey recorded $1.4 million of non-operating professional fees in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to $0.4 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $0.1 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n  * Other noninterest expense was $9.7 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $10.4 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $11.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. Busey recorded $0.4 million of non-operating costs in other noninterest expense in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $0.3 million in the second quarter of 2024 and none in the third quarter of 2023. In connection with Busey’s adoption of ASU 2023-02 on January 1, 2024, Busey began recording amortization of New Markets Tax Credits as income tax expense instead of other operating expense, which resulted in a decrease to other operating expenses of $2.3 million compared to the third quarter of 2023. Other items contributing to the fluctuations in other noninterest expense included the provision for unfunded commitments, mortgage servicing rights valuation expenses, fixed asset impairment, marketing, business development, and expenses related to recruiting and onboarding.\n\n\n\n\nBusey's effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was 24.8%, which was lower than the combined federal and state statutory rate of approximately 28.0% due to the impact of tax exempt interest income, such as municipal bond interest, bank owned life insurance income, and investments in various federal and state tax credits.\n\nEffective tax rates were higher in 2024, compared to 2023, due to the adoption of ASU 2023-02 in January 2024. Upon adoption of ASU 2023-02 Busey elected to use the proportional amortization method of accounting for equity investments made primarily for the purpose of receiving income tax credits. The proportional amortization method results in the cost of the investment being amortized in proportion to the income tax credits and other income tax benefits received, with the amortization of the investment and the income tax credits being presented net in the income statement as a component of income tax expense as opposed to being presented on a gross basis on the income statement as a component of noninterest expense and income tax expense.\n\n**CAPITAL STRENGTH**\n\nBusey's strong capital levels, coupled with its earnings, have allowed the Company to provide a steady return to its stockholders through dividends. On October 25, 2024, Busey will pay a cash dividend of $0.24 per common share to stockholders of record as of October 18, 2024. Busey has consistently paid dividends to its common stockholders since the bank holding company was organized in 1980.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, Busey continued to exceed the capital adequacy requirements necessary to be considered “well-capitalized” under applicable regulatory guidelines. Busey’s Common Equity Tier 1 ratio is estimated4 to be 13.78% at September 30, 2024, compared to 13.20% at June 30, 2024, and 12.52% at September 30, 2023. Our Total Capital to Risk Weighted Assets ratio is estimated4 to be 18.19% at September 30, 2024, compared to 17.50% at June 30, 2024, and 16.72% at September 30, 2023.\n\nBusey’s tangible common equity1 was $1.04 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to $970.9 million at June 30, 2024, and $841.2 million at September 30, 2023. Tangible common equity1 represented 8.96% of tangible assets at September 30, 2024, compared to 8.36% at June 30, 2024, and 7.06% at September 30, 2023. Busey’s tangible book value per common share1 increased to $18.19 at September 30, 2024, from $16.97 at June 30, 2024, and $15.07 at September 30, 2023, reflecting a 20.7% year-over-year increase. The ratios of tangible common equity to tangible assets1 and tangible book value per common share have been impacted by the fair value adjustment of Busey’s securities portfolio as a result of the current rate environment, which is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) component of shareholder’s equity.\n\n**THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS INVESTOR PRESENTATION**\n\nFor additional information on Busey’s financial condition and operating results, please refer to the _**Q3 2024 Earnings Investor Presentation**_ furnished via Form 8-K on October 22, 2024, in connection with this earnings release.\n\n**CORPORATE PROFILE**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, First Busey Corporation (Nasdaq: BUSE) was an $11.99 billion financial holding company headquartered in Champaign, Illinois.\n\nBusey Bank, a wholly-owned bank subsidiary of First Busey Corporation, had total assets of $11.95 billion as of September 30, 2024, and is headquartered in Champaign, Illinois.

Jones, Chief Financial Officer217-365-4130\n\n**NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION**\n\nThis earnings release contains certain financial information determined by methods other than GAAP. Management uses these non-GAAP measures, together with the related GAAP measures, in analysis of Busey’s performance and in making business decisions, as well as for comparison to Busey’s peers. Busey believes the adjusted measures are useful for investors and management to understand the effects of certain non-core and non-recurring noninterest items and provide additional perspective on Busey’s performance over time.\n\nBelow is a reconciliation to what management believes to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures—specifically, net interest income, total noninterest income, net security gains and losses, and total noninterest expense in the case of pre-provision net revenue, adjusted pre-provision net revenue, pre-provision net revenue to average assets, and adjusted pre-provision net revenue to average assets; net income in the case of adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted return on average assets, average tangible common equity, return on average tangible common equity, adjusted return on average tangible common equity; net income and net security gains and losses in the case of further adjusted net income and further adjusted diluted earnings per share; net interest income in the case of adjusted net interest income and adjusted net interest margin; net interest income, total noninterest income, and total noninterest expense in the case of adjusted noninterest income, adjusted noninterest expense, noninterest expense excluding non-operating adjustments, adjusted core expense, efficiency ratio, adjusted efficiency ratio, and adjusted core efficiency ratio; net interest income, total noninterest income, net securities gains and losses, and net gains and losses on the sale of mortgage servicing rights in the case of operating revenue and adjusted noninterest income to operating revenue; total assets and goodwill and other intangible assets in the case of tangible assets; total stockholders’ equity in the case of tangible book value per common share; total assets and total stockholders’ equity in the case of tangible common equity and tangible common equity to tangible assets; and total deposits in the case of core deposits and core deposits to total deposits.\n\nThese non-GAAP disclosures have inherent limitations and are not audited. They should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating results reported in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. Tax effected numbers included in these non-GAAP disclosures are based on estimated statutory rates, estimated federal income tax rates, or effective tax rates, as noted with the tables below.\n\n**RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES** _**(Unaudited)**_\n\n**Pre-Provision Net Revenue, Adjusted Pre-Provision Net Revenue,****Pre-Provision Net Revenue to Average Assets, and****Adjusted Pre-Provision Net Revenue to Average Assets**  \n---  \n _(dollars in thousands)_  \n**Three Months Ended**| **Nine Months Ended**  \n**September 30,****2024**| **June 30,****2024**| **September 30,****2023**| **September 30,****2024**| **September 30,****2023**  \n**PRE-PROVISION NET REVENUE**  \n**Net interest income**|  $| 82,541| $| 82,434| $| 77,791| $| 240,742| $| 242,318  \n**Total noninterest income**|  35,951| 33,801| 31,008| 104,752| 90,868  \n**Net security (gains) losses**| (822| )| 353| 285| 5,906| 2,960  \n**Total noninterest expense**| (75,926| )| (75,537| )| (70,945| )| (222,232| )| (210,553| )  \nPre-provision net revenue| 41,744| 41,051| 38,139| 129,168| 125,593  \nNon-GAAP adjustments:  \nAcquisition and restructuring expenses| 1,935| 2,212| 79| 4,555| 91  \nProvision for unfunded commitments| 407| (369| )| 13| (640| )| (357| )  \nAmortization of New Markets Tax Credits| —| —| 2,260| —| 6,740  \nRealized (gain) loss on the sale of mortgage service rights| 18| (277| )| —| (7,724| )| —  \nAdjusted pre-provision net revenue| $| 44,104| $| 42,617| $| 40,491| $| 125,359| $| 132,067  \nPre-provision net revenue, annualized| [a]| $| 166,069| $| 165,106| $| 151,312| $| 172,538| $| 167,917  \nAdjusted pre-provision net revenue, annualized| [b]| 175,457| 171,405| 160,644| 167,450| 176,573  \nAverage total assets| [c]| 12,007,702| 12,089,692| 12,202,783| 12,040,414| 12,225,232  \n**Reported:** Pre-provision net revenue to average total assets1| [a÷c]| 1.38| %| 1.37| %| 1.24| %| 1.43| %| 1.37| %  \n**Adjusted:** Pre-provision net revenue to average total assets1| [b÷c]| 1.46| %| 1.42| %| 1.32| %| 1.39| %| 1.44| %  \n  \n___________________________________________\n\n  1.

Tax rates used in these calculations were 23.3% and 19.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Quarterly tax benefits were calculated as the year-to-date tax benefit amounts less the sum of amounts applied to previous quarters during the year, equating to tax rates of 21.0%, 25.0%, and 19.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively.\n\n  2.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the rate that we used excluded a one-time deferred tax valuation adjustment resulting from a change in Illinois apportionment rate due to recently enacted regulations. Effective income tax rates that we used to calculate the tax effect were 24.8%, 25.0%, and 18.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively, and were 24.9% and 19.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n  3.

These factors include, among others, the following: (1) risks related to the proposed transaction with CrossFirst, including (i) the possibility that the proposed transaction will not close when expected or at all because required regulatory, stockholder, or other approvals are not received or other conditions to the closing are not satisfied on a timely basis or at all, or are obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated (and the risk that required regulatory approvals may result in the imposition of conditions that could adversely affect the combined company or the expected benefits of the proposed transaction); (ii) the possibility that the anticipated benefits of the proposed transaction will not be realized when expected or at all, including as a result of the impact of, or problems arising from, the integration of the two companies or as a result of the strength of the economy and competitive factors in the areas where Busey and CrossFirst do business; (iii) the possibility that the merger may be more expensive to complete than anticipated, including as a result of unexpected factors or events; (iv) diversion of management's attention from ongoing business operations and opportunities; (v) the possibility that Busey may be unable to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies in the merger within the expected timeframes or at all, and to successfully integrate CrossFirst's operations with those of Busey or that such integration may be more difficult, time consuming or costly than expected; (vi) revenues following the proposed transaction may be lower than expected; and (vii) shareholder litigation that could prevent or delay the closing of the proposed transaction or otherwise negatively impact our business and operations; (2) the strength of the local, state, national, and international economy (including effects of inflationary pressures and supply chain constraints); (3) the economic impact of any future terrorist threats or attacks, widespread disease or pandemics, or other adverse external events that could cause economic deterioration or instability in credit markets (including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East); (4) changes in state and federal laws, regulations, and governmental policies concerning Busey's general business (including changes in response to the failures of other banks or as a result of the upcoming 2024 presidential election); (5) changes in accounting policies and practices; (6) changes in interest rates and prepayment rates of Busey’s assets (including the impact of sustained elevated interest rates); (7) increased competition in the financial services sector (including from non-bank competitors such as credit unions and fintech companies) and the inability to attract new customers; (8) changes in technology and the ability to develop and maintain secure and reliable electronic systems; (9) the loss of key executives or associates; (10) changes in consumer spending; (11) unexpected results of other transactions (including the acquisition of M&M); (12) unexpected outcomes of existing or new litigation, investigations, or inquiries involving Busey (including with respect to Busey’s Illinois franchise taxes); (13) fluctuations in the value of securities held in Busey’s securities portfolio; (14) concentrations within Busey’s loan portfolio (including commercial real estate loans), large loans to certain borrowers, and large deposits from certain clients; (15) the concentration of large deposits from certain clients who have balances above current FDIC insurance limits and may withdraw deposits to diversify their exposure; (16) the level of non-performing assets on Busey’s balance sheets; (17) interruptions involving information technology and communications systems or third-party servicers; (18) breaches or failures of information security controls or cybersecurity-related incidents; and (19) the economic impact of exceptional weather occurrences such as tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, blizzards, and droughts. These risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements.\n\nAdditional information concerning Busey and its business, including additional factors that could materially affect Busey’s financial results, is included in Busey’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n**ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE TRANSACTION AND WHERE TO FIND IT**\n\nBusey has filed a [_registration statement on Form S‑4_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ifGLvvRVfInbERWn-8Xh0tBbbbs-4BVD8AI1NNdM4wsY4gPKx2JAR_-0sb711tQxbeBiyDeaTXyWygUsRXgBeNJiTFbelCXW8aq10FO_k_4HHSHHHt-LUiJGeLV4947xax56gQ469mkXmCrssQ_gReiwPYErAmEzqUKTgkpZxivpLg8WDAeuFP7EGv6WJ4aRoj9yw1px2Lv-MBau2u1crg==) with the SEC to register the shares of Busey’s common stock that will be issued to CrossFirst stockholders in connection with the proposed transaction.

(“CrossFirst”) (Nasdaq: CFB), the holding company for CrossFirst Bank, jointly announced today the signing of a definitive agreement and plan of merger, pursuant to which CrossFirst will merge with and into Busey (the “Merger”) in an all-common stock transaction valued at approximately $916.8 million, based on Busey’s closing stock price of $27.39 as of August 26, 2024. The combined company, which will operate under the Busey brand, will have approximately $20 billion in total assets, approximately $17 billion in total deposits and approximately $13 billion in wealth management assets under care.\n\n“The partnership between our high-quality franchises is a great fit from a strategic, financial and cultural perspective, and we look forward to capitalizing on the many opportunities we see as a combined company in 2025 and beyond,” said Busey Chairman and CEO Van Dukeman. “CrossFirst is a natural fit alongside Busey’s established commercial and wealth management offerings and our payment technology solutions business, FirsTech, Inc. By leveraging CrossFirst’s established presence in attractive markets with compelling growth potential, this partnership is expected to serve as a catalyst for additional commercial banking growth as well as expanded opportunities to grow our existing wealth management and payments businesses. We are excited for our associates, customers and shareholders to experience our next chapter as Busey and CrossFirst combine to form a premier commercial bank that maintains the community bank values our customers and communities expect and deserve.”\n\nMike Maddox, CrossFirst CEO, President and Director, stated, “Founded on the ideals of extraordinary, personal service provided by outstanding, local bankers, our dedicated associates at CrossFirst have built strong, trusting relationships with our clients and the markets we serve. We believe Busey is the right partner to continue CrossFirst’s customer- and community-focus. Because of our like-minded cultures, our complementary business models and manner in which we operate, we are confident this partnership will create significant benefits for our teams, customers, communities and shareholders.”\n\n**Strategic Benefits of the Partnership** The partnership will extend Busey’s regional operating model in the high-growth metro markets of Kansas City, Wichita, Dallas/Fort Worth, Denver and Phoenix while bolstering its commercial banking relationships and offering additional opportunities to grow its wealth management business and FirsTech, Inc., Busey’s payment technology solutions subsidiary. The combined company will further strengthen its deep commitment to and extensive skill set in commercial banking.\n\nThe combination is expected to create a premier full-service commercial bank serving clients from 77 full-service locations across 10 states with combined total assets of approximately $20 billion, $17 billion in total deposits, $15 billion in total loans and $13 billion in wealth assets under care. With a diversified client, loan and deposit base, this scale provides opportunities to augment business models through new customer and product channels.\n\nThrough compatible banking philosophies and cultures, complementary business models, combined capital strength and increased economies of scale, the combination is expected to significantly enhance key performance metrics with meaningful improvements in net interest margin and efficiency, driving increased profitability and returns to our shareholders. Pro forma calculations estimate Busey earnings per share accretion of approximately 20% in 2026, the first full year of combined operations, excluding one-time merger-related charges and assuming fully phased-in cost savings. Tangible book value per share dilution is projected to be modest at -0.6% with a forecasted earnback period of approximately six months. Capital ratios are expected to be significantly above “well-capitalized” thresholds with 9.6% leverage, 11.0% CET1 and 14.1% total risk-based capital. The transaction is expected to result in an internal rate of return of over 19%. With a combined loan-to-deposit ratio of 86%, C&D concentration of 60% and CRE concentration of 250%, the pro forma company will be well-positioned for future growth.\n\nBoth Busey and CrossFirst have extensive experience in successfully integrating with merger partners and are acutely focused on ensuring a smooth transition. Between the two management teams, Busey and CrossFirst have successfully navigated 11 mergers and integrations since 2013.\n\n**Transaction Details** The merger has been unanimously approved by each company’s board of directors.\n\nIn the merger, CrossFirst shareholders will receive 0.6675 shares of Busey common stock for each share held of CrossFirst common stock. CrossFirst’s common shareholders, which currently do not receive a dividend, will be eligible to receive Busey’s ongoing dividends as declared following the closing of the merger.\n\nUpon completion of the transaction, Busey’s shareholders will own approximately 63.5% of the combined company and CrossFirst’s shareholders will own approximately 36.5% of the combined company, on a fully-diluted basis, which will continue to trade on the Nasdaq under the “BUSE” stock ticker symbol.\n\nCompletion of the merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval of both Busey and CrossFirst shareholders and the regulatory approvals for the holding company merger and the bank merger. With approvals, the parties expect to close the holding company merger in the first or second quarter of 2025.\n\n**Name and Headquarters** The combined holding company will continue to operate under the First Busey Corporation name and the combined bank will operate under the Busey Bank name. It is anticipated that CrossFirst Bank will merge with and into Busey Bank in mid-2025. At the time of the bank merger, CrossFirst Bank locations will become service centers of Busey Bank.\n\nBusey Bank’s headquarters will remain in Champaign, Illinois—near where Busey was founded more than 155 years ago. The majority of Busey’s stable deposit base and wealth management assets under care are within its legacy footprint.\n\nThe headquarters of the holding company will move to Leawood, Kansas—at the site of the current CrossFirst headquarters in the Kansas City area, which will be central to the combined company’s new footprint, providing benefits for ease of travel, accessibility and visibility.\n\n**Governance, Leadership and Culture** The Board of Directors of the combined company will be comprised of thirteen (13) members, eight (8) from Busey or Busey Bank and five (5) from CrossFirst, with Van Dukeman serving as Executive Chairman and CEO, Mike Maddox as President and Executive Vice Chairman, and Rod Brenneman—current independent Chairman of the Board of CrossFirst—as Lead Independent Director.\n\nManagement of the combined company will be a combination of both Busey and CrossFirst executives. Van Dukeman will continue to serve as Executive Chairman and CEO of Busey and Executive Chairman of Busey Bank. Mike Maddox will become President and Executive Vice Chairman of Busey and CEO of Busey Bank. Mr. Maddox will succeed Mr. Dukeman as CEO of Busey on the earlier of the one-year anniversary of the bank merger or the 18-month anniversary of the holding company merger, with Dukeman remaining the Executive Chairman of both Busey and Busey Bank.\n\nThe remainder of the management team of the combined company will be led by a well-respected group of individuals with significant financial services and M&A integration experience. This group will provide continuity of leadership both during and beyond integration. Current Busey executives—Chief Financial Officer Jeff Jones, Chief Operating Officer Amy Randolph, Chief Risk Officer Monica Bowe and General Counsel John Powers—will remain in their current roles with the combined company. Randy Rapp, current President of CrossFirst Bank, will assume the role of President of Busey Bank while Chip Jorstad, Busey’s current President of Credit and Bank Administration, and Amy Fauss, CrossFirst’s current Chief Operating Officer, will assume the roles of Chief Credit Officer and Chief Information and Technology Officer, respectively.\n\nBoth companies support and value an engaged and empowered workforce and are committed to building an extraordinary, service-oriented banking experience. Busey has been named among _American Banker’s_ Best Banks to Work For since 2016; listed among 2023 and 2024’s America’s Best Banks by _Forbes_ ; and recognized in all states where it operates as a Best Place to Work, in addition to earning various wellness, training and development, philanthropic and other workplace awards.

Adjusted net income1, which excludes the impact of acquisition and restructuring expenses, was $29.0 million, or $0.50 per diluted common share, for the second quarter of 2024, compared to $26.5 million, or $0.47 per diluted common share, for the first quarter of 2024. Adjustments to net income for the second quarter of 2023 were immaterial. Annualized return on average assets and annualized return on average tangible common equity1 were 0.91% and 11.51%, respectively, for the second quarter of 2024. Annualized adjusted return on average assets1 and annualized adjusted return on average tangible common equity1 were 0.97% and 12.21%, respectively, for the second quarter of 2024.\n\nSecond quarter results included $0.4 million in net securities losses, nearly all of which were unrealized, as well as an additional $0.3 million gain on the mortgage servicing right sale previously announced in the first quarter of 2024. In addition, second quarter results include a one-time deferred tax valuation adjustment of $1.4 million resulting from a change to our Illinois apportionment rate due to recently enacted regulations. These new regulations are expected to lower our ongoing tax obligation in future periods, but create a negative adjustment to the carrying value of our deferred tax asset in the current period. Excluding this one-time deferred tax valuation adjustment, the effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2024 would have been 25.0%, rather than the 28.8% reported, and further adjusted net income would have been $30.5 million, equating to further adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.53.\n\nPre-provision net revenue1 was $41.1 million for the second quarter of 2024, compared to $46.4 million for the first quarter of 2024 and $39.5 million for the second quarter of 2023. Pre-provision net revenue to average assets1 was 1.37% for the second quarter of 2024, compared to 1.55% for the first quarter of 2024, and 1.30% for the second quarter of 2023. Adjusted pre-provision net revenue1 was $42.6 million for the second quarter of 2024, compared to $38.6 million for the first quarter of 2024 and $42.1 million for the second quarter of 2023. Adjusted pre-provision net revenue to average assets1 was 1.42% for the second quarter of 2024, compared to 1.29% for the first quarter of 2024 and 1.38% for the second quarter of 2023.\n\nOur fee-based businesses continue to add revenue diversification. Total noninterest income was $33.8 million for the second quarter of 2024, compared to $35.0 million for the first quarter of 2024 and $28.0 million for the second quarter of 2023. Adjusted noninterest income1 was $33.9 million, or 29.1% of operating revenue1, during the second quarter of 2024, compared to $33.9 million, or 30.9% of total operating revenue, for the first quarter of 2024 and $30.1 million, or 27.7% of total operating revenue, for the second quarter of 2023. Wealth management fees and payment technology solutions contributed $15.9 million and $5.9 million, respectively, to our consolidated noninterest income for the second quarter of 2024, representing 64.6% of noninterest income on a combined basis.\n\nBusey views certain non-operating items, including acquisition-related and other restructuring charges, as adjustments to net income reported under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). Non-operating pretax adjustments for acquisition and other restructuring charges in the second quarter of 2024 were $2.2 million. Busey believes that its non-GAAP measures (which are identified with the endnote labeled as 1) facilitate the assessment of its financial results and peer comparability. For more information and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures in tabular form, see _\"Non-GAAP Financial Information.\"_\n\nWe have effectively managed our noninterest expense during a time of decades-high inflation and have been purposeful in our efforts to rationalize our expense base given our economic outlook and our view on the future of banking. Second quarter expenses include the costs of operating M&M Bank as a stand-alone bank from April 1, 2024, through June 21, 2024. Noninterest expense was $75.5 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared to $70.8 million in the first quarter of 2024 and $69.2 million in the second quarter of 2023. Adjusted noninterest expense1, which excludes the amortization of intangible assets and acquisition and restructuring related expenses, was $70.7 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared to $68.0 million in the first quarter of 2024 and $66.5 million in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nQuarterly pre-tax expense synergies resulting from the M&M acquisition are anticipated to be $1.6 million to $1.7 million per quarter when fully realized. Quarterly run-rate savings are projected to be achieved by the first quarter of 2025. During the second quarter of 2024, we achieved approximately 30% of the full quarterly savings. We expect to continue to prudently manage our expenses and to realize increased rates of M&M acquisition synergies during the second half of 2024.\n\n**_Acquisition of Merchants and Manufacturers Bank Corporation Completed April 1, 2024, and Integration of Merchants & Manufacturers Bank with and into Busey Bank Completed June 21, 2024_**\n\nEffective April 1, 2024, Busey completed its previously announced acquisition (the \"Merger\") of M&M, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated November 27, 2023, between Busey and M&M (the “Merger Agreement”). Upon completion of the Merger, each share of M&M common stock converted to the right to receive, at the election of each stockholder and subject to proration and adjustment, either (1) $117.74 in cash (“Cash Election”), (2) 5.7294 shares of Busey common stock (“Share Election”), or (3) mixed consideration of $34.55 in cash and 4.0481 shares of Busey common stock (“Mixed Election”).\n\nMost of the M&M common stockholders who submitted an election form by the election deadline made the Share Election to receive their Merger consideration solely in the form of shares of Busey common stock. As a result of the elections of M&M common stockholders, and in accordance with the proration and adjustment provisions of the Merger Agreement, the Merger consideration paid to M&M common stockholders was comprised of an aggregate of 1,429,304 shares of Busey common stock and an aggregate of $12.2 million in cash, allocated as follows for each share of M&M stock: (1) $117.74 in cash for the Cash Election, (2) $5.3966 in cash and 5.4668 shares of Busey common stock for the Share Election, and (3) $34.55 in cash and 4.0481 shares of Busey common stock for the Mixed Election. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, M&M common stockholders that did not make an election or submit a properly completed election form by the election deadline of March 29, 2024, received cash consideration of $117.74 for each share of M&M common stock held. No fractional shares of Busey common stock were issued in the Merger. Fractional shares were paid in cash at the rate of $23.32 per share.\n\nAdditional Merger consideration of $3.0 million was paid to redeem 300 shares of M&M preferred stock.\n\nThe M&M transaction added loans with a fair value of $418.7 million and deposits with a fair value of $392.8 million as of the acquisition date. Busey incurred one-time pre-tax acquisition-related expenses of $2.1 million in the second quarter of 2024 related to M&M.\n\nOn June 21, 2024, M&M Bank was merged with and into Busey Bank (the “Bank Merger”). At the time of the Bank Merger, M&M Bank’s banking centers became banking centers of Busey Bank, except for the banking center located at 990 Essington Rd., Joliet, Illinois, which was closed in connection with the Bank Merger. Services were assumed by the existing Busey Bank banking center located at 2801 Black Rd., Joliet, Illinois, which is less than one mile away from where the Essington banking center was located. This partnership adds M&M’s Life Equity Loan® products to Busey’s existing suite of services and expands Busey’s presence in the suburban Chicago area.\n\n**_Busey’s Conservative Banking Strategy_**\n\nBusey’s financial strength is built on a long-term conservative operating approach. That focus will not change now or in the future.\n\nThe quality of our core deposit franchise is a critical value driver of our institution. Our granular deposit base continues to position us well, with core deposits1 representing 96.4% of our deposits as of June 30, 2024. Our retail deposit base was comprised of more than 256,000 accounts with an average balance of $22 thousand and an average tenure of 16.8 years as of June 30, 2024. Our commercial deposit base was comprised of more than 33,000 accounts with an average balance of $96 thousand and an average tenure of 12.5 years as of June 30, 2024. We estimated that 29% of our deposits were uninsured and uncollateralized2 as of June 30, 2024, and we have sufficient on- and off-balance sheet liquidity to manage deposit fluctuations and the liquidity needs of our customers.\n\nAsset quality remains strong by both Busey’s historical and current industry trends. Non-performing assets decreased to $9.2 million during the second quarter of 2024, representing 0.08% of total assets. Busey’s results for the second quarter of 2024 include a $2.3 million provision expense for credit losses and a $0.4 million provision release for unfunded commitments. The allowance for credit losses was $85.2 million as of June 30, 2024, representing 1.07% of total portfolio loans outstanding, and 936.0% of non-performing loans. Busey recorded net charge-offs of $9.9 million in the second quarter of 2024, primarily in connection with a single commercial and industrial credit relationship that also experienced a partial charge-off during the first quarter of 2024. A specific reserve of $7.2 million had previously been allocated against this credit relationship. As of June 30, 2024, our commercial real estate loan portfolio of investor-owned office properties within Central Business District3 areas is minimal at $2.2 million. Our credit performance continues to reflect our highly diversified, conservatively underwritten loan portfolio, which has been originated predominantly to established customers with tenured relationships with our company.\n\nThe strength of our balance sheet is also reflected in our capital foundation. In the second quarter of 2024, our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio4 was 13.19% and our Total Capital to Risk Weighted Assets ratio4 was 17.49%. Our regulatory capital ratios continue to provide a buffer of more than $540 million above levels required to be designated well-capitalized. Our Tangible Common Equity ratio1 increased to 8.36% during the second quarter of 2024, compared to 8.12% for the first quarter of 2024 and 7.18% for the second quarter of 2023. Busey’s tangible book value per common share1 increased to $16.97 at June 30, 2024, from $16.84 at March 31, 2024, and $15.25 at June 30, 2023, reflecting an 11.3% year-over-year increase. During the second quarter of 2024, we paid a common share dividend of $0.24.\n\n**_Community Banking_**\n\nBusey’s commitment to bettering the communities we serve includes providing our Pillars with wide-ranging access to financial education tools. We’re pleased to offer Financial Pathways, a complimentary educational platform that provides an engaging learning experience through a series of interactive modules that deliver actionable financial education. Through the Financial Pathways Engage program, community members of all ages can learn how to manage their finances and plan for the future through educational workshops.

Total assets were $11.97 billion as of June 30, 2024, compared to $11.89 billion as of March 31, 2024, and $12.21 billion as of June 30, 2023.\n\nAs has been our practice, we remain steadfast in our conservative approach to underwriting and disciplined approach to pricing, particularly given our outlook for the economy in the coming quarters, and this approach has impacted loan growth as predicted. Portfolio loans totaled $8.00 billion at June 30, 2024, compared to $7.59 billion at March 31, 2024, and $7.81 billion at June 30, 2023. The $410.8 million increase in portfolio loans during the second quarter of 2024 was due to the M&M acquisition.\n\nAverage portfolio loans were $8.01 billion for the second quarter of 2024, compared to $7.60 billion for the first quarter of 2024 and $7.76 billion for the second quarter of 2023. Average interest-earning assets were $10.99 billion for the second quarter of 2024, compared to $11.00 billion for the first quarter of 2024, and $11.13 billion for the second quarter of 2023.\n\nTotal deposits were $9.98 billion at June 30, 2024, compared to $9.96 billion at March 31, 2024, and $10.06 billion at June 30, 2023. Average deposits were $10.07 billion for the second quarter of 2024, compared to $10.04 billion for the first quarter of 2024 and $9.85 billion for the second quarter of 2023. Deposit fluctuations over the last several quarters were driven by a number of elements, including (1) seasonal factors, including ordinary course public fund flows and fluctuations in the normal course of business operations of certain core commercial customers, (2) the macroeconomic environment, including prevailing interest rates and anticipated future Federal Open Market Committee (“FOMC”) rate moves, as well as inflationary pressures, (3) depositors moving some funds to accounts at competitors offering above-market rates, including state-sponsored investment programs that provide rates in excess of where we can borrow in the wholesale marketplace, and (4) deposits moving within the Busey ecosystem between deposit accounts and our wealth management group. Core deposits1 accounted for 96.4% of total deposits as of June 30, 2024. Cost of deposits was 1.75% in the second quarter of 2024, which represents a decrease of 1 basis point from the first quarter of 2024. Excluding time deposits, Busey’s cost of deposits was 1.36% in the second quarter of 2024, an increase of 4 basis points from the first quarter of 2024. Non-maturity deposit cost of funds has increased as Busey Bank continues to offer savings account specials to customers with larger account balances, with the intention of migrating maturing CDs to these managed rate products. Spot rates on total deposit costs, including noninterest bearing deposits, increased by 8 basis points from 1.67% at March 31, 2024, to 1.75% at June 30, 2024. Spot rates on interest bearing deposits increased by 13 basis points from 2.32% at March 31, 2024 to 2.45% at June 30, 2024.\n\nThere were no short term borrowings as of June 30 or March 31, 2024, compared to $212.0 million at June 30, 2023. We had no borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) at the end of either the second quarter of 2024 or the first quarter of 2024, compared to $200.0 million at the end of the second quarter of 2023. We have sufficient on- and off-balance sheet liquidity5 to manage deposit fluctuations and the liquidity needs of our customers. As of June 30, 2024, our available sources of on- and off-balance sheet liquidity totaled $6.16 billion. We have executed various deposit campaigns to attract term funding and savings accounts at a lower rate than our marginal cost of funds. New certificate of deposit production in the second quarter of 2024 had a weighted average term of 8.4 months at a rate of 3.93%, 127 basis points below our average marginal wholesale funding cost during the quarter. Furthermore, our balance sheet liquidity profile continues to be aided by the cash flows we expect from our relatively short-duration securities portfolio. Those cash flows were approximately $115.2 million in the second quarter of 2024. For the remainder of 2024, cash flows from our securities portfolio are expected to be approximately $162.8 million with a current book yield of 2.62%.\n\n**ASSET QUALITY**\n\nCredit quality continues to be strong. Loans 30-89 days past due totaled $23.5 million as of June 30, 2024, compared to $7.4 million as of March 31, 2024, and $5.2 million as of June 30, 2023. The increase in loans that were 30-89 days past due can be primarily attributed to a single commercial real estate loan. Non-performing loans were $9.1 million as of June 30, 2024, compared to $17.6 million as of March 31, 2024, and $15.8 million as of June 30, 2023. Continued disciplined credit management resulted in non-performing loans as a percentage of portfolio loans of 0.11% as of June 30, 2024, 0.23% as of March 31, 2024, and 0.20% as of June 30, 2023. Non-performing assets were 0.08% of total assets for the second quarter of 2024, compared to 0.15% for the first quarter of 2024 and 0.13% for the second quarter of 2023. Our total classified assets were $95.8 million at June 30, 2024, compared to $105.4 million at March 31, 2024, and $81.9 million at June 30, 2023. Our ratio of classified assets to estimated bank Tier 1 capital4 and reserves remains low by historical standards, at 6.4% as of June 30, 2024, compared to 7.2% as of March 31, 2024, and 5.7% as of June 30, 2023.\n\nNet charge-offs were $9.9 million for the second quarter of 2024, compared to $5.2 million for the first quarter of 2024, and $0.7 million for the second quarter of 2023. The increase in the first and second quarter of 2024 was limited to a single commercial and industrial credit relationship. The allowance as a percentage of portfolio loans was 1.07% as of June 30, 2024, compared to 1.21% as of March 31, 2024, and 1.17% as of June 30, 2023. The ratio was impacted in the second quarter of 2024 by the acquisition of M&M’s Life Equity Loan® portfolio, as Busey did not record an allowance for credit loss for these loans due to the probability of loss at default as permitted under the practical expedient provided within the Accounting Standards Codification 326-20-35-6. The allowance as a percentage of non-performing loans was 936.0% as of June 30, 2024, compared to 521.6% as of March 31, 2024, and 580.8% as of June 30, 2023.\n\nBusey maintains a well-diversified loan portfolio and, as a matter of policy and practice, limits concentration exposure in any particular loan segment.\n\n**ASSET QUALITY**** _(unaudited)_**  \n---  \n_(dollars in thousands)_  \n**As of**  \n**June 30,** **2024** | **March 31,** **2024** | **June 30,** **2023**  \n**Total assets** | $ | 11,971,416 | $ | 11,887,458 | $ | 12,209,029  \n**Portfolio loans** | 7,998,912 | 7,588,077 | 7,805,284  \nLoans 30 – 89 days past due | 23,463 | 7,441 | 5,169  \nNon-performing loans:  \nNon-accrual loans | 8,393 | 17,465 | 15,209  \nLoans 90+ days past due and still accruing | 712 | 88 | 569  \nNon-performing loans | $ | 9,105 | $ | 17,553 | $ | 15,778  \nNon-performing loans, segregated by geography:  \nIllinois / Indiana | $ | 5,793 | $ | 13,553 | $ | 11,681  \nMissouri | 3,089 | 3,746 | 3,928  \nFlorida | 222 | 254 | 169  \nOther non-performing assets | 90 | 65 | 68  \nNon-performing assets | $ | 9,195 | $ | 17,618 | $ | 15,846  \n**Allowance for credit losses** | $ | 85,226 | $ | 91,562 | $ | 91,639  \n**RATIOS**  \nNon-performing loans to portfolio loans | 0.11 | % | 0.23 | % | 0.20 | %  \nNon-performing assets to total assets | 0.08 | % | 0.15 | % | 0.13 | %  \nNon-performing assets to portfolio loans and other non-performing assets | 0.11 | % | 0.23 | % | 0.20 | %  \nAllowance for credit losses to portfolio loans | 1.07 | % | 1.21 | % | 1.17 | %  \nAllowance for credit losses as a percentage of non-performing loans | 936.04 | % | 521.63 | % | 580.80 | %  \n  \n**NET CHARGE-OFFS (RECOVERIES) AND PROVISION EXPENSE (RELEASE)****_(unaudited)_**  \n---  \n_(dollars in thousands)_  \n**Three Months Ended** | **Six Months Ended**  \n**June 30,** **2024** | **March 31,** **2024** | **June 30,** **2023** | **June 30,** **2024** | **June 30,** **2023**  \nNet charge-offs (recoveries) | $ | 9,856 | $ | 5,216 | $ | 715 | $ | 15,072 | $ | 1,549  \nProvision expense (release) | 2,277 | 5,038 | 627 | 7,315 | 1,580  \n  \n**NET INTEREST MARGIN AND NET INTEREST INCOME**\n\nNet interest margin1 was 3.03% for the second quarter of 2024, compared to 2.79% for the first quarter of 2024 and 2.86% for the second quarter of 2023. Excluding purchase accounting accretion, adjusted net interest margin1 was 3.00% for the second quarter of 2024, compared to 2.78% in the first quarter of 2024 and 2.84% in the second quarter of 2023. Net interest income was $82.4 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared to $75.8 million in the first quarter of 2024 and $78.7 million in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nThe FOMC raised rates by a total of 525 basis points since the onset of the current FOMC tightening cycle that began in the first quarter of 2022, with no further increases during 2024. Rising rates initially have a positive impact on net interest margin, as assets, in particular commercial loans, reprice more quickly and to a greater extent than liabilities. As deposit and funding costs increase in response to the tightening rate cycle, and we experience deposit migration into higher cost offerings and funding alternatives, some of the net interest margin expansion is reversed, which we began to experience in the first quarter of 2023. As lower yielding securities and loans continue to mature or renew at higher current market rates, expansion in asset yields has outpaced any remaining lagged pressure on funding costs. Our deposit cost of funds peaked in the beginning of the first quarter of 2024, and we have been able to remain below that peak funding cost each month during the second quarter. We continue to offer CD specials with shorter term structures as well as offering attractive premium savings rates to encourage rotation of maturing CD deposits into nimble pricing products as the expected easing cycle begins. The acquisition of M&M Bank provided higher yielding assets to our loan book, and we leveraged the consolidated Company liquidity strength to unwind higher cost funding of $95.9 million, which had an average rate of 5.49%. During the second quarter we also saw the full benefit of the March 2024 targeted balance sheet repositioning in our net interest margin. Components of the 24 basis point increase in net interest margin1 during the second quarter of 2024 include:\n\n  * Increased loan portfolio yield contributed +35 basis points\n  * Reduced time deposit funding costs contributed +7 basis points\n  * Balance Sheet repositioning contributed +3 basis points\n  * Increased purchase accounting contributed +2 basis points\n  * Reduced borrowing expense +1 basis point\n  * Decreased cash and securities portfolio yield contributed -18 basis points\n  * Increased non-maturity deposit funding costs contributed -6 basis points\n\n\n\nBased on our most recent Asset Liability Management Committee (“ALCO”) model, a +100 basis point parallel rate shock is expected to increase net interest income by 1.8% over the subsequent twelve-month period. Market competition for deposits continues and lower cost deposits continue to rotate into higher beta products, which is factored into our ALCO model and margin forecast. Busey continues to evaluate off-balance sheet hedging and balance sheet restructuring strategies as well as embedding rate protection in our asset originations to provide stabilization to net interest income in lower rate environments. Time deposit and savings specials have provided funding flows, and we had excess earning cash levels at the end of the second quarter. Since the onset of the current FOMC tightening cycle that began in the first quarter of 2022, our cumulative interest-bearing non-maturity deposit beta has been 38%. Our cycle-to-date total deposit beta has been 32% through June 30, 2024. Deposit betas were calculated based on an average federal funds rate of 5.50% during the second quarter of 2024. The average federal funds rate has remained unchanged since the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\n**NONINTEREST INCOME**\n\nNoninterest income was $33.8 million for the second quarter of 2024, as compared to $35.0 million for the first quarter of 2024 and $28.0 million for the second quarter of 2023. Excluding the impact of the mortgage servicing rights sale and net securities gains and losses, adjusted noninterest income1 was $33.9 million, or 29.1% of operating revenue1, during the second quarter of 2024, $33.9 million, or 30.9% of operating revenue, for the first quarter of 2024, and $30.1 million, or 27.7% of operating revenue, for the second quarter of 2023.\n\nConsolidated wealth management fees were $15.9 million for the second quarter of 2024, compared to $15.5 million for the first quarter of 2024 and $14.6 million for the second quarter of 2023. On a segment basis, Wealth Management generated $16.1 million in revenue during the second quarter of 2024, a 9.5% increase over revenue of $14.7 million for the second quarter of 2023. Second quarter of 2024 results marked a new record high reported quarterly revenue for the Wealth Management operating segment. The Wealth Management operating segment generated net income of $5.6 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared to $5.0 million in the first quarter of 2024 and $4.9 million in the second quarter of 2023. Busey’s Wealth Management division ended the second quarter of 2024 with $13.02 billion in assets under care, compared to $12.76 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2024 and $11.48 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2023. Our portfolio management team continues to focus on long-term returns and managing risk in the face of volatile markets and has outperformed its blended benchmark6 over the last three and five years.\n\nPayment technology solutions revenue was $5.9 million for the second quarter of 2024, compared to $5.7 million for the first quarter of 2024 and $5.2 million for the second quarter of 2023. Excluding intracompany eliminations, the FirsTech operating segment generated revenue of $6.2 million during the second quarter of 2024, compared to $6.0 million in the first quarter of 2024 and $5.6 million in the second quarter of 2023. Second quarter of 2024 results marked a new record high reported quarterly revenue for the FirsTech operating segment for the third consecutive quarter. The FirsTech operating segment generated an insignificant amount of net income for the second quarter of 2024, compared to $0.1 million for the first quarter of 2024 and $0.2 million for the second quarter of 2023.\n\nRevenues from wealth management fees and payment technology solutions activities represented 64.4% of Busey’s adjusted noninterest income1 for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, providing a balance to spread-based revenue from traditional banking activities.\n\nFees for customer services were $7.8 million for the second quarter of 2024, compared to $7.1 million in the first quarter of 2024 and $7.2 million in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nNet securities losses were $0.4 million for the second quarter of 2024, comprised primarily of unrealized losses on equity securities.\n\nOther noninterest income was $2.3 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared to $3.4 million in the first quarter of 2024 and $1.7 million in the second quarter of 2023. Fluctuations in other noninterest income are primarily attributable to decreases in venture capital investments, and increases in swap origination fees and commercial loan sales gains, as well as the addition of Life Equity Loan® servicing income.\n\n**OPERATING EFFICIENCY**\n\nSecond quarter expenses include the costs of operating M&M Bank as a stand-alone bank from April 1, 2024, through June 21, 2024. Noninterest expense was $75.5 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared to $70.8 million in the first quarter of 2024 and $69.2 million for the second quarter of 2023. The efficiency ratio1 was 62.3% for the second quarter of 2024, compared to 58.1% for the first quarter of 2024, and 60.9% for the second quarter of 2023. Adjusted core expense was $71.1 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared to $68.6 million in the first quarter of 2024 and $64.0 million in the second quarter of 2023. The adjusted core efficiency ratio1 was 60.9% for the second quarter of 2024, compared to 62.3% for the first quarter of 2024, and 58.6% for the second quarter of 2023. Busey remains focused on expense discipline and expects to realize increased rates of M&M acquisition synergies in the second half of 2024.\n\nNoteworthy components of noninterest expense are as follows:\n\n  * Salaries, wages, and employee benefits expenses were $43.5 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared to $42.1 million in the first quarter of 2024 and $39.9 million in the second quarter of 2023. Busey recorded $1.1 million of non-operating salaries, wages, and employee benefit expenses in the second quarter of 2024, compared to $0.1 million in the first quarter of 2024 and none in the second quarter of 2023. Our associate-base consisted of 1,520 full-time equivalents as of June 30, 2024, compared to 1,464 as of March 31, 2024, and 1,477 as of June 30, 2023. The increase in our associate-base in the second quarter of 2024 was largely due to the M&M acquisition.\n  * Data processing expense was $7.1 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared to $6.6 million in the first quarter of 2024 and $5.9 million in the second quarter of 2023. Busey recorded $0.3 million of non-operating data processing expenses in the second quarter of 2024, compared to $0.1 million in the first quarter of 2024 and none in the second quarter of 2023. Busey has continued to make investments in technology enhancements and has also experienced inflation-driven price increases.\n  * Professional fees were $2.5 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared to $2.3 million in the first quarter of 2024 and $1.0 million in the second quarter of 2023. Busey recorded $0.4 million of non-operating professional fees in the second quarter of 2024, as compared to $0.1 million in the first quarter of 2024 and none in the second quarter of 2023.\n  * Amortization of intangible assets was $2.6 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared to $2.4 million in the first quarter of 2024 and $2.7 million in the second quarter of 2023.\n  * Other noninterest expense was $10.4 million for the second quarter of 2024, compared to $7.9 million in the first quarter of 2024 and $10.2 million in the second quarter of 2023. Busey recorded $0.3 million of non-operating costs in other noninterest expense in the second quarter of 2024, compared to immaterial amounts in the first quarter of 2024 and the second quarter of 2023. In connection with Busey’s adoption of ASU 2023-02 on January 1, 2024, Busey began recording amortization of New Markets Tax Credits as income tax expense instead of other operating expense, which resulted in a decrease to other operating expenses of $2.3 million compared to the second quarter of 2023. Other items contributing to the fluctuations in other noninterest expense included the provision for unfunded commitments, sales of other real estate owned, fixed asset impairment, marketing, and business development expenses.\n\n\n\nBusey's effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2024 was 28.8%, which includes a one-time deferred tax valuation adjustment of $1.4 million resulting from a change to our Illinois apportionment rate due to recently enacted regulations. These new regulations are expected to lower our ongoing tax obligation in future periods, but create a negative adjustment to the carrying value of our deferred tax asset in the current period. Without this one-time adjustment, the effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2024 would have been 25.0%, lower than the combined federal and state statutory rate of approximately 28.0% due to the impact of tax exempt interest income, such as municipal bond interest, bank owned life insurance income, and investments in various federal and state tax credits. Further, the effective tax rate is higher in 2024, compared to 2023, due to the adoption of ASU 2023-02 in January 2024. Upon adoption of ASU 2023-02 Busey elected to use the proportional amortization method of accounting for equity investments made primarily for the purpose of receiving income tax credits. The proportional amortization method results in the cost of the investment being amortized in proportion to the income tax credits and other income tax benefits received, with the amortization of the investment and the income tax credits being presented net in the income statement as a component of income tax expense as opposed to being presented on a gross basis on the income statement as a component of noninterest expense and income tax expense.\n\n**CAPITAL STRENGTH**\n\nBusey's strong capital levels, coupled with its earnings, have allowed the Company to provide a steady return to its stockholders through dividends. On July 26, 2024, Busey will pay a cash dividend of $0.24 per common share to stockholders of record as of July 19, 2024. Busey has consistently paid dividends to its common stockholders since the bank holding company was organized in 1980.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, Busey continued to exceed the capital adequacy requirements necessary to be considered “well-capitalized” under applicable regulatory guidelines. Busey’s Common Equity Tier 1 ratio is estimated4 to be 13.19% at June 30, 2024, compared to 13.45% at March 31, 2024, and 12.35% at June 30, 2023. Our Total Capital to Risk Weighted Assets ratio is estimated4 to be 17.49% at June 30, 2024, compared to 17.95% at March 31, 2024, and 16.56% at June 30, 2023.\n\nBusey’s tangible common equity1 was $970.9 million at June 30, 2024, compared to $937.6 million at March 31, 2024, and $850.9 million at June 30, 2023. Tangible common equity1 represented 8.36% of tangible assets at June 30, 2024, compared to 8.12% at March 31, 2024, and 7.18% at June 30, 2023. Busey’s tangible book value per common share1 increased to $16.97 at June 30, 2024, from $16.84 at March 31, 2024, and $15.25 at June 30, 2023, reflecting an 11.3% year-over-year increase. The ratios of tangible common equity to tangible assets1 and tangible book value per common share have been impacted by the fair market valuation adjustment of Busey’s securities portfolio as a result of the current rate environment, which is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) component of shareholder’s equity.\n\n**2Q24 EARNINGS INVESTOR PRESENTATION**\n\n**For additional information on Busey’s financial condition and operating results, please refer to the****2Q24****Earnings Investor Presentation furnished via Form 8-K on****July 23, 2024****, in connection with this earnings release.**\n\n**CORPORATE PROFILE**\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, First Busey Corporation (Nasdaq: BUSE) was an $11.97 billion financial holding company headquartered in Champaign, Illinois.\n\nBusey Bank, a wholly-owned bank subsidiary of First Busey Corporation, had total assets of $11.94 billion as of June 30, 2024, and is headquartered in Champaign, Illinois.

Jones, Chief Financial Officer 217-365-4130\n\n**NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION**\n\nThis earnings release contains certain financial information determined by methods other than GAAP. Management uses these non-GAAP measures, together with the related GAAP measures, in analysis of Busey’s performance and in making business decisions, as well as for comparison to Busey’s peers. Busey believes the adjusted measures are useful for investors and management to understand the effects of certain non-core and non-recurring noninterest items and provide additional perspective on Busey’s performance over time.\n\nBelow is a reconciliation to what management believes to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures—specifically, net interest income, total noninterest income, net security gains and losses, and total noninterest expense in the case of pre-provision net revenue, adjusted pre-provision net revenue, pre-provision net revenue to average assets, and adjusted pre-provision net revenue to average assets; net income in the case of adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted return on average assets, average tangible common equity, return on average tangible common equity, adjusted return on average tangible common equity; net income and net security gains and losses in the case of further adjusted net income and further adjusted diluted earnings per share; net interest income in the case of adjusted net interest income and adjusted net interest margin; net interest income, total noninterest income, and total noninterest expense in the case of adjusted noninterest income, adjusted noninterest expense, noninterest expense excluding non-operating adjustments, adjusted core expense, efficiency ratio, adjusted efficiency ratio, and adjusted core efficiency ratio; net interest income, total noninterest income, net securities gains and losses, and gain on sale of mortgage servicing rights in the case of operating revenue and adjusted noninterest income to operating revenue; total assets and goodwill and other intangible assets in the case of tangible assets; total stockholders’ equity in the case of tangible book value per common share; total assets and total stockholders’ equity in the case of tangible common equity and tangible common equity to tangible assets; and total deposits in the case of core deposits and core deposits to total deposits.\n\nThese non-GAAP disclosures have inherent limitations and are not audited.

Forward-looking statements, which may be based upon beliefs, expectations and assumptions of Busey’s management and on information currently available to management, are generally identifiable by the use of words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “intend,” “estimate,” “may,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “should” or other similar expressions. Additionally, all statements in this document, including forward-looking statements, speak only as of the date they are made, and Busey undertakes no obligation to update any statement in light of new information or future events. A number of factors, many of which are beyond Busey’s ability to control or predict, could cause actual results to differ materially from those in any forward-looking statements. These factors include, among others, the following: (1) the strength of the local, state, national, and international economy (including effects of inflationary pressures and supply chain constraints); (2) the economic impact of any future terrorist threats or attacks, widespread disease or pandemics, or other adverse external events that could cause economic deterioration or instability in credit markets (including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict); (3) changes in state and federal laws, regulations, and governmental policies concerning Busey's general business (including changes in response to the failures of other banks or as a result of the upcoming 2024 presidential election); (4) changes in accounting policies and practices; (5) changes in interest rates and prepayment rates of Busey’s assets (including the impact of sustained elevated interest rates); (6) increased competition in the financial services sector (including from non-bank competitors such as credit unions and fintech companies) and the inability to attract new customers; (7) changes in technology and the ability to develop and maintain secure and reliable electronic systems; (8) the loss of key executives or associates; (9) changes in consumer spending; (10) unexpected results of acquisitions (including the acquisition of M&M); (11) unexpected outcomes of existing or new litigation, investigations, or inquiries involving Busey (including with respect to Busey’s Illinois franchise taxes); (12) fluctuations in the value of securities held in Busey’s securities portfolio; (13) concentrations within Busey’s loan portfolio (including commercial real estate loans), large loans to certain borrowers, and large deposits from certain clients; (14) the concentration of large deposits from certain clients who have balances above current FDIC insurance limits and may withdraw deposits to diversify their exposure; (15) the level of non-performing assets on Busey’s balance sheets; (16) interruptions involving information technology and communications systems or third-party servicers; (17) breaches or failures of information security controls or cybersecurity-related incidents; and (18) the economic impact of exceptional weather occurrences such as tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, blizzards, and droughts. These risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements.\n\nAdditional information concerning Busey and its business, including additional factors that could materially affect Busey’s financial results, is included in Busey’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n**END NOTES**\n\n1 | See _\"__Non-GAAP Financial Information_ _\"_ for a reconciliation.  \n---|---  \n2 | Estimated uninsured and uncollateralized deposits consist of account balances in excess of the $250 thousand FDIC insurance limit, less intercompany accounts and collateralized accounts (including preferred deposits).  \n3 | Central Business District areas within Busey’s footprint include downtown St. Louis, downtown Indianapolis, and downtown Chicago.  \n4 | Capital amounts and ratios for the second quarter of 2024 are not yet finalized and are subject to change.  \n5 | On- and off-balance sheet liquidity is comprised of cash and cash equivalents, debt securities excluding those pledged as collateral, brokered deposits, and Busey’s borrowing capacity through its revolving credit facility, the FHLB, the Federal Reserve Bank, and federal funds purchased lines.  \n6 | The blended benchmark consists of 60% MSCI All Country World Index and 40% Bloomberg Intermediate US Government/Credit Total Return Index.  \n  \n![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/OThkMDk1ZjgtYmEwNS00ZjgxLWFjZjEtZGQ0NmQwOWZjODNlLTEwMzA1NTA=/tiny/First-Busey-Corporation.png)\n"

Adjusted net income1 was $26.5 million, or $0.47 per diluted common share, for the first quarter of 2024, compared to $29.1 million, or $0.52 per diluted common share, for the fourth quarter of 2023, and $36.8 million, or $0.65 per diluted common share, for the first quarter of 2023. Annualized return on average assets and annualized return on average tangible common equity1 were 0.88% and 11.43%, respectively, for the first quarter of 2024. Annualized adjusted return on average assets1 and annualized adjusted return on average tangible common equity1 were 0.89% and 11.56%, respectively, for the first quarter of 2024.\n\nPre-provision net revenue1 was $46.4 million for the first quarter of 2024, compared to $32.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 and $47.9 million for the first quarter of 2023. Pre-provision net revenue to average assets1 was 1.55% for the first quarter of 2024, compared to 1.06% for the fourth quarter of 2023, and 1.58% for the first quarter of 2023. The $13.5 million increase in pre-provision net revenue in the first quarter, compared to the fourth quarter, was primarily the result of a $7.5 million gain on sale of mortgage servicing rights realized in connection with our strategic two-part balance sheet repositioning completed during the first quarter of 2024, as well as a decrease of $4.2 million in noninterest expense.\n\nAdjusted pre-provision net revenue1 was $38.6 million for the first quarter of 2024, compared to $40.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 and $49.5 million for the first quarter of 2023. Adjusted pre-provision net revenue to average assets1 was 1.29% for the first quarter of 2024, compared to 1.30% for the fourth quarter of 2023 and 1.64% for the first quarter of 2023.\n\nOur fee-based businesses continue to add revenue diversification. Total noninterest income was $35.0 million for the first quarter of 2024, compared to $31.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 and $31.8 million for the first quarter of 2023. Adjusted noninterest income1 was $33.9 million, or 30.9% of operating revenue2, during the first quarter of 2024, compared to $30.8 million, or 28.5% of total operating revenue, for the fourth quarter of 2023 and $32.5 million, or 27.4% of total operating revenue for the first quarter of 2023. Wealth management fees and payment technology solutions contributed $15.5 million and $5.7 million, respectively, to our consolidated noninterest income for the first quarter of 2024, representing 60.7% of noninterest income on a combined basis.\n\nBusey views certain non-operating items, including acquisition-related and other restructuring charges, as adjustments to net income reported under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). Non-operating pretax adjustments for acquisition and other restructuring charges in the first quarter of 2024 were $0.4 million. Busey believes that the following non-GAAP measures facilitate the assessment of its financial results and peer comparability: pre-provision net revenue, adjusted pre-provision net revenue, pre-provision net revenue to average assets, adjusted pre-provision net revenue to average assets, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted return on average assets, return on average tangible common equity, adjusted return on average tangible common equity, further adjusted net income, further adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted net interest income, adjusted net interest margin, adjusted noninterest income, adjusted noninterest expense, adjusted core expense, efficiency ratio, adjusted efficiency ratio, adjusted core efficiency ratio, tangible book value per common share, tangible common equity, tangible common equity to tangible assets, core deposits, and core deposits to total deposits. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures is included in tabular form at the end of this release (see _\"__Non-GAAP Financial Information_ _\"_).\n\nWe have effectively managed our noninterest expense during a time of decades-high inflation and have been purposeful in our efforts to rationalize our expense base given our economic outlook and our view on the future of banking. Noninterest expense was $70.8 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to $75.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $70.4 million in the first quarter of 2023. Adjusted noninterest expense1, which excludes the amortization of intangible assets and acquisition and restructuring related expenses, was $68.0 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to $68.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $67.7 million in the first quarter of 2023. Throughout 2024, we expect to continue to prudently manage our expenses.\n\n**_Acquisition of Merchants and Manufacturers Bank Corporation Completed April 1, 2024_**\n\nEffective April 1, 2024, Busey completed its previously announced acquisition (the \"Merger\") of Merchants and Manufacturers Bank Corporation, an Illinois corporation (“M&M”), pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated November 27, 2023, between Busey and M&M (the “Merger Agreement”). Upon completion of the Merger, each share of M&M common stock converted to the right to receive, at the election of each stockholder and subject to proration and adjustment, either (1) $117.74 in cash (“Cash Election”), (2) 5.7294 shares of Busey common stock (“Share Election”), or (3) mixed consideration of $34.55 in cash and 4.0481 shares of Busey common stock (“Mixed Election”).\n\nMost of the M&M common stockholders who submitted an election form by the election deadline made the Share Election to receive their Merger consideration solely in the form of shares of Busey common stock. As a result of the elections of M&M common stockholders, and in accordance with the proration and adjustment provisions of the Merger Agreement, the Merger consideration paid to M&M common stockholders was comprised of an aggregate of approximately 1,429,304 shares of Busey common stock and an aggregate of approximately $12.2 million in cash, allocated as follows for each share of M&M stock: (1) $117.74 in cash for the Cash Election, (2) $5.3966 in cash and 5.4668 shares of Busey common stock for the Share Election, and (3) $34.55 in cash and 4.0481 shares of Busey common stock for the Mixed Election. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, M&M common stockholders that did not make an election or submit a properly completed election form by the election deadline of March 29, 2024, received cash consideration of $117.74 for each share of M&M common stock held. No fractional shares were issued in the Merger. Fractional shares were paid in cash at the rate of $23.32 per share.\n\nBusey incurred one-time acquisition-related expenses of $0.3 million in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nLate in the second quarter of 2024, M&M Bank will be merged with and into Busey Bank (the “Bank Merger”). At the time of the Bank Merger, M&M Bank’s banking centers will become banking centers of Busey Bank, except for M&M’s banking center located at 990 Essington Rd., Joliet, Illinois, which is expected to be closed in connection with the Bank Merger. This partnership adds M&M’s Life Equity Loan® products to Busey’s existing suite of services and expands Busey’s presence in the Chicago Metropolitan Statistical Area.\n\n**_Busey executed a two-part balance sheet repositioning strategy_**\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, Busey sold the mortgage servicing rights on approximately $923.5 million of one- to four-family mortgage loans for an estimated pre-tax gain of $7.5 million, which enabled us to sell available-for-sale investment securities with a book value of approximately $108.2 million for a pre-tax loss of $6.8 million with no resulting impact to tangible capital.\n\nAt the time of the sale, the securities sold yielded a weighted average rate of 1.98% and had a weighted-average life of 2.3 years. Proceeds from the repositioning were deposited into an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve yielding 5.40%. Busey anticipates reinvesting the proceeds into higher yielding organic growth opportunities over time.\n\nThe increased net interest spread as a result of the two-part repositioning is expected to increase net interest income by approximately $3.3 million on an annualized basis and improve the net interest margin run rate by 3 basis points. In addition, execution of these transactions further bolsters Busey’s liquidity position and balance sheet flexibility, while also strengthening its capital position.\n\nIn combination, the gain generated from the sale of mortgage servicing rights and the loss generated from the sale of securities had an immediate positive impact on consolidated stockholders’ equity and book value per share. Risk-based regulatory capital ratios increased modestly as a result of the repositioning proceeds rotating into lower risk-weighted assets. Busey expects the above transactions to be accretive to capital and earnings per share in future periods.\n\n**_Busey’s Conservative Banking Strategy_**\n\nBusey’s financial strength is built on a long-term conservative operating approach. That focus will not change now or in the future.\n\nThe quality of our core deposit franchise is a critical value driver of our institution. Our granular deposit base continues to position us well and as of March 31, 2024, our estimated uninsured and uncollateralized deposits3 percentage was 29%, and 96.7% of our deposits were core deposits1. Our retail deposit base was comprised of more than 253,000 accounts with an average balance of $22 thousand and an average tenure of 16.6 years as of March 31, 2024. Our commercial deposit base was comprised of more than 33,000 accounts with an average balance of $98 thousand and an average tenure of 12.4 years as of March 31, 2024. We have sufficient on- and off-balance sheet liquidity to manage deposit fluctuations and the liquidity needs of our customers.\n\nAsset quality remains strong by both Busey’s historical and current industry trends. Non-performing assets increased to $17.6 million during the first quarter of 2024, still representing only 0.15% of total assets. Busey’s results for the first quarter of 2024 include a $5.0 million provision expense for credit losses and a $0.7 million provision release for unfunded commitments. The allowance for credit losses was $91.6 million as of March 31, 2024, representing 1.21% of total portfolio loans outstanding, and 521.6% of non-performing loans. Busey recorded net charge offs of $5.2 million in the first quarter of 2024. The increase in non-performing assets and provision expense for credit losses during the first quarter of 2024, as well as the majority of the net charge-offs, were primarily in connection with a single commercial credit relationship. As of March 31, 2024, our commercial real estate loan portfolio of investor-owned office properties within Central Business District4 areas remained low at $4.7 million. Our credit performance continues to reflect our highly diversified, conservatively underwritten loan portfolio, which has been originated predominantly to established customers with tenured relationships with our company.\n\nThe strength of our balance sheet is also reflected in our capital foundation. In the first quarter of 2024, Common Equity Tier 1 and Total Capital to Risk Weighted Assets ratios5 increased to 13.45% and 17.95%, respectively. In fact, our regulatory capital ratios continue to provide a buffer of more than $540 million above levels required to be designated well-capitalized. Our Tangible Common Equity ratio1 increased to 8.12% during the first quarter of 2024, compared to 7.75% for the fourth quarter of 2023 and 7.05% for the first quarter of 2023. Busey’s tangible book value per common share1 increased to $16.84 at March 31, 2024, from $16.62 at December 31, 2023 and $15.14 at March 31, 2023, reflecting an 11.2% year-over-year increase. During the first quarter of 2024, we paid a common share dividend of $0.24.\n\n**_Community Banking_**\n\nBusey’s focus has always been—and will always be—on doing the right thing for our Pillars: our associates, customers, communities, and shareholders. This commitment is the defining aspect of our culture, a vision that is brought to life each day by associates throughout our organization who understand the importance of exceeding customer needs and bettering our vibrant communities.

We are excited to welcome our M&M colleagues into the Busey family and feel confident that the transaction and our continued efforts will lead to attractive financial returns in future periods.\n\nVan A.

Total assets were $11.89 billion as of March 31, 2024, compared to $12.28 billion as of December 31, 2023, and $12.34 billion as of March 31, 2023.\n\nAs has been our practice, we remain steadfast in our conservative approach to underwriting and disciplined approach to pricing, particularly given our outlook for the economy in the coming quarters, and this approach has impacted loan growth as predicted. Portfolio loans totaled $7.59 billion at March 31, 2024, compared to $7.65 billion at December 31, 2023, and $7.78 billion at March 31, 2023. The $63.0 million decline in portfolio loans during the first quarter of 2024 resulted from lower new origination volume.\n\nAverage portfolio loans were $7.60 billion for the first quarter of 2024, compared to $7.74 billion for the fourth quarter of 2023 and $7.71 billion for the first quarter of 2023. Average interest-earning assets were $11.00 billion for the first quarter of 2024, compared to $11.23 billion for the fourth quarter of 2023, and $11.18 billion for the first quarter of 2023.\n\nTotal deposits were $9.96 billion at March 31, 2024, compared to $10.29 billion at December 31, 2023, and $9.80 billion at March 31, 2023. Average deposits were $10.04 billion for the first quarter of 2024, compared to $10.37 billion for the fourth quarter of 2023 and $9.91 billion for the first quarter of 2023. Deposit fluctuations over the last several quarters were driven by a number of elements, including (1) seasonal factors, including ordinary course public fund flows and fluctuations in the normal course of business operations of certain core commercial customers, (2) the macroeconomic environment, including prevailing interest rates and anticipated future Federal Open Market Committee (“FOMC”) rate moves, as well as inflationary pressures, (3) depositors moving some funds to accounts at competitors offering above-market rates, including state-sponsored investment programs that provide rates in excess of where we can borrow in the wholesale marketplace, and (4) deposits moving within the Busey ecosystem from deposit accounts to our wealth management group. Furthermore, during the first quarter of 2024, we moved $129.7 million of wealth management client funds that had previously been swept into interest-bearing money market accounts at Busey Bank back to money market investments managed by the Wealth Management division. At the time those funds were moved, they were carrying a weighted average interest rate of 5.44%. Core deposits1 accounted for 96.7% of total deposits as of March 31, 2024. Cost of deposits was 1.76% in the first quarter of 2024, which represents an increase of 2 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2023. Excluding time deposits, Busey’s cost of deposits was 1.32% in the first quarter of 2024, an increase of 1 basis point from the fourth quarter of 2023. Spot rates on total deposit costs, including noninterest bearing deposits, decreased by 9 basis points from 1.76% at December 31, 2023, to 1.67% at March 31, 2024. Spot rates on interest bearing deposits decreased by 11 basis points from 2.43% at December 31, 2023 to 2.32% at March 31, 2024.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2024 Busey paid off its term loan, which consisted of both short-term borrowings and long-term debt. Short term borrowings were zero at March 31, 2024, compared to $12.0 million at December 31, 2023, and $615.9 million at March 31, 2023. We had no borrowings from the FHLB at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023 or the first quarter of 2024, compared to $603.9 million at the end of the first quarter of 2023. We have sufficient on- and off-balance sheet liquidity6 to manage deposit fluctuations and the liquidity needs of our customers. As of March 31, 2024, our available sources of on- and off-balance sheet liquidity totaled $6.60 billion. We increased deposit campaigns starting in the first quarter of 2023 to attract term funding and savings accounts at a lower rate than our marginal cost of funds. In addition, we instituted a company-wide incentive campaign to drive new customer account openings. New certificate of deposit production in the first quarter of 2024 had a weighted average term of 8.7 months at a rate of 3.26%, 218 basis points below our average marginal wholesale funding cost during the quarter. In total, our deposit initiatives contributed $286 million of retail deposit growth over the last twelve months. Furthermore, our balance sheet liquidity profile continues to be aided by the cash flows we expect from our relatively short-duration securities portfolio. Those cash flows were $90.1 million in the first quarter of 2024. For the remainder of 2024, cash flows from our securities portfolio are expected to be approximately $239.0 million with a current book yield of 2.04%.\n\n**ASSET QUALITY**\n\nCredit quality continues to be strong. Loans 30-89 days past due totaled $7.4 million as of March 31, 2024, compared to $5.8 million as of December 31, 2023, and $5.5 million as of March 31, 2023. Non-performing loans were $17.6 million as of March 31, 2024, compared to $7.8 million as of December 31, 2023, and $15.2 million as of March 31, 2023. The increase in non-performing loans during the first quarter of 2024 can be substantially attributed to a single commercial credit relationship. Continued disciplined credit management resulted in non-performing loans as a percentage of portfolio loans of 0.23% as of March 31, 2024, 0.10% as of December 31, 2023, and 0.20% as of March 31, 2023. Non-performing assets were 0.15% of total assets for first quarter of 2024, compared to 0.06% for the fourth quarter of 2023 and 0.13% for the first quarter of 2023. Our total classified assets increased to $105.4 million at March 31, 2024, from $72.3 million at December 31, 2023, and $103.9 million at March 31, 2023. Our ratio of classified assets to total capital and reserves remains low by historical standards, at 7.2% as of March 31, 2024, compared to 5.0% as of December 31, 2023, and 7.3% as of March 31, 2023.\n\nNet charge-offs were $5.2 million for the first quarter of 2024, compared to $0.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, and $0.8 million for the first quarter of 2023. The increase in the first quarter of 2024 was limited to the single commercial credit relationship mentioned above. The allowance as a percentage of portfolio loans was 1.21% as of March 31, 2024, compared to 1.20% as of December 31, 2023, and 1.18% as of March 31, 2023. The allowance as a percentage of non-performing loans was 521.6% as of March 31, 2024, compared to 1,173.7% as of December 31, 2023, and 602.9% as of March 31, 2023.\n\nBusey maintains a well-diversified loan portfolio and, as a matter of policy and practice, limits concentration exposure in any particular loan segment.\n\n**ASSET QUALITY**** _(unaudited)_**  \n---  \n_(dollars in thousands)_  \n**As of**  \n**March 31,** **2024** | **December 31,** **2023** | **March 31,** **2023**  \n**Total assets** | $ | 11,887,458 | $ | 12,283,415 | $ | 12,344,555  \n**Portfolio loans** | 7,588,077 | 7,651,034 | 7,783,808  \nLoans 30 – 89 days past due | 7,441 | 5,779 | 5,472  \nNon-performing loans:  \nNon-accrual loans | 17,465 | 7,441 | 14,714  \nLoans 90+ days past due and still accruing | 88 | 375 | 500  \nNon-performing loans | $ | 17,553 | $ | 7,816 | $ | 15,214  \nNon-performing loans, segregated by geography:  \nIllinois / Indiana | $ | 13,553 | $ | 3,715 | $ | 10,416  \nMissouri | 3,746 | 3,836 | 4,103  \nFlorida | 254 | 265 | 695  \nOther non-performing assets | 65 | 125 | 759  \nNon-performing assets | $ | 17,618 | $ | 7,941 | $ | 15,973  \n**Allowance for credit losses** | $ | 91,562 | $ | 91,740 | $ | 91,727  \n**RATIOS**  \nNon-performing loans to portfolio loans | 0.23 | % | 0.10 | % | 0.20 | %  \nNon-performing assets to total assets | 0.15 | % | 0.06 | % | 0.13 | %  \nNon-performing assets to portfolio loans and other non-performing assets | 0.23 | % | 0.10 | % | 0.21 | %  \nAllowance for credit losses to portfolio loans | 1.21 | % | 1.20 | % | 1.18 | %  \nAllowance for credit losses as a percentage of non-performing loans | 521.63 | % | 1,173.75 | % | 602.91 | %  \n  \n**NET CHARGE OFFS (RECOVERIES) AND PROVISION EXPENSE (RELEASE)****_(unaudited)_**  \n---  \n_(dollars in thousands)_  \n**Three Months Ended**  \n**March 31,** **2024** | **December 31,** **2023** | **March 31,** **2023**  \nNet charge-offs (recoveries) | $ | 5,216 | $ | 425 | $ | 834  \nProvision expense (release) | 5,038 | 455 | 953  \n  \n**NET INTEREST MARGIN AND NET INTEREST INCOME**\n\nNet interest margin1 was 2.79% for the first quarter of 2024, compared to 2.74% for the fourth quarter of 2023 and 3.13% for the first quarter of 2023. Excluding purchase accounting accretion, adjusted net interest margin1 was 2.78% for the first quarter of 2024, compared to 2.73% in the fourth quarter of 2023 and 3.12% in the first quarter of 2023. Net interest income was $75.8 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to $77.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $85.9 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nThe FOMC raised rates by a total of 525 basis points since the onset of the current FOMC tightening cycle that began in the first quarter of 2022, with no further increases during the first quarter of 2024. Rising rates initially have a positive impact on net interest margin, as assets, in particular commercial loans, reprice more quickly and to a greater extent than liabilities. As deposit and funding costs increase in response to the tightening rate cycle, and we experience deposit migration into higher cost offerings and funding alternatives, some of the net interest margin expansion is reversed, which we began to experience in the first quarter of 2023. As lower yielding securities and loans continue to mature or renew at higher current market rates, expansion in asset yields has outpaced any remaining lagged pressure on funding costs. Our deposit cost of funds peaked in the beginning of the first quarter of 2024, and we have been able to reduce interest expense by offering lower CD specials as well as applying rate management on higher exception priced non-maturity deposit products. We have also begun to benefit from recent actions taken to proactively bolster our net interest margin, including the targeted repositionings completed in both the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, the reversal of the wealth management sweep accounts, and the pay down of our outstanding term debt at the holding company. The collective benefit of these actions on a full run-rate basis will not be realized until the second quarter of 2024. Components of the 5 basis point increase in net interest margin1 during the first quarter of 2024 include:\n\n  * Increased loan portfolio yield, offset by lower average balances, contributed +5 basis points\n  * Increased securities loss trade interest income contributed +3 basis points\n  * Reduced non-maturity deposit funding costs contributed +2 basis points\n  * Increased time deposit funding costs contributed -2 basis points\n  * Reduced cash and securities portfolio yield contributed -2 basis points\n  * Reduced impact from swaps and decreased purchase accounting contributed -1 basis point\n\n\n\nBased on our most recent Asset Liability Management Committee (“ALCO”) model, a +100 basis point parallel rate shock is expected to increase net interest income by 2.1% over the subsequent twelve-month period. Market competition for deposits continues and deposit betas are likely to rise marginally during the first half of 2024, which is factored into our ALCO model and margin forecast. Busey continues to evaluate off-balance sheet hedging and balance sheet restructuring strategies as well as embedding rate protection in our asset originations to provide stabilization to net interest income in lower rate environments. Time deposit specials and retail incentive campaigns continue to provide sufficient funding flows and we maintained excess earning cash levels throughout the quarter. Since the onset of the current FOMC tightening cycle that began in the first quarter of 2022, our cumulative interest-bearing non-maturity deposit beta has been 36%. Our cycle-to-date total deposit beta has been 32% through March 31, 2024. Deposit betas are calculated based on an average federal funds rate of 5.50% during the first quarter of 2024, representing no change from the average federal funds rate for the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\n**NONINTEREST INCOME**\n\nNoninterest income was $35.0 million for the first quarter of 2024, as compared to $31.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 and $31.8 million for the first quarter of 2023. Excluding the impact of the mortgage servicing rights sale and net securities gains and losses, adjusted noninterest income1 was $33.9 million or 30.9% of operating revenue, during the first quarter of 2024, compared to $30.8 million, or 28.5% of total operating revenue, for the fourth quarter of 2023 and $32.5 million, or 27.4% of total operating revenue, for the first quarter of 2023.\n\nConsolidated wealth management fees were $15.5 million for the first quarter of 2024, compared to $13.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 and $14.8 million for the first quarter of 2023. On a segment basis, Wealth Management generated $15.7 million in revenue during the first quarter of 2024, a 5.3% increase over the $14.9 million reported in the first quarter of 2023. The Wealth Management operating segment generated net income of $5.0 million in first quarter of 2024, compared to $4.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $4.9 million in the first quarter of 2023. Busey’s Wealth Management division ended the first quarter of 2024 with $12.76 billion in assets under care, compared to $12.14 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023 and $11.21 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2023. Our portfolio management team continues to focus on long-term returns and managing risk in the face of volatile markets and has outperformed its blended benchmark7 over the last three and five years.\n\nPayment technology solutions revenue was $5.7 million for the first quarter of 2024, compared to $5.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 and $5.3 million for the first quarter of 2023. Excluding intracompany eliminations, the FirsTech operating segment generated revenue of $6.0 million during the first quarter of 2024, compared to $5.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $5.7 million in the first quarter of 2023. First quarter of 2024 results marked a new record high reported quarterly revenue for the FirsTech operating segment. The FirsTech operating segment generated net income of $0.1 million for the first quarter of 2024, compared to $0.3 million fourth quarter of 2023 and an insignificant amount of net losses of in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nRevenues from wealth management fees and payment technology solutions activities represented 62.7% of Busey’s adjusted noninterest income1 for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, providing a balance to spread-based revenue from traditional banking activities.\n\nFees for customer services were $7.1 million for the first quarter of 2024, compared to $7.5 million for fourth quarter of 2023 and $6.8 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nNet securities losses were $6.4 million for the first quarter of 2024, which were comprised of $6.8 million in realized net losses as a result of our targeted balance sheet repositioning during the quarter, and $0.4 million in unrealized gains on equity securities.\n\nOther noninterest income was $10.9 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to $2.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $3.6 million in the first quarter of 2023. Other noninterest income for the first quarter of 2024 included $7.5 million in gains realized on the sale of mortgage servicing rights in connection with our strategic two-part balance sheet repositioning completed during the first quarter of 2024, and $1.3 million in gains on venture capital investments.\n\n**OPERATING EFFICIENCY**\n\nNoninterest expense was $70.8 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to $75.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $70.4 million for the first quarter of 2023. The efficiency ratio1 was 58.1% for the first quarter of 2024, compared to 66.9% for the fourth quarter of 2023, and 56.9% for the first quarter of 2023. Busey remains focused on expense discipline.\n\nNoteworthy components of noninterest expense are as follows:\n\n  * Salaries, wages, and employee benefits expenses were $42.1 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to $42.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $40.3 million in the first quarter of 2023. Busey recorded $0.1 million of non-operating salaries, wages, and employee benefit expenses in the first quarter of 2024, compared to $3.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and none in the first quarter of 2023. Our associate-base consisted of 1,464 full-time equivalents as of March 31, 2024, compared to 1,479 as of December 31, 2023, and 1,473 as of March 31, 2023.\n  * Data processing expense was $6.6 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to $6.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $5.6 million in the first quarter of 2023. Busey recorded $0.1 million of non-operating data processing expenses in the first quarter of 2024, compared to none in the fourth and first quarters of 2023. Busey continues to make investments in technology enhancements and continues to experience inflation-driven price increases.\n  * Professional fees were $2.3 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to $2.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $2.1 million in the first quarter of 2023. Busey recorded $0.1 million of non-operating professional fees in the first quarter of 2024, as compared to $0.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and none in the first quarter of 2023.\n  * Amortization of intangible assets was $2.4 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to $2.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $2.7 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n  * FDIC insurance expense was $1.4 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to $1.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $1.5 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n  * Other operating expenses were $7.9 million for the first quarter of 2024, compared to $12.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $9.8 million in the first quarter of 2023. In connection with Busey’s adoption of ASU 2023-02 on January 1, 2024, Busey began recording amortization of New Markets Tax Credits as income tax expense instead of other operating expense, which resulted in a decrease to other operating expenses of $2.3 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, and $2.2 million compared to the first quarter of 2023. Further changes in other operating expenses are attributable to multiple items, including the provision for unfunded commitments, sales of other real estate owned, marketing, and business development expenses.\n\n\n\nBusey's effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2024 was 25.0%, which was lower than the combined federal and state statutory rate of approximately 28.0% due to tax exempt interest income, such as municipal bond interest, bank owned life insurance income, and investments in various federal and state tax credits. The effective tax rate was higher in the first quarter of 2024 compared to previous quarters due to the adoption of ASU 2023-02 in January 2024. ASU 2023-02 allows entities to elect to account for equity investments made primarily for the purpose of receiving income tax credits using the proportional amortization method, regardless of the tax credit program through which the investment earns income tax credits if certain conditions are met. The proportional amortization method results in the cost of the investment being amortized in proportion to the income tax credits and other income tax benefits received, with the amortization of the investment and the income tax credits being presented net in the income statement as a component of income tax expense as opposed to being presented on a gross basis on the income statement as a component of noninterest expense and income tax expense.\n\n**CAPITAL STRENGTH**\n\nBusey's strong capital levels, coupled with its earnings, have allowed the Company to provide a steady return to its stockholders through dividends. On April 26, 2024, Busey will pay a cash dividend of $0.24 per common share to stockholders of record as of April 19, 2024. Busey has consistently paid dividends to its common stockholders since the bank holding company was organized in 1980.\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, Busey continued to exceed the capital adequacy requirements necessary to be considered “well-capitalized” under applicable regulatory guidelines. Busey’s Common Equity Tier 1 ratio is estimated5 to be 13.45% at March 31, 2024, compared to 13.09% at December 31, 2023, and 12.18% at March 31, 2023. Our Total Capital to Risk Weighted Assets ratio is estimated5 to be 17.95% at March 31, 2024, compared to 17.44% at December 31, 2023, and 16.40% at March 31, 2023.\n\nBusey’s tangible common equity1 was $937.6 million at March 31, 2024, compared to $925.0 million at December 31, 2023, and $845.3 million at March 31, 2023. Tangible common equity1 represented 8.12% of tangible assets at March 31, 2024, compared to 7.75% at December 31, 2023, and 7.05% at March 31, 2023. Busey’s tangible book value per common share1 increased to $16.84 at March 31, 2024, from $16.62 at December 31, 2023 and $15.14 at March 31, 2023, reflecting an 11.2% year-over-year increase. The ratios of tangible common equity to tangible assets1 and tangible book value per common share have been impacted by the fair market valuation adjustment of Busey’s securities portfolio as a result of the current rate environment, which is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) component of shareholder’s equity.\n\n**1Q24****EARNINGS INVESTOR PRESENTATION**\n\n**For additional information on Busey’s financial condition and operating results, please refer to the****1Q24****Earnings Investor Presentation furnished via Form 8-K on****April 23, 2024****, in connection with this earnings release.**\n\n**CORPORATE PROFILE**\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, First Busey Corporation (Nasdaq: BUSE) was a $11.89 billion financial holding company headquartered in Champaign, Illinois.\n\nBusey Bank, a wholly-owned bank subsidiary of First Busey Corporation, had total assets of $11.86 billion as of March 31, 2024, and is headquartered in Champaign, Illinois.

Jones, Chief Financial Officer 217-365-4130\n\n**NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION**\n\nThis earnings release contains certain financial information determined by methods other than GAAP. Management uses these non-GAAP measures, together with the related GAAP measures, in analysis of Busey’s performance and in making business decisions, as well as for comparison to Busey’s peers. Busey believes the adjusted measures are useful for investors and management to understand the effects of certain non-core and non-recurring noninterest items and provide additional perspective on Busey’s performance over time.\n\nBelow is a reconciliation to what management believes to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures—specifically, net interest income, total noninterest income, net security gains and losses, and total noninterest expense in the case of pre-provision net revenue, adjusted pre-provision net revenue, pre-provision net revenue to average assets, and adjusted pre-provision net revenue to average assets; net income in the case of adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted return on average assets, average tangible common equity, return on average tangible common equity, adjusted return on average tangible common equity; net income and net security gains and losses in the case of further adjusted net income and further adjusted diluted earnings per share; net interest income in the case of adjusted net interest income and adjusted net interest margin; net interest income, total noninterest income, and total noninterest expense in the case of adjusted noninterest income, adjusted noninterest expense, noninterest expense excluding non-operating adjustments, adjusted core expense, efficiency ratio, adjusted efficiency ratio, and adjusted core efficiency ratio; total assets and goodwill and other intangible assets in the case of tangible assets; total stockholders’ equity in the case of tangible book value per common share; total assets and total stockholders’ equity in the case of tangible common equity and tangible common equity to tangible assets; and total deposits in the case of core deposits and core deposits to total deposits.\n\nThese non-GAAP disclosures have inherent limitations and are not audited. They should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating results reported in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. Tax effected numbers included in these non-GAAP disclosures are based on estimated statutory rates or effective rates as appropriate.\n\n**RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES _(Unaudited)_ Pre-Provision Net Revenue, Adjusted Pre-Provision Net Revenue,** **Pre-Provision Net Revenue to Average Assets, and** **Adjusted Pre-Provision Net Revenue to Average Assets**  \n---  \n_(dollars in thousands)_  \n**Three Months Ended**  \n**March 31,** **2024** | **December 31,** **2023** | **March 31,** **2023**  \n**PRE-PROVISION NET REVENUE**  \n**Net interest income** | $ | 75,767 | $ | 77,133 | $ | 85,857  \n**Total noninterest income** | 35,000 | 31,516 | 31,848  \n**Net security (gains) losses** | 6,375 | (761 | ) | 616  \n**Total noninterest expense** | (70,769 | ) | (74,979 | ) | (70,403 | )  \nPre-provision net revenue | 46,373 | 32,909 | 47,918  \nNon-GAAP adjustments:  \nAcquisition and other restructuring expenses | 408 | 4,237 | —  \nProvision for unfunded commitments | (678 | ) | 818 | (635 | )  \nAmortization of New Markets Tax Credits | — | 2,259 | 2,221  \nGain on sale of mortgage service rights | (7,465 | ) | — | —  \nAdjusted pre-provision net revenue | $ | 38,638 | $ | 40,223 | $ | 49,504  \nPre-provision net revenue, annualized | [a] | $ | 186,511 | $ | 130,563 | $ | 194,334  \nAdjusted pre-provision net revenue, annualized | [b] | 155,401 | 159,580 | 200,766  \nAverage total assets | [c] | 12,024,208 | 12,308,491 | 12,263,718  \n**Reported:** Pre-provision net revenue to average assets1 | [a÷c] | 1.55 | % | 1.06 | % | 1.58 | %  \n**Adjusted:** Pre-provision net revenue to average assets1 | [b÷c] | 1.29 | % | 1.30 | % | 1.64 | %  \n  \n___________________________________________\n\n  1.

Forward-looking statements, which may be based upon beliefs, expectations and assumptions of Busey’s management and on information currently available to management, are generally identifiable by the use of words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “intend,” “estimate,” “may,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “should” or other similar expressions. Additionally, all statements in this document, including forward-looking statements, speak only as of the date they are made, and Busey undertakes no obligation to update any statement in light of new information or future events. A number of factors, many of which are beyond Busey’s ability to control or predict, could cause actual results to differ materially from those in any forward-looking statements. These factors include, among others, the following: (1) the strength of the local, state, national, and international economy (including effects of inflationary pressures and supply chain constraints); (2) the economic impact of any future terrorist threats or attacks, widespread disease or pandemics, or other adverse external events that could cause economic deterioration or instability in credit markets (including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict); (3) changes in state and federal laws, regulations, and governmental policies concerning Busey's general business (including changes in response to the failures of other banks or as a result of the upcoming 2024 presidential election); (4) changes in accounting policies and practices; (5) changes in interest rates and prepayment rates of Busey’s assets (including the impact of the significant rate increases by the Federal Reserve since 2022); (6) increased competition in the financial services sector (including from non-bank competitors such as credit unions and fintech companies) and the inability to attract new customers; (7) changes in technology and the ability to develop and maintain secure and reliable electronic systems; (8) the loss of key executives or associates; (9) changes in consumer spending; (10) unexpected results of acquisitions (including the acquisition of Merchants and Manufacturers Bank Corporation); (11) unexpected outcomes of existing or new litigation, investigations, or inquiries involving Busey (including with respect to Busey’s Illinois franchise taxes); (12) fluctuations in the value of securities held in Busey’s securities portfolio; (13) concentrations within Busey’s loan portfolio, large loans to certain borrowers, and large deposits from certain clients; (14) the concentration of large deposits from certain clients who have balances above current FDIC insurance limits and may withdraw deposits to diversify their exposure; (15) the level of non-performing assets on Busey’s balance sheets; (16) interruptions involving information technology and communications systems or third-party servicers; (17) breaches or failures of information security controls or cybersecurity-related incidents; and (18) the economic impact of exceptional weather occurrences such as tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, blizzards, and droughts. These risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements.\n\nAdditional information concerning Busey and its business, including additional factors that could materially affect Busey’s financial results, is included in Busey’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n**END NOTES**\n\n1 | See \"Non-GAAP Financial Information\" for a reconciliation.  \n---|---  \n2 | Operating revenue consists of net interest income plus noninterest income excluding net securities gains and losses and excluding gain on sale of mortgage servicing rights.  \n3 | Estimated uninsured and uncollateralized deposits consist of account balances in excess of the $250 thousand FDIC insurance limit, less intercompany accounts and collateralized accounts (including preferred deposits).  \n4 | Central Business District areas within Busey’s footprint include downtown St. Louis, downtown Indianapolis, and downtown Chicago.  \n5 | Capital ratios for the first quarter of 2024 are not yet finalized, and are subject to change.  \n6 | On- and off-balance sheet liquidity is comprised of cash and cash equivalents, debt securities excluding those pledged as collateral, brokered deposits, and Busey’s borrowing capacity through its revolving credit facility, the FHLB, the Federal Reserve Bank, and federal funds purchased lines.  \n7 | The blended benchmark consists of 60% MSCI All Country World Index and 40% Bloomberg Intermediate US Government/Credit Total Return Index.  \n  \nFirst Busey Corporation 100 W.
