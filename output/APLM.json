The data further supports verbreltinib’s high potency and its best-in-class potential.”\n\nThe poster presentation titled “Vebreltinib Efficacy and Safety in NSCLC Patients with METex14 Skipping Mutations” highlighted data from the ongoing global Phase 2 SPARTA-II trial and the Company’s partner, Avistone, Phase 2/3 KUNPENG trial in China. The analysis of the data included 108 patients without prior exposure to MET inhibitors (72 treatment-naive and 36 previously treated NSCLC patients) that received vebreltinib, 200 mg BID in 28-day cycle, with 12 months of follow up data. With centrally confirmed METex14 skipping, overall response rate (ORR) to vebreltinib in treatment-naïve patients was 66.7% (95% CI: 54.6, 77.3) with median duration of response (DOR) of 17.3 months and median progression free survival (PFS) of 13.8 months. In the previously treated patients, ORR was 61.1% (95% CI: 43.5, 76.9) with median DOR of 16.7 months and median PFS of 7.4 months. Among the 91 vebreltinib-treated NSCLC patients with METex14 for whom GCN data was available, GCN distribution was similar to those reported in AACR project GENIE and cBioportal. The ORRs by GCN continue to support vebreltinib’s efficacy, including in the GCN<4 cohort (ORR 67.8%; n=86) - a subgroup that was reported in other MET inhibitor trials to be less responsive: 18% ORR with capmatinib in patients with METex14 NSCLC and GCN<4, and 38.6% with savolitinib in METex14 NSCLC without METamp. Similarly, ORR was 69.2% in GCN<6 (n=91) and 100% (5/5) in GCN>4 cohorts. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAE) of grade 3 or higher were reported in 48.1% of patients, with the most common being edema (16.7%). No death was reported due to TEAEs.\n\nThe poster presentation will be available on the Apollomics website under the [Presentations](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=_lP16x2jeQEEagXNcxuP7Umz47MfyYB5zim3IQ8oxEAOKPPoCJGL_CoUg9CJRK7JDVfx3CyoPqQE6ma0sI-LacqYuuc_f6ixHPnNDbsqagyDh4HzaXKl1HwYmJrX83V2) page under the News and Events section.\n\n**About vebreltinib (APL-101)**\n\nVebreltinib is a potent, small molecule, orally bioavailable and highly selective c-MET inhibitor. It works by inhibiting the aberrant activation of the HGF/c-MET axis, a key pathway involved in tumor growth, proliferation, and the development of resistance to certain targeted therapies such as osimertinib. By targeting c-MET dysregulation, vebreltinib has demonstrated strong tumor inhibitory effect in a variety of preclinical c-MET dysregulated human gastric, hepatic, pancreatic and lung cancer xenograft animal models and patient-derived xenograft models (PDX).\n\nDetails on the Phase 1/2 SPARTA global clinical trial can be found on clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03175224. Apollomics is developing vebreltinib as single-agent cancer therapy in a variety of tumor types and actively assessing the potential of vebreltinib in combination with novel therapies. Vebreltinib recently received conditional approval from the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) of China and is currently under clinical investigation and not approved for any use in any other regions in the world.\n\n**About**[** _Apollomics Inc._**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=N8oH61z7x2Dk2IYP_NwGtyT96HgLl6ciHRoSKtTP3ta31PPjXXhlFOCzZO3UhlQy17l7pSMepBr3E0JIKUKwX2zXqcjFZ3nYs0nyRong2Bo=)\n\nApollomics Inc. is an innovative clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of oncology therapies with the potential to be combined with other treatment options to harness the immune system and target specific molecular pathways to inhibit cancer.

This includes new Apollomics data for the treatment of non-CNS solid tumors with Met fusions, an incremental data update for NSCLC with MET Exon 14 skipping earlier in the year and data for the treatment of NSCLC with MET Amplification shared in this announcement,” said Guo-Liang Yu, Ph.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Apollomics. “We are encouraged by these new data and remain focused on progressing the vebreltinib program to its first regulatory submission. We look forward to providing future data updates for this program.”\n\n**_Pipeline Update_**\n\n  * **Vebreltinib (APL-101) – a highly specific Met inhibitor for the treatment of NSCLC and other solid tumors with Met dysregulation**\n    * In August 2024, the Company announced data from its SPARTA Phase 2 clinical trial for 14 patients with non-CNS MET fusion solid tumors, where a 43% objective response rate (ORR) was achieved by RECIST v1.1 criteria. This includes six confirmed responses out of 14 evaluable patients: one complete response in second-line metastatic NSCLC and five partial responses (three patients with NSCLC, one patient with pancreatic cancer, and one patient with intrahepatic bile duct cancer). Alongside the Avistone data for vebreltinib in the treatment of glioblastoma with PTPRZ1 MET fusions, vebreltinib has now demonstrated activity in a variety of tumors with MET fusions.\n    * Apollomics has also recently completed an analysis of 38 patients in the SPARTA MET amplification cohorts. Testing method discordance (determination of MET amplification by status sequencing of blood, sequencing of tumor biopsies, and/or fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH), as well as the use of local versus central laboratory testing), has complicated the analysis. Of the patients with the highest MET gene copy number (GCN) as determined by central sequencing, an ORR of 30% (3/10) was achieved, as compared to 13% (5/38) in the overall dataset. Going forward, Apollomics will only enroll NSCLC patients with MET amplification confirmed by central FISH testing. Apollomics believes that MET GCN ≥10 by sequencing may be comparable to GCN ≥6 by central FISH testing, which is the criteria to define MET amplification used in previous clinical trials of other MET inhibitors.\n    * In March 2024, Apollomics announced an updated efficacy analysis by gene copy number (GCN) subgroup in the treatment of NSCLC patients with Met Exon 14 skipping mutations. The data show vebreltinib activity similar to previously announced. In the absence of overlapping c-Met amplification (GCN<4), in a pooled analysis of patients from SPARTA and KUNPENG an ORR of 67% was achieved (n=86).\n\n\n  * **Uproleselan (APL-106) – an E-selectin inhibitor as an adjunct to chemotherapy in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) treatment**\n    * In May 2024, GlycoMimetics, our licensor of uproleselan in China, announced negative results from its pivotal Phase 3 study of uproleselan in relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia. Apollomics is conducting a Phase 3 bridging study of uproleselan in China for the same indication. As positive results from the GlycoMimetics global study were likely necessary for approval of uproleselan in China for this indication, the Company has decided to close this study early and unblind after treatment for all patients is completed. As a result of these negative Phase 3 results from GlycoMimetics, the Company determined the recoverable amount was lower than the carrying value of the intangible asset and recorded an impairment loss of $10.0 million to write down the full value of our intangible asset for this program.\n\n\n\n**_Business Highlights_**\n\n  * **Focus on vebreltinib:** In July 2024, Apollomics announced a strategic prioritization for the treatment of NSCLC patients with Met Amplification. By focusing on the patient population with the greatest unmet medical need that can be addressed by MET inhibition with vebreltinib, Apollomics intends to apply its resources in the most efficient manner to generate additional clinical data for support of regulatory submissions.\n\n\n  * **Leadership team changes** : As previously announced, as a result of the updated strategic focus, and aligned with the Company’s resource needs going forward, Sanjeev Redkar, Ph.D., Company co-founder and former President, and Peony Yu, M.D., former Chief Medical Officer, have departed their previous roles and are expected to transition to consulting roles in August. Dr. Redkar will remain on the Board of Directors.\n\n\n  * **Raised $5.8 million:** In May 2024, the Company raised $5.8 million in a private placement in public equity (PIPE) financing, before transaction expenses.\n\n\n\n**_First Half 2024 Financial Results_**\n\n  * Cash, cash equivalents, bank deposits and money market funds as of June 30, 2024 were $25.9 million, compared to $37.8 million as of December 31, 2023. Based on current projections, the Company believes its cash position is sufficient to fund planned operations into the third quarter of 2025.\n\n\n  * Research and development (R&D) expenses were $16.9 million, including share-based compensation of $3.7 million, for the first half of 2024, compared to $16.5 million, including share-based compensation of $2.8 million, for the first half of 2023.\n\n\n  * General and administrative (G&A) expenses were $10.2 million, including share-based compensation of $4.5 million, for the first half of 2024, compared to $9.7 million, including share-based compensation of $2.4 million, for the first half of 2023.\n\n\n  * Net loss for the first half of 2024 was $(35.2) million, or $(0.38) per basic and diluted share, compared with a net loss of $(150.7) million, or $(2.55) per basic and diluted share, for the first half of 2023. Net loss for the first half of 2024 includes an impairment loss of $10.0 million to write down the full value of the uproleselan intangible asset. Net loss for the first half of 2023 includes a non-cash expense for change in fair value of convertible preferred shares of $76.4 million and expenses related to capital markets activities of $45.5 million.\n\n\n\n**About**[** _Apollomics Inc._**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=b3MzNpHJSkV5WQk318ui5WDwYkVv5gnOmDvA33cGpyJnAXvu25vSD_vdZLexiHwNwK6yak3il8BOJSoSyqV73EGyufpd-x7lASSgFdKeUJc=)\n\nApollomics Inc. is an innovative clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of oncology therapies with the potential to be combined with other treatment options to harness the immune system and target specific molecular pathways to inhibit cancer.
