(NASDAQ: RUSHA & RUSHB), which operates the largest network of commercial vehicle dealerships in North America, today announced that for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company achieved revenues of $1.896 billion and net income of $79.1 million, or $0.97 per diluted share, compared with revenues of $1.981 billion and net income of $80.3 million, or $0.96 per diluted share, in the quarter ended September 30, 2023. In the third quarter of 2024, the Company recognized a one-time, pre-tax charge of approximately $3.3 million, or $0.03 per share, related to property damage caused by Hurricane Helene. In the third quarter of 2023, the Company recognized a one-time, pre-tax charge of approximately $2.5 million, or $0.02 per share, related to a fire loss at our San Antonio, Texas facility. Additionally, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.18 per share of Class A and Class B Common Stock, to be paid on December 12, 2024, to all shareholders of record as of November 12, 2024.\n\n“As we have experienced for the last several quarters, the industry continues to struggle with low freight rates and high interest rates, resulting in continued weak demand for Class 8 trucks. Considering these ongoing challenges, we are pleased with our overall financial performance in the third quarter,” said W.M. “Rusty” Rush, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President of Rush Enterprises. “Although sluggish industry conditions continue to negatively impact over-the-road-carriers, we saw positive results in the quarter with respect to our Class 8 vocational and public sector customers. In addition, demand from our medium-duty customers remained healthy throughout the quarter, enabling us to outperform the market. While the used truck market remains difficult, our used truck operations are executing well, managing inventory levels to market conditions while also making strong contributions to our earnings,” he continued. “In the aftermarket, we saw a slight improvement in our revenue compared to our second quarter results, particularly with respect to our service sales, which outperformed the market,” Rush said.\n\n“Looking toward the remainder of the year and the beginning of 2025, although we believe freight rates have found their bottom, we do not anticipate any significant recovery in new Class 8 truck sales until sometime later in 2025. We will continue to rely on the talents of our professional sales force to uncover opportunities to leverage our “One Team” sales approach and fight for market share growth. Despite the tough industry conditions, we expect that our Class 8 and Class 4-7 new commercial vehicle sales will improve in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter,” explained Rush. “Although we expect a typical seasonal decline in our fourth quarter aftermarket results, we believe market conditions will begin to slowly improve during the first quarter of 2025,” he continued.\n\n“It is important that I express my gratitude to our employees for their hard work this quarter. I am especially grateful for their ability to remain focused on our long-term goals despite challenging market conditions, while also continuing to provide best-in-class service to our customers. Additionally, I would be remiss if I did not say a special word of thanks to Michael McRoberts, who as previously announced, is stepping down from his role as Chief Operating Officer, effective October 31. Mike has added immeasurable value to this organization over his many years of service, and I am sure he will continue to do so in his role as Senior Advisor to the Company and as an active member of our Board of Directors. Effective November 1, Jason Wilder will become the Company’s Chief Operating Officer, as previously announced. I am confident that this leadership transition will be seamless and that Jason will effectively lead the Company in his new role going forward,” said Rush.\n\n**Operations**\n\n**Aftermarket Products and Services**\n\nAftermarket products and services accounted for approximately 61.5% of the Company’s total gross profit in the third quarter of 2024, with parts, service and collision center revenues totaling $633.0 million, down 1.6% compared to the third quarter of 2023. The Company achieved a quarterly absorption ratio of 132.6% in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 132.8% in the third quarter of 2023. \n\n“Our aftermarket revenue was down slightly year-over-year, but as I previously noted, was up compared to our second quarter results,” said Rush. “Although the freight recession continues, we saw sequential growth in the third quarter with respect to our over-the-road and wholesale customers for the first time since 2023. In addition, the refuse and public sector market segments continue to be bright spots with respect to Class 8 aftermarket sales, while medium-duty aftermarket sales continue to be strong across all market segments,” he continued.\n\n“We are hopeful that declines in aftermarket sales revenues are behind us and that demand will begin to increase in 2025. Although we expect a typical seasonal decline in our fourth quarter aftermarket results, we believe we will begin a slow climb back to more normal market conditions starting in the first quarter of 2025,“ Rush explained. “We believe that our continued focus on strategic initiatives, such as planned maintenance packages and Xpress Services, will allow us to continue to outperform the market,” he added.\n\n**Commercial Vehicle Sales**\n\nNew U.S. and Canadian Class 8 retail truck sales totaled 73,037 units in the third quarter of 2024, down 3.5% over the same period last year, according to ACT Research. The Company sold 3,604 new Class 8 trucks in the third quarter, a decrease of 16.7% compared to the third quarter of 2023, which accounted for 5.3% of the new U.S. Class 8 truck market and 1.6% of the new Canada Class 8 truck market. ACT Research forecasts U.S. and Canadian retail sales of new Class 8 trucks to total 264,000 units in 2024, a 12.5% decrease compared to 2023.\n\n“Economic uncertainty and continued low freight rates continue to plague Class 8 carriers. However, considering these ongoing challenges, we were pleased with our sales results in the third quarter,” Rush said. “Although Class 8 demand remains weak in the over-the-road segment, our unique focus on specialty markets, including vocational and public sector, allowed us to achieve strong sales results to those customer segments, which we expect to continue in the fourth quarter,” he added.\n\n“Our order intake improved slightly late in the third quarter. Consequently, we expect our new Class 8 truck sales to increase slightly in the fourth quarter compared to our third quarter results,” Rush said. “While we are pleased to see a slight uptick in demand, market conditions remain challenging and commercial vehicle inventory levels are near an all-time high industry-wide. Because of these factors, we believe that truck pricing will continue to be competitive and that new Class 8 truck sales will remain challenging through the first half of 2025,” he added.\n\nNew U.S. and Canadian Class 4 through 7 retail commercial vehicle sales totaled 68,923 units in the third quarter of 2024, down 1.1% over the same period last year, according to ACT Research. The Company sold 3,379 Class 4 through 7 medium-duty commercial vehicles in the third quarter, an increase of 4.2% compared to the third quarter of 2023, which accounted for 5.0% of the total new U.S. Class 4 through 7 commercial vehicle market and 2.9% of the new Canada Class 5 through 7 commercial vehicle market. ACT Research forecasts U.S. and Canadian retail sales for new Class 4 through 7 commercial vehicles to be approximately 273,200 units in 2024, a 2.5% increase compared to 2023.\n\n“We continued to experience healthy demand from medium-duty customers across all of our customer segments in the third quarter. Production has stabilized, delivery lead times continue to improve, and we are, once again, proud to have outperformed the market in medium-duty commercial vehicle sales,” Rush said. Our strategic focus on achieving a diversified customer base has served us well in the medium-duty market, and we are pleased that our Class 4-7 commercial vehicle sales were wide-ranging across a variety of industry segments,” he stated.\n\n“Looking ahead, we continue to monitor potential delays from body manufacturers that could impact deliveries of new Class 4 through 7 commercial vehicles. However, we believe that demand for medium duty commercial vehicles will remain solid in the fourth quarter, and we believe we are well-positioned to increase our market share,” Rush said.\n\nThe company sold 1,829 used commercial vehicles in the third quarter of 2024, a 1.8% increase compared to the third quarter of 2023. “Although the market is still experiencing weak used truck demand due to the aforementioned freight recession, tight credit and excess supply, we continue to successfully execute on our used truck sales strategies, which led to positive results in the third quarter. Used truck depreciation rates have largely returned to normal ranges, and we continue to manage our inventory levels, which we believe are appropriate given the anticipated increase in trade activity from our new truck customers,” Rush stated.\n\n**Leasing and Rental**\n\nRush Truck Leasing operates 56 PacLease and Idealease franchises across the United States and Canada, with more than 10,000 trucks in its lease and rental fleet and more than 2,200 trucks under contract maintenance agreements. Lease and rental revenue decreased 0.4% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to a slight decrease in rental utilization. “Our leasing and rental revenues were basically flat year-over-year. However, we continue to add new vehicles to our fleet, which will translate to lower operating costs going forward. We anticipate that rental utilization rates will improve in the fourth quarter, and we expect to see moderate growth in our leasing and rental revenues as we move into 2025”, Rush said.\n\n**_Financial Highlights_**\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, the Company’s gross revenues totaled $1.896 billion, a 4.3% decrease from $1.981 billion in the third quarter of 2023. Net income for the quarter was $79.1 million, or $0.97 per diluted share, compared to net income of $80.3 million, or $0.96 per diluted share, in the quarter ended September 30, 2023. In the third quarter of 2024, the Company recognized a one-time, pre-tax charge of approximately $3.3 million, or $0.03 per share, related to property damage caused by Hurricane Helene. In the third quarter of 2023, the Company recognized a one-time, pre-tax charge of approximately $2.5 million, or $0.02 per share, related to a fire loss at our San Antonio, Texas facility.\n\nAftermarket products and services revenues were $633.0 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $643.6 million in the third quarter of 2023. The Company delivered 3,604 new heavy-duty trucks, 3,379 new medium-duty commercial vehicles, 574 new light-duty commercial vehicles and 1,829 used commercial vehicles during the third quarter of 2024, compared to 4,326 new heavy-duty trucks, 3,244 new medium-duty commercial vehicles, 425 new light-duty commercial vehicles and 1,797 used commercial vehicles during the third quarter of 2023.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company repurchased $0.2 million of its common stock pursuant to its stock repurchase plan and has repurchased a total of $77.4 million of the $150.0 million that is currently authorized by its Board of Directors. In addition, the Company paid a cash dividend of $14.2 million during the third quarter.\n\n“There is no doubt that 2024 has been a challenging year for the commercial vehicle industry. However, I am extremely proud that our team has rallied behind our expense management and sales initiatives, which have allowed us to navigate this challenging operating environment while continuing to deliver value to our shareholders. We are committed to our long-term strategic initiatives, and I have confidence we will end this difficult year in a strong financial position,” said Rush.\n\n**_Conference Call Information_**\n\nRush Enterprises will host its quarterly conference call to discuss earnings for the third quarter of 2024 on **Wednesday, October 30, 2024, at 10 a.m. Eastern/9 a.m. Central**.

When 100% absorption is achieved, then gross profit from the sale of a commercial vehicle, after sales commissions and inventory carrying costs, directly impacts operating profit.\n\n**Debt Analysis**(in thousands)| **September 30, 2024**| **September 30, 2023**  \n---|---|---  \nFloor plan notes payable| $| 1,285,033| $| 1,121,490  \nCurrent maturities of long-term debt| ─| 104,778  \nCurrent maturities of finance lease obligations| 38,693| 36,128  \nLong-term debt, net of current maturities| 399,674| 202,824  \nFinance lease obligations, net of current maturities| 92,061| 103,513  \n**Total Debt (GAAP)**|  1,815,461| 1,568,733  \nAdjustments:  \nDebt related to lease & rental fleet| (526,443| )| (443,095| )  \nFloor plan notes payable| (1,285,033| )| (1,121,490| )  \n**Adjusted Total Debt (Non-GAAP)**|  3,985| 4,148  \nAdjustment:  \nCash and cash equivalents| (185,073| )| (191,988| )  \n**Adjusted Net Debt (Cash) (Non-GAAP)**|  $| (181,088| )| $| (187,840| )  \n  \nManagement uses “Adjusted Total Debt” to reflect the Company’s estimated financial obligations less debt related to lease and rental fleet (L&RFD) and floor plan notes payable (FPNP), and “Adjusted Net (Cash) Debt” to present the amount of Adjusted Total Debt net of cash and cash equivalents on the Company’s balance sheet. The FPNP is used to finance the Company’s new and used inventory, with its principal balance changing daily as vehicles are purchased and sold and the sale proceeds are used to repay the notes. Consequently, in managing the business, management views the FPNP as interest bearing accounts payable, representing the cost of acquiring the vehicle that is then repaid when the vehicle is sold, as the Company’s floor plan credit agreements require it to repay loans used to purchase vehicles when such vehicles are sold. The Company has the capacity to finance all of its lease and rental fleet under its lines of credit established for this purpose, but may choose to only partially finance the lease and rental fleet depending on business conditions and its management of cash and interest expense. The Company’s lease and rental fleet inventory are either: (i) leased to customers under long-term lease arrangements; or (ii) to a lesser extent, dedicated to the Company’s rental business. In both cases, the lease and rental payments received fully cover the capital costs of the lease and rental fleet (i.e., the interest expense on the borrowings used to acquire the vehicles and the depreciation expense associated with the vehicles), plus a profit margin for the Company. The Company believes excluding the FPNP and L&RFD from the Company’s total debt for this purpose provides management with supplemental information regarding the Company’s capital structure and leverage profile and assists investors in performing analysis that is consistent with financial models developed by Company management and research analysts. “Adjusted Total Debt” and “Adjusted Net (Cash) Debt” are both non-GAAP financial measures and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the Company’s debt obligations, as reported in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Additionally, these non-GAAP measures may vary among companies and may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\n\n**Twelve Months Ended**  \n---  \n**EBITDA**(in thousands)| **September 30, 2024**| **September 30, 2023**  \n**Net Income attributable to Rush Enterprises, Inc.

Free Cash Flow is calculated by subtracting the acquisition of property and equipment included in the _Cash flows from investing activities_ from _Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities_. For purposes of deriving Adjusted Free Cash Flow from the Company’s operating cash flow, Company management makes the following adjustments: (i) adds back draws (or subtracts payments) on the floor plan financing that are included in _Cash flows from financing activities_ , as their purpose is to finance the vehicle inventory that is included in _Cash flows from operating activities_ ; (ii) adds back lease and rental fleet purchases that are included in acquisition of property and equipment (iii) adds back non-maintenance capital expenditures that are for growth and expansion (i.e. building of new dealership facilities) that are not considered necessary to maintain the current level of cash generated by the business. “Free Cash Flow” and “Adjusted Free Cash Flow” are both presented so that investors have the same financial data that management uses in evaluating the Company’s cash flows from operating activities. “Free Cash Flow” and “Adjusted Free Cash Flow” are both non-GAAP financial measures and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, net cash provided by (used in) operations of the Company, as reported in the Company’s consolidated statement of cash flows in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

(NASDAQ: RUSHA and RUSHB), which operates the largest network of commercial vehicle dealerships in North America, today announced the winner of their sweepstakes to give away the last and only 2025 Peterbilt Model 389X ever produced, with proceeds benefitting Wounded Warrior Project® (WWP).\n\nThe sweepstakes, sponsored by Rush Truck Centers, in conjunction with the Rush Enterprises Foundation, launched in March at the Mid-America Trucking Show in Louisville, Kentucky. To enter, individuals were encouraged to make a $50 donation that was given to WWP™ at the end of the sweepstakes. The sweepstakes ended on September 15 and the winner was announced during the American Trucking Associations’ Management Conference and Exhibition (MCE) in Nashville, Tennessee on October 14.\n\nJennifer Best of Pryor, Oklahoma was the lucky winner. Ms. Best and her husband, Shane Best, operate Shane Best Trucking, a small fleet specializing in hauling rock, soil and aggregate materials in and around the Tulsa area. “Trucking runs in our family. We took over the business from Shane’s mother, my dad was a truck driver, and both of our boys are in the business,” said Best. “When I got the call that we’d won, I was in shock. We were happy to support Wounded Warrior Project but to win this incredible truck is unbelievable,” she continued.\n\n“This is a unique and very special truck, and we knew we could do a lot of good for a lot of people with it,” said W.M. “Rusty” Rush, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President of Rush Enterprises. Inc. “We are immensely proud that this sweepstakes generated $500,000 for Wounded Warrior Project and the life-changing programs and services they provide at no cost to America’s injured veterans,” said Rush.\n\n“The effects of war and military service can last a lifetime for wounded veterans, their families, and caregivers,” said Brea Kratzert Todd, WWP vice president of business development. “Supporters like Rush Enterprises and the Best family fuel the life-changing programs and services that Wounded Warrior Project delivers to warriors and their loved ones. Our nation’s heroes deserve our support for as long as they need it, and we can ensure they never feel alone thanks to inspiring partnerships like this one with Rush Enterprises.”\n\nRush Truck Centers secured the build slot for the final Model 389 with a winning bid of $1.5 million in an auction hosted by Peterbilt and attended by its dealer body during the 2023 Peterbilt Dealer Meeting. Peterbilt and Rush Truck Centers donated the full amount of the winning bid to two additional charitable organizations – Truckers Against Trafficking and Wreaths Across America, at the Mid-America Trucking Show event. The Last Peterbilt Model 389 sweepstakes generated $500,000 that was presented to Wounded Warrior Project during the event in Nashville. In total, Rush Truck Centers and Peterbilt Motors Company donated $2,000,000 to three deserving organizations through the dealer auction and subsequent sweepstakes contest.\n\n“The Peterbilt Model 389 is a testament to the rich heritage and tradition of iconic Peterbilt trucks working today on jobsites and highways across North America,” said Jason Skoog, General Manager of Peterbilt Motors Company. “Peterbilt ended its production run of this truck at the end of 2023 and today we are honored to recognize Ms. Best as the winner of the last Model 389, a milestone in Peterbilt’s history,” he added.\n\nMs. Best was presented with the keys to the last Peterbilt Model 389X at the ATA MCE event. The truck will be delivered to Rush Truck Centers in Tulsa where the Bests will take possession later this month.\n\n*No donation was required to enter or win.\n\n**About Rush Enterprises, Inc.** Rush Enterprises, Inc. is the premier solutions provider to the commercial vehicle industry.
