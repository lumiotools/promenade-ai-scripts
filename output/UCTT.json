(Nasdaq: UCTT), today reported its financial results for the third quarter ended September 27, 2024.\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/Ultra Clean Holdings, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/582701/Ultra_Clean_Holdings_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/582701/Ultra_Clean_Holdings_Logo.html)\n\n\"UCT's third quarter results came in above expectations driven by broader equipment demand for AI infrastructure build out and sustained domestic China market spending,\" said Jim Scholhamer, CEO. \"The rationale for significant long-term investment in WFE remains strong. UCT's vertical integration capabilities and strategic manufacturing network provide a competitive edge, and should enable us to increase share as demand expands.\"\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 GAAP Financial Results** Total revenue was $540.4 million. Products contributed $479.0 million and Services added $61.4 million. Total gross margin was 17.3%, operating margin was 4.7%, and net loss was $(2.3) million or $(0.05) per diluted share. This compares to total revenue of $516.1 million, gross margin of 17.1%, operating margin of 4.4%, and net income of $19.1 million or $0.42 per diluted share, in the prior quarter.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Non-GAAP Financial Results** On a non-GAAP basis, gross margin was 17.8%, operating margin was 7.3%, and net income was $15.9 million or $0.35 per diluted share. This compares to gross margin of 17.7%, operating margin of 6.9%, and net income of $14.4 million or $0.32 per diluted share in the prior quarter.\n\n**Fourth Quarter 2024 Outlook** The Company expects revenue in the range of $535 million to $585 million. The Company expects GAAP diluted net income per share to be between $0.06 and $0.26 and non-GAAP diluted net income per share to be between $0.34 and $0.54.\n\n**Conference Call** The conference call and webcast will take place on Monday, October 28, 2024 at 1:45 p.m. PT and can be accessed by dialing 1-800-836-8184 or 1-646-357-8785. No passcode is required. A replay of the call will be available by dialing 1-888-660-6345 or 1-646-517-4150 and entering the confirmation code 34185#.

We believe the presentation of non-GAAP results is useful to investors for analyzing our core business and business trends and comparing performance to prior periods, along with enhancing investors' ability to view the Company's results from management's perspective. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Tables presenting reconciliations from GAAP results to non-GAAP results are included at the end of this press release.\n\nThe Company defines non-GAAP net income as net income (loss) before amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, acquisition activity costs, fair value adjustments, debt refinancing costs, legal-related costs and the tax effects of the foregoing adjustments.\n\nA reconciliation of our guidance for non-GAAP net income per diluted share for the subsequent quarter is not available due to fluctuations in the geographic mix of our earnings from quarter to quarter, which impacts our tax rate and cannot be reasonably predicted or determined. As a result, such reconciliation is not available without unreasonable efforts and we are unable to determine the probable significance of the unavailable information.\n\n**Safe Harbor Statement** The foregoing information contains, or may be deemed to contain, \"forward-looking statements\" (as defined in the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) which reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. We use words such as \"anticipates,\" \"projection,\" \"outlook,\" \"forecast,\" \"believes,\" \"plan,\" \"expect,\" \"future,\" \"intends,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"estimates,\" \"see,\" \"predicts,\" \"should\" and similar expressions to identify these forward-looking statements. Forward looking statements included in this press release include our expectations about the semiconductor capital equipment market and outlook. All forward-looking statements address matters that involve risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, the Company's actual results may differ materially from the results predicted or implied by these forward-looking statements. These risks, uncertainties and other factors also include, among others, those identified in \"Risk Factors,\" \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations'' and elsewhere in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 29, 2023, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Ultra Clean Holdings, Inc. undertakes no obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise unless required by law.\n\n**Contact:** Rhonda BennettoSVP Investor Relations _rbennetto@uct.com_\n\n**ULTRA CLEAN HOLDINGS, INC.**  \n---  \n**CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS**

ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nOrganization — Ultra Clean Holdings, Inc., (the “Company” or “UCT”) a Delaware corporation, was founded in November 2002 and became a publicly traded\ncompany on the NASDAQ Global Market in March 2004. The Company is a leading developer and supplier of critical subsystems, components, parts, and\nultra-high purity cleaning and analytical services, primarily for the semiconductor industry. UCT offers its customers an integrated outsourced solution for\nmajor subassemblies, improved design-to-delivery cycle times, design for manufacturability, prototyping and part and component manufacturing, as well as\ntool chamber parts cleaning and coating, and micro-contamination analytical services. The Company’s Products business primarily designs, engineers and\nmanufactures production tools, components and parts, and modules and subsystems for the semiconductor and display capital equipment markets. Products\ninclude chemical delivery modules, frame assemblies, gas delivery systems, fluid delivery systems, precision robotics, process modules, sub-fab process\nequipment support racks, as well as other high-level assemblies. The Company’s Services business provides ultra-high purity parts cleaning, process tool part\nrecoating, surface encapsulation and high sensitivity micro contamination analysis primarily for the semiconductor device makers and wafer fabrication\nequipment markets.\nBasis of Presentation — The unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q include the accounts of\nthe Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). This\nfinancial information reflects all adjustments which are, in the opinion of the Company, normal, recurring and necessary for a fair statement of the results of\noperations, financial position, and cash flows for the interim periods presented. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in our annual\nfinancial statements, prepared in accordance with GAAP, have been condensed or omitted from the interim financial statements in this Quarterly Report on\nForm 10-Q. Therefore, these unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the\nCompany's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 29, 2023.\nFiscal Year — The Company uses a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the Friday nearest December 31. All references to quarters refer to fiscal quarters and all\nreferences to years refer to fiscal years.\nPrinciples of Consolidation — The Company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned\nsubsidiaries and all intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.\nSignificant Accounting Policies — There were no changes to the accounting policies disclosed in Note 1, Organization and Significant Accounting Polices of\nthe Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 29, 2023 that had a material impact on the Company's condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements and related notes.\nImpairment Testing of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill — In the second quarter of 2024, the Company conducted an interim impairment test of its long-lived\nassets and goodwill associated with its HIS Innovations Group (“HIS”) reporting unit due to the presence of an indicator of potential impairment. This indicator\nincluded lower-than-expected financial performance.\nThe Company reviewed the HIS asset group’s long-lived assets for impairment by comparing the carrying value to the estimated undiscounted future cash\nflows expected to be generated by the assets. Based on this assessment, the Company determined that the estimated undiscounted future cash flows exceeded\nthe carrying values of the long-lived assets. Consequently, no impairment loss was recognized in the period.\nThe Company performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill for the HIS reporting unit using the income approach. The income approach involves\nestimating the future cash flows attributable and discounting these cash flows to their present value using an appropriate discount rate. The fair value of the\nreporting unit was then compared to its carrying amount, including goodwill. The results of this quantitative assessment indicated that the fair value of the\nreporting unit exceeded its carrying amount. As a result, the Company concluded that no impairment of goodwill was necessary.\nAccounting Standards Recently Adopted\nThe Company has not adopted any new accounting standards during the nine months ended September 27, 2024 that have a material impact on the Company’s\ncondensed consolidated financial statements.\n- 10 -\nIndex to Notes\nAccounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\nIn November 2023, FASB issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment\nDisclosures, which requires a public entity to disclose significant segment expenses and other segment items on an annual and interim basis and provide in\ninterim periods all disclosures about a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets that are currently required annually. The ASU does not change how a\npublic entity identifies its operating segments, aggregates them, or applies the quantitative thresholds to determine its reportable segments. The Company is\nrequired to adopt this standard in the fiscal year 2024 for the annual reporting ending December 27, 2024, with retrospective disclosure of prior periods\npresented. The Company expects this ASU to only impact its disclosures with no impact to its results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which amends the guidance in\nASC 740, Income Taxes. ASU No. 2023-09 is intended to improve the transparency of income tax disclosures by requiring (1) consistent categories and greater\ndisaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and (2) income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. It also includes certain other amendments to\nimprove the effectiveness of income tax disclosures. The Company is required to adopt this standard prospectively in fiscal year 2025 for the annual reporting\nperiod ending December 26, 2025. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this new guidance on its consolidated financial\nstatements and related disclosures.\n2. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS\nOn October 25, 2023, the Company acquired 100% of the shares of HIS, a privately held company based in Hillsboro, Oregon. HIS is a leading supplier to the\nsemiconductor sub-fab segment including the design, manufacturing, and integration of components, process solutions, and fully integrated sub-systems. The\nacquisition strengthens the Company's leadership in developing and supplying critical products to the semiconductor industry, and extends our reach into the\nsub-fab area.\nThe purchase price of HIS for purposes of the Company’s purchase price allocation was determined to be $73.6 million, which includes initial cash\nconsideration of $46.5 million and the fair value of potential earn-out payments of approximately $27.1 million. These potential earn-out payments represent\nup to $70.0 million of cash consideration that may be payable based on the financial performance of the acquired business during the fiscal years 2023, 2024,\nand 2025. The fair value of the potential earn-out payments was determined utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation model.\nThe Company has assigned the purchase price of HIS to the tangible assets, liabilities and identifiable intangible assets acquired, based on their estimated fair\nvalues. The excess of purchase price over the aggregate fair value was recorded as goodwill. Goodwill associated with the acquisition is primarily attributable\nto the future technology, market presence and knowledgeable and experienced workforce. The fair value assigned to identifiable intangible assets acquired was\ndetermined using the income approach taking into account the Company’s consideration of a number of inputs, including a third-party analysis that was based\nupon estimates and assumptions provided by the Company. These estimates and assumptions were determined through established and generally accepted\nvaluation techniques and with the assistance of a valuation specialist.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, the Company completed the acquisition accounting and the valuation of the fair value of the assets acquired and\nthe liabilities assumed.\nThe following table summarizes the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition, including all measurement period\nadjustments:\n- 11 -\nIndex to Notes\n(In millions) Amount\nCash and cash equivalents $ 0.4\nAccounts receivable 5.6\nInventories 11.4\nPrepaid expenses and other assets 2.7\nProperty, plant and equipment 9.3\nPurchased intangible assets 51.6\nOperating lease right-of-use assets 7.5\nAccounts payable (8.1)\nAccrued compensation and related benefits (0.7)\nOther current liabilities (0.9)\nDeferred tax liabilities (12.1)\nOperating lease liabilities (9.6)\nTotal identifiable net assets $ 57.1\nGoodwill $ 16.5\nThe following table summarizes the intangible assets acquired and the useful lives of these assets:\nPurchased\nUseful Intangible\nLife Assets\n(In years) (In millions)\nCustomer relationships 7 $ 35.2\nIP knowhow 5 11.2\nDeveloped technology 5 4.6\nBacklog 1 0.6\nTotal purchased intangible assets $ 51.6\nThe results of operations for HIS have been included in the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements since the date of the acquisition. In\naddition, acquisition-related costs of $0.6 million and $1.0 million were included in the results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 27,\n2024, respectively. Acquisition-related costs for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2023 were immaterial. Acquisition costs are included in\ngeneral and administrative expenses in the Company’s condensed consolidated results of operations.\n3.

Refer to Note 1,\n“Organization and Significant Accounting Policies” for additional information regarding impairment testing of long-lived assets.\n4. FAIR VALUE\nThe fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.\nThe following table summarizes, for assets or liabilities measured at fair value, the respective fair value and the classification by level of input within the fair\nvalue hierarchy:\nFair Value Measurement at\nReporting Date Using\nQuoted Prices in Significant Significant\nActive Markets for Other Observable Unobservable\nIdentical Assets Inputs Inputs\nDescription September 27, 2024 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\n(In millions)\nOther non-current assets:\nPlan assets $ 0.5 $ — $ — $ 0.5\nOther current liabilities:\nForward contracts $ 0.5 $ — $ 0.5 $ —\nOther liabilities:\nPension obligation $ 1.6 $ — $ — $ 1.6\nContingent earn-out $ 7.1 $ — $ — $ 7.1\nFair Value Measurement at\nReporting Date Using\nQuoted Prices in Significant Significant\nActive Markets for Other Observable Unobservable\nIdentical Assets Inputs Inputs\nDescription December 29, 2023 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\n(In millions)\nOther non-current assets:\nPlan assets $ 1.3 $ — $ — $ 1.3\nOther current liabilities:\nForward contracts $ 0.1 $ — $ 0.1 $ —\nOther liabilities:\nPension obligation $ 1.6 $ — $ — $ 1.6\nContingent earn-out $ 29.1 $ — $ — $ 29.1\n- 13 -\nIndex to Notes\nThe estimated fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is based upon quoted market prices obtained from independent pricing services for similar\nderivative contracts and these financial instruments are characterized as Level 2 assets in the fair value hierarchy.\nThe estimated fair value of pension obligation is based on expected years of service and average compensation. The valuation model used to value pension\nobligation utilizes mortality rate, inflation, interest rate risks and changes in the life expectancy for pensioners. These assumptions are routinely made in the\nappraisal process by the independent actuary resulting in a Level 3 classification. As of September 27, 2024, the Company's aggregate pension benefit\nobligations was $12.3 million and the fair value of the pension plan assets was $11.2 million. The underfunded pension benefit obligations was $1.1 million as\nof September 27, 2024. The Company recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit pension plans, measured as the difference between\nthe fair value of the plan assets and the benefit obligation. Each overfunded plan is recognized as an asset and each underfunded plan is recognized as a\nliability.\nThe Company measures its contingent earn-out liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The significant unobservable\ninputs used in the model include the forecasted operating profit of the acquired business during each of calendar years 2024 and 2025. Significant increases or\ndecreases to the forecasted results would result in a significantly higher or lower liability, with a higher liability capped by the contractual maximum of the\ncontingent earn-out obligation. Ultimately, the liability will be equivalent to the amount paid, and the difference between the fair value estimate and amount\npaid will be recorded in earnings. The amount paid that is less than or equal to the contingent earn-out liability on the acquisition date is reflected as cash used\nin financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Any amount paid in excess of the contingent earn-out liability on the acquisition date will\nbe reflected as cash used in operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. For the three and nine months ended September 27, 2024, the\nCompany recorded $(0.8) million of loss and $22.0 million of gain, respectively from change in the fair value of contingent earn-out related to the acquisition\nof HIS. This gain (loss) from change in the fair value was recognized as other income (expense), net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThere were no transfers from Level 1 or Level 2. Fair value adjustments were noncash, and therefore did not impact the Company’s liquidity or capital\nresources.\n5. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nGoodwill\nThe Company’s methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to an acquisition is determined through established and generally accepted valuation\ntechniques. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the consideration transferred over the sum of the amounts assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible\nassets acquired less liabilities assumed.\nTo test goodwill for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a\nreporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying\namount, the Company does not proceed to perform a quantitative impairment test. If the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the\nreporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative goodwill impairment test will be performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its\ncarrying value. A quantitative impairment analysis, if necessary, considers the income approach, which requires estimates of the present value of expected\nfuture cash flows to determine a reporting unit’s fair value. Significant estimates include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate\nprojected future cash flows, discount rates, and future economic and market conditions. A goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which\nthe reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value. Any loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nThe process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets requires significant judgment. The Company regularly monitors current\nbusiness conditions and other factors including, but not limited to, adverse industry or economic trends and lower projections of profitability that may impact\nfuture operating results.\n- 14 -\nIndex to Notes\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 27, 2024, there were no changes to the Company's reporting units, and the Company did not recognize any\nimpairment charges or additions to goodwill. Refer to Note 1, “Organization and Significant Accounting Policies” for additional information regarding\nimpairment testing of goodwill.\nDetails of aggregate goodwill of the Company are as follows:\n(In millions) Products Services Total\nBalance at September 27, 2024 $ 191.8 $ 73.5 $ 265.3\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition. The Company evaluates the useful lives of its intangible assets each\nreporting period to determine whether events and circumstances require revising the remaining period of amortization. In addition, the Company reviews finite-\nlived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable and evaluates\nindefinite-lived intangible asset for impairment annually, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist. Management considers such indicators\nas significant differences in product demand from the estimates, changes in the competitive and economic environment, technological advances, and changes in\ncost structure. Refer to Note 1, “Organization and Significant Accounting Policies” for additional information regarding impairment testing of intangible assets.\nDetails of intangible assets were as follows:\nAs of September 27, 2024 As of December 29, 2023\nGross Gross\nUseful Life Accumulated Carrying Accumulated Carrying\nCarrying Carrying\n(In years) Amortization Value Amortization Value\n(Dollars in millions) Amount Amount\nCustomer relationships 6 - 10 $ 207.2 $ (112.4) $ 94.8 $ 207.2 $ (97.5) $ 109.7\nRecipes 20 73.2 (22.4) 50.8 73.2 (19.5) 53.7\nIntellectual property/know-how 7 - 15 48.9 (21.7) 27.2 48.9 (18.4) 30.5\nTradename 4 - 6* 32.5 (22.7) 9.8 32.5 (22.1) 10.4\nStandard operating procedures 20 8.6 (2.6) 6.0 8.6 (2.3) 6.3\nDeveloped technology 5 4.6 (0.8) 3.8 4.6 (0.2) 4.4\nBacklog 1 0.6 (0.6) — 0.6 (0.3) 0.3\nTotal $ 375.6 $ (183.2) $ 192.4 $ 375.6 $ (160.3) $ 215.3\n* The Company concluded that the asset life of UCT tradename of $9.0 million is indefinite and is therefore not amortized but is reviewed for impairment at\nleast annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.\nThe Company amortizes its intangible assets on a straight-line or accelerated basis over the estimated economic life of the assets. Amortization expense was\napproximately $7.6 million and $22.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 27, 2024, respectively, and $5.5 million and $16.9 million for the\nthree and nine months ended September 29, 2023, respectively. Amortization expense related to recipes, standard operating procedures, developed technology\nand certain intellectual property/know-how is charged to cost of revenues and the remainder is charged to general and administrative expense. As of\nSeptember 27, 2024, future estimated amortization expense is expected to be as follows:\nAmortization\n(In millions) Expense\n2024 (remaining in year) $ 7.5\n2025 28.1\n2026 27.2\n2027 26.9\n2028 23.8\nThereafter 69.9\nTotal $ 183.4\n- 15 -\nIndex to Notes\n6. BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS\nOn April 4, 2024, the Company entered into a Sixth Amendment (the “Sixth Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement dated as of August 27, 2018 (as amended\nas of October 1, 2018, March 31, 2021, August 19, 2022, June 29, 2023 and July 27, 2023 (the “Existing Credit Agreement”), and the Existing Credit\nAgreement as further amended by the Sixth Amendment, the “Credit Agreement”). Pursuant to the Sixth Amendment, the Existing Credit Agreement was\namended to, among other things, (i) extend the final maturity date of the term loan and revolving credit facilities under the Credit Agreement by 30 months; (ii)\nreduce the interest rate applicable to the term loan facility under the Credit Agreement by 0.25% per annum; and (iii) increase the outstanding amount under the\nTerm Loan of $475.4 million to $500 million.\nThe Sixth Amendment resulted in the receipts of an additional $67.7 million of debt, net of $1.1 million related lender fees from new or existing syndicate\nlenders which was offset by syndicate lenders who reduced their positions by $44.2 million. The Company capitalized additional $2.5 million of costs related\nto this amendment and continued to defer previously capitalized costs of $5.2 million. The Company expensed the third party transaction costs and the\npreviously capitalized costs of extinguished debt of $3.6 million which was included in the other income (expense), net in the Condensed Consolidated\nStatements of Operations for the three and nine month period ended September 27, 2024.\nThe Company pays monthly interest payments in arrears and quarterly principal payments of 0.625% of the outstanding principal balance since April 4, 2024,\nwith the remaining principal paid upon maturity.\nThe revolving credit facility has an available commitment of $150.0 million and a maturity date of August 27, 2027. The Company pays a quarterly\ncommitment fee in arrears equal to 0.25% of the average daily available commitment outstanding. Outstanding letters of credit reduce the availability of the\nrevolving credit facility and, as of September 27, 2024, the Company had $146.0 million, net of $4.0 million of outstanding letters of credit, available under\nthis revolving credit facility.\nThe letter of credit facility has an available commitment of $50.0 million and a maturity date of August 27, 2027. The Company pays a quarterly fee in arrears\nequal to 2.5% (subject to certain adjustments to the Term Loan) of the dollar equivalent of all outstanding letters of credit, and a fronting fee equal to 0.125% of\nthe undrawn and unexpired amount of each letter of credit. As of September 27, 2024, the Company had $4.0 million of outstanding letters of credit and $46.0\nmillion of available commitments remaining under the letter of credit facility.\nOn June 29, 2023, the Company entered into a Fourth Amendment (the “Fourth Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement to replace the LIBOR-based reference\ninterest rate option with a reference interest option based upon Term SOFR under the Credit Agreement.\nUnder the Credit Agreement, the Company may elect that the Term Loan bear interest at a rate per annum equal to either (a) “ABR” (as defined in the Credit\nAgreement), plus the applicable margin or (b) the “Eurodollar Rate” (as defined in the Credit Agreement), based on SOFR, plus the applicable margin. The\napplicable margin for the Term Loan is equal to a rate per annum to either (i) at any time that the Company’s corporate family rating is Ba3 (with a stable\noutlook) or higher from Moody’s and BB- (with a stable outlook) or higher from S&P, (x) 3.25% for such Eurodollar term loans and (y) 2.25% for such ABR\nterm loans or (ii) at all other times, (x) 3.50% for such Eurodollar term loans and (y) 2.50% for such ABR term loans. Interest on the Term Loan is payable on\n(1) in the case of such ABR term loans, the last day of each calendar quarter and (2) in the case of such Eurodollar term loans, the last day of each relevant\ninterest period and, in the case of any interest period longer than three months, on each successive date three months after the first day of such interest period.\nAt September 27, 2024, the Company had an outstanding amount under the Term Loan of $493.8 million, gross of unamortized debt issuance costs of $7.7\nmillion. As of September 27, 2024, the interest rate on the outstanding Term Loan was 8.9%.\nThe Credit Agreement requires the Company to maintain certain financial covenants including a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and a consolidated\nleverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) as of the last day of any fiscal quarter. The Company currently has no revolving loans outstanding under the\nCredit Agreement. As of September 27, 2024, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants contained within the Credit Agreement.\nThe Company has a credit agreement with a local bank in the Czech Republic that provides for a revolving credit facility in the aggregate of up to 7.0 million\neuros (approximately $7.8 million). As of September 27, 2024, no debt was outstanding under this revolving credit facility.\nFluid Solutions has credit facilities with various financial institutions in Israel that provides borrowing up to $11.0 million. As of September 27, 2024, Fluid\nSolutions had a $6.1 million outstanding balance under these facilities with interest rate of 7.1%.\n- 16 -\nIndex to Notes\nAs of September 27, 2024, the Company’s total bank debt was $492.2 million, net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $7.7 million. As of September 27,\n2024, the Company had $146.0 million, $4.9 million, and $7.8 million available to draw from its credit facilities in the U.S., Israel and Czech Republic,\nrespectively.\nThe fair value of the Company’s long-term debt was based on Level 2 inputs, and fair value was determined using quoted prices for similar liabilities in\ninactive markets. The Company’s carrying value approximates fair value for the Company’s long-term debt.\n7. INCOME TAX\nThe Company's effective tax rate was 97.1% and (70.7)% for the three months ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, respectively, and 66.0%\nand (488.6)% for the nine months ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, respectively. The Company’s income tax provision was $9.9 million and\n$5.3 million for the three months ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, respectively, and $28.2 million and $17.1 million for the nine months\nended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, respectively. The change in respective tax rates reflects, primarily, changes in the geographic mix of\nworldwide earnings and financial results in jurisdictions which are taxed at different rates and the impact of losses in jurisdictions with full valuation\nallowances on deferred tax assets. Company management continuously evaluates the need for a valuation allowance and, as of September 27, 2024, concluded\nthat a full valuation allowance on its U.S. federal and state and certain of its foreign deferred tax assets was still appropriate.\nAs of September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, the Company’s gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest, was $3.1 million and $2.7\nmillion, respectively. Increases or decreases to interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions are included in the income tax provision in the Condensed\nConsolidated Statements of Operations. Although it is possible that some of the unrecognized tax benefits could be settled within the next twelve months, the\nCompany cannot reasonably estimate the outcome at this time.\n8. RETIREMENT PLANS\nDefined Benefit Plans\nCinos Korea has a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all of its employees upon their retirement. The Company's entities in\nIsrael also have noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering their employees upon their retirement. The benefits for these plans are based on\nexpected years of service and average compensation. The net period costs are recognized as employees render the services necessary to earn the postretirement\nbenefits. The Company records annual amounts relating to the pension plan based on calculations that incorporate various actuarial and other assumptions,\nincluding discount rates, mortality, assumed rates of return, compensation increases and turnover rates. The Company reviews its assumptions on an annual\nbasis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current and expected rates of return and trends when it is appropriate to do so. The effect of\nmodifications to those assumptions is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and amortized to net periodic cost over future periods using the\ncorridor method. The Company believes that the assumptions utilized in recording its obligations under the plans are reasonable based on its experience and\nmarket conditions.\nAs of September 27, 2024, the benefit obligation of the plans was $12.3 million and the fair value of the benefit plan assets was $11.2 million which are\ninvested in several fixed deposit accounts with financial institutions. As of September 27, 2024, the underfunded balance of the plans of $1.1 million has been\nrecorded by the Company and is included in other liabilities.\nAmounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss and contributed for the three and nine months ended September 27, 2024 were negligible. The\nCompany and its subsidiaries contributed $0.1 million during the three and nine months ended September 29, 2023 and recognized $0.2 million and $0.4\nmillion in accumulated other comprehensive loss for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2023.\nAs of September 27, 2024, the Company's future estimated payment obligations for the respective fiscal years are as follows:\n- 17 -\nIndex to Notes\n(In millions)\n2024 $ 0.4\n2025 1.7\n2026 2.5\n2027 1.4\n2028 1.2\nThereafter 10.8\nTotal $ 18.0\nEmployee Savings and Retirement Plan\nThe Company sponsors a 401(k) savings and retirement plan (the “401(k) Plan”) for all U.S. employees who meet certain eligibility requirements. Participants\ncan elect to contribute to the 401(k) Plan, on a pre-tax basis, up to 25% of their salary to a maximum of the IRS limit. The Company matches 50.0% of each\nemployee's contribution, up to a maximum of 6% of the employee's eligible earnings. The Company made $0.8 million and $2.7 million discretionary\nemployer contributions to the 401(k) Plan for the three and nine months ended September 27, 2024 and $0.9 million and $2.5 million for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 29, 2023.\n9. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nCommitments\nThe Company leases real estate and equipment under various non-cancelable operating leases.\nContingencies\nFrom time to time, the Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted, that arise in the ordinary course of business.\nAlthough the outcome of the various legal proceedings and claims individually or in the aggregate cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company has not had\na history of outcomes to date that have been material to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and does not believe that any of these\nproceedings or other claims will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n10. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY AND NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS\nTreasury Stock\nOn October 20, 2022, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to purchase up to an aggregate of $150 million of\nthe Company’s common stock over a three-year period. No shares were repurchased under this program for the three and nine months ended September 27,\n2024, and for the three months ended September 29, 2023. For the nine months ended September 29, 2023, approximately 0.8 million shares were repurchased\nunder this program with an aggregate cost of $23.7 million.\nThe Company may reissue these treasury shares as part of its stock-based compensation programs.\nNon-controlling Interests\nThe Company owns part of the outstanding shares of Cinos Korea, a South Korean company that provides outsourced cleaning and recycling of precision parts\nfor the semiconductor industry through its operating facilities in South Korea and through a partial interest in Cinos China.\nThe carrying value of the remaining interest held by another shareholder in Cinos Korea and the remaining interest in Cinos China are presented as\nnoncontrolling interests in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The noncontrolling interests were estimated based on the values\nof Cinos Korea and Cinos China on a 100% basis. The values were calculated based on the pro-rata portion of total Services earnings before interest expense,\ntaxes, depreciation and amortization contributed by each entity.\n11. EMPLOYEE STOCK PLANS\nEmployee Stock Plans\n- 18 -\nIndex to Notes\nThe Company grants stock awards in the form of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance stock units (“PSUs”) to its employees as part of the\nCompany’s long-term equity compensation plan. These stock awards are granted to employees with a unit purchase price of zero dollars and typically vest over\nthree years, subject to the employee’s continued service with the Company and, in the case of PSUs, subject to achieving certain performance goals and market\nconditions. The Company also grants common stock to its board members in the form of restricted stock awards (“RSAs”), which vest on the earlier of the next\nAnnual Shareholder Meeting, or 365 days from date of grant.\nStock-based compensation expense includes compensation costs related to estimated fair values of awards granted. The estimated fair value of the Company’s\nequity-based awards is amortized on a straight-line basis over the awards’ vesting period and is adjusted for performance as it relates to PSUs.\nThe following table shows the Company’s stock-based compensation expense included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 27, September 29, September 27, September 29,\n(In millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nCost of revenues (1) $ 0.5 $ 0.3 $ 1.3 $ 0.9\nResearch and development 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.2\nSales and marketing 0.4 0.4 1.4 1.1\nGeneral and administrative 3.7 3.2 9.8 6.5\nTotal stock-based compensation $ 4.7 $ 4.0 $ 12.7 $ 8.7\n(1) Stock-based compensation expense capitalized in inventory for the three and nine months ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023 were\nimmaterial.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 27, 2024, 27 thousand and 502 thousand RSUs were granted with a weighted average fair value of $39.72 and\n$41.37 per share, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 29, 2023, 14 thousand and 567 thousand RSUs were granted with a weighted\naverage fair value of $32.55 and $28.41 per share, respectively.\nFor the nine months ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, 125 thousand and 145 thousand PSUs were granted, respectively. No PSUs were\ngranted for the three months ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023.\nFor the nine months ended September 27, 2024and September 29, 2023, 26 thousand and 37 thousand RSAs were granted, respectively. No RSAs were granted\nfor the three months ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023.\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s combined RSU, PSU and RSA activity for the nine months ended September 27, 2024:\nAggregate\nNumber of Intrinsic\n(In millions) Shares Value\nOutstanding at December 29, 2023 1.4 $ 46.1\nGranted 0.7\nVested (0.4)\nForfeited (0.3)\nOutstanding at September 27, 2024 1.4 56.7\nExpected to vest at September 27, 2024 1.4 $ 56.7\nAs of September 27, 2024, approximately $29.4 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation cost related to employee and director awards remains to be\namortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted average period of 1.9 years, and will be adjusted for subsequent changes in future grants. The total\nunamortized expense of the Company’s unvested RSAs as of September 27, 2024 was $0.8 million.\nUnder the current PSU program, performance goals are set at the time of grant and performance is reviewed at the end of a three-year period. The percentage to\nbe applied to each participant’s target award ranges from zero to 200%, based upon the extent to which the financial performance goals are achieved. If specific\nperformance threshold levels for the financial goals are met on an annual basis, the amount earned for that element will be applied to one-third of the\nparticipant’s PSU award granted to determine the number of total units earned.\nRecipients of PSU awards generally must remain employed by the Company on a continuous basis through the end of the three-year performance period in\norder to receive any amount of the PSUs covered by that award. In events such as death,\n- 19 -\nIndex to Notes\ndisability or retirement, the recipient may be entitled to pro-rata amounts of PSUs as defined in the Plan. Target shares subject to PSU awards do not have\nvoting rights of common stock until earned and issued following the end of the three-year performance period.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nThe ESPP permits employees to purchase common stock at a discount through payroll withholdings at certain specified dates (purchase period) within a\ndefined offering period. The purchase price is 85% of the fair market value of the common stock at the end of the purchase period and is intended to qualify as\nan “employee stock purchase plan” under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code.\nDuring the nine months ended September 27, 2024, 42 thousand shares were issued under the ESPP. No shares were issued under the ESPP during the three\nmonths ended September 27, 2024. The Company recorded $0.2 million and $0.5 million of expense related to ESPP for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 27, 2024.\nNo shares were issued under the ESPP during the three and nine months ended September 29, 2023. The Company recorded $0.2 million and $0.3 million of\nexpense related to ESPP for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2023.\n12. REVENUE RECOGNITION\nRevenue is recognized when the Company satisfies the performance obligations as evidenced by the transfer of control of the promised goods or services to the\nCompany’s customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.\nThe Company sells its products and services primarily to customers in the semiconductor capital equipment industry. The Company’s revenues are highly\nconcentrated, and therefore highly dependent upon a small number of customers. Typical payment terms with our customers range from thirty to sixty days.\nThe Company’s Products business segment provides warranty on its products for a period of up to two years and provides for warranty costs at the time of sale\nbased on historical activity. Determination of the warranty reserve requires the Company to make estimates of product return rates and expected costs to repair\nor replace the products under warranty. If actual return rates and/or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from these estimates, adjustments to\nrecognize additional cost of revenues may be required in future periods. The warranty reserve is included in other current liabilities on the Condensed\nConsolidated Balance Sheets and is not considered significant.\nThe Company’s products are manufactured and services provided at the Company's locations throughout the Americas, Asia Pacific and Europe and the Middle\nEast (“EMEA”). Sales to customers are initiated through a purchase order and are governed by our standard terms and conditions, written agreements, or both.\nRevenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of an agreement with a customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of\ncontrol of the products or when the Company provides the services. Based on the enforceable rights included in our agreements or prevailing terms and\nconditions, products produced by the Company without an alternative use are not protected by an enforceable right of payment that includes a reasonable profit\nthroughout the duration of the agreement. Consignment sales are recognized in revenue at the earlier of the period that the goods are consumed or after a period\nof time subsequent to receipt by the customer as specified by terms of the agreement, provided control of the promised goods or services has transferred.\nRevenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services. Sales, value-add, and other\ntaxes we collect concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. Certain of our customers may receive cash-based incentives, such as\nrebates or credits, which are accounted for as variable consideration. We estimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and\nreduce revenues recognized. Accruals for unpaid customer rebates of $1.8 million and $2.0 million as of September 27, 2024 and December 29, 2023,\nrespectively, were netted against accounts receivable. The Company's disaggregated revenues are apportioned by segments within the Company’s Condensed\nConsolidated Statement of Operations.\nThe Company’s principal markets include America, Asia Pacific and EMEA. The Company's foreign operations are conducted primarily through its\nsubsidiaries in China, Malaysia, Singapore, Israel, Taiwan, South Korea, United Kingdom\n- 20 -\nIndex to Notes\nand the Czech Republic. Revenues by geographic area are categorized based on the customer’s location to which the products were shipped or services were\nperformed. The following table sets forth revenue by geographic area:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 27, September 29, September 27, September 29,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nSingapore $ 173.9 $ 155.4 $ 500.0 $ 446.5\nUnited States 145.6 125.8 432.7 393.7\nChina 56.7 26.7 171.2 80.8\nAustria 48.9 33.1 131.6 94.9\nSouth Korea 25.3 21.9 73.6 71.9\nTaiwan 23.2 20.0 60.3 60.5\nOthers 66.8 52.1 164.9 141.5\nTotal $ 540.4 $ 435.0 $ 1,534.3 $ 1,289.8\nThe Company’s most significant customers (having individually accounted for 10% or more of revenues) and their related revenues as a percentage of total\nrevenues were as follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 27, September 29, September 27, September 29,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nLam Research Corporation 31.2 % 33.0 % 31.4 % 34.5 %\nApplied Materials, Inc. 21.8 25.7 22.4 22.9\nTotal 53.0 % 58.7 % 53.9 % 57.4 %\nThree customers’ accounts receivable balances, Lam Research Corporation, ASML Holding NV and Applied Materials, Inc., were individually greater than\n10% of accounts receivable as of September 27, 2024, in the aggregate approximately 35.0% of the Company's total accounts receivable.\nTwo customers’ accounts receivable balances, Lam Research Corporation and Applied Materials, Inc., were individually greater than 10% of accounts\nreceivable as of December 29, 2023, in the aggregate approximately 26.8% of total accounts receivable.\n13. LEASES\nThe Company leases land, offices, facilities and equipment in locations throughout the United States, Asia Pacific and EMEA.\nIn 2023, the Company entered into a 60-year land lease in Malaysia with the intent of building a manufacturing site. The commencement date of the lease\noccurred in July 2024 contemporaneous with the Company obtaining control of the identified asset.\nIn the first quarter of 2024, the Company commenced a 10-year lease of manufacturing space in Austin, Texas, with a single 7-year renewal option at lease end.\nAdditionally, the Company’s subsidiary in Czech Republic entered into 8-year lease of additional manufacturing and office space.\nAs a result, $21.9 million and $16.8 million were recorded at commencement date to operating lease right-of-use assets and to operating lease liabilities,\nrespectively, in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet .\n- 21 -\nIndex to Notes\n14.

REPORTABLE SEGMENTS\nThe Company prepares financial results based on three operating segments (Products, Services, and HIS) and two reportable segments (Products and Services).\nThe Products and HIS operating segments have been aggregated into the Products reportable segment based upon consistency of economic characteristics,\nnature of products, similarity of production process, and class of customers. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer (chief operating decision maker) views\nand evaluates operations based on the results of each of the operating segments. The following table describes each reportable segment:\nSegment Product or Services Primary Markets Served Geographic Areas\nProducts Assembly Semiconductor Americas\nWeldments Asia Pacific\nMachining EMEA\nFabrication\nServices Cleaning Semiconductor Americas\nAnalytics Asia Pacific\nCoating EMEA\nThe Company uses segment profit or loss as the primary measure of profitability to evaluate operating performance and to allocate capital resources. Segment\nprofit or loss is defined as a segment’s income or loss from continuing operations before other income and income taxes included in the accompanying\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nAny intercompany sales and associated profit (and any other intercompany items) are eliminated from segment results. There were no significant intercompany\neliminations for the periods presented.\n- 22 -\nIndex to Notes\nSegment Data\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 27, September 29, September 27, September 29,\n(In millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenues:\nProducts $ 479.0 $ 380.9 $ 1,350.2 $ 1,112.0\nServices 61.4 54.1 184.1 177.8\nTotal segment revenues $ 540.4 $ 435.0 $ 1,534.3 $ 1,289.8\nGross margin:\nProducts $ 75.7 $ 51.6 $ 209.0 $ 156.5\nServices 17.7 13.6 55.5 49.8\nTotal segment gross margin $ 93.4 $ 65.2 $ 264.5 $ 206.3\nIncome from operations:\nProducts $ 22.4 $ 7.7 $ 55.9 $ 27.3\nServices 2.8 (2.0) 9.4 3.4\nTotal segment income from operations $ 25.2 $ 5.7 $ 65.3 $ 30.7\nSeptember 27, December 29,\n(In millions) 2024 2023\nAssets\nProducts $ 1,670.8 $ 1,617.5\nServices 276.7 250.2\nTotal segment assets $ 1,947.5 $ 1,867.7\nLong-lived assets comprised of operating lease right-of-use assets and property, plant and equipment, net, reported based on the location of the asset.

Management’s Discussion And Analysis of Financial Condition And Results Of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial\nStatements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on\nMarch 6, 2024. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains “forward-looking statements” that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. The statements\ncontained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that are not purely historical are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the\nSecurities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including, but not limited to, statements regarding our expectations,\nbeliefs, intentions, strategies, future operations, future financial position, future revenue, projected expenses, gross margins and plans and objectives of\nmanagement. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,”\n“might,” “plan,” “project,” “will,” “would,” “should,” “could,” “can,” “predict,” “potential,” “continue,” “objective,” or the negative of these terms, and\nsimilar expressions intended to identify forward-looking statements. However, not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. These\nforward-looking statements reflect our current views about future events and involve known risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual\nresults, performance or achievement to be materially different from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or\ncontribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below, and those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” included in this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 6, 2024. Furthermore, such forward-looking statements\nspeak only as of the date of this report. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or\ncircumstances after the date of such statements.\nOverview\nUltra Clean Holdings, Inc., (“UCT”, the “Company” or “We”) is a leading developer and supplier of critical subsystems, components, parts, and ultra-high\npurity cleaning and analytical services primarily for the semiconductor industry. UCT offers its customers an integrated outsourced solution for major\nsubassemblies, improved design-to-delivery cycle times, design for manufacturability, prototyping and part and component manufacturing, as well as tool\nchamber parts cleaning and coating, and micro-contamination analytical services. We report results for two segments: Products and Services. Our Products\nsegment primarily designs, engineers and manufactures production tools, components and parts, and modules and subsystems for the semiconductor and\ndisplay capital equipment markets. Products include chemical delivery modules, frame assemblies, gas delivery systems, fluid delivery systems, precision\nrobotics, process modules as well as other high-level assemblies. Our Services segment provides ultra-high purity parts cleaning, process tool part recoating,\nsurface encapsulation and high sensitivity micro contamination analysis primarily for the semiconductor device makers and wafer fabrication equipment\n(“WFE”) markets.\nWe ship a majority of our products and provide most of our services to U.S. registered customers with locations both in and outside the U.S. In addition to U.S.\nmanufacturing and service operations, we manufacture products and provide parts cleaning and other related services in our Asia Pacific, Europe and Middle\nEast (“EMEA”) facilities to support local and U.S. based customers. We conduct our operating activities primarily through our subsidiaries.\nOver the long term, we believe the semiconductor market we serve will continue to grow due to multi-year industry demand from a broad range of drivers,\nsuch as new process architecture (e.g. gate all around) and memory devices (e.g. high bandwidth memory) necessary for cloud, artificial intelligence (“AI”) and\nmachine learning (“ML”) applications. We also believe that semiconductor original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”) are increasingly relying on partners like\nUCT to fulfill their expanding capacity requirements. Additionally, our Services business is benefiting as device manufacturers rely on precision cleaning and\ncoating to achieve ever more advanced devices.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which\nrequire us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure at the date of our\nCondensed Consolidated Financial Statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to inventories, income\ntaxes, business combinations, contingent earn-out liabilities and goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets. We base our estimates and judgments on\nhistorical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of our\njudgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.

are taxed at different rates and the impact of\nlosses in jurisdictions with full valuation allowances on deferred tax assets. The negative tax rates in the three and nine months ended September 29, 2023 were\nthe result of pre-tax losses in those periods compared to pre-tax profits in the comparable periods ended September 27, 2024.\nCompany management continuously evaluates the need for a valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets and, as of September 27, 2024, concluded that a full\nvaluation allowance on its U.S. federal, state and certain of its foreign deferred tax assets remained appropriate.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash and cash Equivalents\nThe following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents:\nSeptember 27, December 29,\n(In millions) 2024 2023 Increase\nTotal cash and cash equivalents $ 318.2 $ 307.0 $ 11.2\nThe following table summarizes the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow information:\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 27, September 29,\n(In millions) 2024 2023\nOperating activities $ 47.9 $ 100.6\nInvesting activities (46.2) (56.9)\nFinancing activities 8.8 (61.0)\nEffects of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 0.7 0.5\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 11.2 $ (16.8)\n- 28 -\nTable of Contents\nOur primary cash inflows and outflows were as follows:\n• For the nine months ended September 27, 2024, we generated cash from operating activities of $47.9 million compared to $100.6 million for the nine\nmonths ended September 29, 2023. The $52.7 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was driven by a $83.1 million unfavorable\nchange in net working capital and by a $4.7 million decrease in non-cash items included in net income offset in part by an increase in net income of\n$35.1 million.\n• The major contributors in net changes in operating assets and liabilities for the nine months ended September 27, 2024 were as follows:\n◦ Accounts receivable increased $47.3 million primarily due to the timing of shipments and collections and $28.1 million increase in\ninventories due to increased production levels.\n◦ Accounts payable increased $46.1 million, income taxes payable increased $1.4 million, and accrued compensation and related benefits\nincreased $0.2 million, primarily due to the timing of payments.\n• Net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023 consisted primarily of $46.2 million\nand $59.2 million purchases of property, plant and equipment, respectively.\n• During the nine months ended September 27, 2024, the cash provided in financing activities was $8.8 million compared to cash used in financing\nactivities of $61.0 million in the nine months ended September 29, 2023. The $69.8 million increase in net cash provided by financing activities is\ndue to the $23.5 million net cash proceeds from the amended credit agreement, a decrease of $24.6 million in principal payments on bank\nborrowings, and a $23.7 million decrease in share repurchases offset partially by the additional $2.2 million payment of debt issuance costs.\nWe believe we have sufficient capital to fund our working capital needs, satisfy our debt obligations, maintain our existing capital equipment, purchase new\ncapital equipment and make strategic acquisitions from time to time. As of September 27, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $318.2 million compared\nto $307.0 million as of December 29, 2023. Our cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, and amounts available under our revolving line of\ncredit described below were our principal sources of liquidity as of September 27, 2024.\nFluid Solutions has an existing factoring arrangement with a financial institution in which a portion of its accounts receivable are sold on a non-recourse basis.\nAs of September 27, 2024, Fluid Solutions factored $7.6 million under this arrangement.\nWe anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents balance and operating cash flow will be sufficient to service our indebtedness and meet our working\ncapital requirements and technology development projects for at least the next twelve months. The adequacy of these resources to meet our liquidity needs\nbeyond that period will depend on our growth, the size and number of any acquisitions, the state of the worldwide economy, our ability to meet our financial\ncovenants with our credit facility, the cyclical expansion or contraction of the semiconductor capital equipment industry and the other industries we serve and\ncapital expenditures required to meet possible increased demand for our products.\nIn order to expand our business or acquire additional complementary businesses or technologies, we may need to raise additional funds through equity or debt\nfinancing. If required, additional financing may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, if at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of\nequity or convertible debt securities, our stockholders’ equity interest will be diluted and these securities might have rights, preferences and privileges senior to\nthose of our current stockholders. We may also require the consent of our new lenders to raise additional funds through equity or debt financing. No assurance\ncan be given that additional financing will be available or that, if available, such financing can be obtained on terms favorable to our stockholders and us.\nAs of September 27, 2024, we have cash of approximately $278.3 million in our foreign subsidiaries. It is not practicable to determine the tax liability that\nmight be incurred if the undistributed earnings of these foreign subsidiaries were to be distributed. For undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries which are\nnot considered indefinitely reinvested, deferred taxes have been accrued.\n- 29 -\nTable of Contents\nBorrowing Arrangements\nThe following table summarizes our borrowings:\nSeptember 27,\n2024\nWeighted-\nAverage\n(Dollars in millions) Amount Interest Rate\nU.S. Term Loan $ 493.8 8.9 %\nFluid Solutions Debt Facilities 6.1 7.1 %\nDebt issuance costs (7.7)\n$ 492.2\nAt September 27, 2024, the Company had an outstanding amount under the Term Loan of $493.8 million, gross of unamortized debt issuance costs of $7.7\nmillion.

The Company’s anticipated capital expenditures for the remainder of 2024 are expected to be financed primarily from our\ncash flow generated from operations and cash on hand.\nContractual Obligations\nThe Company had commitments to various third parties to purchase inventories totaling approximately $495.7 million as of September 27, 2024.\nIn conjunction with the sale of our products in the ordinary course of business, we provide standard indemnification against certain liabilities to our customers,\nwhich may include claims of losses by their own customers resulting out of property damages, bodily injuries or deaths, or infringement of intellectual property\nrights by our products. Our potential liability arising out of intellectual property infringement claims by any third party is generally uncapped. As of\nSeptember 27, 2024, we have not incurred any significant costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification arrangements. As a result,\nwe believe the estimated fair value of these arrangements is minimal.\n- 30 -\nTable of Contents\nITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThere were no significant changes to our quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk during the period covered by this report. Refer to Part II,\nItem 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended December 29,\n2023, for a more complete discussion of the market risks we encounter.\nITEM 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an\nevaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Disclosure controls and procedures are\ndesigned to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized\nand reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management,\nincluding the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon this\nevaluation, our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer concluded the disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 27,\n2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, due to material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described\nbelow.\nMaterial Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nAs previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2023, the Company identified the following material\nweaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that continue to exist as of September 27, 2024.\nThe Company did not design and maintain effective controls relating to the: (i) sufficiency of processes related to identifying and analyzing risks to the\nachievement of objectives across the entity, (ii) sufficiency of competent personnel to analyze risks of material misstatement and develop internal control\nactivities to support the achievement of the Company’s internal control objectives; and (iii) monitoring of performance of control activities in accordance with\nestablished policies in a timely manner.\nThese material weaknesses contributed to the following additional material weaknesses:\n(a) The Company did not design and maintain effective information technology (“IT”) general controls for certain information systems that are relevant to the\npreparation of its consolidated financial statements. Specifically, for certain of the Fluid Solutions operating subsidiaries in the Products segment which have\nnot been migrated to the Company’s primary ERP system, the Company did not design and maintain (a) program change management controls to ensure that IT\nprogram and data changes affecting financial IT applications and underlying accounting records are identified, tested, authorized and implemented\nappropriately, and (b) user access controls to ensure appropriate segregation of duties that adequately restrict user and privileged access to our financial\napplications and data to appropriate company personnel. Business process controls that are dependent on information and data produced by systems affected by\nthe deficiencies in IT general controls were deemed ineffective because they could have been adversely impacted.\n(b) The Company did not design and maintain effective application controls over certain information technology systems that are relevant to the preparation of\nits consolidated financial statements. Specifically, for certain other international operating subsidiaries in the Products segment which have not been migrated\nto the Company’s primary ERP system, the Company did not design and maintain effective IT application controls or business process controls including, but\nnot limited to appropriate segregation of duties. The business process controls were deemed ineffective because they could have allowed for certain personnel\nto have incompatible duties allowing for the creation, review, and processing of certain transactions without independent review and authorization which\naffects substantially all financial statement account balances and disclosures within such subsidiaries;\n(c) The Company did not design and maintain effective controls to determine the valuation of inventories, including the write down of inventory to its\nestimated market value less costs to sell and the validation and approval of inventory costing;\n(d) The Company did not design effective controls necessary to validate the accuracy of certain data used within the operation of controls which affects\nsubstantially all financial statement account balances and disclosures; and\n- 31 -\nTable of Contents\n(e) The Company did not design and maintain effective controls related to the review of cash flow forecasts used in the valuation of certain assets and liabilities\nacquired in a business combination. Specifically, the control activities related to the review of the inputs and assumptions utilized to develop the cash flow\nforecasts used in the valuation of acquired intangible assets and contingent earn-out liabilities were not designed at an appropriate level of precision.\nThe material weaknesses described above did not result in any changes to previously released annual or interim financial results. However, these material\nweaknesses could result in misstatements of our consolidated financial statements that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim\nconsolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. Based on additional procedures and post-closing review, management concluded that\nthe condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position,\nresults of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nRemediation Plan and Progress\nManagement has been executing and remains committed to implementing measures designed to ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material\nweaknesses are remediated, such that these controls are designed, implemented, and operating effectively.\nIn response to all material weaknesses, management has taken the following actions:\n• engaged an external advisor to assist with evaluating and documenting the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls and to assist with the\nremediation of deficiencies, as necessary;\n• hired additional IT, accounting, and finance personnel to support our remediation efforts, including a Vice President of Internal Audit, as well as third-\nparty resources with relevant expertise to augment our internal resources;\n• formalized roles and responsibilities within the organization to establish ownership of workstreams to identify and analyze risks of material\nmisstatement, develop internal control activities to support the achievement of the Company’s internal control objectives, and monitor the effective\nperformance of those control objectives;\n• performed an entity-wide risk assessment of information technology systems and business processes by operating subsidiary; and\n• assessed the specific training needs for newly hired and existing personnel and developed and delivered training programs designed to support our\ninternal controls.\nIn response to the material weakness “(a)” management has taken the following actions:\n• in process of designing and implementing change management and user access review controls for relevant information technology systems at certain\nFluid Solutions operating subsidiaries not yet migrated to our primary ERP system. Management also continues to design and implement user access\ncontrols to ensure appropriate segregation of duties that adequately restrict user access to our financial applications and data to appropriate company\npersonnel.\nIn response to the material weakness “(b)” management has taken the following actions:\n• in process of completing a segregation of duties assessment to identify key conflicts, establishing policies and procedures to maintain effective\nsegregation of duties, and identifying mitigating factors for any key conflicts identified for certain other international operating subsidiaries in the\nProducts segment which have not been migrated to the Company’s primary ERP system and\n• in process of identifying and evaluating the effectiveness of key IT dependencies, including automated application controls for certain other\ninternational operating subsidiaries in the Products segment which have not been migrated to the Company’s primary ERP system.\nIn response to the material weakness “(c)” management has taken the following actions:\n• designed and implemented controls over valuation of inventories, including review and assessment of the methodology for the valuation of\ninventories, including the write down of inventory to its estimated market value less costs to sell and\n• designed and implemented controls over validation and approval of inventory costing, including capitalizing variances from standard costs.\nIn response to the material weakness “(d)” management has taken the following actions:\n- 32 -\nTable of Contents\n• established ongoing education and training of control owners on how to assess the accuracy and completeness of relevant data used within the\noperation of controls, including the adequate levels of evidence and documentation required to support such procedures\n• designed and implemented an additional control to validate the accuracy of certain data used within the operation of controls and\n• ensured the design of all business process controls include a control activity to assess the completeness and accuracy of the data used in the operation\nof controls and to ensure adequate levels of evidence and documentation to support assessment of data used within the operation of controls.\nIn response to the material weakness “(e)” management has taken the following actions:\n• designed and implemented effective controls over the review of cash flow forecasts utilized in the valuation of contingent earn-out liabilities including\nreview of the inputs and assumptions utilized to develop the cash flow forecasts at an appropriate level of precision and\n• designed controls that stand ready to operate in a future business combination to review the inputs and assumptions utilized to develop the cash flow\nforecasts in the valuation of intangible assets at an appropriate level of precision.\nAs we continue to evaluate and work to improve our internal control over financial reporting, we may decide to take additional measures to address the\nmaterial weaknesses or modify the remediation plans described above. We believe that these actions will remediate the material weaknesses, however the\nmaterial weaknesses will not be considered remediated until we conclude all measures necessary to remediate the material weaknesses have been designed,\nimplemented, and the applicable controls have operated for a sufficient period of time, and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are\ndesigned and operating effectively. While Management believes that the aforementioned plans will remediate the material weaknesses, there is no assurance on\nthe exact timing of the completion of the remediation. As the remediation plans continue to be implemented, management may be required to take additional\nmeasures or modify the plan elements.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOther than the remediation measures described above, there were no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September\n27, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n- 33 -\nTable of Contents\nPART II.

(Nasdaq: UCTT), today reported its financial results for the third quarter ended September 27, 2024.\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/Ultra Clean Holdings, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/582701/Ultra_Clean_Holdings_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/582701/Ultra_Clean_Holdings_Logo.html)\n\n\"UCT's third quarter results came in above expectations driven by broader equipment demand for AI infrastructure build out and sustained domestic China market spending,\" said Jim Scholhamer, CEO. \"The rationale for significant long-term investment in WFE remains strong. UCT's vertical integration capabilities and strategic manufacturing network provide a competitive edge, and should enable us to increase share as demand expands.\"\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 GAAP Financial Results** Total revenue was $540.4 million. Products contributed $479.0 million and Services added $61.4 million. Total gross margin was 17.3%, operating margin was 4.7%, and net loss was $(2.3) million or $(0.05) per diluted share. This compares to total revenue of $516.1 million, gross margin of 17.1%, operating margin of 4.4%, and net income of $19.1 million or $0.42 per diluted share, in the prior quarter.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Non-GAAP Financial Results** On a non-GAAP basis, gross margin was 17.8%, operating margin was 7.3%, and net income was $15.9 million or $0.35 per diluted share. This compares to gross margin of 17.7%, operating margin of 6.9%, and net income of $14.4 million or $0.32 per diluted share in the prior quarter.\n\n**Fourth Quarter 2024 Outlook** The Company expects revenue in the range of $535 million to $585 million. The Company expects GAAP diluted net income per share to be between $0.06 and $0.26 and non-GAAP diluted net income per share to be between $0.34 and $0.54.\n\n**Conference Call** The conference call and webcast will take place on Monday, October 28, 2024 at 1:45 p.m. PT and can be accessed by dialing 1-800-836-8184 or 1-646-357-8785. No passcode is required. A replay of the call will be available by dialing 1-888-660-6345 or 1-646-517-4150 and entering the confirmation code 34185#.

Under its Products division, UCT offers its customers an integrated outsourced solution for major subassemblies, improved design-to-delivery cycle times, design for manufacturability, prototyping, and high-precision manufacturing. Under its Services Division, UCT offers its customers tool chamber parts cleaning and coating, as well as micro-contamination analytical services. Ultra Clean is headquartered in Hayward, California. Additional information is available at [www.uct.com](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4288385-1&h=4265791917&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uct.com%2F&a=www.uct.com). \n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Measures** In addition to providing results that are determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"), management uses non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP net income to evaluate the Company's operating and financial results. We believe the presentation of non-GAAP results is useful to investors for analyzing our core business and business trends and comparing performance to prior periods, along with enhancing investors' ability to view the Company's results from management's perspective. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Tables presenting reconciliations from GAAP results to non-GAAP results are included at the end of this press release.\n\nThe Company defines non-GAAP net income as net income (loss) before amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, acquisition activity costs, fair value adjustments, debt refinancing costs, legal-related costs and the tax effects of the foregoing adjustments.\n\nA reconciliation of our guidance for non-GAAP net income per diluted share for the subsequent quarter is not available due to fluctuations in the geographic mix of our earnings from quarter to quarter, which impacts our tax rate and cannot be reasonably predicted or determined. As a result, such reconciliation is not available without unreasonable efforts and we are unable to determine the probable significance of the unavailable information.\n\n**Safe Harbor Statement** The foregoing information contains, or may be deemed to contain, \"forward-looking statements\" (as defined in the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) which reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. We use words such as \"anticipates,\" \"projection,\" \"outlook,\" \"forecast,\" \"believes,\" \"plan,\" \"expect,\" \"future,\" \"intends,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"estimates,\" \"see,\" \"predicts,\" \"should\" and similar expressions to identify these forward-looking statements. Forward looking statements included in this press release include our expectations about the semiconductor capital equipment market and outlook. All forward-looking statements address matters that involve risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, the Company's actual results may differ materially from the results predicted or implied by these forward-looking statements. These risks, uncertainties and other factors also include, among others, those identified in \"Risk Factors,\" \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations'' and elsewhere in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 29, 2023, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

(Nasdaq: UCTT), today reported its financial results for the third quarter ended September 27, 2024.\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/Ultra Clean Holdings, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/582701/Ultra_Clean_Holdings_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/582701/Ultra_Clean_Holdings_Logo.html)\n\n\"UCT's third quarter results came in above expectations driven by broader equipment demand for AI infrastructure build out and sustained domestic China market spending,\" said Jim Scholhamer, CEO. \"The rationale for significant long-term investment in WFE remains strong. UCT's vertical integration capabilities and strategic manufacturing network provide a competitive edge, and should enable us to increase share as demand expands.\"\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 GAAP Financial Results** Total revenue was $540.4 million. Products contributed $479.0 million and Services added $61.4 million. Total gross margin was 17.3%, operating margin was 4.7%, and net loss was $(2.3) million or $(0.05) per diluted share. This compares to total revenue of $516.1 million, gross margin of 17.1%, operating margin of 4.4%, and net income of $19.1 million or $0.42 per diluted share, in the prior quarter.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Non-GAAP Financial Results** On a non-GAAP basis, gross margin was 17.8%, operating margin was 7.3%, and net income was $15.9 million or $0.35 per diluted share. This compares to gross margin of 17.7%, operating margin of 6.9%, and net income of $14.4 million or $0.32 per diluted share in the prior quarter.\n\n**Fourth Quarter 2024 Outlook** The Company expects revenue in the range of $535 million to $585 million. The Company expects GAAP diluted net income per share to be between $0.06 and $0.26 and non-GAAP diluted net income per share to be between $0.34 and $0.54.\n\n**Conference Call** The conference call and webcast will take place on Monday, October 28, 2024 at 1:45 p.m. PT and can be accessed by dialing 1-800-836-8184 or 1-646-357-8785. No passcode is required. A replay of the call will be available by dialing 1-888-660-6345 or 1-646-517-4150 and entering the confirmation code 34185#. The Webcast will be available on the Investor Relations section of the Company's website at <http://uct.com/investors/events/>.\n\n**About Ultra Clean Holdings, Inc.** Ultra Clean Holdings, Inc. is a leading developer and supplier of critical subsystems, components, parts, and ultra-high purity cleaning and analytical services, primarily for the semiconductor industry. Under its Products division, UCT offers its customers an integrated outsourced solution for major subassemblies, improved design-to-delivery cycle times, design for manufacturability, prototyping, and high-precision manufacturing.

Additional information is available at [www.uct.com](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4288385-1&h=4265791917&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uct.com%2F&a=www.uct.com). \n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Measures** In addition to providing results that are determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"), management uses non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP net income to evaluate the Company's operating and financial results. We believe the presentation of non-GAAP results is useful to investors for analyzing our core business and business trends and comparing performance to prior periods, along with enhancing investors' ability to view the Company's results from management's perspective. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Tables presenting reconciliations from GAAP results to non-GAAP results are included at the end of this press release.\n\nThe Company defines non-GAAP net income as net income (loss) before amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, acquisition activity costs, fair value adjustments, debt refinancing costs, legal-related costs and the tax effects of the foregoing adjustments.\n\nA reconciliation of our guidance for non-GAAP net income per diluted share for the subsequent quarter is not available due to fluctuations in the geographic mix of our earnings from quarter to quarter, which impacts our tax rate and cannot be reasonably predicted or determined. As a result, such reconciliation is not available without unreasonable efforts and we are unable to determine the probable significance of the unavailable information.\n\n**Safe Harbor Statement** The foregoing information contains, or may be deemed to contain, \"forward-looking statements\" (as defined in the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) which reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. We use words such as \"anticipates,\" \"projection,\" \"outlook,\" \"forecast,\" \"believes,\" \"plan,\" \"expect,\" \"future,\" \"intends,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"estimates,\" \"see,\" \"predicts,\" \"should\" and similar expressions to identify these forward-looking statements. Forward looking statements included in this press release include our expectations about the semiconductor capital equipment market and outlook. All forward-looking statements address matters that involve risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, the Company's actual results may differ materially from the results predicted or implied by these forward-looking statements. These risks, uncertainties and other factors also include, among others, those identified in \"Risk Factors,\" \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations'' and elsewhere in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 29, 2023, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
