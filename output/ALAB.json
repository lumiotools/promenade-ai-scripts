(Nasdaq: ALAB), a global leader in semiconductor-based connectivity solutions for cloud and AI infrastructure, today announced preliminary financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, ended September 30, 2024. \n\n“Astera Labs delivered strong Q3 results, setting our fifth consecutive quarterly revenue record and grew 47% versus the previous quarter,” said Jitendra Mohan, Astera Labs’ Chief Executive Officer. “Our business has now entered a new growth phase with multiple product families ramping across AI platforms based upon both third-party GPUs and internally developed AI accelerators. With expanding product portfolio including the new Scorpio Fabric Switches, we are cementing our position as a critical part of AI connectivity infrastructure, delivering increased value to our hyperscaler customers, and unlocking additional multi-year growth trajectories for Astera.” \n\n**Third Quarter of Fiscal 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\nGAAP Financial Results: \n\n  * Revenue of $113.1 million, up 47% sequentially and up 206% year-over-year \n  * GAAP gross margin of 77.7% \n  * GAAP operating loss of $8.9 million\n  * GAAP operating margin of (7.9%) \n  * GAAP net loss of $7.6 million\n  * GAAP diluted net loss per share of $0.05\n\n\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Results (excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense and the income tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments): \n\n  * Non-GAAP gross margin of 77.8% \n  * Non-GAAP operating income of $36.6 million\n  * Non-GAAP operating margin of 32.4% \n  * Non-GAAP net income of $40.3 million\n  * Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.23\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter of Fiscal 2024 and Recent Business Highlights**\n\n  * Introduced new portfolio of Scorpio Smart Fabric Switches purpose-built for AI infrastructure at cloud-scale. The Scorpio Smart Fabric Switch family features two application-specific product lines with a multi-generational roadmap, including the P-Series for GPU-to-CPU/NIC/SSD PCIe Gen 6 connectivity and the X-Series for platform-specific, back-end GPU clustering. Scorpio is currently shipping in pre-production quantities. \n  * Joined the Ultra Accelerator Link (UALink) Consortium as a promoting member on the Board of Directors. UALink technology will be used to enable efficient high-speed scale-up connectivity between AI accelerators within large and growing cluster sizes for AI workloads. Astera Labs is well positioned to quickly contribute to this new and compelling industry initiative to develop and advance UALink technology. \n  * Demonstrated current and next-generation product families in collaboration with over a dozen customers and partners at the 2024 OCP Global Summit, including the industry’s first live end-to-end PCIe Gen 6 system leveraging the Scorpio P-Series Fabric Switch and Aries 6 Smart DSP Retimer.

The joint demonstration showed AI inferencing benefit gains by using CXL-attached memory. Astera Labs is now a two-time winner at FMS having won the award at FMS 2023 by demonstrating high-performance OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) with CXL-attached memory. \n\n\n\n**Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2024 Financial Outlook**\n\nBased on current business trends and conditions, Astera Labs estimates the following: \n\nGAAP Financial Outlook: \n\n  * Revenue within a range of $126 million to $130 million\n  * GAAP gross margin of approximately 75% \n  * GAAP operating expenses within a range of approximately $101 million to $102 million\n  * GAAP taxes in a range of $3 million to $5 million tax benefit \n  * GAAP diluted earnings per share within a range of approximately $0.04 to $0.06 on weighted-average diluted shares outstanding of approximately 179 million \n\n\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Outlook (excluding the impact of approximately $47 million of stock-based compensation and including a range of $8 million to $10 million of additional income taxes): \n\n  * Non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 75% \n  * Non-GAAP operating expenses within a range of approximately $54 million to $55 million\n  * Non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 10% \n  * Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share within a range of approximately $0.25 to $0.26 on non-GAAP weighted-average diluted shares outstanding of approximately 179 million \n\n\n\n**Earnings Webcast and Conference Call**\n\nAstera Labs will host a conference call to review its financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and to discuss our financial outlook today at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time. Interested parties may join the conference call by dialing 1-800-715-9871 and using conference ID 5908687. The call will also be webcast and can be accessed at the Astera Labs website at [https://ir.asteralabs.com/](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fir.asteralabs.com%2F&esheet=54146878&newsitemid=20241104192654&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fir.asteralabs.com%2F&index=1&md5=43415e12385d42b32afc51ae53eede82). The webcast will be recorded and available for replay on the company’s website for the next six months. \n\n**Discussion of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nWe use certain non-GAAP financial measures to supplement the performance measures in our consolidated financial statements, which are presented in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP measure can be found later in this release. These non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP tax rate, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP diluted earnings (loss) per share, and non-GAAP weighted-average share count. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to assist us in evaluating period-to-period comparisons. By excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core operating results, we believe that, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP tax rate, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP pro forma diluted earnings (loss) per share, and non-GAAP pro forma weighted-average share count provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance. Accordingly, we believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and others because they allow for additional information with respect to financial measures used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and they may be used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business. However, there are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures, and these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently or not at all, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures. No reconciliation is provided with respect to the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures included in our non-GAAP financial outlook, as the GAAP measures are not accessible on a forward-looking basis. As a result, we cannot reliably predict all necessary components or their impact to reconcile such financial measures without unreasonable effort. The events necessitating a non-GAAP adjustment are inherently unpredictable and may have a significant impact on our future GAAP financial results. \n\nWe adjust the following items from one or more of our non-GAAP financial measures: \n\nStock-based compensation expense\n\nWe exclude stock-based compensation expense, which is a non-cash expense, from certain of our non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that excluding this item provides meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance. In particular, companies calculate non-cash stock-based compensation expense using a variety of valuation methodologies and subjective assumptions. Moreover, stock-based compensation expense is a non-cash charge that can vary significantly from period to period for reasons that are unrelated to our core operating performance, and therefore excluding this item provides investors and other users of our financial information with information that allows meaningful comparisons of our business performance across periods. \n\nEmployer payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation resulting from our IPO\n\nWe exclude employer payroll taxes related to the time-based vesting and net settlement of restricted stock units in connection with our initial public offering (the “IPO”), because this does not correlate to the operation of our business. We believe that excluding this item provides meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance given the amount of employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions was immaterial prior to our IPO. \n\nIncome tax effect\n\nThis represents the impact of the non-GAAP adjustments on an after-tax basis and one-off discrete tax adjustments that are unrelated to our core operating performance in connection with the presentation of non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per diluted share. This approach is designed to enhance investors’ ability to understand the impact of our non-GAAP tax expense on its current operations, provide improved modeling accuracy, and substantially reduce fluctuations caused by GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments. \n\nNon-GAAP pro forma weighted-average shares to compute non-GAAP pro forma net income (loss) per share\n\nWe present non-GAAP pro forma weighted-average shares, assuming our redeemable convertible preferred stock is converted from the beginning of each respective periods presented, to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding EPS trend on a consistent basis. All of our outstanding redeemable preferred stock converted into the equivalent number of shares of common stock in connection with our IPO. \n\n**Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements based on Astera Labs' current expectations. The words \"believe\", \"estimate\", \"expect\", \"intend\", \"anticipate\", \"plan\", \"project\", \"will\", and similar phrases as they relate to Astera Labs are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements reflect the current views and assumptions of Astera Labs and are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. These forward-looking statements include but are not limited to, statements regarding our future operating results, financial position and guidance, our business strategy and plans, our objectives for future operations, our development or delivery of new or enhanced products and anticipated results of those products for our customers, including the anticipated market opportunity and success of the Scorpio Smart Fabric Switch family of products and our AI platform dollar content opportunity, our competitive positioning, technological capabilities and plans, and macroeconomic trends in cloud and AI infrastructure. A variety of risks and factors that are beyond our control could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements including, without limitation: the competitive and cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry; the concentration of our customer base; the changes in demand for AI; the challenging macroeconomic environment; risks that demand and the supply chain may be adversely affected, including by military conflict (such as between Russia/Ukraine and Israel/Hamas), terrorism, sanctions or other geopolitical events globally (including conflict between Taiwan and China); quarterly fluctuations in revenues and operating results; difficulties developing new products that achieve market acceptance; risks associated with managing international activities (including trade barriers, particularly with respect to China); absence of long-term commitments from customers; risks that Astera Labs may not be able to manage strains associated with its growth; credit risks associated with its accounts receivable; stock price volatility; information technology risks, including cyber-attacks against Astera Labs' products and its networks; and other risks and uncertainties that are detailed under the caption “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the other SEC filings and reports Astera Labs may make from time to time. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment, and new risks may emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor(s) may cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. Accordingly, you should not rely on any of the forward-looking statements. Astera Labs disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law. \n\n**About Astera Labs**\n\nOur PCIe, CXL and Ethernet semiconductor-based connectivity solutions are purpose-built to unleash the full potential of accelerated computing at cloud-scale.
