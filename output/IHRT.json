Eligible Holders (as defined below) of the Existing Notes may not deliver consents in the Consent Solicitations without tendering their Existing Notes in the Exchange Offers. \n\nConcurrently with, but separately from, the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations, the Company also announced the commencement of an exchange offer (the “Term Loan Exchange”) for Communications’ outstanding term loans (the “Existing Term Loans” and, together with the Existing Notes, the “Existing Debt”) and a consent solicitation (the “Term Loan Consent Solicitation”) to amend certain provisions in the credit agreement governing the Existing Term Loans (the “Existing Term Loan Credit Agreement”) in connection with the Term Loan Exchange. \n\nPursuant to a Transaction Support Agreement entered into by the Company, certain of its subsidiaries and certain lenders and holders (or their managers, advisors or sub-advisors) of the Existing Debt (collectively, the “Supporting Holders”), as of November 14, 2024, Supporting Holders representing approximately 85.4% of the aggregate principal amount of the Existing Debt, including approximately 84.1% aggregate principal amount of the Existing 2026 Secured Notes, approximately 89.5% aggregate principal amount of the Existing 2027 Secured Notes, approximately 40.9% aggregate principal amount of the Existing 2028 Secured Notes, approximately 82.8% aggregate principal amount of the Existing Unsecured Notes and approximately 95.3% aggregate principal amount of the Existing Term Loans, have agreed to tender and provide consents with respect to their Existing Notes in the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations and exchange and provide consents with respect to their Existing Term Loans in the Term Loan Exchange and Term Loan Consent Solicitation. \n\nSimpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP served as counsel and PJT Partners served as financial advisor to the Company. Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP served as counsel and Perella Weinberg Partners served as financial advisor to an ad hoc group of certain of the Supporting Holders. \n\n**About the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations**\n\nThe type and amount of securities to be issued at the closing of the Exchange Offers will depend on the participation levels in the Exchange Offers and Term Loan Exchange (collectively, the “Offers”) as described below. Either the Comprehensive Exchange Offers (as defined below) will be consummated or the Alternative Exchange Offers (as defined below) will be consummated, but not both. \n\n**_Comprehensive Offers_ **\n\n_ Comprehensive Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations _\n\nIf Eligible Holders of at least 95% of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of each issue of Existing Debt tender and participate in the Offers (such participation levels collectively, the “Comprehensive Threshold”), subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in the Offering Memorandum and the Term Loan Exchange documentation being satisfied, we will consummate the “Comprehensive Exchange Offers” and issue the New Comprehensive Notes (as defined below). \n\nConcurrently with the Comprehensive Exchange Offers Communications is soliciting Consents (the “Comprehensive Consent Solicitations” and, together with the Comprehensive Exchange Offers, the “Comprehensive Offers”) from Eligible Holders of each series of Existing Notes to adopt certain proposed amendments, which will become operative in the event the Comprehensive Exchange Offers are consummated, to the indenture governing such series of Existing Notes (the “Comprehensive Proposed Amendments”), which include: (i) with consents from at least a majority in aggregate principal amount outstanding of such series of Existing Notes, (a) eliminating substantially all of the restrictive covenants as well as certain events of default and related provisions, (b) releasing the guarantees of the guarantors of such series of Existing Notes and eliminating related provisions and (c) with respect to the Existing Secured Notes, authorizing the entry into new intercreditor agreements (one of which will, among other things, require holders of the Existing Secured Notes to, after an event of default under the agreements that will govern the New Comprehensive Debt (as defined below), turn over all payments and other recoveries to, or on account of, such series of Existing Notes for the benefit of the holders of the New Comprehensive Debt as set forth therein); and (ii) with consents from at least 66.67% in aggregate principal amount outstanding of such series of Existing Secured Notes, releasing all liens on the collateral securing such series of Existing Secured Notes and eliminating related provisions. \n\nEach series of the New Comprehensive Notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a secured basis by iHeartMedia Capital I, LLC (“Holdings”) and each existing and future material domestic wholly-owned subsidiary of Communications, subject to certain exceptions (the “Comprehensive Guarantors”).

The second priority New Communications Notes and the guarantees thereof will be secured, subject to permitted liens and certain other exceptions, by a second priority lien on the Fixed Asset Collateral and by a third priority lien on the ABL Collateral. \n\n**_Alternative Offers_ **\n\n_ Alternative Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations _\n\nIf the Comprehensive Threshold is not achieved, subject to certain terms and conditions being satisfied (including the Initial Supporting Holders Participation Condition (as defined below)), we will consummate a series of transactions whereby, among other things, (i) we will effect certain corporate reorganizations resulting in (a) the entities that hold our Katz Media business, Ad Tech business and our FCC licenses being transferred to IH Media + Entertainment I LLC (“Entertainment I”) and then immediately thereafter by Entertainment I to IH Media + Entertainment II LLC (“Entertainment II”), each a newly-formed subsidiary of Communications that we will designate as an unrestricted subsidiary under the agreements governing the Existing Debt, and (b) the guarantees of the Existing Debt provided by the entities transferred to Entertainment I and the liens on the collateral provided by such entities to secure the Existing Debt being released concurrently therewith, and (ii) we will consummate the “Alternative Exchange Offers” and issue the New Alternative Notes (as defined below). \n\nThe Alternative Exchange Offers will be conditioned upon Eligible Holders holding (i) 76.8% of the aggregate principal amount of the Existing 2026 Secured Notes, (ii) 80.6% of the aggregate principal amount of the Existing 2027 Secured Notes, (iii) 38.1% of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Existing 2028 Secured Notes and (iv) 82.8% of the aggregate principal amount of the Existing Unsecured Notes tendering their Existing Notes in the Exchange Offers and providing consents in the Consent Solicitations, and holders of at least 92.3% of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of Existing Term Loans participating in the Term Loan Exchange and providing consents to the Term Loan Consent Solicitation (the “Initial Supporting Holders Participation Condition”).

The deadline for Eligible Holders to validly tender their Existing Notes and deliver Consents in order to receive the applicable Total Exchange Consideration (including the applicable Early Tender Premium) will be 5:00 p.m., New York City time on November 29, 2024 unless extended or earlier terminated by the Issuers in their sole discretion (the “Early Tender Deadline”). Eligible Holders who validly tender their Existing Notes and deliver Consents after the Early Tender Date and before the Expiration Time will only be eligible to receive the applicable Exchange Consideration (which does not include the Early Tender Premium). The Issuers will exchange any Existing Notes pursuant to the Exchange Offers that have been validly tendered at or prior to the Expiration Time and that are accepted for exchange, subject to all conditions to the Exchange Offers and the Consent Solicitations having been either satisfied or waived by the Issuers, as soon as practicable after the Expiration Time (the “Settlement Date”). The Exchange Offers and the Consent Solicitations are conditioned upon the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Offering Memorandum. Either the Comprehensive Exchange Offers will be consummated or the Alternative Exchange Offers will be consummated, but not both. \n\nEligible Holders of the Existing Notes who wish to participate in the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations must tender all their Existing Notes across each series in the Comprehensive Exchange Offers (and deliver consents in the related Comprehensive Consent Solicitations) and the Alternative Exchange Offers (and deliver consents in the related Alternative Consent Solicitations), and shall not be permitted to tender in only one or a subset of the foregoing. Eligible Holders of the Existing Notes who validly tender their Existing Notes in the Exchange Offers will be deemed to have tendered their Existing Notes in both the Comprehensive Exchange Offers and the Alternative Exchange Offers. In addition, such Eligible Holders will be deemed to have delivered consents for each Comprehensive Proposed Amendment and Alternative Proposed Amendment applicable to their Existing Notes. \n\nThere are no withdrawal or revocation rights in connection with any of the Exchange Offers. As a result, any tenders of Existing Notes and delivery of the related Consents will be final and irrevocable. Each Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation is a separate offer and/or solicitation, and each may be individually amended, extended, terminated or withdrawn, subject to certain conditions and applicable law, at any time in the Issuers’ sole discretion, and without amending, extending, terminating or withdrawing any other Exchange Offer or Consent Solicitation; _provided_ that the consummation of each Comprehensive Exchange Offer is conditioned upon consummation of all of the Comprehensive Exchange Offers and the applicable Term Loan Exchange, and the consummation of each Alternative Exchange Offer is conditioned upon consummation of all of the Alternative Exchange Offers and the applicable Term Loan Exchange. The Issuers reserve the right throughout the Exchange Offers to amend any of the terms of any Exchange Offers and/or Consent Solicitations, New Comprehensive Notes, and/or the New Alternative Notes, in their sole discretion without instituting withdrawal or revocation rights, regardless of the nature thereof. Any such amendment may be significant. \n\nNone of the Issuers, their advisors, the trustee of the Existing Notes, the trustee with respect to the New Comprehensive Notes or New Alternative Notes, as applicable, the Exchange Agent and Information Agent (each as defined below) or any affiliate of any of them, makes any recommendation as to whether Eligible Holders of Existing Notes should participate in the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations , and no one has been authorized by any of them to make such a recommendation. Eligible Holders of Existing Notes should read carefully the Offering Memorandum before making a decision to participate in the Exchange Offers and the Consent Solicitations. In addition, Eligible Holders of the Existing Notes must make their own decisions as to whether to tender their Existing Notes in the Exchange Offers and provide the consent in the related Consent Solicitation. \n\nThe Exchange Offers are being made, and the New Comprehensive Notes and New Alternative Notes are being offered and issued only to holders of Existing Notes that are either (i) persons who are reasonably believed to be “qualified institutional buyers” as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act or (ii) persons other than “U.S. persons” as defined in Regulation S who agree to purchase any New Notes outside of the United States and who are otherwise in compliance with the requirements of Regulation S. The Issuers are not making the Exchange Offers in any jurisdiction where the inclusion of any person in such jurisdiction would require the Issuers or any subsidiary of the Issuers to comply with registration requirements or other similar requirements under any securities laws of such jurisdiction. The holders of Existing Notes who have certified to us that they are eligible to participate in the Exchange Offers pursuant to at least one of the foregoing conditions are referred to as “Eligible Holders.” \n\nOnly Eligible Holders of Existing Notes may receive a copy of the Offering Memorandum and participate in the Exchange Offers and the Consent Solicitations. The Exchange and Information Agent is Kroll Issuer Services (US) (“Kroll” or the “Exchange Agent” and the “Information Agent”). Detailed instructions regarding how Eligible Holders of Existing Notes can tender Existing Notes and deliver consents with respect to the Consent Solicitations are set forth in the Offering Memorandum. Questions concerning the Exchange Offers or Consent Solicitations or requests for additional copies of the Offering Memorandum or other related documents may be directed to Kroll at iheart@is.kroll.com. Eligible Holders of the Existing Notes should also consult their broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other institution for assistance concerning the Exchange Offers and the Consent Solicitations. \n\nThis communication is for informational purposes only and does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy, any security and does not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale of any security in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful. \n\n**About the Term Loan Exchange and Term Loan Consent Solicitation**\n\nThe Term Loan Exchange and Term Loan Consent Solicitation will be conducted pursuant to a separate exchange offer open to the lenders under the Existing Term Loan Credit Agreement (the “Existing Lenders”). Any Existing Lender that participates in the Term Loan Exchange (a “Participating Lender”) will agree to exchange all of its Existing Term Loans in the Term Loan Exchange. If the Comprehensive Threshold is achieved, each Participating Lender will receive (i) a new class of first lien term loans issued by Communications in a principal amount up to 94.0% of its Existing Term Loans and (ii) cash in an amount up to 5.0% of its Existing Term Loans. If the Comprehensive Threshold is not achieved, each Participating Lender will receive (i) a new class of first lien term loans issued by Entertainment I in a principal amount up to 93.5% of its Existing Term Loans, (ii) a new class of first lien term loans issued by Communications in a principal amount up to 0.5% of its Existing Term Loans and (iii) cash in an amount up to 5.0% of its Existing Term Loans. The Term Loan Consent Solicitation will amend the Existing Term Loan Credit Agreement to, among other things, permit the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Support Agreement and to remove substantially all affirmative and negative covenants and mandatory prepayments and certain events of default under the Existing Term Loan Credit Agreement. \n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\n_Certain statements herein constitute “forward-looking statements”.

We have flattened our organization, eliminated redundancies and broken down silos, which will have a major impact on costs, expected to generate $200 million of annual savings in 2025 compared to 2024, and benefiting full year 2025 Adjusted EBITDA by $150 million on a year over year basis.” \n\n“We’re happy to announce that we have entered into a Transaction Support Agreement with a group of debt holders representing, on an aggregate basis, approximately 80% of the Company’s outstanding debt to support an exchange of approximately $4.1 billion of debt for new notes and term loans,” said Rich Bressler, iHeartMedia’s President, COO and CFO. “The exchange offers will extend maturities by three years; keep consolidated annual cash interest essentially flat; and provide debt reduction – all of which will strengthen the Company’s financial flexibility, and provide us with the runway to accelerate our strategic growth initiatives. This marks a significant step in iHeart’s strategy of disciplined balance sheet and capital structure management.” \n\n** Consolidated Results of Operations **\n\n** Third Quarter 2024 Consolidated Results **\n\nOur consolidated revenue increased $55.1 million, or 5.8%, during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 primarily due to increases in Digital Audio Group revenue and political revenue as 2024 is a presidential election year. Digital Audio revenue increased $33.8 million, or 12.7%, driven primarily by continuing increases in demand for digital advertising. Multiplatform revenue decreased $6.8 million, or 1.1%, primarily resulting from a decrease in broadcast advertising in connection with continued uncertain market conditions, partially offset by increases in political revenues and non-cash trade revenues. Audio & Media Services revenue increased $28.1 million, or 45.3%, primarily as a result of higher political revenue and an increase in digital revenue. \n\nConsolidated direct operating expenses increased $29.7 million, or 7.8%, during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. The increase was primarily driven by higher variable content costs, including higher third-party digital costs and podcast profit sharing expenses related to the increase in digital revenues. \n\nConsolidated Selling, General & Administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses increased $25.2 million, or 6.4%, during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. The increase was driven primarily by higher non-cash trade expense related to the 2024 Summer Olympics and the 2024 iHeartRadio Music Festival and an increase in costs incurred in connection with executing on our cost savings initiatives. \n\nOur consolidated GAAP Operating income was $76.7 million compared to $69.0 million in the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to the increase in consolidated revenues, partially offset by the increase in direct operating and SG&A expenses as discussed above. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA increased to $204.6 million compared to $203.8 million in the prior-year period. \n\nCash provided by operating activities was $102.8 million, compared to $96.2 million in the prior year period primarily due to the increase in political revenues, largely offset by a decrease in broadcast revenue. Free Cash Flow was $73.3 million, compared to $67.7 million in the prior year period. \n\n** Business Segments: Results of Operations **\n\n** Third Quarter 2024 Multiplatform Group Results **\n\n_(In thousands)_ |  **Three Months Ended** **September 30,** |  **%** |  **Nine Months Ended** **September 30,** |  **%**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **Change** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **Change**  \nRevenue  |  $  |  619,544  |  $  |  626,383  |  (1.1  |  )%  |  $  |  1,688,914  |  $  |  1,751,340  |  (3.6  |  )%   \nOperating expenses 1 |  489,672  |  463,939  |  5.5  |  %  |  1,377,597  |  1,339,441  |  2.8  |  %   \nSegment Adjusted EBITDA  |  $  |  129,872  |  $  |  162,444  |  (20.1  |  )%  |  $  |  311,317  |  $  |  411,899  |  (24.4  |  )%   \n_Segment Adjusted EBITDA margin_ |  _21.0_ |  _%_ |  _25.9_ |  _%_ |  _18.4_ |  _%_ |  _23.5_ |  _%_  \n1 Operating expenses consist of Direct operating expenses and SG&A expenses, excluding Restructuring expenses.   \n  \nRevenue from our Multiplatform Group decreased $6.8 million, or 1.1% YoY, primarily due to a decrease in broadcast advertising in connection with continued uncertain market conditions, partially offset by an increase in political revenues and non-cash trade revenue.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as consolidated Operating income (loss) adjusted to exclude restructuring expenses included within Direct operating expenses and SG&A expenses, and share-based compensation expenses included within SG&A expenses, as well as the following line items presented in our Statements of Operations: Depreciation and amortization, Impairment charges, and Other operating expense. Alternatively, Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as Net loss, adjusted to exclude Income tax (benefit) expense, Interest expense, net, Depreciation and amortization, (Gain) loss on investments, net, Gain on extinguishment of debt, Other (income) expense, net, Equity in loss of nonconsolidated affiliates, Impairment charges, Other operating expense, Share-based compensation expense, and restructuring expenses. Restructuring expenses primarily include expenses incurred in connection with cost-saving initiatives, as well as certain expenses, which, in the view of management, are outside the ordinary course of business or otherwise not representative of the Company's operations during a normal business cycle. Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Revenue. \n\nThe Company uses Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, among other measures, to evaluate the Company’s operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is among the primary measures used by management for the planning and forecasting of future periods, as well as for measuring performance for compensation of executives and other members of management. We believe this measure is an important indicator of the Company’s operational strength and performance of its business because it provides a link between operational performance and operating income. It is also a primary measure used by management in evaluating companies as potential acquisition targets. \n\nThe Company believes the presentation of these measures is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by the Company’s management. The Company believes it helps improve investors’ ability to understand the Company’s operating performance and makes it easier to compare the Company’s results with other companies that have different capital structures or tax rates. In addition, the Company believes this measure is also among the primary measures used externally by the Company’s investors, analysts and peers in its industry for purposes of valuation and comparing the operating performance of the Company to other companies in its industry. \n\nSince Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, it should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, Operating income (loss) as an indicator of operating performance and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily a measure of the Company’s ability to fund its cash needs. As it excludes certain financial information compared with Operating income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, users of this financial information should consider the types of events and transactions which are excluded. \n\nWe define Free Cash Flow as Cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, which is disclosed as Purchases of property, plant and equipment in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We use Free Cash Flow, among other measures, to evaluate the Company’s liquidity and its ability to generate cash flow. We believe that Free Cash Flow is meaningful to investors because it provides them with a view of the Company's liquidity after deducting capital expenditures, which are considered to be a necessary component of ongoing operations. In addition, we believe that Free Cash Flow helps improve investors' ability to compare our liquidity with that of other companies. \n\nSince Free Cash Flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, it should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, Cash provided by operating activities and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. Free Cash Flow is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs. \n\nThe Company presents revenue, excluding the effects of political revenue. Due to the cyclical nature of the electoral system and the seasonality of the related political revenue, management believes presenting revenue, excluding the effects of political revenue, provides additional information to investors about the Company’s revenue growth from period to period. \n\nWe define Net Debt as Total Debt less Cash and cash equivalents. We define net leverage as Net Debt divided by Adjusted EBITDA. The Company uses net leverage and Net Debt to evaluate the Company's liquidity. We believe these measures are an important indicator of the Company's ability to service its long-term debt obligations. \n\nSince these non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as an indicator of operating performance or liquidity. \n\nAs required by the SEC rules, the Company provides reconciliations below to the most directly comparable measures reported under GAAP, including (i) Adjusted EBITDA to Operating income (loss), (ii) Adjusted EBITDA to Net loss, (iii) Free Cash Flow to Cash provided by operating activities, (iv) revenue, excluding political advertising revenue, to revenue, and (v) Net Debt to Total Debt. \n\nWe have provided forecasted Consolidated Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA guidance for the quarter ending December 31, 2024 and the full year 2024 and 2025, which reflects targets for Adjusted EBITDA and net debt. Our Earnings Call on November 7, 2024 may present additional guidance that includes Adjusted EBITDA. A full reconciliation of the forecasted Adjusted EBITDA, net debt and net leverage on a non-GAAP basis to the respective most-directly comparable GAAP metrics cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying with reasonable accuracy significant items required for the reconciliations, including gains or losses on investments, extinguishment of debt, equity in nonconsolidated affiliates, impairment charges, stock based compensation, and restructuring as well as the Company's cash and cash equivalent balance. \n\n**Reconciliation of Operating income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA**\n\n_(In thousands)_ |  **Three Months Ended** **September 30,** |  **Nine Months Ended** **September 30,** |  **Three Months Ended June 30,**  \n---|---|---|---  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **2024**  \nOperating income (loss)  |  $  |  76,720  |  $  |  68,965  |  $  |  (867,655  |  )  |  $  |  (877,091  |  )  |  $  |  (909,667  |  )   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  101,331  |  106,451  |  310,849  |  323,028  |  104,356   \nImpairment charges  |  412  |  570  |  922,144  |  965,087  |  920,224   \nOther operating income, net  |  1,092  |  3,378  |  2,180  |  3,338  |  516   \nRestructuring expenses  |  16,767  |  16,227  |  67,928  |  46,469  |  27,558   \nShare-based compensation expense  |  8,263  |  8,191  |  23,963  |  27,555  |  7,220   \nAdjusted EBITDA  |  $  |  204,585  |  $  |  203,782  |  $  |  459,409  |  $  |  488,386  |  $  |  150,207   \n  \n**Reconciliation of Net loss** **to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA**\n\n_(In thousands)_ |  **Three Months Ended** **September 30,** |  **Nine Months Ended** **September 30,** |  **Three Months Ended June 30,**  \n---|---|---|---  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **2024**  \nNet loss  |  $  |  (41,325  |  )  |  $  |  (8,969  |  )  |  $  |  (1,041,422  |  )  |  $  |  (1,114,314  |  )  |  $  |  (981,989  |  )   \nIncome tax (benefit) expense  |  20,835  |  (9,261  |  )  |  (23,786  |  )  |  (29,513  |  )  |  (23,959  |  )   \nInterest expense, net  |  95,715  |  99,509  |  286,807  |  293,659  |  95,577   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  101,331  |  106,451  |  310,849  |  323,028  |  104,356   \nEBITDA  |  $  |  176,556  |  $  |  187,730  |  $  |  (467,552  |  )  |  $  |  (527,140  |  )  |  $  |  (806,015  |  )   \n(Gain) loss on investments, net  |  103  |  7,381  |  (91,479  |  )  |  19,924  |  412   \nGain on extinguishment of debt  |  —  |  (23,947  |  )  |  —  |  (51,474  |  )  |  —   \nOther (income) expense, net  |  (1,195  |  )  |  738  |  (468  |  )  |  1,109  |  231   \nEquity in loss of nonconsolidated affiliates  |  2,587  |  3,514  |  2,693  |  3,518  |  61   \nImpairment charges  |  412  |  570  |  922,144  |  965,087  |  920,224   \nOther operating income, net  |  1,092  |  3,378  |  2,180  |  3,338  |  516   \nRestructuring expenses  |  16,767  |  16,227  |  67,928  |  46,469  |  27,558   \nShare-based compensation expense  |  8,263  |  8,191  |  23,963  |  27,555  |  7,220   \nAdjusted EBITDA  |  $  |  204,585  |  $  |  203,782  |  $  |  459,409  |  $  |  488,386  |  $  |  150,207   \n  \n**Reconciliation of Cash provided by operating activities to Free Cash Flow**\n\n_(In thousands)_ |  **Three Months Ended** **September 30,** |  **Nine Months Ended** **September 30,**  \n---|---|---  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nCash provided by operating activities  |  $  |  102,765  |  $  |  96,169  |  $  |  70,217  |  $  |  58,958   \nPurchases of property, plant and equipment  |  (29,420  |  )  |  (28,518  |  )  |  (72,174  |  )  |  (90,456  |  )   \nFree cash flow  |  $  |  73,345  |  $  |  67,651  |  $  |  (1,957  |  )  |  $  |  (31,498  |  )   \nNet proceeds from real estate sales 1 |  210  |  —  |  210  |  4,629   \nFree cash flow including net proceeds from real estate sales  |  $  |  73,555  |  $  |  67,651  |  $  |  (1,747  |  )  |  $  |  (26,869  |  )   \n(1) We deployed significant capital expenditures to accelerate the proactive streamlining of our real estate footprint.

(NASDAQ: IHRT) (“iHeartMedia” or the “Company”) today announced that it and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively with the Company, the “iHeartMedia Parties”) have entered into a Transaction Support Agreement (the “TSA”) with certain lenders and holders (or their managers, advisors or sub-advisors) (collectively, the “Initial Supporting Holders”) of iHeartCommunications, Inc.’s (“iHeartCommunications”) outstanding notes and term loans. The Initial Supporting Holders represent approximately 80% of the aggregate principal amount of the Existing Debt (as defined below), including approximately 77% of the aggregate principal amount of iHeartCommunications’ outstanding senior secured notes due 2026, 79% of the aggregate principal amount of its outstanding senior secured notes due 2027, 38% of the aggregate principal amount of its outstanding senior secured notes due 2028, 71% of the aggregate principal amount of its outstanding senior unsecured notes due 2027, and 92% of the aggregate principal amount of its outstanding term loans (all such notes and term loans outstanding collectively, the “Existing Debt”). \n\nThe iHeartMedia Parties and the Initial Supporting Holders have agreed to the terms of, and to support, (i) exchange offer transactions that will be offered to all holders of the Existing Debt, consisting of two alternative exchange transaction structures, each of which will extend the maturity of the Existing Debt tendered in the exchange offer transactions by three years, and (ii) concurrent consent solicitations to amend certain provisions in the indentures and credit agreement governing the Existing Debt. In the first transaction structure, if certain thresholds of holder participation are met, iHeartCommunications will issue new secured debt in exchange for the Existing Debt held by participating holders. Alternatively, if certain thresholds of holder participation are not met, newly-formed subsidiaries of the Company holding certain transferred assets and an intercompany note (to be issued by iHeartMedia + Entertainment, Inc.) will issue new secured debt in exchange for the Existing Debt held by participating holders. Completion of either exchange transaction will result in a strengthened financial position, providing iHeartMedia with additional flexibility to execute on its strategy and business initiatives. \n\nConcurrently with entry into the TSA, the Company also entered into an amendment to its ABL facility (the “ABL Amendment”) to, among other things, permit both exchange transaction alternatives and other transactions related to the exchange, amend certain covenants and provisions and increase the interest rate. The amendments contained in the ABL Amendment will become effective upon the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, including the consummation of one of the transactions contemplated by the TSA. \n\niHeartMedia expects to commence the exchange offer in the near term. \n\nThe Company today filed a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which contains further details regarding the terms of the TSA and the related transactions and a copy of the ABL Amendment. The foregoing descriptions of the TSA and the ABL Amendment do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the TSA and the ABL Amendment. \n\nSimpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP served as counsel and PJT Partners served as financial advisor to the Company. Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP served as counsel and Perella Weinberg Partners served as financial advisor to an ad hoc group of certain of the Initial Supporting Holders. \n\nThis press release is not intended to be, and does not constitute, an offer to sell, buy or subscribe for any securities or otherwise, nor shall there be any sale, issuance or transfer of securities in any jurisdiction in contravention of applicable law.

We have flattened our organization, eliminated redundancies and broken down silos, which will have a major impact on costs, expected to generate $200 million of annual savings in 2025 compared to 2024, and benefiting full year 2025 Adjusted EBITDA by $150 million on a year over year basis.” \n\n“We’re happy to announce that we have entered into a Transaction Support Agreement with a group of debt holders representing, on an aggregate basis, approximately 80% of the Company’s outstanding debt to support an exchange of approximately $4.1 billion of debt for new notes and term loans,” said Rich Bressler, iHeartMedia’s President, COO and CFO. “The exchange offers will extend maturities by three years; keep consolidated annual cash interest essentially flat; and provide debt reduction – all of which will strengthen the Company’s financial flexibility, and provide us with the runway to accelerate our strategic growth initiatives. This marks a significant step in iHeart’s strategy of disciplined balance sheet and capital structure management.” \n\n** Consolidated Results of Operations **\n\n** Third Quarter 2024 Consolidated Results **\n\nOur consolidated revenue increased $55.1 million, or 5.8%, during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 primarily due to increases in Digital Audio Group revenue and political revenue as 2024 is a presidential election year. Digital Audio revenue increased $33.8 million, or 12.7%, driven primarily by continuing increases in demand for digital advertising. Multiplatform revenue decreased $6.8 million, or 1.1%, primarily resulting from a decrease in broadcast advertising in connection with continued uncertain market conditions, partially offset by increases in political revenues and non-cash trade revenues. Audio & Media Services revenue increased $28.1 million, or 45.3%, primarily as a result of higher political revenue and an increase in digital revenue. \n\nConsolidated direct operating expenses increased $29.7 million, or 7.8%, during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. The increase was primarily driven by higher variable content costs, including higher third-party digital costs and podcast profit sharing expenses related to the increase in digital revenues. \n\nConsolidated Selling, General & Administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses increased $25.2 million, or 6.4%, during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. The increase was driven primarily by higher non-cash trade expense related to the 2024 Summer Olympics and the 2024 iHeartRadio Music Festival and an increase in costs incurred in connection with executing on our cost savings initiatives. \n\nOur consolidated GAAP Operating income was $76.7 million compared to $69.0 million in the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to the increase in consolidated revenues, partially offset by the increase in direct operating and SG&A expenses as discussed above. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA increased to $204.6 million compared to $203.8 million in the prior-year period. \n\nCash provided by operating activities was $102.8 million, compared to $96.2 million in the prior year period primarily due to the increase in political revenues, largely offset by a decrease in broadcast revenue. Free Cash Flow was $73.3 million, compared to $67.7 million in the prior year period. \n\n** Business Segments: Results of Operations **\n\n** Third Quarter 2024 Multiplatform Group Results **\n\n_(In thousands)_ |  **Three Months Ended** **September 30,** |  **%** |  **Nine Months Ended** **September 30,** |  **%**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **Change** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **Change**  \nRevenue  |  $  |  619,544  |  $  |  626,383  |  (1.1  |  )%  |  $  |  1,688,914  |  $  |  1,751,340  |  (3.6  |  )%   \nOperating expenses 1 |  489,672  |  463,939  |  5.5  |  %  |  1,377,597  |  1,339,441  |  2.8  |  %   \nSegment Adjusted EBITDA  |  $  |  129,872  |  $  |  162,444  |  (20.1  |  )%  |  $  |  311,317  |  $  |  411,899  |  (24.4  |  )%   \n_Segment Adjusted EBITDA margin_ |  _21.0_ |  _%_ |  _25.9_ |  _%_ |  _18.4_ |  _%_ |  _23.5_ |  _%_  \n1 Operating expenses consist of Direct operating expenses and SG&A expenses, excluding Restructuring expenses.   \n  \nRevenue from our Multiplatform Group decreased $6.8 million, or 1.1% YoY, primarily due to a decrease in broadcast advertising in connection with continued uncertain market conditions, partially offset by an increase in political revenues and non-cash trade revenue.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as consolidated Operating income (loss) adjusted to exclude restructuring expenses included within Direct operating expenses and SG&A expenses, and share-based compensation expenses included within SG&A expenses, as well as the following line items presented in our Statements of Operations: Depreciation and amortization, Impairment charges, and Other operating expense. Alternatively, Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as Net loss, adjusted to exclude Income tax (benefit) expense, Interest expense, net, Depreciation and amortization, (Gain) loss on investments, net, Gain on extinguishment of debt, Other (income) expense, net, Equity in loss of nonconsolidated affiliates, Impairment charges, Other operating expense, Share-based compensation expense, and restructuring expenses. Restructuring expenses primarily include expenses incurred in connection with cost-saving initiatives, as well as certain expenses, which, in the view of management, are outside the ordinary course of business or otherwise not representative of the Company's operations during a normal business cycle. Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Revenue. \n\nThe Company uses Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, among other measures, to evaluate the Company’s operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is among the primary measures used by management for the planning and forecasting of future periods, as well as for measuring performance for compensation of executives and other members of management. We believe this measure is an important indicator of the Company’s operational strength and performance of its business because it provides a link between operational performance and operating income. It is also a primary measure used by management in evaluating companies as potential acquisition targets. \n\nThe Company believes the presentation of these measures is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by the Company’s management. The Company believes it helps improve investors’ ability to understand the Company’s operating performance and makes it easier to compare the Company’s results with other companies that have different capital structures or tax rates. In addition, the Company believes this measure is also among the primary measures used externally by the Company’s investors, analysts and peers in its industry for purposes of valuation and comparing the operating performance of the Company to other companies in its industry. \n\nSince Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, it should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, Operating income (loss) as an indicator of operating performance and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily a measure of the Company’s ability to fund its cash needs. As it excludes certain financial information compared with Operating income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, users of this financial information should consider the types of events and transactions which are excluded. \n\nWe define Free Cash Flow as Cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, which is disclosed as Purchases of property, plant and equipment in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We use Free Cash Flow, among other measures, to evaluate the Company’s liquidity and its ability to generate cash flow. We believe that Free Cash Flow is meaningful to investors because it provides them with a view of the Company's liquidity after deducting capital expenditures, which are considered to be a necessary component of ongoing operations. In addition, we believe that Free Cash Flow helps improve investors' ability to compare our liquidity with that of other companies. \n\nSince Free Cash Flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, it should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, Cash provided by operating activities and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. Free Cash Flow is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs. \n\nThe Company presents revenue, excluding the effects of political revenue. Due to the cyclical nature of the electoral system and the seasonality of the related political revenue, management believes presenting revenue, excluding the effects of political revenue, provides additional information to investors about the Company’s revenue growth from period to period. \n\nWe define Net Debt as Total Debt less Cash and cash equivalents. We define net leverage as Net Debt divided by Adjusted EBITDA. The Company uses net leverage and Net Debt to evaluate the Company's liquidity. We believe these measures are an important indicator of the Company's ability to service its long-term debt obligations. \n\nSince these non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as an indicator of operating performance or liquidity. \n\nAs required by the SEC rules, the Company provides reconciliations below to the most directly comparable measures reported under GAAP, including (i) Adjusted EBITDA to Operating income (loss), (ii) Adjusted EBITDA to Net loss, (iii) Free Cash Flow to Cash provided by operating activities, (iv) revenue, excluding political advertising revenue, to revenue, and (v) Net Debt to Total Debt. \n\nWe have provided forecasted Consolidated Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA guidance for the quarter ending December 31, 2024 and the full year 2024 and 2025, which reflects targets for Adjusted EBITDA and net debt. Our Earnings Call on November 7, 2024 may present additional guidance that includes Adjusted EBITDA. A full reconciliation of the forecasted Adjusted EBITDA, net debt and net leverage on a non-GAAP basis to the respective most-directly comparable GAAP metrics cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying with reasonable accuracy significant items required for the reconciliations, including gains or losses on investments, extinguishment of debt, equity in nonconsolidated affiliates, impairment charges, stock based compensation, and restructuring as well as the Company's cash and cash equivalent balance. \n\n**Reconciliation of Operating income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA**\n\n_(In thousands)_ |  **Three Months Ended** **September 30,** |  **Nine Months Ended** **September 30,** |  **Three Months Ended June 30,**  \n---|---|---|---  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **2024**  \nOperating income (loss)  |  $  |  76,720  |  $  |  68,965  |  $  |  (867,655  |  )  |  $  |  (877,091  |  )  |  $  |  (909,667  |  )   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  101,331  |  106,451  |  310,849  |  323,028  |  104,356   \nImpairment charges  |  412  |  570  |  922,144  |  965,087  |  920,224   \nOther operating income, net  |  1,092  |  3,378  |  2,180  |  3,338  |  516   \nRestructuring expenses  |  16,767  |  16,227  |  67,928  |  46,469  |  27,558   \nShare-based compensation expense  |  8,263  |  8,191  |  23,963  |  27,555  |  7,220   \nAdjusted EBITDA  |  $  |  204,585  |  $  |  203,782  |  $  |  459,409  |  $  |  488,386  |  $  |  150,207   \n  \n**Reconciliation of Net loss** **to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA**\n\n_(In thousands)_ |  **Three Months Ended** **September 30,** |  **Nine Months Ended** **September 30,** |  **Three Months Ended June 30,**  \n---|---|---|---  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **2024**  \nNet loss  |  $  |  (41,325  |  )  |  $  |  (8,969  |  )  |  $  |  (1,041,422  |  )  |  $  |  (1,114,314  |  )  |  $  |  (981,989  |  )   \nIncome tax (benefit) expense  |  20,835  |  (9,261  |  )  |  (23,786  |  )  |  (29,513  |  )  |  (23,959  |  )   \nInterest expense, net  |  95,715  |  99,509  |  286,807  |  293,659  |  95,577   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  101,331  |  106,451  |  310,849  |  323,028  |  104,356   \nEBITDA  |  $  |  176,556  |  $  |  187,730  |  $  |  (467,552  |  )  |  $  |  (527,140  |  )  |  $  |  (806,015  |  )   \n(Gain) loss on investments, net  |  103  |  7,381  |  (91,479  |  )  |  19,924  |  412   \nGain on extinguishment of debt  |  —  |  (23,947  |  )  |  —  |  (51,474  |  )  |  —   \nOther (income) expense, net  |  (1,195  |  )  |  738  |  (468  |  )  |  1,109  |  231   \nEquity in loss of nonconsolidated affiliates  |  2,587  |  3,514  |  2,693  |  3,518  |  61   \nImpairment charges  |  412  |  570  |  922,144  |  965,087  |  920,224   \nOther operating income, net  |  1,092  |  3,378  |  2,180  |  3,338  |  516   \nRestructuring expenses  |  16,767  |  16,227  |  67,928  |  46,469  |  27,558   \nShare-based compensation expense  |  8,263  |  8,191  |  23,963  |  27,555  |  7,220   \nAdjusted EBITDA  |  $  |  204,585  |  $  |  203,782  |  $  |  459,409  |  $  |  488,386  |  $  |  150,207   \n  \n**Reconciliation of Cash provided by operating activities to Free Cash Flow**\n\n_(In thousands)_ |  **Three Months Ended** **September 30,** |  **Nine Months Ended** **September 30,**  \n---|---|---  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nCash provided by operating activities  |  $  |  102,765  |  $  |  96,169  |  $  |  70,217  |  $  |  58,958   \nPurchases of property, plant and equipment  |  (29,420  |  )  |  (28,518  |  )  |  (72,174  |  )  |  (90,456  |  )   \nFree cash flow  |  $  |  73,345  |  $  |  67,651  |  $  |  (1,957  |  )  |  $  |  (31,498  |  )   \nNet proceeds from real estate sales 1 |  210  |  —  |  210  |  4,629   \nFree cash flow including net proceeds from real estate sales  |  $  |  73,555  |  $  |  67,651  |  $  |  (1,747  |  )  |  $  |  (26,869  |  )   \n(1) We deployed significant capital expenditures to accelerate the proactive streamlining of our real estate footprint.
