(Nasdaq: CARA) today announced that it has engaged Piper Sandler & Co. to act as its financial advisor for the process of exploring and reviewing strategic alternatives.\n\n“We are committed to evaluating a range of strategic options to maximize value for our shareholders,” said Christopher Posner, President and Chief Executive Officer of Cara Therapeutics. “As part of this effort, our Board of Directors has approved a streamlined operating plan focused on cost-containment and cash conservation.”\n\nThere can be no assurance that the exploration of strategic alternatives will result in any agreements or transactions, or as to the timing of any such agreements or transactions.

(Nasdaq: CARA), a development-stage biopharmaceutical company leading a new treatment paradigm to improve the lives of patients suffering from pruritus, today announced the outcome from the dose-finding Part A of the KOURAGE-1 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of oral difelikefalin for moderate-to-severe pruritus in adult patients with notalgia paresthetica (NP). Oral difelikefalin did not demonstrate a meaningful clinical benefit at any dose compared to placebo, resulting in the Company’s decision to discontinue the clinical program in NP.\n\n“Given our strong proof-of-concept results in NP and the significant unmet need in this sensory neuropathy, we are disappointed that oral difelikefalin did not demonstrate a meaningful improvement in pruritus compared to placebo in the KOURAGE-1 Part A study,” said Christopher Posner, President and Chief Executive Officer of Cara Therapeutics. “We are grateful for the patients and investigators who participated in this study. We will be winding down the Phase 2/3 clinical program in NP and exploring strategic alternatives focused on maximizing shareholder value.”\n\nKOURAGE-1 Part A was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to inform the dose and sample size for the pivotal portions of the Phase 2/3 clinical program. In Part A, 214 patients were randomized to one of four arms: oral difelikefalin 2 mg twice a day (BID), 1 mg BID, 0.25 mg BID or placebo BID for 8 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving a ≥4-point improvement from baseline in the weekly mean of the daily 24-hour Itch-Numeric Rating Scale (I-NRS) score at Week 8.\n\nOral difelikefalin did not demonstrate a meaningful clinical benefit at any dose compared to placebo. The drug was generally well tolerated with a safety profile similar to prior trials.\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, the Company had approximately $70 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.\n\n**About Cara Therapeutics**\n\nCara Therapeutics is a development-stage biopharmaceutical company leading a new treatment paradigm to improve the lives of patients suffering from pruritus.
