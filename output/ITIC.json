Lewter\nNovember 5, 2024\nTelephone: (919) 968-2200\nNasdaq Symbol: ITIC\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:\nChapel Hill, NC – Investors Title Company (Nasdaq: ITIC) today announced results for the third\nquarter ended September 30, 2024. The Company reported net income of $9.3 million, or $4.92 per\ndiluted share, compared with $7.1 million, or $3.75 per diluted share, for the prior year period.\nRevenues increased 12.1% to $68.8 million, compared to $61.4 million in the prior year period,\nprimarily due to an increase in net premiums written and a positive change in net investment gains\n(losses). Net premiums written increased primarily due to expansion efforts in our Texas and Florida\nmarkets, in addition to appreciation in average home prices and higher activity levels related to lower\naverage mortgage interest rates. The improvement in net investment gains (losses) was due to the impact\nof positive changes in the estimated fair value of equity security investments during the current year\nquarter.\nOperating expenses increased 8.4% to $57.2 million, compared to $52.8 million in the prior year\nperiod. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to higher agent commissions,\ncommensurate with the increase in agent premium volume, partially offset by a decrease in personnel\nexpenses resulting from lower staffing levels. Other categories of operating expenses were in line with the\nprior year period.\nIncome before income taxes increased to $11.6 million for the current year quarter, versus $8.6\nmillion in the prior year period. Excluding the impact of net investment gains (losses), adjusted income\nbefore income taxes (non-GAAP) increased to $10.6 million for the current year quarter, versus $9.4\nmillion in the prior year period (see Appendix A for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the\nmost directly comparable GAAP measure).\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net income increased $6.9 million to $22.7\nmillion, or $12.02 per diluted share, versus $15.9 million, or $8.37 per diluted share, for the prior year\nperiod. Revenues increased 9.7% to $187.7 million, compared with $171.1 million for the prior year\nperiod. Operating expenses increased 5.3% to $159.0 million, compared to $151.1 million for the prior\nyear period. Overall results for the year-to-date period have been shaped predominantly by the same\nfactors that affected the third quarter.\nChairman J. Allen Fine commented, \"We were pleased to see an increase in revenues and net\nincome for the third quarter, driven mostly by higher volume, particularly in agent-focused markets.\nExpenses were up in total due to higher commissions resulting from an increase in volume, but overhead\ncosts were down from the prior year period due to cost-saving measures.\n\"Market conditions remain challenging for the industry and transaction volumes remain materially\nbelow levels seen in the years immediately following the COVID pandemic. However, activity seems to\nhave generally stabilized, and third quarter volumes were higher than the second quarter of the year.\n\"Interest rates declined over the course of the quarter as the Fed began easing monetary policy,\nalthough some of the improvement was offset by the subsequent release of surprisingly strong economic\ndata. Regardless of market conditions, we will continue to focus on achieving our strategic goals and\nimproving our competitive positioning.\"\nInvestors Title Company’s subsidiaries issue and underwrite title insurance policies. The\nCompany also provides investment management services and services in connection with tax-deferred\nexchanges of like-kind property.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements contained herein constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities\nLitigation Reform Act of 1995.

This includes adjusting revenues\nto remove the impact of net investment gains and losses, which are recognized in net income under GAAP. Net investment\ngains and losses include realized gains and losses on sales of investment securities and changes in the estimated fair value of\nequity security investments. Management believes that these measures are useful to evaluate the Company's internal\noperational performance from period to period because they eliminate the effects of external market fluctuations. The\nCompany also believes users of the financial results would benefit from having access to such information, and that certain of\nthe Company’s peers make available similar information. This information should not be used as a substitute for, or considered\nsuperior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from similarly titled\nnon-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\nThe following tables reconcile non-GAAP financial measurements used by Company management to the comparable\nmeasurements using GAAP:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenues\nTotal revenues (GAAP) $ 68,829 $ 61,410 $ 187,670 $ 171,067\n(Subtract) Add: Net investment (gains) losses (976) 815 (4,640) (720)\nAdjusted revenues (non-GAAP) $ 67,853 $ 62,225 $ 183,030 $ 170,347\nIncome before Income Taxes\nIncome before income taxes (GAAP) $ 11,588 $ 8,610 $ 28,652 $ 20,017\n(Subtract) Add: Net investment (gains) losses (976) 815 (4,640) (720)\nAdjusted income before income taxes (non-GAAP) $ 10,612 $ 9,425 $ 24,012 $ 19,297"

          "content": "April 12, 2024\nTo Our Fellow Shareholders:\nIn a challenging year for the real estate market, we focused on proactive steps to strengthen our company and\nwere able to report relatively favorable financial performance. Market conditions remained daunting as interest\nrates rose to 20-year highs and the supply of available homes for sale remained low. These factors combined\nto push transaction volumes to lows not seen since the mid-1990s and were the primary reasons for the\ndecline in our revenue. Despite these market-related headwinds, our company achieved an 11.7% pre-tax\nprofit margin, made targeted investments to expand our geographic footprint, and leveraged technology to\nstrengthen our competitive position.\nThe demand spurred during the COVID-19 era by shifts to remote work combined with the low inventory of\nhomes for sale to drive real estate values to new highs. As the pandemic subsided, the Federal Reserve raised\ninterest rates to curb inflation. The elevated cost to obtain mortgage financing and higher home prices\ncombined to erode affordability. Additionally, many potential sellers have been reluctant to forgo low interest\nrates on their current mortgages. The net result was that mortgage originations declined last year to the lowest\nannual level in two decades, which, in turn, pushed title insurance transaction volume down.\nThe Company’s total title insurance premiums declined 31.2% in 2023 but compared favorably to industry\ndeclines, generally due to the relative health of our core markets and the growth experienced from our recent\nexpansion into markets such as Florida. This, combined with disciplined expense management, helped soften\nthe impact of premium declines on earnings. In addition to the expenses that typically decline commensurate\nwith volume, such as agent commissions, we implemented targeted reductions in almost all expense\ncategories, including personnel-related costs, especially in geographic areas most affected by the market\nslowdown.\nOther factors that helped mitigate premium declines included higher investment earnings and growth in\nrevenue from non-title services such as like-kind exchange business. For the first time in many years, we were\nable to invest our investment portfolio at interest rates more in line with historical averages. Interest and\ndividend income increased 92.5% over the previous year. Higher interest-rate levels also favorably impacted\nrevenue in our like-kind exchange subsidiary. Other non-title services, such as the wealth-management\nsolutions offered by our Investors Trust Company subsidiary, which celebrates 20 years of operations in 2024,\nalso performed well and contributed positively to revenues.\nClaims expense increased 12% but, in general, remained in line with the trend of recent years. Title claims\noften experience an uptick with downturns in the real estate business cycle, but we have not observed a\nnoticeable increase in this market. As in any year, we continue to maintain a robust program of proactive risk\nmitigation that includes education for both internal and external audiences designed to raise awareness of\npotential problems.\nDisciplined loss prevention and expense management go hand in hand with maximizing internal efficiencies\nand delivering solutions that save time for business partners. In 2023, we continued to invest significantly in\ntechnology initiatives that simplify internal procedures, promote productivity, and meet the complex and\nevolving needs of diverse customer segments. We implemented new accounting, contract management, and\nhuman resources systems. We also launched an improved title insurance rate calculator, refreshed websites\nwith new features such as mobile-device responsiveness, and enhanced our existing or introduced new\ncustomer-facing production and payment solutions. These investments optimize operations, strengthen\nexisting relationships, and demonstrate our attractive value proposition to new customers, all of which\nreinforces our strong financial position and ability to return value to shareholders.\n(Continued on page 2)\nPage 1 of 2\nContinued from page 1\nFor the seventh consecutive year, the board of directors declared a special dividend, which reflects our strong\nrelative operational performance and balance sheet. This financial strength provides flexibility to continue to\ninvest in our Company despite the occasional downturn in the real estate market. Our ongoing investments\nhelp support growth, strengthen our competitive position, and maintain the financial stability required to ensure\npolicyholder protection. Our superior financial stability continues to be affirmed by rating agencies, such as\nAM Best, as being among the highest in the industry.\nLooking ahead, we see signs that support an optimistic economic outlook: The economy has avoided slipping\ninto recession thus far, employment remains strong, and the Fed has paused rate hikes. Knowing the exact\ntiming of a future turn in the real estate market is impossible, but we are confident the discipline that has\nhelped us navigate market cycles in the past will help us persevere through this one and be fully prepared to\nmaximize opportunities at the onset of the next upturn. Conservative operating and investment principles,\nstrategic and mutually beneficial relationships with partners, and dedication to outstanding service will continue\nto differentiate us.\nWe are grateful to our talented and passionate employees for their commitment to the foundational values that\nhave propelled our company forward since its inception in 1972, our partners for their loyal support and their\ncontribution to our mutual success, and you, our fellow shareholders, for your confidence in us and the\nCompany’s continued prosperity.\nInvestors Title Company | 121 N Columbia St, Chapel Hill, NC 27514 | 919.968.2200 / F 919.968.2227\ninvtitle.com | nititle.com | invtrust.com\nCautionary Information about Forward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements contained herein may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private\nSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
