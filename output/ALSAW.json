We have therefore chosen to recognise interest income on client cash balances as ‘Net Treasury Income – Client Funds’, not revenue. We share the blended average client balances and interest rates through our website on a quarterly basis, in order to provide a mechanism for stakeholders to model this interest income themselves.\n\n**Q3 2024**\n\n  * Blended average balance: £2.2bn\n  * Blended average interest rate: 3.8%\n\n\n\n**Q2 2024**\n\n  * Blended average balance: £2.1bn\n  * Blended average interest rate: 3.9%\n\n\n\n**Q1 2024**\n\n  * Blended average balance: £2.0bn\n  * Blended average interest rate: 4.0%\n\n\n\n**Q4 2023**\n\n  * Blended average balance: £2.1bn\n  * Blended average interest rate: 3.8%\n\n\n\n**Q3 2023**\n\n  * Blended average balance: £1.9bn\n  * Blended average interest rate: 3.8%\n\n\n\n**Q2 2023**\n\n  * Blended average balance: £1.9bn\n  * Blended average interest rate: 3.8%\n\n\n\n**Q1 2023**\n\n  * Blended average balance: £1.6bn\n  * Blended average interest rate: 2.8%\n\n\n\n## Client & Sector Concentrations\n\n### Sector Concentration\n\nFigures are updated on a bi-annual basis and show sectors that makeup 1% or more of the Group’s total revenue (last updated 30/06/2024).\n\nSector| % of revenue  \n---|---  \nFinancial Institutions| 39%  \nManufacturing non-food| 17%  \nWholesale| 8%  \nRetail| 7%  \nEngineering| 4%  \nTravel & Tourism| 4%  \nOther| 3%  \nPrimary Industry*| 2%  \nOnline Services| 2%  \nManufacturing Food & Drink| 2%  \nImport/Export| 2%  \nTransport| 2%  \nConsulting Services| 1%  \nLogistics| 1%  \nMedia| 1%  \nConstruction| 1%  \nResearch & Development| 1%  \nTelecommunications| 1%  \n  \n### Top 20 Client FX Exposures\n\nFigures are updated on a bi-annual basis and show Alpha’s top 20 client FX exposures, represented as a % of the forward book (30/06/2024).\n\nCurrency Pair| % of forward book  \n---|---  \nEURUSD| 4.08%  \nGBPEUR| 3.12%  \nGBPUSD| 2.08%  \nGBPUSD| 1.97%  \nEURUSD| 1.92%  \nEURUSD| 1.76%  \nUSDCAD| 1.45%  \nEURUSD| 1.30%  \nEURUSD| 1.27%  \nEURUSD| 1.22%  \nEURUSD| 1.21%  \nGBPEUR| 1.20%  \nEURUSD| 1.18%  \nUSDBRL| 0.97%  \nAUDUSD| 0.96%  \nEURUSD| 0.95%  \nEURPLN| 0.87%  \nEURUSD| 0.84%  \nEURUSD| 0.82%  \nEURUSD| 0.82%  \n  \n![](https://d21y75miwcfqoq.cloudfront.net/c80ff5af)\n\nWe use cookies on this site to enhance your user experience.
