Most importantly, in late December, we fundamentally changed the composition of our balance sheet, adding up to $140 million in non-dilutive capital by partially monetizing our VABYSMO® (faricimab) royalties, economics that we purchased in 2021 for $14 million. Interestingly, XOMA now has more cash on its balance sheet than at any point in its 43-year history. \n\nUpon joining the firm in early 2023, Brad Sitko, our Chief Investment Officer, and I made it clear that our intent was to maintain a disciplined approach to our capital allocation by (1) focusing on business development, which is paramount to our long-term prospects, and (2) returning capital to our stockholders upon success. In that vein, in January 2024, subsequent to our $140 million VABYSMO® transaction, we announced a stock repurchase program for up to $50 million. Growing royalty receipts coupled with a relatively static expense base and a diminished share count should lever future returns to the benefit of our long-term stockholders. \n\n### **2024 Top Priorities**\n\nXOMA occupies a unique position in the royalty monetization space, one that is distinct from the vast majority of our competitors. We focus our efforts across the lifecycle of drug development, from early stage assets entering the clinic to commercially available programs. The underlying premise is to balance, over time, revenue generating assets that support our notional value with the high-risk, yet high-reward, early stage programs that have the potential to generate significant technology value for XOMA prior to commercialization.\n\nToday, XOMA has five cash flow generating assets, up from one just over a year ago, including the recently approved OJEMDA™ (tovorafenib), Day One’s type II RAF inhibitor for relapsed or refractory BRAF-altered Pediatric Low-Grade Glioma (pLGG), the most common form of childhood brain cancer. In addition, in a deal announced in late April, we acquired a royalty stream derived from the end user sales of XACIATO™ (clindamycin phosphate) vaginal gel 2%, which is marketed by Organon, one of the premier women’s health companies. And by the end of 2024, assuming regulatory success, we anticipate having six cash flow generating assets, as Zevra Therapeutics’ arimoclomol for Niemann-Pick Type C disease has a PDUFA date in late September. These assets either address a critical unmet need or possess a best-in-class profile that should generate significant cashflows for XOMA over time.\n\n### **Capital Deployment**\n\nRelative to years past, the quantity, breadth, and attractiveness of the Company’s business development pipeline for royalty acquisitions is quite robust, likely a function of the external funding market, which has been subdued of late for early stage companies, and an increasingly proactive business development effort. While we reviewed a number of interesting opportunities in 2023, our acquisition activity was limited by the lack of capital on our balance sheet. The VABYSMO® financing transaction significantly enhances our cash position and provides us with the opportunity to fulfill our objective of being a trusted partner and royalty capital solutions provider within the biotech ecosystem.\n\nMuch of our royalty portfolio is a legacy of XOMA’s BCE technology and Phage display libraries, although many of our most important and most valuable assets are a result of acquisitions completed in recent years. Most of these acquisitions were sourced through our network of partners, including shareholders, investment banks, lawyers, and industry contacts. And while we will look to continue to broaden our network, especially in emerging markets and Europe, we intend to take a more proactive approach in identifying potential opportunities for capital deployment. With the pace of scientific achievement showing no signs of decelerating, we believe it will be increasingly important to identify and allocate capital to potentially game-changing therapies as a means to drive total shareholder return for XOMA stakeholders.\n\n### **Capitalize on Our Value Proposition**\n\nThe biotech funding market has certainly improved off the lows of 2022 and 2023, evidenced by the strength of the XBI (Nasdaq Biotechnology Index) in 4Q 2023 (+26%), and more recently, the reemergence of the biotech IPO and secondary equity offerings. With that said, the market remains bifurcated, as the majority of the recent financings involve companies with late-stage compounds. For earlier-stage companies or those still in search of proof-of-concept, a group that commands much of our interest, capital remains elusive, especially at a reasonable cost of capital.\n\nHistorically speaking, royalty and milestone monetizations were utilized as a financing of last resort. Today, the virtues of this financing type are increasingly appreciated, not only by the management and Boards of our partners, but also by their shareholders. Royalty financings provide risk-based capital, limit equity dilution, and often unlock hidden value to the benefit of all parties.\n\nXOMA prides itself on providing bespoke royalty capital solutions, tailored to address the financial needs of our partners. In 2024, in addition to being more proactive, we intend to use the assets within XOMA, namely our people, permanent capital structure, creativity, structuring experience, and patience, to capitalize on the current opportunities arising from the have and have nots.\n\n### **Identify Opportunities to Unlock Value for Stockholders**\n\nThere are multiple avenues by which we can build XOMA’s royalty portfolio, as well as build XOMA’s balance sheet. We think creatively to identify the appropriate risk-adjusted opportunities that deliver cash to XOMA today and/or have the potential to generate cash for XOMA in the future. This February, we announced the acquisition of Kinnate Biopharma. While returning the majority of Kinnate’s cash to its stockholders, we expect we’ll add over $9.5 million, net, in non-dilutive cash to our balance sheet, as well as several precision oncology programs that we are actively seeking to monetize through sale or out-licensing. This acquisition reflects one creative approach that unlocks value for both our stockholders and Kinnate’s investors – today and into the future.\n\n### **Drive Total Shareholder Return**\n\nXOMA is unique among its peers, having only recently transitioned into the royalty space as of 2017. At the end of 2023, we had approximately $160 million in cash and no corporate debt1. We have a small, but growing number of products that are generating royalties, followed by a visible pipeline that continues to mature with the passage of time. Investors have an opportunity to participate in two separate publicly traded classes of stock (common – XOMA – and preferred – XOMAP and XOMAO) catering to different return objectives.\n\nOur recently announced $50 million share buyback fulfills one of the key tenets that we outlined last year: returning capital to shareholders upon success. We believe a balanced approach to capital allocation is important in both theory and practice. In addition, in an effort to further align the interests of XOMA employees and our shareholders, we changed the equity compensation for every employee in the company, moving from options to performance stock units (PSUs) with strike prices significantly ahead of the prevailing stock price.\n\nWith a sizable portfolio that is diversified across therapeutic areas, mechanisms, modalities, stages of development, and partners, we are building the foundation for a company that has the potential to drive long-term shareholder value. We believe our actions in 2023 support that assertion, and we hope our efforts in 2024 solidify that thinking. \n\nAs I close this letter, there is a collective excitement within XOMA – work from years past is starting to pay off. Our business model is more relevant than ever, and market dynamics provide ample opportunity to further build XOMA’s royalty and milestone portfolio. Thank you for your continued support. \n\nSincerely,\n\n![](https://xoma.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/signature2023-300x81.png)\n\nOwen Hughes\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements/Explanatory Notes**\n\nCertain statements contained in this letter are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including statements regarding the potential of XOMA’s portfolio of partnered programs and licensed technologies generating substantial milestone and royalty proceeds over time, and creating additional value for the stockholders.

(NYSE: OWL).\n\n“The Blue Owl financing provides us with significant non-dilutive capital to drive shareholder value through stock repurchases and additional royalty and milestone acquisitions,” stated Brad Sitko, Chief Investment Officer of XOMA. “This capital infusion comes at an opportune time given the existing state of the biotech funding market, providing us with an opportunity to accelerate the growth of our royalty and milestones portfolio, which currently consists of two marketed products, two programs in or near registration, five assets in Phase 3 development, and over 60 assets in earlier stages of development.”\n\n“Blue Owl’s Life Science efforts are focused on credit, royalty, and equity investments in innovative healthcare and life sciences companies and products. We recognize the value embedded in XOMA’s differentiated royalty and milestone aggregation business strategy. Our long-established relationship with XOMA’s management team gives us confidence that they can continue building a balanced portfolio of current and future royalty-generating assets. This financing establishes a long-term partnership with XOMA, as we help broaden their access to capital for royalty and milestone monetization opportunities,” said Sandip Agarwala, Managing Director at Blue Owl Capital.\n\n**Terms of the Agreement** XOMA has drawn down $130 million in principal from Blue Owl and has the option to draw another $10 million should the royalties received from VABYSMO® (faricimab) sales on or prior to March 15, 2026, exceed a predetermined amount. XOMA is obligated to make semi-annual interest payments at a fixed rate of 9.875% per year until the royalty-backed loan is repaid, at which time VABYSMO® royalty payments will revert back to XOMA. The loan is repayable over a 15-year period, although XOMA may repay it in full at any time during that period, subject to the terms of the loan. Additionally, XOMA has issued to Blue Owl warrants to purchase an aggregate of up to 120,000 shares of XOMA’s common stock in three equal tranches with strike prices of $35.00, $42.50, and $50.00 per share, respectively, resulting in implied premiums of 122%, 170%, and 217% to the price of XOMA’s common stock at closing, respectively.\n\n**Advisors** Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP served as XOMA’s legal advisor while Blue Owl was advised by Cooley LLP.\n\n**About XOMA Corporation** XOMA is a biotechnology royalty aggregator playing a distinctive role in helping biotech companies achieve their goal of improving human health.

Over the course of the next few years, we have the potential to earn royalty and milestone payments on several innovative products, enabling XOMA to establish a path to self-sufficiency, something that eludes many biotech companies. \n\nJim Neal and the team did a great job establishing the royalty and milestone aggregator business model, providing XOMA with a solid foundation from which to prosper. The combination of legacy antibody agreements and shrewd capital deployment has resulted in a portfolio of 70+ assets, providing the Company with over $85 million of milestone payments since 2017 and recording incoming cash flows from its first royalty product in 2022 (Vabysmo® (faricimab), marketed by Roche for wet AMD and DME).\n\nAt present, following the recent purchase of the IXINITY® [coagulation factor IX (recombinant)] royalties from Aptevo Therapeutics, our late-stage portfolio consists of:\n\n  * two cash flow generating assets,\n  * a potential 2023 NDA filing for tovorafenib (DAY101), and\n  * up to five assets either in or expected to enter into Phase 3 development by year-end.\n\n\n\nIn addition, our business development team, led by Brad Sitko, our recently appointed Chief Investment Officer, is reviewing an ever-increasing number of opportunities as companies come to understand the value of royalty monetizations, especially as debt and equity capital remain constrained in the early- stage life sciences market.\n\n### As we look to the future, I’d like to take the opportunity presented with XOMA’s Annual Letter to Stockholders to outline our top three priorities for 2023.\n\n**One. Increase XOMA’s brand equity as a capital provider, enabling today’s science to be tomorrow’s cures.**\n\nIn March 2023, we acquired a mid-single digit royalty on IXINITY®, which is marketed by Medexus Pharmaceuticals for the control and prevention of bleeding episodes and postoperative management in people with Hemophilia B. We paid $9.6 million to Aptevo Therapeutics for these commercial payments. In the second quarter of 2023, we expect to begin receiving a mid-single digit royalty on all IXINITY® sales beginning January 1, 2023, and continuing quarterly into 2035. XOMA’s non-dilutive capital gives Aptevo Therapeutics the opportunity to continue advancing its portfolio of clinical-stage immuno-oncology candidates.\n\nWe continue to identify companies holding economic interests in pre-commercial assets licensed to large cap pharmaceutical and established biotech companies that are looking to monetize all or a portion of their future royalty streams. As companies come to recognize the value of royalty / milestone financing relative to equity dilution, we anticipate XOMA’s unique position within the early-stage biotech environment will be a critical factor for our future success.\n\n**Two. Capitalize on the dislocation in the biotech ecosystem and specifically, the biotech funding market.**\n\nThe once exuberant market sentiment of 2020 and 2021 has given way to the sobering reality of one of the most difficult funding environments in the history of biotech. As of April 2023, nearly 250 biotech companies are trading with a negative enterprise value, i.e., their market cap is below their cash on hand. And it is in fact this dislocation that presents a significant opportunity for XOMA. As referenced earlier, the number of opportunities that we are actively reviewing is much higher than historical norms, both in terms of breadth as well as quality. As such, we anticipate deploying additional capital sourced from our future milestones and royalties to capitalize on this dislocation, allowing us to further diversify our growing pipeline.\n\n**Three. Generate positive risk-adjusted, non-correlated returns for our stockholders.**\n\nOur royalty cashflows are derived from the sales of pharmaceutical products addressing serious conditions that often require life-saving medications. While there may be some elasticity in pharmaceutical demand, the sales of therapeutics tend not to be influenced by the broader economic backdrop or the performance of the equity or credit markets. With a portfolio of over 70 assets, diversified across therapeutic areas, mechanism, modality, stage of development and partner, we are building the foundation for a company that maintains the upside of a traditional biotech company, but with a significantly mitigated risk profile. And in that manner, we believe our pipeline success will beget future free cash flow generation, which we intend to redeploy both internally, as well as externally to the benefit of our stockholders.\n\nSincerely,\n\n![](https://xoma.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/signature2023-300x81.png)\n\nOwen Hughes\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements/Explanatory Notes**\n\nCertain statements contained in this letter are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including statements regarding the potential of XOMA’s portfolio of partnered programs and licensed technologies generating substantial milestone and royalty proceeds over time, and creating additional value for the stockholders.

The capital we deploy through our royalty and milestone acquisitions provides immediate non-dilutive cash to the sellers and helps them achieve their near-term goals. \n\nFirst, I see increasing recognition of XOMA as a royalty aggregator and the role we play in the biotechnology financing ecosystem. That signals to me that the time we have spent introducing XOMA to a broad audience of investors and biotech company executives has moved the needle. Our business development team hit a new benchmark of over 170 meetings at conferences in 2022 and expects to exceed that number in 2023. We continue to seek targeted opportunities to increase XOMA’s exposure to, and reputation within, the industry. Our goal is to make XOMA the ‘go-to’ Royalty Aggregator for biotech companies seeking to monetize a royalty.\n\nSecond, I see a milestone and royalty portfolio that is on the cusp of capturing significant attention as cash begins to flow in increasingly tangible royalty and milestone receipts. September marked the first reporting of commercial sales payments (i.e., royalties) made to XOMA since we transitioned to a royalty aggregator. Every six months going forward for the next 10 years, we expect to receive a check representing 0.5%of Vabysmo® (faricimab) net sales. Even more exciting is our view that this royalty stream is just the beginning, as our portfolio includes royalty rights on two oncology assets in Phase 3 development today and two assets with Orphan Drug designation that are preparing to enter Phase 3 in the coming months. The more Phase 3 assets we have in our portfolio, the more we see the prospects of our portfolio delivering royalty revenue and earnings.\n\nIn addition to these royalty prospects, XOMA holds rights to approximately $1.5 billion in future potential milestone payments. The large milestone payments we received in two of the past three years have more than covered our lean operating expenses. And though this milestone revenue is lumpy and hard to predict, it is impactful as a source of non-dilutive capital as we continue to grow XOMA’s milestone and royalty portfolio.\n\nThird, I see a strong team that works exceptionally well together. Each member of the XOMA team is dedicated to our mission – Play a distinctive role in helping biotech companies achieve their goal of advancing novel therapeutic candidates aimed at improving human health. Each team member has brought royalty acquisition ideas to the table. Each team member tells the XOMA story with excitement and passion, thereby introducing the Company to new people on a regular basis. Each team member has worked through weekends, vacations, and COVID-19 symptoms to build XOMA into a well-regarded royalty aggregator. They are supportive of each other, and they bring out the best in each other. The strength of this XOMA team should not be overlooked.\n\nFinally, I am amongst a group of highly supportive stockholders in XOMA. When the New Year dawns and my involvement in XOMA’s day-to-day operations ends, my support of XOMA as a company, as an investment, and as a team will continue. Establishing XOMA as the Royalty Aggregator for biotech companies is my professional legacy. I’m proud of what we have accomplished and know the team will build on and amplify what we’ve started.\n\nThank you for your support these past six years, and we hope you will continue to support XOMA for into the future.\n\nEveryone at XOMA wishes you the best for a happy, healthy, and prosperous 2023,\n\nJim Neal\n\n![](https://xoma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/JN-Signature-e1586918269901.png)\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements/Explanatory Notes**\n\nCertain statements contained in this letter are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including statements regarding the potential of XOMA’s portfolio of partnered programs and licensed technologies generating substantial milestone and royalty proceeds over time, and creating additional value for the stockholders.

MIPLYFFA™ is indicated for use in combination with miglustat for the treatment of neurological manifestations of NPC in adult and pediatric patients 2 years of age and older.  \nRezolute | Announced the sunRIZE Phase 3 clinical trial investigating ersodetug (RZ358) in patients with congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) will begin enrolling patients in the U.S. in early 2025¹.Received FDA clearance to initiate Phase 3 registrational study for ersodetug for the treatment of hypoglycemia due to tumor hyperinsulinism².  \nJohnson & Johnson | Presented neoadjuvant TAR-200 plus cetrelimab Phase 2 data in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) who are ineligible or refuse neoadjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy and are scheduled for radical cystectomy at the European Society of Medical Oncology 2024 Congress³.  \n  \n**Subsequent Events**\n\nPartner | Event  \n---|---  \nTwist Bioscience | XOMA Royalty completed a $15 million royalty monetization agreement with Twist, acquiring 50% of the future milestones and royalties and adding 60-plus partnered early-stage programs across 30 companies enabled by Twist Bioscience’s Biopharma Solutions business unit to the XOMA Royalty portfolio.  \nJohnson & Johnson | Announced one of two Phase 3 clinical trials in difficult to treat muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) that included treatment with cetrelimab was being discontinued for not showing superiority to chemoradiation during a scheduled interim analysis⁴. Cetrelimab continues to be investigated in multiple other clinical trials.  \n  \n**Anticipated 2024 Events of Note**\n\nPartner | Event  \n---|---  \nTakeda | On December 12, 2024, Takeda will be hosting an R&D Day: Focus on Late-State Pipeline and Market Opportunity and has commented publicly mezagitamab will be discussed during this investor event.  \n  \n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nXOMA Royalty recorded total income and revenues of $7.2 million for the third quarter of 2024, which included $6.5 million in estimated income associated with two commercial products in our portfolio. In the third quarter of 2023, XOMA Royalty reported total income and revenue of $0.8 million. \n\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses were $0.8 million in the third quarter of 2024, reflecting transitory clinical trial costs related to KIN-3248, an asset acquired in the Kinnate acquisition, which the Company currently is winding down. R&D expenses in the third quarter of 2023 were $25,000.\n\nGeneral and administrative (“G&A”) expenses were $8.0 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared with $6.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase of $1.6 million was primarily comprised of $1.4 million in total costs incurred after our acquisition of Kinnate, which included $1.1 million in legal and consulting costs, $0.1 million in information technology costs, and $0.1 million in insurance costs. The remainder of the increased G&A expense reflects an increase of $0.2 million for salaries and related costs.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, as a result of communications with Agenus, XOMA Royalty evaluated the status of the partnered programs underlying the Agenus Royalty Purchase Agreement for potential impairment and recorded a one-time, non-cash impairment charge of $14.0 million and a reduction of royalty receivables of $14.0 million associated with Agenus.\n\nIn the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, G&A expenses included $2.6 million and $2.7 million, respectively, in non-cash stock-based compensation expenses.\n\nTotal interest expense in the third quarter of 2024 was $3.5 million, representing interest and costs related to the Blue Owl Loan established in December 2023.\n\nThe Company reported total other income, net, of $1.9 million in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to total other income, net, of $0.3 million in the corresponding period of 2023. The $1.6 million increase reflects a $1.3 million increase in investment income due to higher balances on our investments and the change in the market price for XOMA Royalty’s shares of Rezolute common stock.\n\nNet loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $17.2 million, compared to a net loss of $5.5 million for the third quarter of 2023, primarily resulting from the $14.0 million non-cash impairment related to the Agenus Royalty Purchase Agreement.\n\nOn September 30, 2024, XOMA Royalty had cash and cash equivalents of $146.8 million (including $4.8 million in restricted cash). On December 31, 2023, XOMA Royalty had cash and cash equivalents of $159.6 million (including $6.3 million in restricted cash). During the third quarter of 2024, XOMA Royalty received $9.9 million in cash from royalty and commercial payments. Net cash used in operating activities during the quarter was $8.6 million. On October 15, 2024, the Company paid a total of $1.4 million in cash dividends on the 8.625% Series A Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (Nasdaq: XOMAP) and the 8.375% Series B Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (Nasdaq: XOMAO).\n\n**About XOMA Royalty Corporation**\n\nXOMA Royalty is a biotechnology royalty aggregator playing a distinctive role in helping biotech companies achieve their goal of improving human health.

MIPLYFFA™ is indicated for use in combination with miglustat for the treatment of neurological manifestations of NPC in adult and pediatric patients 2 years of age and older.  \nRezolute | Announced the sunRIZE Phase 3 clinical trial investigating ersodetug (RZ358) in patients with congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) will begin enrolling patients in the U.S. in early 2025¹.Received FDA clearance to initiate Phase 3 registrational study for ersodetug for the treatment of hypoglycemia due to tumor hyperinsulinism².  \nJohnson & Johnson | Presented neoadjuvant TAR-200 plus cetrelimab Phase 2 data in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) who are ineligible or refuse neoadjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy and are scheduled for radical cystectomy at the European Society of Medical Oncology 2024 Congress³.  \n  \n**Subsequent Events**\n\nPartner | Event  \n---|---  \nTwist Bioscience | XOMA Royalty completed a $15 million royalty monetization agreement with Twist, acquiring 50% of the future milestones and royalties and adding 60-plus partnered early-stage programs across 30 companies enabled by Twist Bioscience’s Biopharma Solutions business unit to the XOMA Royalty portfolio.  \nJohnson & Johnson | Announced one of two Phase 3 clinical trials in difficult to treat muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) that included treatment with cetrelimab was being discontinued for not showing superiority to chemoradiation during a scheduled interim analysis⁴. Cetrelimab continues to be investigated in multiple other clinical trials.  \n  \n**Anticipated 2024 Events of Note**\n\nPartner | Event  \n---|---  \nTakeda | On December 12, 2024, Takeda will be hosting an R&D Day: Focus on Late-State Pipeline and Market Opportunity and has commented publicly mezagitamab will be discussed during this investor event.  \n  \n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nXOMA Royalty recorded total income and revenues of $7.2 million for the third quarter of 2024, which included $6.5 million in estimated income associated with two commercial products in our portfolio. In the third quarter of 2023, XOMA Royalty reported total income and revenue of $0.8 million. \n\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses were $0.8 million in the third quarter of 2024, reflecting transitory clinical trial costs related to KIN-3248, an asset acquired in the Kinnate acquisition, which the Company currently is winding down. R&D expenses in the third quarter of 2023 were $25,000.\n\nGeneral and administrative (“G&A”) expenses were $8.0 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared with $6.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase of $1.6 million was primarily comprised of $1.4 million in total costs incurred after our acquisition of Kinnate, which included $1.1 million in legal and consulting costs, $0.1 million in information technology costs, and $0.1 million in insurance costs. The remainder of the increased G&A expense reflects an increase of $0.2 million for salaries and related costs.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, as a result of communications with Agenus, XOMA Royalty evaluated the status of the partnered programs underlying the Agenus Royalty Purchase Agreement for potential impairment and recorded a one-time, non-cash impairment charge of $14.0 million and a reduction of royalty receivables of $14.0 million associated with Agenus.\n\nIn the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, G&A expenses included $2.6 million and $2.7 million, respectively, in non-cash stock-based compensation expenses.\n\nTotal interest expense in the third quarter of 2024 was $3.5 million, representing interest and costs related to the Blue Owl Loan established in December 2023.\n\nThe Company reported total other income, net, of $1.9 million in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to total other income, net, of $0.3 million in the corresponding period of 2023. The $1.6 million increase reflects a $1.3 million increase in investment income due to higher balances on our investments and the change in the market price for XOMA Royalty’s shares of Rezolute common stock.\n\nNet loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $17.2 million, compared to a net loss of $5.5 million for the third quarter of 2023, primarily resulting from the $14.0 million non-cash impairment related to the Agenus Royalty Purchase Agreement.\n\nOn September 30, 2024, XOMA Royalty had cash and cash equivalents of $146.8 million (including $4.8 million in restricted cash). On December 31, 2023, XOMA Royalty had cash and cash equivalents of $159.6 million (including $6.3 million in restricted cash). During the third quarter of 2024, XOMA Royalty received $9.9 million in cash from royalty and commercial payments. Net cash used in operating activities during the quarter was $8.6 million. On October 15, 2024, the Company paid a total of $1.4 million in cash dividends on the 8.625% Series A Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (Nasdaq: XOMAP) and the 8.375% Series B Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (Nasdaq: XOMAO).\n\n**About XOMA Royalty Corporation**\n\nXOMA Royalty is a biotechnology royalty aggregator playing a distinctive role in helping biotech companies achieve their goal of improving human health.

In some cases, you can identify such forward-looking statements by terminology such as “anticipate,” “intend,” “believe,” “estimate,” “plan,” “seek,” “project,” “expect,” “may,” “will”, “would,” “could” or “should,” the negative of these terms or similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are not a guarantee of XOMA Royalty’s performance, and you should not place undue reliance on such statements. These statements are based on assumptions that may not prove accurate, and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated due to certain risks inherent in the biotechnology industry, including those related to the fact that our product candidates subject to out-license agreements are still being developed, and our licensees may require substantial funds to continue development which may not be available; we do not know whether there will be, or will continue to be, a viable market for the products in which we have an ownership or royalty interest; and if the therapeutic product candidates to which we have a royalty interest do not receive regulatory approval, our third-party licensees will not be able to market them. Other potential risks to XOMA Royalty meeting these expectations are described in more detail in XOMA Royalty's most recent filing on Form 10-Q and in other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Consider such risks carefully when considering XOMA Royalty's prospects. Any forward-looking statement in this press release represents XOMA Royalty's beliefs and assumptions only as of the date of this press release and should not be relied upon as representing its views as of any subsequent date. XOMA Royalty disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statement, except as required by applicable law.\n\nEXPLANATORY NOTE: Any references to “portfolio” in this press release refer strictly to milestone and/or royalty rights associated with a basket of drug products in development.
