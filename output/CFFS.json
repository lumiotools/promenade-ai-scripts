Reports First Nine Months 2024 Net Earnings of $890 Million, Adjusted EBITDA of $1.72 Billion\n\nOctober 30, 2024\n\n_Operational Performance, Favorable Global Nitrogen Cost Structure Drive Strong Cash Generation_\n\n_Returned $1.4 Billion to Shareholders Through Share Repurchases and Dividends in First Nine Months of 2024_\n\nNORTHBROOK, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--  CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: CF), a leading global manufacturer of hydrogen and nitrogen products, today announced results for the first nine months and third quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n  * First nine months 2024 net earnings (1)(2) of $890 million, or $4.86 per diluted share, EBITDA (3) of $1.75 billion, and adjusted EBITDA (3) of $1.72 billion \n  * Third quarter 2024 net earnings of $276 million, or $1.55 per diluted share, EBITDA of $509 million, and adjusted EBITDA of $511 million \n  * Trailing twelve months net cash from operating activities of $2.33 billion and free cash flow (4)  of $1.51 billion \n  * Repurchased 6.1 million shares for $476 million during the third quarter of 2024 \n\n\n\n“The CF Industries team operated well across all aspects of our business in the third quarter against the backdrop of favorable global nitrogen industry conditions, supporting strong cash generation and enabling the Company to continue to create significant value for long-term shareholders,” said Tony Will, president and chief executive officer, CF Industries Holdings, Inc. \n\n**Operations Overview**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company’s 12-month rolling average recordable incident rate was 0.17 incidents per 200,000 work hours. \n\nGross ammonia production for the first nine months and third quarter of 2024 was approximately 7.2 million and 2.4 million tons, respectively, compared to 7.0 million and 2.2 million tons in the first nine months and third quarter of 2023, respectively. The Company expects gross ammonia production for the full year 2024 to be approximately 9.8 million tons. \n\n**Financial Results Overview**\n\n_First Nine Months 2024 Financial Results_\n\nFor the first nine months of 2024, net earnings attributable to common stockholders were $890 million, or $4.86 per diluted share, EBITDA was $1.75 billion, and adjusted EBITDA was $1.72 billion. These results compare to first nine months of 2023 net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $1.25 billion, or $6.42 per diluted share, EBITDA of $2.15 billion, and adjusted EBITDA of $2.17 billion. \n\nNet sales in the first nine months of 2024 were $4.41 billion compared to $5.06 billion in the first nine months of 2023. Average selling prices for the first nine months of 2024 were lower than in the first nine months of 2023 as lower global energy costs reduced the global market clearing price required to meet global demand. Sales volumes in the first nine months of 2024 were similar to the first nine months of 2023 as higher ammonia sales volumes due primarily to the addition of contractual commitments served from the recently acquired Waggaman ammonia production facility were offset primarily by lower urea ammonium nitrate solution (UAN) sales volumes. \n\nCost of sales for the first nine months of 2024 was lower compared to the first nine months of 2023 due to lower realized natural gas costs partially offset by higher maintenance costs incurred in the first quarter of 2024 related to plant outages. \n\nThe average cost of natural gas reflected in the Company’s cost of sales was $2.38 per MMBtu in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the average cost of natural gas in cost of sales of $3.90 per MMBtu in the first nine months of 2023. \n\n_Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results_\n\nFor the third quarter of 2024, net earnings attributable to common stockholders were $276 million, or $1.55 per diluted share, EBITDA was $509 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $511 million. These results compare to third quarter of 2023 net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $164 million, or $0.85 per diluted share, EBITDA of $372 million, and adjusted EBITDA of $445 million. \n\nNet sales in the third quarter of 2024 were $1.37 billion compared to $1.27 billion in the third quarter of 2023. Average selling prices for the third quarter of 2024 were higher than in the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to higher average selling prices for ammonia from lower global supply availability due in part to lower natural gas availability in Trinidad and Egypt. Sales volumes in the third quarter of 2024 were similar to the third quarter of 2023 as higher ammonia sales volumes due primarily to the addition of contractual commitments served from the recently acquired Waggaman ammonia production facility were offset primarily by lower UAN sales volumes. \n\nCost of sales for the third quarter of 2024 was similar to the third quarter of 2023 as higher maintenance costs were offset by lower realized natural gas costs. \n\nThe average cost of natural gas reflected in the Company’s cost of sales was $2.10 per MMBtu in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the average cost of natural gas in cost of sales of $2.54 per MMBtu in the third quarter of 2023. \n\n**Capital Management**\n\n_Capital Expenditures_\n\nCapital expenditures in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 were $139 million and $321 million, respectively. Management projects capital expenditures for full year 2024 will be approximately $525 million. \n\n_Share Repurchase Program_\n\nThe Company repurchased 14.4 million shares for $1.13 billion during the first nine months of 2024, which includes the repurchase of 6.1 million shares for $476 million during the third quarter of 2024. Since CF Industries commenced its current $3 billion share repurchase program in the second quarter of 2023, the Company has repurchased 20.0 million shares for approximately $1.55 billion. As of September 30, 2024, approximately $1.45 billion remains under the program, which expires in December 2025. \n\n_CHS Inc. Distribution_\n\nCHS Inc. (CHS) is entitled to semi-annual distributions resulting from its minority equity investment in CF Industries Nitrogen, LLC (CFN). The estimate of the partnership distribution earned by CHS, but not yet declared, for the third quarter of 2024 is approximately $65 million. \n\n**Nitrogen Market Outlook**\n\nGlobal nitrogen pricing was supported in the third quarter of 2024 by strong global nitrogen demand and lower supply availability due to natural gas shortages in Trinidad and Egypt, China’s absence from the urea export market, and planned maintenance activities in the Middle East. In the near-term, management expects the global supply-demand balance to remain constructive, as inventories globally are believed to be below average and energy spreads continue to be significant between North America and high-cost production in Europe. \n\n  * **North America:** While grains prices in North America are under pressure from expected high crop production in 2024, management believes that the fall ammonia application season in the United States and Canada will be positive, if weather is favorable, given the relative affordability of nitrogen inputs. U.S. crop returns for 2025 are forecast at similar levels to 2024, which is expected to support stable planted corn acres year-over-year. \n  * **Brazil:** Through September 2024, urea imports to Brazil were 5.4 million metric tons, 13% higher than through the same period in 2023. Brazil is expected to import 2.0-2.5 million metric tons of urea in the fourth quarter of 2024 due to forecast higher planted corn acres and nominal domestic production. \n  * **India:** Management believes significant urea import requirements remain for India through March 2025 due to favorable weather for rice, wheat and other crop production as well as lower-than-targeted urea production in India driving greater import need. \n  * **Europe:** Approximately 20% of ammonia and urea capacity were reported in shutdown/curtailment in Europe as of September 2024. Management believes that ammonia operating rates and overall domestic nitrogen product output in Europe will remain below historical averages over the long-term given the region’s status as the global marginal producer. \n  * **China:** Ongoing urea export controls by the Chinese government continues to limit urea export availability from the country. Through September 2024, China has exported 254,000 metric tons of urea, 91 percent lower than the same period in 2023. \n  * **Russia:** Urea exports from Russia have increased by 5% in 2024 due to the start-up of new urea granulation capacity and the willingness of certain countries to purchase Russian fertilizer, including Brazil and the United States. Exports of ammonia from Russia are expected to rise with the completion of the country’s Taman port ammonia terminal though annual ammonia export volumes are projected to remain below pre-war levels. \n\n\n\nOver the medium-term, significant energy cost differentials between North American producers and high-cost producers in Europe and Asia are expected to persist. As a result, the Company believes the global nitrogen cost structure will remain supportive of strong margin opportunities for low-cost North American producers. \n\nLonger-term, management expects the global nitrogen supply-demand balance to tighten as global nitrogen capacity growth over the next four years is not projected to keep pace with expected global nitrogen demand growth of approximately 1.5% per year for traditional applications and new demand growth for clean energy applications. Global production is expected to remain constrained by continued challenges related to cost and availability of natural gas. \n\n**Strategic Initiatives Update**\n\n_Evaluation of low-carbon ammonia technologies_\n\nCF Industries, along with its partners, continue to advance front-end engineering and design (FEED) studies evaluating autothermal reforming (ATR) ammonia production technology and assessing the cost and viability of adding flue gas carbon dioxide capture to a steam methane reforming (SMR) ammonia facility. Both FEED studies are expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2024. \n\n_Donaldsonville Complex green ammonia project_\n\nCommissioning of the 20-megawatt alkaline water electrolysis plant at CF Industries’ Donaldsonville, Louisiana, manufacturing complex continues. \n\n_Donaldsonville Complex carbon capture and sequestration project_\n\nConstruction of a dehydration and compression unit at CF Industries’ Donaldsonville Complex continues to advance: all major equipment for the facility has been procured, fabrication of the carbon dioxide compressors is proceeding, installation of piping and process equipment is in progress, one of the two compressors has been delivered to site, and construction of the cooling tower required for the unit has been completed. Once in service, the dehydration and compression unit will enable up to 2 million metric tons of captured process carbon dioxide to be transported and permanently stored by ExxonMobil. CF Industries expects the project to qualify for tax credits under Section 45Q of the Internal Revenue Code, which provides a credit per metric ton of carbon dioxide sequestered. Start-up of the project is expected in 2025. \n\n_Yazoo City Complex carbon capture and sequestration project_\n\nCF Industries signed a definitive commercial agreement in July 2024 with ExxonMobil for the transport and sequestration in permanent geologic storage of up to 500,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually from the Company’s Yazoo City, Mississippi, Complex. CF Industries will invest approximately $100 million into its Yazoo City Complex to build a carbon dioxide dehydration and compression unit to enable up to 500,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide captured from the ammonia production process per year to be transported and stored. CF Industries expects the project to qualify for tax credits under Section 45Q of the Internal Revenue Code, which provides a credit per metric ton of carbon dioxide sequestered. Start-up of the project is expected in 2028. \n\n___________________________________________________   \n---  \n(1) |  Certain items recognized during the first nine months of 2024 impacted the Company’s financial results and their comparability to the prior year period.

Management believes that EBITDA, EBITDA per ton, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA per ton, free cash flow, and, on a segment basis, adjusted gross margin, adjusted gross margin as a percent of net sales and adjusted gross margin per product ton and per nutrient ton, which are non-GAAP financial measures, provide additional meaningful information regarding the Company’s performance and financial strength. Management uses these measures, and believes they are useful to investors, as supplemental financial measures in the comparison of year-over-year performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, EBITDA, EBITDA per ton, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA per ton, free cash flow, adjusted gross margin, adjusted gross margin as a percent of net sales and adjusted gross margin per product ton and per nutrient ton, included in this release may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Reconciliations of EBITDA, EBITDA per ton, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA per ton, and free cash flow to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided in the tables accompanying this release under “CF Industries Holdings, Inc.-Selected Financial Information-Non-GAAP Disclosure Items.” Reconciliations of adjusted gross margin, adjusted gross margin as a percent of net sales and adjusted gross margin per product ton and per nutrient ton to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided in the segment tables included in this release. \n\n**Safe Harbor Statement**\n\nAll statements in this communication by CF Industries Holdings, Inc.

Forward-looking statements can generally be identified by their use of terms such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “estimate,”\n“expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “predict,” “project,” “will” or “would” and similar terms and phrases, including references to assumptions. Forward-looking\nstatements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the\nCompany’s control, which could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements.

Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, among\nothers, the risk of obstacles to realization of the benefits of the transactions with IPL; the risk that the synergies from the transactions with IPL may not be fully\nrealized or may take longer to realize than expected; the risk that the completion of the transactions with IPL, including integration of the Waggaman ammonia\nproduction complex into the Company’s operations, disrupt current operations or harm relationships with customers, employees and suppliers; the risk that\nintegration of the Waggaman ammonia production complex with the Company’s current operations will be more costly or difficult than expected or may otherwise\nbe unsuccessful; diversion of management time and attention to issues relating to the transactions with IPL; unanticipated costs or liabilities associated with the\nIPL transactions; the cyclical nature of the Company’s business and the impact of global supply and demand on the Company’s selling prices; the global\ncommodity nature of the Company’s nitrogen products, the conditions in the international market for nitrogen products, and the intense global competition from\nother producers; conditions in the United States, Europe and other agricultural areas, including the influence of governmental policies and technological\ndevelopments on the demand for our fertilizer products; the volatility of natural gas prices in North America and the United Kingdom; weather conditions and the\nimpact of adverse weather events; the seasonality of the fertilizer business; the impact of changing market conditions on the Company’s forward sales programs;\ndifficulties in securing the supply and delivery of raw materials or utilities, increases in their costs or delays or interruptions in their delivery; reliance on third party\nproviders of transportation services and equipment; the Company’s reliance on a limited number of key facilities; risks associated with cybersecurity; acts of\nterrorism and regulations to combat terrorism; risks associated with international operations; the significant risks and hazards involved in producing and handling\nthe Company’s products against which the Company may not be fully insured; the Company’s ability to manage its indebtedness and any additional indebtedness\nthat may be incurred; the Company’s ability to maintain compliance with covenants under its revolving credit agreement and the agreements governing its\nindebtedness; downgrades of the Company’s credit ratings; risks associated with changes in tax laws and disagreements with taxing authorities; risks involving\nderivatives and the effectiveness of the Company’s risk management and hedging activities; potential liabilities and expenditures related to environmental, health\nand safety laws and regulations and permitting requirements; regulatory restrictions and requirements related to greenhouse gas emissions; the development and\ngrowth of the market for green and low-carbon ammonia and the risks and uncertainties relating to the development and implementation of the Company’s green\nand low-carbon ammonia projects; and risks associated with expansions of the Company’s business, including unanticipated adverse consequences and the\nsignificant resources that could be required. More detailed information about factors that may affect the Company’s performance and could cause actual results to\ndiffer materially from those in any forward-looking statements may be found in CF Industries Holdings, Inc.’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission,\nincluding CF Industries Holdings, Inc.’s most recent annual and quarterly reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, which are available in the Investor Relations\nsection of the Company’s web site. It is not possible to predict or identify all risks and uncertainties that might affect the accuracy of our forward-looking statements\nand, consequently, our descriptions of such risks and uncertainties should not be considered exhaustive. There is no guarantee that any of the events, plans or\ngoals anticipated by these forward-looking statements will occur, and if any of the events do occur, there is no guarantee what effect they will have on our\nbusiness, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and future prospects. Forward-looking statements are given only as of the date of this presentation\nand the Company disclaims any obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise,\nexcept as required by law.\nNote regarding non-GAAP financial measures\nThe Company reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Management believes that EBITDA, adjusted\nEBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, net debt/adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, and free cash flow to adjusted EBITDA conversion, which are non-GAAP financial\nmeasures, provide additional meaningful information regarding the Company's performance and financial strength. Non-GAAP financial measures should be\nviewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, because not all companies use\nidentical calculations, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, net debt/adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, and free cash flow to adjusted EBITDA\nconversion, included in this presentation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Reconciliations of the Company’s EBITDA,\nadjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided in the tables accompanying this presentation.\nEBITDA is defined as net earnings attributable to common stockholders plus interest expense (income)—net, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization.\nOther adjustments include the elimination of loan fee amortization that is included in both interest and amortization, and the portion of depreciation that is included\nin noncontrolling interest. The Company has presented EBITDA because management uses the measure to track performance and believes that it is frequently\nused by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in the industry.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted with the selected items as summarized in the tables accompanying this presentation. The Company has\npresented adjusted EBITDA because management uses adjusted EBITDA, and believes it is useful to investors, as a supplemental financial measure in the\ncomparison of year-over-year performance. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales.\nNet debt is defined as short-term debt, the current portion of long-term debt, and long-term debt less cash and cash equivalents. Net debt/adjusted EBITDA is\ndefined as net debt divided by adjusted EBITDA.\nFree cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, as stated in the consolidated statements of cash flows, reduced by capital expenditures and\ndistributions to noncontrolling interests. Free cash flow to adjusted EBITDA conversion is defined as free cash flow divided by adjusted EBITDA.\nCF Industries built for the long-term\n2,700 16 0.17\nemployees Ammonia RIR(1)\nHeadquartered in\nworldwide production Industry\nNorthbrook, IL\nplants leading safety\n“We believe operational excellence, outstanding safety and resulting\nhigh asset utilization, is a hallmark of the CF Industries team.”\n-TONY WILL, CEO & PRESIDENT\nCF $15B BBB $11B+\nLISTED Market Investment grade Returned to\nNYSE capitalization(2) rating shareholders\nover past 12 years(3)\nPublicly traded\nsince 2005\n(1) 12-month rolling average recordable incident rate per 200,000 work hours through June 30, 2024\n(2) Market capitalization as of August 31, 2024 4\n(3) Share repurchases and dividends from June 30, 2012 through June 30, 2024\nOur mission is to feed and fuel the world sustainably\nOur Mission, Vision, and Strategy\n5\nPathways to grow shareholder value\nDisciplined Invest in high\nLow-carbon ammonia Margin enhancing\ngrowth initiatives return projects\nproduction growth projects\n& clean energy within our network\nShare repurchases Return capital Inorganic growth Evaluate accretive\nand quarterly dividends to shareholders opportunities acquisitions\nCreating substantial value for long-term shareholders\n6\nCF Industries’ evolution to world’s largest ammonia producer\nAcquisition of Terra Industries\ndoubled production capacity First commercial scale green\nNorth America capacity ammonia production project\nincreased by 25%\nFounded as Central (expansion at Donaldsonville & Port Neal) North America capacity\nFarmers Fertilizer increased by ~10%\n(agricultural Strategic venture with CHS $2.8B(1) (Waggaman acquisition)\ncooperative) supply agreement which represented\n8.9% of CF’s total production capacity\n1946 2005 2010 2014 2016 2020 2021 2022 2023\nEvolved strategy\nIPO, listed to provide clean energy in the\non NYSE form of low-carbon ammonia\nSold phosphate business $1.4B\nLandmark\nCCS agreement\nwith ExxonMobil\n(1) The strategic venture with CHS Inc.

Management\nbelieves that EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, and free cash flow to adjusted EBITDA conversion, which are non-GAAP\nfinancial measures, provide additional meaningful information regarding the Company's performance and financial strength. Non-\nGAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company’s reported results prepared in\naccordance with GAAP. In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow,\nand free cash flow to adjusted EBITDA conversion included in this presentation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures\nof other companies. Reconciliations of EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow to the most directly comparable GAAP\nmeasures are provided in the tables accompanying this presentation.\nEBITDA is defined as net earnings attributable to common stockholders plus interest expense (income)—net, income taxes, and\ndepreciation and amortization. Other adjustments include the elimination of loan fee amortization that is included in both interest and\namortization, and the portion of depreciation that is included in noncontrolling interest. The Company has presented EBITDA\nbecause management uses the measure to track performance and believes that it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors\nand other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in the industry.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted with the selected items as summarized in the tables accompanying this\npresentation. The Company has presented adjusted EBITDA because management uses adjusted EBITDA, and believes it is useful\nto investors, as a supplemental financial measure in the comparison of year-over-year performance.\nFree cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, as stated in the consolidated statements of cash flows,\nreduced by capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interests. Free cash flow to adjusted EBITDA conversion is\ndefined as free cash flow divided by adjusted EBITDA.\nIndustry leading operational excellence drives cash generation\n$276M $511M $2.3B $1.7B\nQ3 2024 Q3 2024 LTM Cash from LTM Capital Returned to\nNet Earnings Adjusted EBITDA(1) Operations Shareholders (2)\n$890M $1.7B $1.5B $1.4B\n9M 2024 9M 2024 LTM FCF(3) Remaining in Current $3B\nNet Earnings Adjusted EBITDA(1) Share Repurchase\nAuthorization\n0.17 ~93% 65%\nWorld’s Largest\nAmmonia Producer\n12-month Rolling Average Q3 2024 Q3 2024 LTM FCF/Adj\nRecordable Incident Rate(4) Capacity Utilization EBITDA Conversion(5)\n(1) See appendix for reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measure\n(2) Last twelve months share repurchases and dividends through September 30, 2024\n(3) See appendix for reconciliation of free cash flow to the most directly comparable GAAP measure\n(4) Per 200,000 work hours as of September 30, 2024\n(5) Represents Q3 2024 LTM free cash flow divided by Q3 2024 LTM adjusted EBITDA; see appendix for reconciliations of free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA to the most directly\ncomparable GAAP measures\n4\nFirst nine months and third quarter 2024 adjusted EBITDA\n9M 2024 vs 9M 2023 Adjusted EBITDA(1) Q3 2024 vs Q3 2023 Adjusted EBITDA(1)\n$ millions $ millions\n$2,168\n$40 $511\n$52\n$390 $1,722\n$445\n$(13)\n$(40) $(13)\n$(680)\n$(116)\nAdj.
