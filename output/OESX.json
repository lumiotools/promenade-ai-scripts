These advanced alternatives to fluorescents provide not only better light quality but also significant savings in energy and maintenance costs. As we transition to a more sustainable future, LEDs stand out as the safer, more efficient choice for illuminating our spaces.[](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/website-pages/edit-content-in-a-rich-text-module)\n\n![](https://www.orionlighting.com/hubfs/Website%20Design/deco-white-dots-flipped.svg)\n\n## Key Reasons Fluorescent Lighting Is Becoming Non-Compliant\n\n**Fluorescents** | **Orion LEDs**  \n---|---  \n**Energy Efficiency** | Convert only **20-25%** of energy into light, with the rest lost to heat and unwanted light dispersion. | Convert up to **95%** of energy into light, with no heat produced and precise light distribution to target areas.  \n**Lifespan** | Last only**15,000** + hours | Last
