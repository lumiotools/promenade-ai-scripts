NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND GOING CONCERN\nAmerican Lithium Corp. (the “Company”) was incorporated in the Province of British Columbia. The\nCompany is engaged in the business of identification, acquisition, and exploration of mineral interests\nin the United States of America and Peru. The Company’s head office is located at 710 – 1030 West\nGeorgia Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, V6E 2Y3, Canada, and its registered and records office is\nlocated at Suite 2200, 885 West Georgia Street, Vancouver, BC, V6C 3E8, Canada. The Company’s\ncommon shares are listed for trading on Tier 2 of the TSX Venture Exchange (the “Exchange”) under\nthe symbol “LI”, the NASDAQ exchange under the symbol “AMLI”, and on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange\nunder the symbol “5LA”.\nThe Company is in the process of exploring its principal mineral properties and has not yet determined\nwhether the properties contain ore reserves that are economically recoverable. The recoverability of\namounts shown as exploration and evaluation assets is dependent upon the discovery of economically\nrecoverable reserves, the confirmation of the Company's interest in the underlying mineral claims, the\nability of the Company to obtain necessary financing to complete the development and upon future\nprofitable production or proceeds from the disposition thereof.\nThese condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of\naccounting principles applicable to a going concern which assumes that the Company will be able to\nrealize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. As at May 31, 2024 the\nCompany had a working capital position of $11,422,074 (February 28, 2024 - $16,323,474), and for the\nthree months ended May 31, 2024, incurred a net loss of $7,192,604 (May 31, 2023 – $11,125,623).\nFurthermore, as at May 31, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $166,363,941 (February\n28, 2024 – $159,171,337), which has been funded primarily by the issuance of equity. The Company's\nability to continue as a going concern and to realize assets at their carrying values is dependent upon\nobtaining additional financing. Though the Company has raised financing in the past, there is no\nguarantee that it will be able to in the future. As at May 31, 2024, management believes that the\nCompany has sufficient working capital to meet the Company’s obligations over the ensuing twelve-\nmonth period from the date of the statement of financial position.\n2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nStatement of compliance\nThese condensed interim consolidated financial statements, including comparatives, have been\nprepared in accordance with International Accounting Standards (“IAS”) 34, “Interim Financial Reporting”\nusing accounting policies consistent with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued\nby the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and Interpretations issued by the International\nFinancial Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”).\nCertain accounts have been reclassified to be consistent with the current period classification.\nThese consolidated financial statements were approved and authorized for issue by the Board of\nDirectors on July 12, 2024.\nBasis of measurement\nThese condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost\nbasis except for certain financial instruments that are measured at fair value. In addition, the\nconsolidated financial statements have been prepared using the accrual basis of accounting except for\ncash flow disclosure.\n8\nAmerican Lithium Corp.\nNotes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the three months ended May 31, 2024 and 2023\n(Expressed in Canadian Dollars – unaudited)\n2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION (continued)\nThe condensed interim consolidated financial statements are presented in Canadian dollars unless\notherwise noted. The Canadian dollar is also the functional currency of the Company and its\nsubsidiaries, except for Macusani Yellowcake S.A.C. and Macusani Uranium S.A.C. where the\nfunctional currency is the United States dollar.\nPrinciples of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and the following\nsubsidiaries:\nName Jurisdiction\nAmerican Lithium Holdings Corp. British Columbia, Canada\nBig Smoky Holdings, Inc. Nevada, USA\nTonopah Lithium Corp. Nevada, USA\nMaran Ventures Ltd. (\"Maran\") Nevada, USA\nPlateau Energy Metals Inc. (“Plateau”) Ontario, Canada\nMacusani Yellowcake S.A.C. Peru\nMacusani Uranium S.A.C. Peru\nAll intercompany transactions, balances, revenue and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. During\nthe year ended February 28, 2023, the Company amalgamated 1032701 Nevada Ltd., 1065604 Nevada\nLtd., 1067323 Nevada Ltd., 1134989 Nevada Ltd., 1301420 Nevada Ltd., and 4286128 Nevada Corp.\nas one company under Tonopah Lithium Corp. In addition, the Company amalgamated Big Smoky\nHoldings Corp. as one company under American Lithium Holdings Corp.\nSubsidiaries are entities over which the Company has exposure to variable returns from its involvement\nand has the ability to use power over the investee to affect its returns. The existence and effect of\npotential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing\nwhether the Company controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which\ncontrol is transferred to the Company until the date on which control ceases.\n3. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION\nThese condensed interim consolidated financial statements do not include all the information required\nof the audited annual consolidated financial statements and is intended to provide users with an update\nin relation to events and transactions that are significant to an understanding of the changes in the\nfinancial position and performance of the Company since the end of the last annual reporting period.\nThe accounting policies followed in these condensed consolidated interim financial statements are the\nsame as those applied in the Company’s most recent audited consolidated annual financial statements\nfor the year ended February 29, 2024. Therefore, it is recommended that these condensed interim\nconsolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the audited annual consolidated financial\nstatements of the Company for the years ended February 29,2024 and February 28, 2023.\n9\nAmerican Lithium Corp.\nNotes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the three months ended May 31, 2024 and 2023\n(Expressed in Canadian Dollars – unaudited)\n3. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (continued)\nJudgements and estimates\nThe preparation of annual consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires\nmanagement to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting\npolicies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities as at the date of the\nconsolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the\nreporting period. Estimates and assumptions are continuously evaluated and are based on\nmanagement’s experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed\nto be reasonable under the circumstances. However, actual outcomes can differ from these estimates.\nThe results of estimates form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and\nliabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting\nestimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that\nperiod or in the period of the revision and further periods if the review affects both current and future\nperiods.\nThe key areas of judgement and estimation impacting these consolidated financial statements are as\nfollows:\nCarrying value of exploration and evaluation assets\n The Company’s exploration and evaluation assets represent its most significant asset on the\nstatement of financial position. The Company’s management applies its judgement, using facts\nand circumstances available at the time, to determine whether the exploration and evaluation\nasset value may be realized. For each of its projects, the Company reviews its right to the\nclaims/concessions, future plans and exploration or development progress to determine if it\nshould test the respective projects for impairment. There is significant judgement involved in\ndetermining if a project shows impairment indicators that may impact the carrying value of\nexploration and evaluation assets.\nValuation of share-based compensation awards\n Stock options are valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with inputs that can\nsignificantly impact the calculated value. Typical inputs into the Black-Scholes option pricing\nmodel include: exercise price, historical volatility, time to expiration and risk-free discount rates.\nHistorical volatility and risk-free discount rates in particular require judgement around the\nreference period or benchmark rate used as inputs into the Black-Scholes option pricing model.\nValuation of common shares and common share purchase warrants received from investment in Surge\nBattery Metals Inc. (note 6)\n The Company’s investment in Surge Battery Metals Inc. required the use of the Black-Scholes\noption pricing model to determine the discount for lack of marketability applied to the initial value\nof the Surge common shares and to value the Surge common share purchase warrants. Typical\ninputs into the Black-Scholes option pricing model include: exercise price, historical volatility,\ntime to expiration and risk-free discount rates. Historical volatility and risk-free discount rates in\nparticular require judgement around the reference period or benchmark rate used as inputs into\nthe Black-Scholes option pricing model.\n10\nAmerican Lithium Corp.\nNotes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the three months ended May 31, 2024 and 2023\n(Expressed in Canadian Dollars – unaudited)\n3. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (continued)\nDetermination of significant influence\n The accounting for investments in other companies can vary depending on the degree of control\nand influence over those other companies. Management is required to assess at each reporting\ndate the Company’s control and influence over these other companies. Management has used\nits judgment to determine which companies are controlled and require consolidation and those\nwhich are significantly influenced and require equity accounting. As at May 31, 2024, the\nCompany determined it has significance influence in Surge Battery Metals Inc. (note 6).\nAccounting pronouncements not yet adopted\nIFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements, which will replace IAS 1, Presentation of\nFinancial Statements aims to improve how companies communicate in their financial statements, with\na focus on information about financial performance in the statement of profit or loss, in particular\nadditional defined subtotals, disclosures about management-defined performance measures and new\nprinciples for aggregation and disaggregation of information. IFRS 18 is accompanied by limited\namendments to the requirements in IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows. IFRS 18 is effective from 1 January\n2027. Companies are permitted to apply IFRS 18 before that date.\nThe Company has performed an assessment of new standards issued by the IASB that are not yet\neffective and has determined that any standards that have been issued would have no or very minimal\nimpact on the Company’s condensed interim consolidated financial statements.\n4. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\nMay 31, 2024 February 29, 2024\n$ $\nCash held in banks 1,702,714 2,082,134\nRedeemable guaranteed investment certificates 7,262,287 9,807,282\n8 ,965,001 1 1,889,416\nThe Company’s cash and cash equivalents include an aggregate of $7,262,287 in redeemable\nguaranteed investment certificates (“GICs”) including accumulated interest from Canadian financial\ninstitutions, which earn interest at rates ranging from 4.40% - 5.70% per annum and mature between\nOctober 24, 2024, and January 10, 2025.\nThe Company’s GICs that are included in cash and cash equivalents are fully redeemable without a loss\nof accumulated interest.\n5. SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT\nAs part of the Company’s strategic investment in Surge Battery Metals Inc.’s (“Surge”) private placement\n(note 6), the Company was issued 13,400,000 common share purchase warrants (“Warrants”). The\nWarrants are exercisable at $0.55 per Warrant for a period of three years from June 9, 2023. The\nWarrants are financial assets carried at FVTPL and are revalued at each reporting period end.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of changes in the carrying value of the Warrants.\n11\nAmerican Lithium Corp.\nNotes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the three months ended May 31, 2024 and 2023\n(Expressed in Canadian Dollars – unaudited)\n5. SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT (continued)\n$\nBalance, February 28, 2023 -\nAllocated transaction value of Surge's Warrants (note 6) 2 ,297,143\nDeferred gain on Warrants (note 6) 2 ,526,857\nFair value of Warrants at date of acquisition 4 ,824,000\nLoss on short-term investment for year ended February 29, 2024 (372,520)\nBalance, February 29, 2024 4 ,451,480\nLoss on short-term investment for the period ended May 31, 2024 (1,484,720)\nBalance, May 31, 2024 2 ,966,760\nThe Company determined the fair value of the Surge Warrants at May 31, 2024 was $2,966,760\n(February 29, 2024 - $4,451,480) and therefore recognized an unrealized loss of $1,484,720 for the\nthree months ended May 31, 2024 (May 31, 2024 - $nil).\nThe fair value of Surge’s Warrants at May 31, 2024 was determined using the following inputs:\nMay 31, 2024\nExpected volatility 123%\nRisk-free interest rate 4.17%\nSpot Price 0.39\nExercise Price 0.55\nTime to expiration 2.02 years\nDividend yield Nil\nFor the three months ended May 31, 2024, the Company recognized $210,571 (May 31, 2024 - $nil) of\nthe deferred gain of Warrants recognized on the date of acquisition. The remaining liability of $1,684,572\n(of which $842,286 is short-term) will be recognized over the term of the Warrants.\n6. INVESTMENT IN SURGE BATTERY METALS INC.\nOn June 9, 2023, the Company completed a strategic investment in Surge, a company incorporated in\nCanada, whose principal business activity is the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral\nproperties in Nevada.\nSurge closed the first tranche of a non-brokered private placement financing by issuing 13,400,000 units\n(“Units”) at a price of $0.40 per Unit to the Company for a total transaction value of $5,360,000. Each\nUnit consists of one common share and one Warrant exercisable at $0.55 per Warrant for a period of\nthree years from the date of issuance and is subject to a 4-month hold.\nThe allocation of the transaction value to the Surge common shares and Warrants at June 9, 2023 was\ndetermined based on the relative fair values of each asset, $3,062,857 and $2,297,143, respectively. The\ncommon shares were valued based on the market price of Surge's common shares on the date of the\ntransaction multiplied by a discount for lack of marketability (\"DLOM\") of 22.6%, determined by utilizing\nthe Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Warrants were valued using Black-Scholes option pricing\nmodel with the spot price of the Warrants based on the DLOM price of Surge's common shares to reflect\nthe 4-month hold period.\n12\nAmerican Lithium Corp.\nNotes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the three months ended May 31, 2024 and 2023\n(Expressed in Canadian Dollars – unaudited)\n6. INVESTMENT IN SURGE BATTERY METALS INC. (continued)\nThe following Black-Scholes assumptions were utilized to value the discount for lack of marketability on\nthe common shares and the Warrants at June 9, 2023:\nCommon Shares Warrants\n4-month hold\nExpected volatility 102% 132%\nRisk-free interest rate 4.08% 4.08%\nSpot Price 0 .62 0.48\nExercise Price 0 .62 0.55\nTime to expiration 4 months 3 years\nDividend yield Nil Nil\nThe Company determined that the fair value of Surge’s Warrants acquired was $4,824,000 at June 9,\n2023. Since the fair value of this financial instrument exceeded the Unit offering’s allocated transaction\nvalue of $2,297,143, and the fair value is not based solely on observable inputs, $2,526,857 was\nrecorded as a deferred gain, which is recognized over the three-year life of the Warrants (note 5).\nAfter initial recognition, the Surge common shares and Warrants are separate financial assets, and\ntherefore are valued separately. The Company determined that, through a combination of its\nshareholdings and its board representation, has significant influence over Surge on the date of\nacquisition, and therefore accounts for the investment using the equity method. The Warrants are fair\nvalued at each reporting date (note 5).\nAs at May 31, 2024, the Company owns 13,400,000 shares of Surge, representing approximately 8.32%\nownership of the investee, and has one of the five board of director seats of Surge.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\nThe Company’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Company’s ability to continue\nas a going concern in order to pursue the exploration and development of its mineral properties and to\nmaintain a flexible capital structure for its projects for the benefit of its stakeholders, to maintain\ncreditworthiness and to maximize returns for shareholders over the long-term. The Company does not\nhave any externally imposed capital requirements to which it is subject. As the Company is in the\nexploration stage, its principal source of funds is from the issuance of common shares. The Company\nincludes the components of shareholders’ equity in its management of capital.\nThe Company manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in\neconomic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. To maintain or adjust the\ncapital structure, the Company may attempt to issue new shares to raise cash and obtain bridging loans\nfrom related parties. The Company’s investment policy is to invest its cash in low-risk investment\ninstruments in financial institutions with terms to maturity selected with regards to the expected time of\nexpenditures from continuing operations.\nThere were no changes in the Company’s management of capital during the three months ended May\n31, 2024.\n14.

As at May 31, 2024, the Company classifies its short-term investment as\nFVTPL and its remaining financial instruments at amortized cost. For financial instruments at amortized\ncost, their carrying values approximate their fair values because of their current nature. The carrying\nvalue of the Company’s lease liability is measured at the present value of the discounted future cash\nflows.\nThe Company classifies financial instruments carried at fair value according to the following hierarchy\nbased on the amount of observable inputs used to value the financial instrument:\nLevel 1 – Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the\nreporting date. Active markets are those in which transactions occur in sufficient frequency and volume\nto provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.\nLevel 2 – Fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices that are\nobservable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices).\nLevel 3 – Valuations in this level are those with inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on\nobservable market data. The Company’s Surge Warrants (short-term investment) are classified under\nLevel 3.\nThe Company’s financial instruments are exposed to the following risks:\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to\nmeet its contractual obligations.

The Company’s primary focus consists\nof the following projects: the Tonopah Lithium Claims project in Nevada (the “TLC Project”); its Falchani\nlithium concessions in Peru (the “Falchani Lithium Project” or “Falchani”); and its uranium concessions in\nPeru (the “Macusani Uranium Project” or “Macusani”).\nThe Company is pursuing development of its two lithium projects, the TLC Project and the Falchani Lithium\nProject, with Prefeasibility Study (“PFS”) work initiated on both projects. For the Macusani Uranium Project,\nthe Company has engaged in work to update the existing Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) (which\nwas published in February of 2016) and then move to PFS. The Company recognizes that each of these\nProjects has the potential for continued development and future commercialization.\nCompany highlights for the three-month period ended May 31, 2024\n Falchani Flow Sheet Optimization & Improvements - On June 27, 2024, the Company announced\npositive results from Falchani process test work ongoing at ANSTO laboratories, which should\nimprove Falchani economics further. Employing counter current leaching/recycling results in 50%\nreduction in acid consumption and severely reduces reagent requirements for neutralization.\nEmploying solvent extraction (“SX”) improves the purity of lithium carbonate produced, SX has the\npotential to simplify the flow sheet reducing the number of impurity removal stages required, and\nimproves the quality of potential by-products – cesium sulfate (“CS”) and sulfate of potash (“SOP).\n Major Peruvian ESG Initiative - March 25, 2024, the Company announced a major ESG project.\nThe solar electrification program is a joint initiative with the Peruvian Armed Forces involving\ninstallation of solar panels in remote homes that lack electricity. The Company plans to install 1,000\nunits this year to benefit the five Andean communities surrounding the Falchani Lithium and\nMacusani Uranium Projects. Each solar unit powers a lithium-ion battery, four LED lightbulbs, a\nflashlight, portable radio, and USB ports for charging cell phones. This transformative project is\nproviding needed electricity to isolated farms and dwellings and, amongst numerous benefits, is\nenabling children to read and study after dusk.\nOthe recent developments\n Robust Economics for Falchani PEA - On January 10, 2024, the Company announced results from\nthe updated PEA for the Falchani Lithium Project completed by DRA Global. The results highlight\nFalchani as a long-life, low-cost potential lithium production centre with the opportunity to produce\nsulfate of potash (“SOP”) fertilizer and cesium sulfate as valuable by-products. The updated PEA Li-\nonly base case highlights include: After-tax Net Present Value (“NPV8%\") of $5.11 billion at\n$22,500/tonne (\"t\") Lithium Carbonate Equivalent (“LCE”) selling price; After-tax internal rate of return\n(“IRR”) of 32.0%; with Operating Costs (“Opex”) of $5,092/t LCE. Unless otherwise stated, all dollar\nfigures are in United States dollars. The completion of the Falchani Lithium Project’s updated PEA\nwas an important step towards the expediting of Falchani’s Pre-Feasibility Study (“PFS”). The\naccompanying technical report titled: “Falchani Lithium Project NI 43-101 Technical Report –\nPreliminary Economic Assessment” dated February 22, 2024 with an effective date of January 10,\n2024 prepared by DRA Global and Stantec Consulting Inc. was filed February 23, 2024.\n3\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\n TLC Deposit Expansion - On December 8, 2023, the Company announced results from 14 step out\ndrill holes expanding the measured resource footprint at the TLC Project. A total of 26 diamond core\nholes and 16 Reverse Circulation (“RC”) holes drilled in 2022 and 2023 will be added to the updated\nmineral resource block model and incorporated into an updated Mineral Resource Estimate (“MRE”),\ncurrently underway with Stantec Consulting Inc.\n Filed Semi-Detailed Environmental Impact Assessment Study - On November 28, 2023, the\nCompany announced that it has completed and submitted the Semi-Detailed Environmental Impact\nAssessment Study (“EIA-sd”) for the Falchani Lithium Project to the Ministry of Energy and Mines.\nThe EIA-sd provides a framework for approval of all major phases required to finalize the\ndevelopment and construction of Falchani from mining reserve definition to completion of mine\nconstruction and, when approved, the EIA-sd provides authority to drill multiple holes from up to 420\ndrill platforms across the Falchani Lithium Project, with no additional exploration and development\npermits required.\n Positive Peruvian Superior Court Ruling - November 15, 2023 the Company announced that the\nthree judge tribunal of Peru’s Superior Court specialized in administration disputes unanimously\nupheld the ruling of the lower court judge in favour of the Company’s subsidiary, Macusani\nYellowcake in relation to title over 32 disputed concessions out of 172 owned by Macusani. The Court\nruling clearly maintains the Company’s rightful ownership of these concessions. INGEMMET and\nMINEM have subsequently filed petitions to the Supreme Court of Peru to hear the case. A decision\nby the Supreme Court on whether it will accept jurisdiction is expected in Mid2024.\n Falchani Resource Growth - On October 31, 2023, the Company announced an updated MRE for\nthe Falchani Lithium Project increasing the Measured and Indicated lithium resources 476% over the\nprevious March 2019 MRE for Falchani. The latest MRE for Falchani is: Measured Resource – 1.01\nmillion tonnes (“Mt”) LCE (69 Mt @ 2,792 ppm Li); Indicated Resource – 4.52 Mt LCE (378 Mt @\n2,251 ppm Li); and Inferred Resource – 3.99 Mt LCE (506 Mt @ 1,481 ppm Li). The accompanying\ntechnical report titled: “Technical Report and Mineral Resource Estimate - Falchani Property,\nCarabaya Province, Department of Puno, South-Eastern Peru” dated December 14, 2023, with an\neffective date of October 31, 2023, prepared by Stantec Consulting Inc. was filed on December 15,\n2023.\n New Lithium Discovery - On September 26, 2023, the Company announced a new lithium discovery\nat the Quelcaya exploration target, located 6 km west of the Falchani Lithium deposit in Peru. The\ninitial exploration discovery drill hole intersected large-scale lithium mineralization with 222.5 metres\naveraging 1,560 ppm Li from 119.1 m downhole with a maximum 1 m interval sample of 2,668 ppm\nLi at 335 m. The Company continues to assess the results from this drill program and the\nmetallurgical potential of the mineralization.\n Refinement of TLC Flowsheet - On September 7, 2023, the Company announced results of ongoing\nprocess work on the TLC Project, which show an increase in lithium carbonate purity, higher\nextraction rates at lower leach temperatures, significant potential for lower acid consumption and\npotential for lower lithium losses during impurity removal. Further optimization work and process\nimprovements are expected to enhance project returns.\n Development of Macusani Uranium internally – On July 17, 2023, the Company announced the\ndecision to defer spin-out of its uranium asset and to advance the next phase of work within American\nLithium.\n Intersects of highest-grade Lithium and Cesium Samples encountered to date at Falchani -\nOn July 12, 2023, the Company announced assays of up to 5,645 ppm Lithium and up to 12,610\nppm Cesium.\n Strategic Transaction - On June 12, 2023, the Company completed a $5,360,000 strategic\ninvestment in Surge Battery Metals Inc. (“Surge”) and received common shares and common share\npurchase warrants of Surge. Surge’s primary asset is the Nevada North Lithium Project, for which\nSurge recently published a mineral resource estimate.\n4\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance\nThe Company places a large emphasis on ESG matters, enhancing its protocols through the engagement of\nOnyen Corporation to assist with implementation of ESG best practices and systems to measure and monitor\nperformance in these areas. In August 2023, the Company published its maiden ESG Report for the 2022\ncalendar year, which included the following highlights:\n Environmental Stewardship: Zero instances of non-compliance with environmental\nregulations.\n Ethics & Integrity: Anti-corruption training has been implemented for the Board of Directors\nand senior management.\n Human Rights and Diversity Policy: Commitments reference the Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights, the United Nations Guiding Principles, and international humanitarian law.\n Social Risk Management: Mechanisms in place through which early alerts are launched on\nrisks identified for the continuity of operations, and to address concerns, requests, and claims.\nThe full report may be accessed via the following link, or from the Company’s website:\nhttp://www.americanlithiumcorp.com/esg/\nThe Company continues to focus on environmental best practices and to prioritize community relations. The\nCompany conducted the annual community Christmas food and gift package distribution and facilitated the\nsemi-annual Mobile Medical and Dental Clinics in the local Andean communities near our Peruvian Projects\nin late 2022 and throughout 2023. Recently the Company has launched an initiative in conjunction with the\nPeruvian Army to fund and install up to 1,400 solar / battery systems into homes in its communities to supply\nlighting and charging capabilities enabling radio, Wi-Fi, and mobile connectivity. Installation of these systems\nis currently in progress. The Company also assists the community with continuous support for local education\n(teachers’ salaries and supplies) and health care (medical and health care support workers support).\nIn Nevada, the Company maintains cultural liaison with representatives of all three tribal groups who are\nbased around Tonopah. A cultural monitoring agreement is in place for pre-disturbance cultural surveys with\none tribe, and the Company has engaged in early project consultation with two other nearby tribes. The\nCompany once again is a sponsor the Nevada State Mining Championships held in Tonopah, NV in May\n2024, and raised awareness of the Company and the TLC Project through sponsorship and staffing of a\nbooth at the AEMA conference in Reno in early December 2023. The Company continues an environmental\nreclamation and remediation study with researchers at the University of Nevada, Reno, on seed coatings to\npromote faster and more efficient floral remediation of disturbed lands in Nevada.\nQualified Person and Technical Reports\nThe scientific and technical information contained in this MD&A has been reviewed and approved by Ted\nO’Connor, Executive Vice President of American Lithium, who is a Qualified Person as defined in National\nInstrument 43-101.\nCertain scientific and technical information contained in this MD&A with respect to the following projects has\nbeen taken from their related technical reports as indicated below:\n TLC Project - “Tonopah Lithium Claims Project NI 43-101 Technical Report – Preliminary Economic\nAssessment” with an effective date of January 31, 2023 and prepared by John Joseph Riordan,\nValentine Eugene Coetzee, of DRA Pacific and Derek J. Loveday, Satjeet Pandher, Joan C. Kester\nand Sean Ennis of Stantec Consulting Inc.\n Falchani Lithium Project – “Falchani Lithium Project NI 43-101 Technical Report Preliminary\nEconomic Assessment – Update” dated February 22, 2024, with an effective date of January 10,\n2024, prepared by John Joseph Riordan, Aveshan Naidoo, David Alan Thompson of DRA Pacific\nand Derek J. Loveday and Mariea Kartick of Stantec Consulting Inc.; “Technical Report and Mineral\nResource Estimate - Falchani Property, Carabaya Province, Department of Puno, South-Eastern\n5\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nPeru” dated December 14, 2023, with an effective date of October 31, 2023, prepared by Derek\nLoveday, P. Geo. and Mariea Kartick, P.Geo. of Stantec Consulting Services Inc.\n Macusani Uranium Project - “Macusani Project, Macusani, Peru, NI 43-101 Report – Preliminary\nEconomic Assessment” with an effective date of January 12, 2016 and prepared by Michael Short\nand Thomas Apelt of GBM Minerals Engineering Consultants Limited, David Young of The Mineral\nCorporation and Mark Mounde of Wardell Armstrong International Limited.\nThe most recent technical reports for the TLC project and the Falchani Lithium Project can be viewed on the\nCompany’s SEDAR+ profile at www.sedarplus.ca. The Macusani Uranium Project’s technical report can be\nfound under the SEDAR+ profile of the Company’s subsidiary, Plateau Energy Metals Inc.\nCertain technical information in this MD&A refers to the results of PEA’s prepared for the Projects. PEAs are\npreliminary in nature and include inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically\nto have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral\nreserves. There is no certainty the results of the PEA’s will be realized. Mineral resources are not mineral\nreserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. Additional work is required to upgrade the mineral\nresources to mineral reserves. In addition, the mineral resource estimates could be materially affected by\nenvironmental, geotechnical, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-political, marketing, or other relevant\nfactors.\nProject development updates\nThe Company’s plans are to continue to develop and de-risk the following projects:\nTLC Project - Targeting the completion of a PFS in 2025\nBulk sample and exploration / expansion drilling has been completed at the TLC Project to provide additional\nmetallurgical samples and evaluate / add additional higher grade target areas at the TLC Project, with an\nupdated MRE also initiated. 10-15 tonnes of high-grade lithium claystone mineralization have been prepared\nfrom the bulk sample drilling and will be used as material for the detailed preconcentration and metallurgical\ntesting required to further refine and enhance the TLC Flowsheet for its PFS and ahead of launching pilot\noperations.\nEnvironmental and cultural work is ongoing ahead of the full mine permitting process which will be formally\nlaunched at TLC following finalization of the PFS. To this end, SRK Consulting (U.S.) Inc. of Elko, Nevada\nhas been engaged to coordinate the preparation of a mine plan of Operations with the BLM and Nexus\nEnvironmental Consultants Inc. of Reno, Nevada has been engaged to complete biological baseline studies\nin support of the Mine Plan of Operations application.\nFalchani Lithium Project – Targeting the completion of a PFS by H1 2025\nEIA drilling has been completed with an updated MRE completed in October 2023, and filed on December\n15, 2023. Following this filing, an updated PEA was completed (filed on February 23, 2024) incorporating the\nupdated MRE, adding potential cesium and potassium by-products, with updated project economics including\nthe latest lithium pricing. Both reports are key steps in the finalization of the Falchani Lithium Project PFS,\nexpected in H2 2025. The Company also continues to optimize its flow sheet ahead of finalizing PFS.\nEnvironmental work required for pre-feasibility, feasibility studies and ultimately mine permitting on the\nFalchani Lithium Project commenced in the fall of 2022 with the initiation of an EIA which includes detailed\nhydrological / hydrogeological studies focusing on the upper 150m below surface to investigate water table\nparameters. This program also enabled the recovery of core for resource expansion and reclassification and\nreclassification and formed part of the updated MRE completed by Stantec Consulting Inc. (“Stantec”) in\nNovember 2023. The EIA drilling confirmed no water table issues at Falchani, and 4 piezometers were\ninstalled to monitor seasonal water flows. The EIA-sd for the Falchani Lithium Project has been submitted to\nMINEM. The EIA-sd provides a framework for approval of all major phases required to finalize the\ndevelopment of Falchani from mining reserve definition to completion of mine construction and when\napproved, provides authority to drill up to 420 drill platforms across the Falchani Lithium Project, with no\nadditional permits required. It is anticipated that the full EIA will be complete following completion of PFS at\nFalchani.\n6\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nIn addition to the in-fill, expansion, and resource reclassification drilling undertaken at the Falchani Lithium\nProject, the Company also launched initial exploration / discovery drilling at two new lithium target areas at\nQuelcaya, approximately 6 -11 km west of the Falchani Lithium Project. The initial exploration discovery at\nQuelcaya was announced September 26, 2023, with thick, large-scale lithium mineralization averaging 1,560\nppm Li over 222.5 m and up to 2,668 ppm. Follow up exploration and metallurgical work is recommended.\nMacusani Uranium Project – Targeting the completion of an updated PEA in H2 2024\nWith the significant improvement noted in the uranium business environment and future outlook fostered by\ndemand for clean energy, the Company will continuously monitor and determine its activities in the light of\nfavourable developments.\nThe flowsheet is at an advanced stage, and it is currently anticipated that piloting will commence in respect\nof the Macusani Uranium Project in 2024. In addition, with numerous in-fill and expansion targets identified,\nfurther drilling is planned during 2024 at Macusani to upgrade resource categories and expand the existing\nresource, pending the finalization of the necessary exploration permits. This will lead to an updated MRE.\nThe Company has also commenced updating the historic PEA on the Macusani Project which will use the\nexisting mineral resource model, establish an updated mine schedule incorporating results of the latest pre-\nconcentration, metallurgical and process improvements and update commodity pricing from the original\nUS$50 per lb used in the historic PEA to reflect current more robust pricing.\nProperties – Background and Technical Reports\nTLC Project – Nevada, USA\nSince 2016, the Company has acquired, through a series of transactions, the control of unpatented lode\nmining claims in Nevada’s Nye and Esmeralda counties and now controls a total of approximately 12,511\nacres of contiguous land highly prospective for lithium and which comprise the TLC Project. The TLC Project\nhas been under exploration and development by the Company since 2019. Lithium claystone mineralization\nis found consistently in near surface drilling and sampling across a >20 km2 area and is open to expansion\nprimarily to the south and west sides of the project.\nIn addition, the Company has acquired agricultural lands with accompanying water rights to secure water for\nthe project for the long term. The outright ownership of the subject properties will provide close to 2,500 acre-\nfeet of combined water rights which should provide sufficient water for at least the initial phases of any future\nproduction at the TLC Project and a strong base for any future expansion phases.

The PEA\ndemonstrates that the TLC project has the potential to become a substantial, long-life producer of low-cost\nlithium carbonate with the potential to produce either battery grade LCE or lithium hydroxide (“LiOH”). The\nPEA base case envisions an initial 4.4 Million tonnes per annum (“Mtpa”) processing throughput expanding\nto 8.8Mtpa. The PEA alternative case is identical, but with added production of high purity magnesium sulfate\nas a by-product over life of operations. Unless otherwise stated, all dollar figures are in US currency.\n9\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nTLC Project PEA - Highlights (Base Case – Ramp-up Production Li only production):\n Pre-tax NPV : $3.64 billion at $20,000/t LCE; After-tax NPV : $3.26 billion at $20,000/t LCE\n8% 8%\n Pre-tax IRR: 28.8%; After-tax IRR: 27.5%\n PEA mine plan produces: 1.46 Mt LCE Life-of-Mine (“LOM”) over 40 years\n Pre-tax initial capital payback period: 3.6 years; after-tax payback: 3.7 years**\n Average LOM annual pre-tax cash flow: $435 million; annual after-tax cash flow: $396 million\n Initial Capital Costs (“Capex”): $819 million\n Total Capex: $1,431 million; Sustaining Capital: $792 million\n Opex: $7,443/t LCE inclusive of power credits\n** Payback is based on Phase 1 capital alone, with undiscounted cashflows\nTLC Project PEA - Highlights (Alternate Case – Ramp-Up Production Li + Magnesium Sulfate production):\n Pre-tax NPV : $6.06 billion at $20,000/t LCE & $150/t MgSO After-tax NPV : $5.16 billion at\n8% 4; 8%\n$20,000/t LCE & $150/t MgSO\n4\n Pre-tax IRR: 38.6%; After-tax IRR: 36.0%\n PEA mine plan produces:1.46 Mt LCE and 64.9 Mt MgSO LOM over 40 years\n4\n Pre-tax initial capital payback period: 2.6 years; after-tax payback: 2.8 years\n Average LOM pre-tax annual cash flow: $684 million; annual after-tax cash flow: $591 million\n Initial Capex: $827 million\n Total Capex: $1,439 million; Sustaining Capital: $763 million\n Opex: at $7,443/t LCE inclusive of power credits\n Opex: $817/t LCE, inclusive of power & MgSO credits\n4\nRefer to section “Qualified Person and Technical Reports” above in this MD&A for risks associated with PEAs.\nTLC Project PEA - Mine Life & Production\n Simple truck and shovel open pit mining of the shallow resource underpins the scalable, long-life, lithium\nproject producing approximately 24,000 tpa LCE over Years 1-6 once steady state production is achieved\nand expanding to 48,000 tpa LCE productionfor Years 7-19 when mining ceases. Rehandling of the\n>1,000 parts per million (“ppm”) stockpile allows production to continue for Years 20-40.\n Average LOM Production of approximately 38,000 tpa LCE for 40 years.\n 1,400 ppm feed material beneficiation increases the head grade to leaching to 2,000 ppm Li.\n LOM Strip Ratio (Waste:Ore) of 0.93:1 with a maximum final pit depth of ~325-350’, well above the water\ntable depth.\n Where possible, progressive reclamation of mining areas is planned along with in-pit back-filling of waste\nrock and filtered tailings.\n Sulfuric acid leaching using industry standard techniques and flowsheet produces high purity lithium\ncarbonate to enable the production of battery grade LCE or LiOH.\n PEA study estimates that for an additional $100M (Installed) Capex, and $406/t LCE Opex, a final\nconversion and refining processing step will enable the production of battery grade LiOH; or\n End users have the flexibility of acquiring high purity LCE from TLC and converting it themselves to\nwhichever product is required.\n Magnesium sulphate (monohydrate) is an increasingly important fertilizer add-on product with a large\nand growing global market.

The recent prospecting and mapping activities\ndemonstrate that new lithium occurrences in the vicinity of the Quelcaya village are more extensive than\ninitially modelled. In addition, and as set out above, the Company was able to expand and reclassify the\nexisting resource in Q4 2023 based on EIA drilling in 2022 and 2023. The Company is also targeting\nadditional infill and extension drilling at Falchani with these results to be incorporated into Falchani’s PFS.\nFurthermore, the Company has discovered a new area within the Quelcaya village, 6 kilometers west of the\nFalchani deposit. The discovery hole intersected lithium mineralization over 222.5 m in subvolcanic intrusive\nrocks averaging 1,560 ppm Li from 119.1 m downhole.\n14\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFalchani and Quelcaya Project Location Map\nA 10-hole hydrology diamond drill program that is part of the environmental work required for an\nEnvironmental Impact Assessment (“EIA”) on the project which will provide the framework for, and be a key\npart of, the Mine Permitting Process was completed in September 2023 on the Falchani Lithium Project, led\nby SRK Peru. No groundwater has been encountered in any of the EIA drill holes.\nAdditional exploration and development work has been planned to support further extension/in-fill drilling at\nthe Falchani Lithium Project should this prove necessary / desirable and would commence following approval\nof the EIA-sd filed in November 2023 with the Peruvian authorities and currently expected during H2 2024.\nLocal community acceptance and approvals have been granted and archeological and environmental\nsampling work has been concluded.\nANSTO continues to investigate optimizing the Falchani flow sheet with recent results announced June 27,\n2024. These positive results should improve Falchani economics further. Employing counter current\nleaching/recycling results in 50% reduction in acid consumption and significantly reduces reagent\nrequirements for neutralization. Employing solvent extraction (“SX”) improves the purity of lithium carbonate\nproduced with the potential to simplify the flow sheet reducing the number of impurity removal stages\nrequired, and improves the quality of potential by-products – cesium sulfate (“CS”) and sulfate of potash\n(“SOP).\nTECMMINE in Peru continues to run numerous additional full cycle tests on the existing “lithium-only” flow-\nsheet and continues to produce high purity LC with purities between 99.50% – 99.87% LC. (above typical\nbattery grade designation)\nFalchani Lithium Project PEA\nAn updated MRE was completed by Stantec Consulting Services Inc. and announced October 31, 2023,\nexpanding the contained lithium resources in the Measured & Indicated categories by 476%. The Falchani\nLithium Project resource is comprised primarily of three zones, namely the upper breccia unit (“UBX”), lithium-\nrich tuff unit (“LRT”) and lower breccia unit (“LBX”), in order of stratigraphy. A lower grade Li-rich subvolcanic\nintrusion (Coarse Felsic Intrusion) forms the basement to the Falchani volcanic stratigraphy, and contributes\nto the overall MRE Inferred category.\n15\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nUsing the updated MRE completed by Stantec (filed December 15, 2023), an updated PEA was completed\nby DRA Global and filed on February 23, 2024, demonstrating that the Falchani Lithium Project has the\npotential to become a substantial, low-cost, long-life producer of high purity lithium carbonate with the\npotential to also produce SOP and Cesium Sulfate (“CsS” or “Cs SO4”) by-products alongside LCE. Key\n2\nhighlights and figures of the updated PEA can be found below.\nThe Falchani Lithium Project’s updated MRE and updated PEA both include the Falchani and Ocacasa 4\nconcessions based on the most recent legal decision confirming the Company’s ownership of all concessions.\nHowever, please refer to the “Cautionary Note Regarding Concessions” section in this MD&A.\nThe PEA base case envisions an initial 1.5 Mtpa processing throughput (Years 1-5), expanding to 3.0 Mtpa\n(Years 6-10) and ultimately ramping up to 6.0 Mtpa (Years 11-43) with 32 years of mining followed by 11\nyears of stockpile processing. The PEA alternative processing case is identical, but with added production of\nhigh purity SOP and Cs SO as by-products from Years 6-43 alongside the initial expansion. Unless\n2 4\notherwise stated, all dollar figures are in US currency.\nFalchani Lithium Project PEA - Highlights (Base Case – Li only production):\n Pre-tax NPV : $8.41 billion at $22,500/tonne (“t”) LCE; After-tax NPV : $5.11 billion at $22,500/t\n8% 8%\nLCE\n Pre-tax IRR: 40.7%; After-tax IRR: 32.0%\n Pre-tax initial capital payback period: 2.5 years; After-tax payback: 3.0 years\n Average LOM annual pre-tax cash flow: $1,003 million; Annual after-tax cash flow: $628 million\n Initial Capex: $681 million\n Total Capex (Phases 1, 2 & 3): $2,565 million; Sustaining Capital: $236 million\n Opex: $5,092/t LCE\n PEA mine plan produces: 2.64 Mt LCE LOM over 43 years\no Phase 1: 23,000 tpa LCE; Phase 2: 45,000 tpa; and Phase 3: 84,000 tpa\nFalchani Lithium Project PEA Highlights (Alternate Case – Li-only in Phase 1; SOP + Cs SO added from\n2 4\nPhase 2):\n Identical LCE production scenario, but with added average production of 81,556 tpa of SOP and 3,796\ntpa of CsS from Years 6-43;\n Pre-tax NPV :$9.25 billion at $22,500/t LCE, $1,000/t SOP & $58,000/t Cs SO ; After-tax NPV :\n8% 2 4 8%\n$5.59 billion at $22,500/t LCE, $1,000/t SOP & $58,000/t Cs SO\n2 4\n Pre-tax IRR: 38.5%; After-tax IRR: 29.9%\n Pre-tax initial capital payback period: 2.5 years; after-tax payback: 3.0 years\n Average LOM pre-tax annual cash flow: $1,211 million; annual after-tax cash flow: $758 million\n Initial Capex: $681 million\n Total Capex: $3,466 million; Sustaining Capital: $260 million\n Opex: $5,705/t LCE (for all products)\n Opex: $1,361/t LCE, inclusive of SOP & Cs SO credits\n2 4\n PEA mine plan produces: 2.64 Mt LCE and 3.19 Mt SOP and 147,000t Cs SO LOM over 43 years\n2 4\nFalchani Lithium Project PEA - Mine Life & Production\n Simple drill, blast, truck and shovel open pit mining of the near-surface, high-grade (>2,700 ppm Li)\nresource.\n Mining ceases at the end of year 32 and rehandling of the <2,700 ppm Li stockpile allows production to\ncontinue for Years 33-43.\n Average LOM Production of approximately 61,400 tpa of 99.5% LCE for 43 years.\n LOM Strip Ratio (Waste:Ore) of 0.60:1 after accounting for processed stockpile material\n Sulfuric acid leaching using industry standard techniques and flowsheet produces high purity lithium\ncarbonate to enable the production of battery grade LCE.\n16\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\n SOP is an important fertilizer product for specialty crops, especially those grown in Peru (ex. avocado,\nblueberries, grapes & coffee) with a decent, and growing global market. SOP production from Falchani\nhas the potential to satisfy Peru’s domestic needs with additional export possibility.\n Cesium is used in high-pressure, high-temperature offshore oil and gas drilling and is used in infrared\ndetectors, optics, photoelectrical cells, scintillation counters and spectrometers. Isotopes of cesium are\natomic clocks necessary for aircraft guidance systems, global positioning satellites, and internet and cell\nphone applications.

Of Stantec Consulting Services Inc. in conformity with CIM\n“Estimation of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserves Best Practices” guidelines and are reported in accordance with the Canadian Securities Administrators NI\n43-101. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. The effective date of the Mineral Resource Estimate is\nOctober 30,2023. There is no certainty that any mineral resource will be converted into mineral reserve.\nThe mineral resource estimates are based on 12,317 m from 67 drill holes from 35 Platforms (2017 to 2023).\nSampling was carried out at sampling intervals of between 0.5m and 1.0m. Samples used throughout the\nestimation process were composited to a downhole length of 2.5m (see Figure: Falchani Lithium Project\nMineral Classification and Drill Platform Location Map, below).\n20\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFalchani Lithium Project Mineral Classification and Drill Platform Location Map\nFalchani Lithium Project - Environmental\nA baseline environmental study (the “Baseline Study”) undertaken by ACOMISA, a Lima-based\nenvironmental consulting company, and continued in collaboration with Anddes Asociados S.A.C. is ongoing.\nThe Baseline Study was expanded to include each of the Falchani Lithium Project and Macusani Uranium\nProject areas and now covers the relevant areas belonging to the communities of Isivilla, Tantamaco, Corani,\nChimboya and Paquaje, and Chacaconiza. This expanded Baseline Study was accepted by the Peruvian\nGovernment Agency SENACE (Servicio Nacional de Certificacion Ambiental) and built on previous\nenvironmental monitoring that was started by the Company in 2010 during the exploration phase of work.\nThe Baseline Study has recently progressed into an EIA that includes community relations and impacts of\nfuture development, as well as flora, fauna, water, air and noise sampling and comprehensive archaeological\nstudies.\n21\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nThe Company has also subsequently completed and submitted the semi-detailed EIA, covering the project,\nbuilding on the Environmental Baseline Study. The environmental work required for the PFS on the Falchani\nLithium project was led by SRK Peru, and includes detailed hydrological / hydrogeological studies focusing\non investigating water table parameters within the upper 120-150 m below surface. The Company anticipates\napproval of the semi-detailed EIA shortly and the full EIA following completion of PFS.\nThe Falchani Lithium Project lies outside of the Corani-Macusani Area of Cultural and Archaeological\nSignificance (“Archaeological Area of Interest”). Archaeological studies completed as part of our exploration\nprogram permitting and recent EIA study work have shown that to date, there are no sites of cultural or\narchaeological significance affecting the Falchani Lithium Project. The local landscape, landforms, higher\nelevation and rock weathering style at the project was not conducive for hosting, or preservation of, sites of\narchaeological significance. An overview of the results of the archaeological studies, including excavations\navailable to date, is being prepared for presentation to the Ministry of Culture of Peru.\nMacusani Uranium Project – Puno, Peru\nThe Macusani Uranium Project is one of the largest undeveloped uranium projects in the world containing\nsignificant measured, indicated, and inferred uranium resources. Located approximately 25 kilometres away\nfrom the Company’s Falchani Lithium Project, the Macusani Uranium Project is proximal to excellent\ninfrastructure and although it currently has the benefit of significant historical work, includes a significantly\nunder explored land package. Planned near-term activities include the launch of a pilot operation to provide\nfinal validation of the flow sheet as well as to produce yellowcake for evaluation by interested strategic parties.\nA planned major expansion and infill drilling program to expand and reclassify the large historical resource\nwill follow upon receipt of final drill permits. In addition, the Company is currently updating the historic PEA\non Macusani for recent work, including on preconcentration, tank leaching vs heap leaching and updating the\nUS$50 commodity pricing for current market pricing.\nMacusani Uranium Project - PEA\nOn February 10, 2016, Plateau filed an updated PEA. The PEA was completed by UK based, mining\nengineering consultants Wardell Armstrong International and GBM Minerals Engineering Consultants Limited\nand contains a detailed base case which contemplates the construction of a conventional open pit mining\noperation, with a minor supplemental high-grade underground component feeding a centralized processing\nfacility.\nSix complexes covering multiple concessions contain mineral resources, four complexes are included in the\nMacusani Uranium Project PEA filed under Plateau’s profile on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca. Of these four\ncomplexes, three have portions of the mineral resources on concessions that have been subject to dispute\nand these have been protected by judicial rulings restoring concession title, rights, and validity to the\nCompany. (Refer to “Cautionary Note Regarding Concessions” section in this MD&A which contain details\non judicial processes relating to 32 of the Company’s concessions).\nProcessing work tailored towards upgrading, or pre-concentrating, through communition/concentration\nstudies on the uranium mineralization commenced in August 2020 with encouraging results released March\n30, 2021. The work utilized mineralization from 3 main deposits, with successful upgrading from all deposits\ntested. Uranium preferentially reports to the fine fraction with an upgrade factor of 2.3 in 30-35% of original\nmass. The upgrading results highlight the opportunity to bring in lower grade deposits previously not included\nin the PEA production schedule, and the higher-grade feed material should positively impact the PEA Capital\nCosts with a smaller plant footprint and PEA operating costs due to lower energy and reagent costs. Trade\noff studies between original heap leach processing and tank/vat leach processing options will be conducted\nusing the upgraded fraction achievable in a scrubbing and classification circuit.\nWork has started on updating the PEA for Macusani. DRA Global will use the existing historical resource\nestimate to develop a new mining block model and schedule with processing based on employing\npreconcentration in combination with tank leaching refinements developed and refined in recent years.\nPricing will also be updated to reflect the current more robust pricing environment.\n22\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nEnvironmental\nWithin the Macusani Uranium Project area lies an Archaeological Area of Interest which includes sites of\ncultural interest. The area boundaries are very clearly defined and are well-known to people working in the\nregion. The Company continues working with environmental and archaeological professionals, local\ncommunities, and Peruvian authorities to develop a plan to protect any sites located in proximity to the\nproposed future project operations. The Macusani Project and proposed future infrastructure for operations\ncurrently do not directly affect any such sites, and as such are not impacted by them.\nIn order to protect these sites of cultural interest and with the assistance of the Ministry of Culture of Peru,\nthe Company has spent the past three years conducting a professional archaeological study in the project\narea. This is a full archaeological research project that the Company’s team initiated and is still on-going.\nDesktop work is completed, and on-site work resumed in July 2022. Archeological study results will be\nsubmitted to the Peruvian Ministry of Culture following this final dry season field study.\nThe Company remains fully informed of the progress of this archeological study and is confident based on\nthe findings to date, that together with the qualified investigating team, it will work towards an outcome that\nrespects, salvages and preserves cultural heritage where it exists. In addition, all the recently validated\nartefacts are currently exposed to natural erosion and decay from the weather conditions that characterize\nthe Macusani plateau, therefore a preserving solution should be found. It is positive to see the government\nproactively working towards an actionable outcome on both accounts, and it is indicative of the level of\nsupport across the board for the Company’s projects.\nMacusani Project Exploration and Development Work\nSurface mapping, sampling and prospecting work for future target generation has continued while awaiting\ndrill permits. Exploration and resource expansion/extension drilling is expected to commence upon receipt of\npermitting approvals, expected in H2 2024. An update of the existing Macusani PEA based on the historical\nMRE and including pre-concentration and tank leach processing improvements should be completed in H2\n2024 following which PFS work will commence. As previously announced, the Company has had success in\npre concentrating / upgrading Macusani uranium mineralization with the potential to significantly improve the\neconomics of the existing PEA and to increase the resources included in the existing PEA. While the\nCompany considers the latest PEA for the Macusani Uranium Project to be historical, it should be noted that\nuranium prices have rebounded over the past 12 months with the spot price now above $80/lb and term\npricing forecast to stay above $75/lb, well above the $50/lb U O pricing used in the historical PEA. The\n3 8\nCompany also has a plan to launch pilot plant test work for Macusani in later 2024.\n23\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nMacusani Project Location Map with new target areas\nCautionary Note Regarding Concessions\n32 of the 174 Falchani Lithium and Macusani Uranium project concessions now held through the Company’s\nsubsidiary Macusani Yellowcake S.A.C. have been subject to Administrative and Judicial processes\n(together, the “Processes”) in Peru to overturn resolutions issued by the Geological, Mining, and Metallurgical\nInstitute of Peru (“INGEMMET”) and the Mining Council of the Ministry of Energy and Mines of Peru\n(“MINEM”) in February 2019 and July 2019, respectively, which declared Macusani’s title to the 32\nconcessions invalid due to late receipt of the annual concessions validity payments. On November 15, 2023\nthe Superior Court of Peru unanimously upheld the prior ruling of the lower court in favour of the Company\nin relation to those 32 concessions, which clearly established that Macusani is the rightful owner of these\nconcessions. On December 29, 2023 the Company announced that INGEMMET and MINEM have petitioned\nthe Supreme Court to assume jurisdiction in a final attempt to reverse the ruling. If the petition is successful,\nMacusani’s title to the 32 concessions could be revoked. The Company believes that there are no grounds\nfor the Supreme Court to assume jurisdiction and that the petitions should be rejected immediately and thus\nmark the end of the case, and accordingly will continue to take all necessary actions, and pursue all available\nlegal options, to defend its interests.\n24\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nOutlook\nThe Company continues to believe that the growing demand for lithium-ion batteries will continue to drive\ndemand for lithium products and that the domestic market for lithium products will be under supplied for many\nyears to come. The uranium market is equally compelling with persistent supply/demand imbalance,\nimproving price environment and continuing steady demand growth. These developments position the\nCompany well should the Company be able to raise the required capital to continue its exploration and\ndevelopment efforts with the goal of successfully developing commercially viable lithium and uranium\ndeposits.\nWith large lithium and uranium resources, strategically located in Nevada and Peru, and with recent\nsuccessful development work on all its projects, the Company believes that it is well positioned to benefit\nfrom growing demand for sustainable, domestically sourced supplies of lithium and the need for clean/green\nbaseload energy that can only be answered with nuclear energy as a large part of the Global energy mix.\nSummary of Quarterly Results\nThe following table sets out selected quarterly financial information for each of the eight most recently\ncompleted quarters. The financial information has been reported in accordance with IFRS and is presented\nin Canadian dollars, unless otherwise indicated. The Company has not yet earned revenue from any of its\nmineral properties.\nPreviously, the Company’s net losses were primarily impacted by exploration and evaluation expenditures and\nshare-based compensation. Since the period ending August 31, 2023, net losses have also been impacted by\nthe Company’s strategic investment in Surge and the associated equity pick-up and dilution losses recorded by\nthe Company.\n31-May-24 29-Feb-24 30-Nov-23 31-Aug-23\n$ $ $ $\nTotal assets 167,920,270 173,594,831 177,178,511 185,429,628\nTotal liabilities 3,536,802 4,246,386 4,389,041 5,110,999\nWorking capital 11,422,074 16,323,474 21,365,132 28,247,647\nRevenues - - -\nNet loss (7,192,604) (7,013,110) (11,184,352) (10,581,005)\nComprehensive loss (7,006,169) (7,011,816) (11,169,972) (10,579,027)\nLoss per share (0.03) (0.03) (0.05) (0.05)\n31-May-23 28-Feb-23 30-Nov-22 31-Aug-22\n$ $ $ $\nTotal assets 188,859,007 194,280,141 183,914,633 188,910,671\nTotal liabilities 2,095,404 1,890,074 2,362,560 4,341,810\nWorking capital 35,625,925 41,394,150 36,058,791 39,090,026\nRevenues - - - -\nNet loss (11,125,623) (10,191,240) (5,508,459) (11,043,199)\nComprehensive loss (11,122,415) (9,845,287) (5,436,973) (10,709,964)\nLoss per share (0.05) (0.05) (0.03) (0.05)\n25\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nVariances can be explained as follows:\n For the three-month end period ended May 31, 2024, net losses decreased over the prior quarter due\nmainly to reduced share-based compensation for a spend of $2,030,350 (February 29, 2024 -\n$3,570,571)\n For the quarter ended February 29, 2024, net losses decreased over the prior quarter due mainly to a\nreduction of exploration activity on the Company’s properties for a total spend of $1,283,713 and a\nrecognition of share-based compensation for $3,570,571.\n For the quarter ended November 30, 2023, the higher net loss compared to August 31, 2023 is related\nto a combined loss on short-term investment of $1,916,008, including a deferred gain recognition, and\na combined share of net loss and dilution loss of $734,426 related to the equity investment in Surge;\npartly offset by decreased expenses on exploration and evaluation ($2,407,547), marketing ($867,862)\nand share-based compensation ($464,155).\n For the quarter ended August 31, 2023, net losses are primarily related to exploration and evaluation\nexpenditures of $5,394,032 and share-based compensation of $4,104,968.\n For the quarter ended May 31, 2023, net losses are primarily related to exploration and evaluation\nexpenditures of $4,735,199 and share-based compensation of $4,677,327.\n For the quarter ended February 28, 2023, net losses are primarily related to exploration and evaluation\nexpenditures of $4,193,511 and share-based compensation of $4,237,870.\n For the quarter ended November 30, 2022, net losses were at a reduced level primarily due to a\nreduction in exploration and evaluation expenditures of $2,370,755 and share-based compensation of\n$2,071,572.\n For the quarter ended August 31, 2022, net losses are related to exploration and evaluation\nexpenditures of $4,879,673, share-based compensation of $2,802,987, and professional fees of\n$1,031,005.\nResults of Operations\nThe table below details the significant changes in administrative expenditures for the three months ended\nMay 31, 2024, as compared to the corresponding three months ended May 31, 2023:\nExpenses Increase / Decrease in Explanation for Change\nExpenses\nExploration and Decrease of $2,984,458 Reduced exploration activity during the current period\nevaluation in conjunction with the comparative period containing\nexpenditures costs related to the release of the TLC project’s\ncurrent MRE and PEA.\nProfessional fees Increase of $136,466 Decreased due to the prior year containing legal fees\nincurred for an Ontario Securities Commission\n(“OSC”) settlement.\nShare-based Decrease of $2,646,977 Decreased due to the majority of previously granted\ncompensation stock options being fully vested, partly offset by an\nincreasing number of RSU and PSU units being\nsubject to graded vesting.\nIn addition to the above, the Company incurred the following for the three months period ended May 31,\n2024, as compared to the corresponding three months period ended May 31, 2023:\n Incurred a loss on short-term investment of $1,484,720 and $nil, respectively, in relation to the Surge\ncommon share purchase warrants held by the Company.\n Interest and miscellaneous income decreased by $294,705 primarily due to a reduction in interest\nbearing funds held on deposit\n26\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nCash Flows\nNet cash used in operating activities for the three months ended May 31, 2024, was $3,106,027 (May 31,\n2023 - $6,932,258). The cash used consisted primarily of exploration and evaluation expenditures of\n$1,750,741 (May 31, 2023 - $4,735,199) and corporate overhead expenditures net of non-cash expenditures\nand a net change in non-cash working capital.\nDuring the three-month period ended May 31, 2024, cash provided by investing activities was $Nil (May 31,\n2023 - $4,693,439).\nDuring the three months ended May 31, 2024, cash used in financing activities was $1,894 (three months\nended May 31, 2023 – cash provided by financing activities of $794,238. The Company received proceeds\nof $Nil (May 318, 2023 – $801,908) in connection with the exercise of stock options and $10,842 (May 31,\n2023 – $16,716) in connection with the exercise of warrants.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company has no revenue-generating operations from which it can internally generate funds and\ntherefore has been incurring losses since inception. The Company has financed its operations and met its\ncapital requirements primarily through private placement financings and the subsequent exercise of share\npurchase warrants issued in connection with such private placements and the exercise of stock options. The\nCompany expects that it will continue to operate at a loss for the foreseeable future and will require additional\nfinancing to fund the development of its existing properties and the acquisition of potential resource\nproperties.\nAs at May 31, 2024, the Company had working capital of $11,422,074 (February 29, 2024 – $16,323,474).\nDuring the three-month period ended May 31, 2024 the Company’s cash and GIC positions decreased\n$2,924,415.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company has not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nRelated Party Transactions\nKey management personnel include those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing,\nand controlling the activities of the Company as a whole. The Company has determined that key management\npersonnel consist of executive and non-executive members of the Company’s Board of Directors and\ncorporate officers.\nFor the three months ended\n31-May-24 31-May-23\n$ $\nManagement and directors’ fees 492,399 516,750\nShare-based compensation 2,017,574 2,551,713\n2,509,973 3,068,463\nAs at May 31, 2024, the Company owed $470 (February 29,2024 - $24,725) to companies controlled by\nofficers and directors of the Company for unpaid management fees and exploration and evaluation expenses\nwhich is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.\n27\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nTransactions with Surge, which is deemed to be a related party, have been disclosed in note 7 of the\nCompany’s Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for the three-month period ended May\n31, 2024 and May 31, 2023.\nThese transactions were in the normal course of operations.\nMaterial Accounting Policy Information\nInvestment in associate\nThe Company accounts for its strategic investment in Surge, over which it has significant influence, as an\ninvestment in associate using the equity method, whereby the investment is initially recorded at cost, and\nsubsequently adjusted to recognize the Company’s share of earnings or losses from the associated company.\nThe consolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss reflect the share of the net loss of the\nassociated company from the acquisition date forward. Changes in the Company’s interest in its associated\ncompany resulting in dilution gains or losses, are recognized in the consolidated statements of loss and\ncomprehensive loss.\nThe Company determines whether any objective evidence of impairment exists at each reporting date. If\nimpaired, the carrying value of the investment is written down to its recoverable amount.\nAn assessment is made at each reporting date to determine whether there is an indication that previously\nrecognised impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased. If such indication exists, the Company\nestimates the asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed\nonly if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since\nthe last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does\nnot exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net\nof depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is\nrecognised in the consolidated statement of loss and comprehensive loss.\nAccounting pronouncements not yet adopted\nIFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements, which will replace IAS 1, Presentation of\nFinancial Statements aims to improve how companies communicate in their financial statements, with a focus\non information about financial performance in the statement of profit or loss, in particular additional defined\nsubtotals, disclosures about management-defined performance measures and new principles for aggregation\nand disaggregation of information. IFRS 18 is accompanied by limited amendments to the requirements in\nIAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows.\nThe Company has performed an assessment of new standards issued by the IASB that are not yet effective\nand has determined that any other standards that have been issued would have no or very minimal impact\non the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements.\nJudgements and estimates\nThe preparation of annual consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management\nto make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the\nreported amounts of assets, liabilities, and contingent liabilities as at the date of the annual consolidated\nfinancial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.\nEstimates and assumptions are continuously evaluated and are based on management’s experience and\nother factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the\ncircumstances. However, actual outcomes can differ from these estimates. The results of estimates form the\nbasis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from\nother sources.\n28\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting\nestimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period\nor in the period of the revision and further periods if the review affects both current and future periods.\nThe key areas of judgement and estimation impacting these condensed interim consolidated financial\nstatements are as follows:\nCarrying value of exploration and evaluation assets\nThe Company’s exploration and evaluation assets represent its most significant asset in the\nstatement of financial position. The Company’s management applies its judgement, using facts and\ncircumstances available at the time, to determine whether the exploration and evaluation asset value\nmay be realized. For each of its projects, the Company reviews its right to the claims/concessions,\nfuture plans and exploration or development progress to determine if it should test the respective\nprojects for impairment. There is significant judgement involved in determining if a project shows\nimpairment indicators that may impact the carrying value of exploration and evaluation assets.\nValuation of share-based compensation awards\nStock options are valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with inputs that can\nsignificantly impact the calculated value. Typical inputs into the Black-Scholes option pricing model\ninclude: exercise price, historical volatility, time to expiration and risk-free discount rates. Historical\nvolatility and risk-free discount rates in particular require judgement around the reference period or\nbenchmark rate used as inputs into the Black-Scholes option pricing model.\nValuation of common shares and common share purchase warrants received from investment in Surge\nBattery Metals Inc.\nThe Company’s investment in Surge required the use of the Black-Scholes option pricing model to\ndetermine the discount for lack of marketability applied to the initial value of the Surge common\nshares and to value the Surge common share purchase warrants. Typical inputs into the Black-\nScholes option pricing model include: exercise price, historical volatility, time to expiration and risk-\nfree discount rates. Historical volatility and risk-free discount rates in particular require judgement\naround the reference period or benchmark rate used as inputs into the Black-Scholes option pricing\nmodel.\nDetermination of significant influence\nThe accounting for investments in other companies can vary depending on the degree of control and\ninfluence over those other companies. Management is required to assess at each reporting date the\nCompany’s control and influence over these other companies. Management has used its judgment\nto determine which companies are controlled and require consolidation and those which are\nsignificantly influenced and require equity accounting. As at May 31, 2024, the Company determined\nit has significant influence in Surge.\nFinancial Instruments and Risk Management\nFair value of financial instruments\nThe Company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, GICs, a short-term investment,\namounts receivable, deposits, reclamation deposits, accounts payable and accrued liabilities and lease\nliabilities. As at May 31, 2024, the Company classifies its short-term investment as FVTPL and its remaining\nfinancial assets at amortized cost. For financial instruments at amortized cost, their carrying values\napproximate their fair values because of their current nature. The carrying value of the Company’s lease\nliability is measured at the present value of the discounted future cash flows.\nThe Company classifies the fair value of these financial instruments according to the following hierarchy\nbased on the amount of observable inputs used to value the instrument:\n29\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nLevel 1 – Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting\ndate. Active markets are those in which transactions occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide\npricing information on an ongoing basis.\nLevel 2 – Fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices that are observable\nfor the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices).\nLevel 3 – Valuations in the level are those with inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable\nmarket data. The Company’s Surge Warrants (short-term investment) are classified under Level 3.\nThe Company’s financial instruments are exposed to the following risks:\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet\nits contractual obligations. Financial instruments which are potentially subject to credit risk for the Company\nconsist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, GICs and amounts receivable. The cash and cash equivalents\nand GICs are held at Canadian financial institutions and the Company considers the credit risk to be minimal.\nThe Company’s amounts receivable balance primarily consists of good and sales taxes receivables from the\nGovernment of Canada. As at May 31, 2024, the Company has gross credit exposure of $9,072,608.\nLiquidity Risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its obligations with respect to financial\nliabilities as they come due. The Company’s financial liabilities are comprised of accounts payable and\naccrued liabilities. The Company manages its liquidity risk by forecasting cash flows from operations and\nanticipating any investing and financing activities. Liquidity risk is assessed as low. As at May 31, 2024, the\nCompany had a cash and cash equivalents balance of $8,965,001 to settle financial liabilities of $1,852,231.\nLiquidity risk is assessed as low.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nThe Company is exposed to foreign currency risk on fluctuations related to cash and cash equivalents,\nreclamation deposits, and accounts payable and accrued liabilities that are denominated in a foreign\ncurrency. As at May 31, 2024, the Company had foreign currency net assets $1.945,702 in United States\ndollars, amounting to $2,653,353. A 10% fluctuation in the foreign exchange rate of foreign currencies against\nthe Canadian dollar would result in a foreign exchange gain/loss of approximately $265,335.\nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate\nbecause of changes in market interest rates. The Company has cash and cash equivalents balances and\nterm deposits with interest based on the prime rate. The Company’s current policy is to invest excess cash\nin investment-grade short-term deposit certificates issued by its banking institution. The Company periodically\nmonitors the investments it makes and is satisfied with the credit ratings of its banks.\nPrice Risk\nPrice risk is the risk that assets or liabilities carried at fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument\nwill fluctuate because of changes in market conditions. As at May 31, 2024, the Company’s maximum\nexposure to price risk on its short-term investment is $2,966,760.\nDuring the three-month period ended May 31, 2024, and May 31, 2023, there were no transfers between\nlevel 1, level 2 and level 3 classified assets and liabilities.\n30\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nOutstanding Share Data\nAs at the date of this report:\na) Authorized: unlimited common shares without par value.\nb) Issued and outstanding: 217,559,501 common shares, 10,722,016 stock options, 2,830,000 restricted\nshare units and 2,000,000 performance share units.\nc) Outstanding stock options and their respective exercise prices are below.\nNumber of Number of\noptions options Exercise price Remaining life\noutstanding exercisable $ (years) Expiry date\n200,000 200,000 0.25 0.68 4-Feb-25\n1,729,167 1,729,167 1.28 1.30 17-Sep-25\n51,515 51,515 1.03 1.53 9-Dec-25\n5,758,334 5,758,334 2.17 2.03 10-Jun-26\n1,323,000 1,323,000 3.63 2.72 16-Feb-27\n250,000 250,000 1.91 3.10 4-Jul-27\n150,000 150,000 2.14 3.35 4-Oct-27\n1,185,000 1,185,000 4.85 3.68 2-Feb-28\n75,000 50,000 2.73 4.14 18-Jul-28\n10,722,016 10,697,016\nInternal controls over financial reporting\nThe Company’s management is responsible for designing and maintaining an adequate system of internal\ncontrols over financial reporting as required under National Instrument 52-109 – Certification of Disclosure in\nIssuers’ Annual and Interim Filings. Management designed the internal control system based on the Internal\nControl – Integrated Framework (2013) published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (COSO). From this framework, an evaluation of the internal control system was\ncompleted, and management concluded that the system of internal controls over financial reporting was\neffective as at February 29, 2024.\nAny internal control system, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations. Therefore, internal controls\ncan only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.\nThere have not been any significant changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during\nthe three-month period ended May 31, 2024 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially\naffect the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting.\n31\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nDisclosure controls and procedures\nThe Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that\ninformation required to be disclosed by the Company is recorded, processed, summarized and reported\nwithin the time periods specified in the securities legislation. The Company’s management has concluded\nthat the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as at February 29, 2024.\nAny control system, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations. Therefore, disclosure controls and\nprocedures can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to timely disclosure of material information.\nRisk Factors\nThe Company is in the business of acquiring, exploring and, if warranted, developing and exploiting mineral\nproperties. Due to the nature of the Company’s business and the present stage of exploration of its mineral\nproperties (which are primarily early-stage exploration properties with no established reserves), there are a\nnumber of risks that may have a material and adverse impact on the future operating and financial\nperformance of the Company and could cause the Company’s operating and financial performance to differ\nmaterially from the estimates described in forward-looking statements relating to the Company. Readers are\nadvised to review and consider risk factors disclosed in the Annual Information Form for the fiscal year ended\nFebruary 29, 2024 available under the Company’s profile on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca.\nResource Exploration and Development is Generally a Speculative Business: Resource exploration and\ndevelopment is a speculative business and involves a high degree of risk, including, among other things,\nunprofitable efforts resulting not only from the failure to discover mineral deposits but from finding mineral\ndeposits which, though present, are insufficient in size or too metallurgically challenging to return a profit from\nproduction. The marketability of natural resources that may be acquired or discovered by the Company will\nbe affected by numerous factors beyond the control of the Company. These factors include market\nfluctuations, the proximity and capacity of natural resource markets, government regulations, including\nregulations relating to prices, taxes, royalties, land use, importing and exporting of minerals and\nenvironmental protection. The exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted, but the\ncombination of these factors may result in the Company not receiving an adequate return on invested capital.\nThe great majority of exploration projects do not result in the discovery of commercially mineable deposits of\nore.\nTitle to Property: The acquisition of title to resource properties is a detailed and time-consuming process.\nThe Company may acquire an interest in its properties through land use permits. Title to, and the area of, the\nproperties may be disputed. There is no guarantee that such title will not be challenged or impaired. There\nmay be challenges to the title of the property in which the Company may have an interest, including\nconcessions which, if successful, could result in the loss or reduction of the Company's interest in the\nproperty, including the Peru concessions. Refer to the Cautionary Note Regarding Concessions in this MD&A.\nPotential conflicts of Interest: Certain of the Company’s directors and officers may serve as directors and/or\nofficers of other public and private companies and devote a portion of their time to managing other business\ninterests. This may result in certain conflicts of interest, to the extent that such other companies may\nparticipate in ventures in which the Company is also participating. The laws of British Columbia require the\ndirectors and officers to act honestly, in good faith, and in the best interests of the Company. In addition, each\ndirector must declare his or her interest and abstain from voting on any contract or transaction in which the\ndirector may have a conflict of interest.\nPermits and Licenses: The operations of the Company will require licenses and permits from various\ngovernmental authorities. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain all necessary\nlicenses and permits that may be required to carry out exploration, development, and mining operations at\nits projects.\nMining Industry is Intensely Competitive: The Company’s business will be the acquisition, exploration and\ndevelopment of resource properties. The mining industry is intensely competitive, and the Company will\ncompete with other companies that have far greater resources.\n32\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nEnvironmental Matters: Existing and possible future environmental legislation, regulations and actions could\ncause significant expense, capital expenditures, restrictions, and delays in the activities of the Company, the\nextent of which cannot be predicted, and which may well be beyond the capacity of the Company to fund.\nThe Company’s right to exploit any mining properties will be subject to various reporting requirements and to\nobtaining certain government approvals and there can be no assurance that such approvals, including\nenvironment approvals, will be obtained without inordinate delay or at all.\nForeign Operations: The Company is exposed to risks of political instability and changes in government\npolicies, laws and regulations in Peru. The Company holds mineral interests in the Republic of Peru that may\nbe adversely affected in varying degrees by political instability, government regulations relating to the mining\nindustry and foreign investment therein, and the policies of other nations in respect of Peru. Any changes in\nregulations (including, without limitation, the New Uranium Regulations) or shifts in political conditions are\nbeyond the Company’s control and may adversely affect the Company’s business. New laws, regulations\nand requirements may be retroactive in their effect and implementation. The Company’s operations may be\naffected in varying degrees by government regulations, including those with respect to restrictions on\nproduction, price controls, export controls, income taxes, expropriation of property, employment, land use,\nwater use, environmental legislation and mine safety. The Company's operations may also be adversely\naffected in varying degrees by government regulations, including those with respect to restrictions on foreign\nownership, state-ownership of strategic resources, production, price controls, export controls, income taxes,\nexpropriation of property, employment, land use, water use, environmental legislation, and mine safety. There\nis no assurance that permits can be obtained, or that delays will not occur in obtaining all necessary permits\nor renewals of such permits for existing properties or additional permits required in connection with future\nexploration and development programs. In the event of a dispute arising at the Company’s foreign operations,\nthe Company may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or may not be successful in\nsubjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts in Canada. The Company may also be hindered or\nprevented from enforcing its rights with respect to a government entity or instrumentality because of the\ndoctrine of sovereign immunity. Government authorities in emerging market countries often have a high\ndegree of discretion and at times may appear to act selectively or arbitrarily, and sometimes in a manner that\nmay not be in full accordance with the rule of law or that may be influenced by political or commercial\nconsiderations. Unlawful, selective, or arbitrary governmental actions could include denial or withdrawal of\nlicenses, sudden and unexpected tax audits, and civil actions. Although unlawful, selective, or arbitrary\ngovernment action may be challenged in court, such action, if directed at the Company or its shareholders,\ncould have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition\nand future prospects.\nFluctuation of Metal Prices: Even if commercial quantities of mineral deposits are discovered by the\nCompany, there is no guarantee that a profitable market will exist for the sale of the metals produced. Factors\nbeyond the control of the Company may affect the marketability of any substances discovered. The prices of\nvarious metals have experienced significant movement over short periods of time and are affected by\nnumerous factors beyond the control of the Company, including international economic and political trends,\nexpectations of inflation, currency exchange fluctuations, interest rates and global or regional consumption\npatterns, speculative activities, and increased production due to improved mining and production methods.\nThe supply of and demand for metals are affected by various factors, including political events, economic\nconditions, and production costs in major producing regions. There can be no assurance that the price of any\nmineral deposit will be such that any of its resource properties could be mined at a profit.\nNo Assurance of Profitability: The Company has no history of earnings and, due to the nature of its\nproposed business, there can be no assurance that the Company will ever be profitable. The Company has\nnot paid dividends on its shares and does not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future. The only present\nsource of funds available to the Company is from the sale of its common shares or, possibly, the sale or\noptioning of a portion of its interest in its resource properties. Even if the results of exploration are\nencouraging, the Company may not have sufficient funds to conduct the further exploration that may be\nnecessary to determine whether or not a commercially mineable deposit exists. While the Company may\ngenerate additional working capital through further equity offerings or through the sale or possible syndication\nof its properties, there can be no assurance that any such funds will be available on favourable terms, or at\nall. At present, it is impossible to determine what amounts of additional funds, if any, may be required. Failure\nto raise such additional capital could put the continued viability of the Company at risk.\n33\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nDependence Upon Others and Key Personnel: The success of the Company’s operations will depend\nupon numerous factors, many of which are beyond the Company’s control, including (i) the ability to design\nand carry out appropriate exploration programs on its resource properties; (ii) the ability to produce minerals\nfrom any resource deposits that may be located; (iii) the ability to attract and retain additional key personnel\nin exploration, marketing, mine development and finance; and (iv) the ability and the operating resources to\ndevelop and maintain the properties held by the Company. These and other factors will require the use of\noutside suppliers as well as the talents and efforts of the Company and its consultants and employees. There\ncan be no assurance of success with any or all of these factors on which the Company’s operations will\ndepend, or that the Company will be successful in finding and retaining the necessary employees, personnel\nand/or consultants in order to be able to successfully carry out such activities.\nEstimates of Mineral Resources May Prove to Be Inaccurate: Calculations of mineral resources, mineral\nreserves and metal recovery are estimates only, and there can be no assurance about the quantity and grade\nof minerals until reserves or resources are actually mined. Until reserves or resources are mined and\nprocessed, the quantity of reserves or resources and grades must be considered as estimates only. In\naddition, the quantity of reserves or resources may vary depending on commodity prices. Any material\nchanges in the quantity of resources, grade or stripping ratio or recovery rates may adversely affect the\neconomic viability of the Projects and the Company's financial condition and prospects.\nPEA Results Are Preliminary in Nature: PEA’s are preliminary in nature and include inferred mineral\nresources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to\nthem that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves. There is no certainty the results of the\nPEA’s will be realized. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic\nviability. Additional work is required to upgrade the mineral resources to mineral reserves. In addition, the\nmineral resource estimates could be materially affected by environmental, geotechnical, permitting, legal,\ntitle, taxation, socio-political, marketing, or other relevant factors.\nGovernment Regulation: The Company’s business interests and operations are subject to the laws and\nregulations of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. These laws and regulations are wide-ranging\nand oversee social license, exploration, development, taxes, employee labour standards, health and safety,\nenvironmental protection, human rights, anticorruption measures and matters related to later stage operating\ncompanies including but not limited to production, exports, waste disposal and tailings management, safe\nhandling of toxic substances, water usage and greenhouse gases. Compliance with such laws and\nregulations increases the costs of planning, designing, drilling, developing, constructing, operating,\nmanaging, closing, reclaiming, and rehabilitating a mine or other facilities. Introduction of new laws,\namendments to current laws and regulations governing mining activities and operations or more stringent\nimplementation or arbitrary interpretation thereof could have a material adverse effect on the Company,\nincrease costs, cause a reduction in levels of production, and delay or prevent the development of the\nCompany’s projects. Regulatory enforcement, in the form of compliance or infraction notices, has occurred\nin the past and, while the current risks related to such enforcement are not expected to be material, the risk\nof material fines or corrective action cannot be ruled out in the future.\nUninsured or Uninsurable Risks: The Company may become subject to liability for pollution or hazards\nagainst which it cannot insure or against which it may elect not to insure where premium costs are\ndisproportionate to the Company’s perception of the relevant risks. The payment of such insurance premiums\nand of such liabilities would reduce the funds available for exploration and production activities.\nExploration and Development Activities Are Inherently Risky: The business of exploration and extraction\ninvolves a high degree of risk. Few properties that are explored are ultimately developed into production.\nUnusual or unexpected formations, formation pressures, power outages, labour disruptions, explosions,\ncave-ins, landslides, and the inability to obtain suitable or adequate machinery, equipment or labour are other\nrisks involved in the conduct of exploration programs. These factors can all affect the timing, cost and success\nof exploration programs and any future development. Although the Company carries liability insurance with\nrespect to its exploration operations, the Company may become subject to liability for damage to life and\nproperty, environmental damage, cave-ins, or hazards against which it cannot insure or against which it may\nelect not to insure.\n34\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nPrevious operations may have caused environmental damage at certain of the Company's properties. It may\nbe difficult or impossible to assess the extent to which such damage was caused by the Company or by the\nactivities of previous operators, in which case, any indemnities and exemptions from liability may be\nineffective, and the Company may be responsible for the costs of reclamation.\nPrice Fluctuations and Share Price Volatility: In recent years, the securities markets in the United States\nand Canada have experienced a high level of price and volume volatility, and the market price of securities\nof many companies, particularly those considered development stage companies, have experienced wide\nfluctuations in price which have not necessarily been related to the operating performance, underlying asset\nvalues or prospects of such companies. There can be no assurance that continual and extreme fluctuations\nin price will not occur.\nRights or Claims of Indigenous Groups: The Company’s properties may be located in areas presently or\npreviously inhabited or used by indigenous peoples and may be affected by evolving regulations regarding\nthe rights of indigenous peoples. The Company’s operations are subject to national and international laws,\ncodes, resolutions, conventions, guidelines, and other similar rules respecting the rights of indigenous\npeoples, including the provisions of ILO Convention 169. ILO Convention 169 mandates, among other things,\nthat governments consult with indigenous peoples who may be impacted by mining projects prior to granting\nrights, permits or approvals in respect of such projects. The Company's current or future operations are\nsubject to a risk that one or more groups of indigenous people may oppose continued operation, further\ndevelopment, or new development on those projects or operations on which the Company holds an interest.\nSuch opposition may be directed through legal or administrative proceedings or protests, roadblocks or other\nforms of public expression against the Company or the owner/operators' activities and may require the\nmodification of, or preclude operation or development of projects, or may require the entering into of\nagreements with indigenous people.\nSurface Rights and Access: Although the Company acquires the rights to some or all of the minerals in the\nground subject to the tenures that it acquires, or has a right to acquire, in most cases it does not thereby\nacquire any rights to, or ownership of, the surface to the areas covered by its mineral tenures. In such cases,\napplicable mining laws usually provide for rights of access to the surface for the purpose of carrying on mining\nactivities, however, the enforcement of such rights can be costly and time consuming. In areas where there\nare no existing surface rights holders, this does not usually cause a problem, as there are no impediments to\nsurface access. However, in areas where there are local populations or landowners, it is necessary, as a\npractical matter, to negotiate surface access. There can be no guarantee that, despite having the right at law\nto access the surface and conduct mining activities, the Company will be able to negotiate a satisfactory\nagreement with any such existing landowners/occupiers for such access, and therefore it may be unable to\ncarry out mining activities. In addition, in circumstances where such access is denied, or no agreement can\nbe reached, the Company may need to rely on the assistance of local officials or the courts in such\njurisdictions. The Company’s properties are primarily located on land administered by the United States\nBureau of Land Management, and access is permitted subject to the completion of certain filings, tax\npayments and other obligations as are customary for mineral exploration companies operating in the State\nof Nevada.\nIf any of the Company's properties moves to a development stage, the Company would be subject to\nadditional risks respecting any development and production activities.\nNo Known Mineral Reserves: Despite exploration work on the Company’s mineral property interests, to\ndate no mineral reserves have been established thereon. In addition, the Company is still engaged in\nexploration on all of its material properties in order to determine if any economic deposits exist thereon. The\nCompany may expend substantial funds on exploring some of its properties only to abandon them and lose\nits entire expenditure on the properties if no commercial or economic quantities of minerals are found. Even\nif commercial quantities of minerals are discovered, the exploration properties might not be brought into a\nstate of commercial production. Finding mineral deposits is dependent on a number of factors, including the\ntechnical skill of exploration personnel involved. The commercial viability of a mineral deposit once\ndiscovered is also dependent on a number of factors, some of which are the particular attributes of the\ndeposit, such as content of the deposit including harmful substances, size, grade, and proximity to\ninfrastructure, as well as metal prices and the availability of power and water in sufficient supply to permit\n35\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\ndevelopment. Most of these factors are beyond the control of the entity conducting such mineral exploration.\nThe Company is an exploration and development stage company with no history of pre-tax profit and no\nincome from its operations. There can be no assurance that the Company’s operations will be profitable in\nthe future. There is no certainty that the expenditures to be made by the Company in the exploration and\ndevelopment of its properties will result in discoveries of mineralized material in commercial quantities. Most\nexploration projects do not result in the discovery of commercially mineable deposits and no assurance can\nbe given that any particular level of recovery of mineral reserves will in fact be realized or that any identified\nmineral deposit will ever qualify as a commercially mineable (or viable) mineral deposit which can be legally\nand economically exploited. There can be no assurance that minerals recovered in small scale tests will be\nduplicated in large scale tests under on-site conditions or in production. If the Company is unsuccessful in its\nexploration and development efforts, it may be forced to acquire additional projects or cease operations.\nClimate Change Risks: The Company acknowledges climate change as an international and community\nconcern, and it supports and endorses various initiatives for voluntary actions consistent with international\ninitiatives on climate change. However, in addition to voluntary actions, governments are moving to introduce\nclimate change legislation and treaties at the international, national, state/provincial and local levels. Where\nlegislation already exists, regulation relating to emission levels and energy efficiency is becoming more\nstringent. Some of the costs associated with reducing emissions can be offset by increased energy efficiency\nand technological innovation. However, if the current regulatory trend continues, the Company expects that\nthis could result in increased costs at its operations in the future.\nLitigation Risk: In the ordinary course of the Company’s business, it may become party to new litigation or\nother proceedings in local or international jurisdictions in respect of any aspect of its business, whether under\ncriminal law, contract or otherwise. The causes of potential litigation cannot be known and may arise from,\namong other things, business activities, employment matters, including compensation issues, environmental,\nhealth and safety laws and regulations, tax matters, volatility in the Company’s stock price, failure to comply\nwith disclosure obligations or labour disruptions at its project sites. Regulatory and government agencies may\ninitiate investigations relating to the enforcement of applicable laws or regulations and the Company may\nincur expenses in defending them and be subject to fines or penalties in case of any violation and could face\ndamage to its reputation. The Company may attempt to resolve disputes involving foreign\ncontractors/suppliers through arbitration in another county and such arbitration proceedings may be costly\nand protracted, which may have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition. Litigation may be\ncostly and time-consuming and can divert the attention of management and key personnel from the\nCompany’s operations and, if adjudged adversely to the Company, may have a material and adverse effect\non the Company’s cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nCosts of Land Reclamation: It is difficult to determine the exact amounts which will be required to complete\nall land reclamation activities in connection with the properties in which the Company holds an interest.\nReclamation bonds and other forms of financial assurance represent only a portion of the total amount of\nmoney that will be spent on reclamation activities over the life of a mine. Accordingly, it may be necessary to\nrevise planned expenditures and operating plans in order to fund reclamation activities. Such costs may have\na material adverse impact upon the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.\nForeign Currency Risk: The Company and its subsidiaries incur significant purchases denominated in\ncurrencies other than the presentation currency, the Canadian dollar, and are subject to foreign currency risk\non assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the Canadian dollar. Exploration expenditures\nare transacted in United States Dollars, Peruvian New Soles and Australian Dollars, and the Company is\nexposed to risk of exchange rate fluctuation between the Canadian dollar and these currencies. The\nCompany does not hedge the foreign currency balances.\nCorruption and Bribery Laws: The Company’s operations are governed by, and involve interactions with,\nmany levels of government in other countries. The Company is required to comply with anti-corruption and\nanti-bribery laws, including the Criminal Code, and the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act (Canada),\nas well as similar laws in the countries in which the Company conducts its business. In recent years, there\nhas been a general increase in both the frequency of enforcement and the severity of penalties under such\nlaws, resulting in greater scrutiny and punishment to companies convicted of violating anti-corruption and\nanti-bribery laws. Measures that the Company has adopted to mitigate these risks are not always effective in\n36\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nensuring that the Company, its employees, or third-party agents will comply strictly with such laws.\nFurthermore, a company may be found liable for violations by not only its employees, but also by its\ncontractors and third-party agents. If the Company finds itself subject to an enforcement action or is found to\nbe in violation of such laws, this may result in significant penalties, fines and/or sanctions imposed on the\nCompany resulting in a material adverse effect on the Company’s reputation and results of its operations.\nCautionary notice to US investors regarding mineral resource estimates\nDisclosure of mineral resource estimates and mineral classification terms herein are made in accordance\nwith the Canadian National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects. NI 43-101 is a\nrule established by the Canadian Securities Administrators (“CSA”) that sets the standards for all public\ndisclosure by issuers regarding scientific information and technical data concerning mineral projects. Unless\notherwise indicated, all mineral resource estimates contained in the technical disclosure have been prepared\nin accordance with NI 43-101 and the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum Definition\nStandards on Mineral Resources and Reserves (“CIM Definition Standards”). Canadian standards, including\nNI 43-101, differ significantly from the historical requirements of the United States Securities and Exchange\nCommission (“SEC”), and mineral resource information contained or incorporated by reference in this MD&A\nmay not be comparable to similar information disclosed by U.S. companies.\nThe SEC has adopted amendments to its disclosure rules to modernize the mineral property disclosure\nrequirements for issuers whose securities are registered with the SEC. These amendments became effective\nFebruary 25, 2019 (the “SEC Modernization Rules”) and, following a two-year transition period, the SEC\nModernization Rules replaced the historical property disclosure requirements for mining registrants that are\nincluded in SEC Industry Guide 7 for fiscal years beginning January 1, 2021 or later.\nUnder the SEC Modernization Rules, the definitions of “proven mineral reserves” and “probable mineral\nreserves” have been amended to be substantially similar to the corresponding CIM Definition Standards and\nthe SEC has added definitions to recognize “measured mineral resources”, “indicated mineral resources” and\n“inferred mineral resources” which are also substantially similar to the corresponding CIM Definition\nStandards; however, there are still differences in the definitions and standards under the SEC Modernization\nRules and the CIM Definition Standards. Therefore, the Company’s mineral resources as determined in\naccordance with NI 43-101 may be significantly different than if they had been determined in accordance with\nthe SEC Modernization Rules.\nOther MD&A Requirements\nAdditional information relating to the Company may be found on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca including,\nbut not limited to:\n the Company’s condensed interim consolidated financial Statement for the three-month period ended\nMay 31, 2024, and May 31, 2023;\n the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended February 29, 2024,\nand February 28, 2023\n the Company’s Annual Information Form.\n37"

NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND GOING CONCERN\nAmerican Lithium Corp. (the “Company”) was incorporated in the Province of British Columbia. The\nCompany is engaged in the business of identification, acquisition, and exploration of mineral interests\nin the United States of America and Peru. The Company’s head office is located at 710 – 1030 West\nGeorgia Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, V6E 2Y3, Canada, and its registered and records office is\nlocated at Suite 2200, 885 West Georgia Street, Vancouver, BC, V6C 3E8, Canada. The Company’s\ncommon shares are listed for trading on Tier 2 of the TSX Venture Exchange (the “Exchange”) under\nthe symbol “LI”, the NASDAQ exchange under the symbol “AMLI”, and on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange\nunder the symbol “5LA”.\nThe Company is in the process of exploring its principal mineral properties and has not yet determined\nwhether the properties contain ore reserves that are economically recoverable. The recoverability of\namounts shown as exploration and evaluation assets is dependent upon the discovery of economically\nrecoverable reserves, the confirmation of the Company's interest in the underlying mineral claims, the\nability of the Company to obtain necessary financing to complete the development and upon future\nprofitable production or proceeds from the disposition thereof.\nThese condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of\naccounting principles applicable to a going concern which assumes that the Company will be able to\nrealize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. As at August 31, 2024,\nthe Company had a working capital position of $7,312,285 (February 28, 2024 - $16,323,474), and for\nthe six months ended August 31, 2024, incurred a net loss of $13,063,088 (August 31, 2023 –\n$21,706,628). Furthermore, as at August 31, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of\n$172,234,425 (February 29, 2024 – $159,171,337), which has been funded primarily by the issuance\nof equity. The Company's ability to continue as a going concern and to realize assets at their carrying\nvalues is dependent upon obtaining additional financing. Though the Company has raised financing in\nthe past, there is no guarantee that it will be able to in the future. As at August 31, 2024, management\nbelieves that the Company has sufficient working capital to meet the Company’s obligations over the\nensuing twelve-month period from the date of the statement of financial position.\n2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nStatement of compliance\nThese condensed interim consolidated financial statements, including comparatives, have been\nprepared in accordance with International Accounting Standards (“IAS”) 34, “Interim Financial Reporting”\nusing accounting policies consistent with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued\nby the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and Interpretations issued by the International\nFinancial Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”).\nCertain accounts have been reclassified to be consistent with the current period classification.\nThese condensed interim consolidated financial statements were approved and authorized for issue by\nthe Board of Directors on October 11, 2024.\nBasis of measurement\nThese condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost\nbasis except for certain financial instruments that are measured at fair value. In addition, the\nconsolidated financial statements have been prepared using the accrual basis of accounting except for\ncash flow disclosure.\n8\nAmerican Lithium Corp.\nNotes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the three and six months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023\n(Expressed in Canadian Dollars – unaudited)\n2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION (continued)\nThe condensed interim consolidated financial statements are presented in Canadian dollars unless\notherwise noted. The Canadian dollar is also the functional currency of the Company and its\nsubsidiaries, except for Macusani Yellowcake S.A.C. and Macusani Uranium S.A.C. where the\nfunctional currency is the United States dollar.\nPrinciples of consolidation\nThe condensed interim consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and the\nfollowing subsidiaries:\nName Jurisdiction\nAmerican Lithium Holdings Corp. British Columbia, Canada\nBig Smoky Holdings, Inc. Nevada, USA\nTonopah Lithium Corp. Nevada, USA\nMaran Ventures Ltd. (\"Maran\") Nevada, USA\nPlateau Energy Metals Inc. (“Plateau”) Ontario, Canada\nMacusani Yellowcake S.A.C. Peru\nMacusani Uranium S.A.C. Peru\nAll intercompany transactions, balances, revenue and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. During\nthe year ended February 28, 2023, the Company amalgamated 1032701 Nevada Ltd., 1065604 Nevada\nLtd., 1067323 Nevada Ltd., 1134989 Nevada Ltd., 1301420 Nevada Ltd., and 4286128 Nevada Corp.\nas one company under Tonopah Lithium Corp. In addition, the Company amalgamated Big Smoky\nHoldings Corp. as one company under American Lithium Holdings Corp.\nSubsidiaries are entities over which the Company has exposure to variable returns from its involvement\nand has the ability to use power over the investee to affect its returns. The existence and effect of\npotential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing\nwhether the Company controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which\ncontrol is transferred to the Company until the date on which control ceases.\n3. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION\nThese condensed interim consolidated financial statements do not include all the information required\nof the audited annual consolidated financial statements and is intended to provide users with an update\nin relation to events and transactions that are significant to an understanding of the changes in the\nfinancial position and performance of the Company since the end of the last annual reporting period.\nThe accounting policies followed in these condensed consolidated interim financial statements are the\nsame as those applied in the Company’s most recent audited consolidated annual financial statements\nfor the year ended February 29, 2024. Therefore, it is recommended that these condensed interim\nconsolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the audited annual consolidated financial\nstatements of the Company for the years ended February 29, 2024 and February 28, 2023.\n9\nAmerican Lithium Corp.\nNotes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the three and six months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023\n(Expressed in Canadian Dollars – unaudited)\n3. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (continued)\nJudgements and estimates\nThe preparation of annual consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires\nmanagement to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting\npolicies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities as at the date of the\nconsolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the\nreporting period. Estimates and assumptions are continuously evaluated and are based on\nmanagement’s experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed\nto be reasonable under the circumstances. However, actual outcomes can differ from these estimates.\nThe results of estimates form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and\nliabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting\nestimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that\nperiod or in the period of the revision and further periods if the review affects both current and future\nperiods.\nThe key areas of judgement and estimation impacting these consolidated financial statements are as\nfollows:\nCarrying value of exploration and evaluation assets\n The Company’s exploration and evaluation assets represent its most significant asset on the\nstatement of financial position. The Company’s management applies its judgement, using facts\nand circumstances available at the time, to determine whether the exploration and evaluation\nasset value may be realized. For each of its projects, the Company reviews its right to the\nclaims/concessions, future plans and exploration or development progress to determine if it\nshould test the respective projects for impairment. There is significant judgement involved in\ndetermining if a project shows impairment indicators that may impact the carrying value of\nexploration and evaluation assets.\nValuation of share-based compensation awards\n Stock options are valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with inputs that can\nsignificantly impact the calculated value. Typical inputs into the Black-Scholes option pricing\nmodel include: exercise price, historical volatility, time to expiration and risk-free discount rates.\nHistorical volatility and risk-free discount rates in particular require judgement around the\nreference period or benchmark rate used as inputs into the Black-Scholes option pricing model.\nValuation of common shares and common share purchase warrants received from investment in Surge\nBattery Metals Inc. (note 6)\n The Company’s investment in Surge Battery Metals Inc. required the use of the Black-Scholes\noption pricing model to determine the discount for lack of marketability applied to the initial value\nof the Surge common shares and to value the Surge common share purchase warrants. Typical\ninputs into the Black-Scholes option pricing model include: exercise price, historical volatility,\ntime to expiration and risk-free discount rates. Historical volatility and risk-free discount rates in\nparticular require judgement around the reference period or benchmark rate used as inputs into\nthe Black-Scholes option pricing model.\n10\nAmerican Lithium Corp.\nNotes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the three and six months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023\n(Expressed in Canadian Dollars – unaudited)\n3. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (continued)\nDetermination of significant influence\n The accounting for investments in other companies can vary depending on the degree of control\nand influence over those other companies. Management is required to assess at each reporting\ndate the Company’s control and influence over these other companies. Management has used\nits judgment to determine which companies are controlled and require consolidation and those\nwhich are significantly influenced and require equity accounting. As at August 31, 2024, the\nCompany determined it has significance influence in Surge Battery Metals Inc. (note 6).\nAccounting pronouncements not yet adopted\nIFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements, which will replace IAS 1, Presentation of\nFinancial Statements aims to improve how companies communicate in their financial statements, with\na focus on information about financial performance in the statement of profit or loss, in particular\nadditional defined subtotals, disclosures about management-defined performance measures and new\nprinciples for aggregation and disaggregation of information. IFRS 18 is accompanied by limited\namendments to the requirements in IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows. IFRS 18 is effective from 1 January\n2027. Companies are permitted to apply IFRS 18 before that date.\nThe Company has performed an assessment of new standards issued by the IASB that are not yet\neffective and has determined that any standards that have been issued would have no or very minimal\nimpact on the Company’s condensed interim consolidated financial statements.\n4.

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT\nAs part of the Company’s strategic investment in Surge Battery Metals Inc.’s (“Surge”) private placement\n(note 6), the Company was issued 13,400,000 common share purchase warrants (“Warrants”).

Since the fair value of this financial instrument exceeded the Unit offering’s allocated transaction\nvalue of $2,297,143, and the fair value is not based solely on observable inputs, $2,526,857 was\nrecorded as a deferred gain, which is recognized over the three-year life of the Warrants (note 5).\nAfter initial recognition, the Surge common shares and Warrants are separate financial assets, and\ntherefore are valued separately. The Company determined that, through a combination of its\nshareholdings and its board representation, has significant influence over Surge on the date of\nacquisition, and therefore accounts for the investment using the equity method. The Warrants are fair\nvalued at each reporting date (note 5).\nAs at August 31, 2024, the Company owns 13,400,000 shares of Surge, representing approximately\n8.16% ownership of the investee, and has one of the five board of director seats of Surge.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\nThe Company’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Company’s ability to continue\nas a going concern in order to pursue the exploration and development of its mineral properties and to\nmaintain a flexible capital structure for its projects for the benefit of its stakeholders, to maintain\ncreditworthiness and to maximize returns for shareholders over the long-term. The Company does not\nhave any externally imposed capital requirements to which it is subject. As the Company is in the\nexploration stage, its principal source of funds is from the issuance of common shares. The Company\nincludes the components of shareholders’ equity in its management of capital.\nThe Company manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in\neconomic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. To maintain or adjust the\ncapital structure, the Company may attempt to issue new shares to raise cash and obtain bridging loans\nfrom related parties. The Company’s investment policy is to invest its cash in low-risk investment\ninstruments in financial institutions with terms to maturity selected with regards to the expected time of\nexpenditures from continuing operations.\nThere were no changes in the Company’s management of capital during the six months ended August\n31, 2024.\n14. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\nThe Company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, GICs, a short-term\ninvestment, amounts receivable, deposits, reclamation deposits, accounts payable and accrued\nliabilities and lease liabilities. As at August 31, 2024, the Company classifies its short-term investment\nas FVTPL and its remaining financial instruments at amortized cost. For financial instruments at\namortized cost, their carrying values approximate their fair values because of their current nature. The\ncarrying value of the Company’s lease liability is measured at the present value of the discounted future\ncash flows.\nThe Company classifies financial instruments carried at fair value according to the following hierarchy\nbased on the amount of observable inputs used to value the financial instrument:\nLevel 1 – Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the\nreporting date. Active markets are those in which transactions occur in sufficient frequency and volume\nto provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.\nLevel 2 – Fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices that are\nobservable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices).\nLevel 3 – Valuations in this level are those with inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on\nobservable market data. The Company’s Surge Warrants (short-term investment) are classified under\nLevel 3.\nThe Company’s financial instruments are exposed to the following risks:\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to\nmeet its contractual obligations. Financial instruments which are potentially subject to credit risk for the\nCompany consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, GICs and amounts receivable. The cash and\ncash equivalents and GICs are held at Canadian financial institutions and the Company considers the\ncredit risk to be minimal. The Company’s amounts receivable balance primarily consists of goods and\nsales taxes receivables from the Government of Canada.\n23\nAmerican Lithium Corp.\nNotes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the three and six months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023\n(Expressed in Canadian Dollars – unaudited)\n14.

The Company’s primary focus consists\nof the following projects: the Tonopah Lithium Claims project in Nevada (the “TLC Project”); its Falchani\nlithium concessions in Peru (the “Falchani Lithium Project” or “Falchani”); and its uranium concessions in\nPeru (the “Macusani Uranium Project” or “Macusani”).\nThe Company is pursuing development of its two lithium projects, the TLC Project and the Falchani Lithium\nProject, with Prefeasibility Study (“PFS”) work initiated on both projects. For the Macusani Uranium Project,\nthe Company has engaged in work to update the existing Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) (which\nwas published in February of 2016) and then move to PFS. The Company recognizes that each of these\nProjects has the potential for continued development and future commercialization.\nCompany highlights for the six months period ended August 31, 2024\n Falchani Flow Sheet Optimization & Improvements - On June 27, 2024, the Company announced\npositive results from Falchani process test work ongoing at ANSTO laboratories, which should\nimprove Falchani economics further. Employing counter current leaching/recycling results in 50%\nreduction in acid consumption and severely reduces reagent requirements for neutralization.\nEmploying solvent extraction (“SX”) improves the purity of lithium carbonate produced, SX has the\npotential to simplify the flow sheet reducing the number of impurity removal stages required, and\nimproves the quality of potential by-products – cesium sulfate (“CS”) and sulfate of potash (“SOP).\n Major Peruvian ESG Initiative - March 25, 2024, the Company announced a major ESG project.\nThe solar electrification program is a joint initiative with the Peruvian Armed Forces involving\ninstallation of solar panels in remote homes that lack electricity. The Company plans to install 1,000\nunits this year to benefit the five Andean communities surrounding the Falchani Lithium and\nMacusani Uranium Projects. Each solar unit powers a lithium-ion battery, four LED lightbulbs, a\nflashlight, portable radio, and USB ports for charging cell phones. This transformative project is\nproviding needed electricity to isolated farms and dwellings and, amongst numerous benefits, is\nenabling children to read and study after dusk.\nOthe recent developments\n Robust Economics for Falchani PEA - On January 10, 2024, the Company announced results\nfrom the updated PEA for the Falchani Lithium Project completed by DRA Global. The results\nhighlight Falchani as a long-life, low-cost potential lithium production centre with the opportunity to\nproduce sulfate of potash (“SOP”) fertilizer and cesium sulfate as valuable by-products. The updated\nPEA Li-only base case highlights include: After-tax Net Present Value (“NPV8%\") of $5.11 billion at\n$22,500/tonne (\"t\") Lithium Carbonate Equivalent (“LCE”) selling price; After-tax internal rate of return\n(“IRR”) of 32.0%; with Operating Costs (“Opex”) of $5,092/t LCE. Unless otherwise stated, all dollar\nfigures are in United States dollars. The completion of the Falchani Lithium Project’s updated PEA\nwas an important step towards the expediting of Falchani’s Pre-Feasibility Study (“PFS”). The\naccompanying technical report titled: “Falchani Lithium Project NI 43-101 Technical Report –\nPreliminary Economic Assessment” dated February 22, 2024 with an effective date of January 10,\n2024 prepared by DRA Global and Stantec Consulting Inc. was filed February 23, 2024.\n TLC Deposit Expansion - On December 8, 2023, the Company announced results from 14 step out\ndrill holes expanding the measured resource footprint at the TLC Project. A total of 26 diamond core\n3\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nholes and 16 Reverse Circulation (“RC”) holes drilled in 2022 and 2023 will be added to the updated\nmineral resource block model and incorporated into an updated Mineral Resource Estimate (“MRE”),\ncurrently underway with Stantec Consulting Inc.\n Filed Semi-Detailed Environmental Impact Assessment Study - On November 28, 2023, the\nCompany announced that it has completed and submitted the Semi-Detailed Environmental Impact\nAssessment Study (“EIA-sd”) for the Falchani Lithium Project to the Ministry of Energy and Mines.\nThe EIA-sd provides a framework for approval of all major phases required to finalize the\ndevelopment and construction of Falchani from mining reserve definition to completion of mine\nconstruction and, when approved, the EIA-sd provides authority to drill multiple holes from up to 420\ndrill platforms across the Falchani Lithium Project, with no additional exploration and development\npermits required.\n Positive Peruvian Superior Court Ruling - November 15, 2023 the Company announced that the\nthree judge tribunal of Peru’s Superior Court specialized in administration disputes unanimously\nupheld the ruling of the lower court judge in favour of the Company’s subsidiary, Macusani\nYellowcake in relation to title over 32 disputed concessions out of 172 owned by Macusani. The Court\nruling clearly maintains the Company’s rightful ownership of these concessions. INGEMMET and\nMINEM have subsequently filed petitions to the Supreme Court of Peru to hear the case. A decision\nby the Supreme Court on whether it will accept jurisdiction is expected in later October 2024.\n Falchani Resource Growth - On October 31, 2023, the Company announced an updated MRE for\nthe Falchani Lithium Project increasing the Measured and Indicated lithium resources 476% over the\nprevious March 2019 MRE for Falchani. The latest MRE for Falchani is: Measured Resource – 1.01\nmillion tonnes (“Mt”) LCE (69 Mt @ 2,792 ppm Li); Indicated Resource – 4.52 Mt LCE (378 Mt @\n2,251 ppm Li); and Inferred Resource – 3.99 Mt LCE (506 Mt @ 1,481 ppm Li). The accompanying\ntechnical report titled: “Technical Report and Mineral Resource Estimate - Falchani Property,\nCarabaya Province, Department of Puno, South-Eastern Peru” dated December 14, 2023, with an\neffective date of October 31, 2023, prepared by Stantec Consulting Inc. was filed on December 15,\n2023.\n New Lithium Discovery - On September 26, 2023, the Company announced a new lithium discovery\nat the Quelcaya exploration target, located 6 km west of the Falchani Lithium deposit in Peru. The\ninitial exploration discovery drill hole intersected large-scale lithium mineralization with 222.5 metres\naveraging 1,560 ppm Li from 119.1 m downhole with a maximum 1 m interval sample of 2,668 ppm\nLi at 335 m. The Company continues to assess the results from this drill program and the\nmetallurgical potential of the mineralization.\n Refinement of TLC Flowsheet - On September 7, 2023, the Company announced results of ongoing\nprocess work on the TLC Project, which show an increase in lithium carbonate purity, higher\nextraction rates at lower leach temperatures, significant potential for lower acid consumption and\npotential for lower lithium losses during impurity removal. Further optimization work and process\nimprovements are expected to enhance project returns.\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance\nThe Company places a large emphasis on ESG matters, enhancing its protocols through the engagement of\nOnyen Corporation to assist with implementation of ESG best practices and systems to measure and monitor\nperformance in these areas. In August 2023, the Company published its maiden ESG Report for the 2022\ncalendar year, which included the following highlights:\n Environmental Stewardship: Zero instances of non-compliance with environmental\nregulations.\n Ethics & Integrity: Anti-corruption training has been implemented for the Board of Directors\nand senior management.\n Human Rights and Diversity Policy: Commitments reference the Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights, the United Nations Guiding Principles, and international humanitarian law.\n Social Risk Management: Mechanisms in place through which early alerts are launched on\nrisks identified for the continuity of operations, and to address concerns, requests, and claims.\n4\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nThe full report may be accessed via the following link, or from the Company’s website:\nhttp://www.americanlithiumcorp.com/esg/\nThe Company continues to focus on environmental best practices and to prioritize community relations. The\nCompany conducted the annual community Christmas food and gift package distribution and facilitated the\nsemi-annual Mobile Medical and Dental Clinics in the local Andean communities near our Peruvian Projects\nin late 2022 and throughout 2023. Recently the Company has launched an initiative in conjunction with the\nPeruvian Army to fund and install up to 1,400 solar / battery systems into homes in its communities to supply\nlighting and charging capabilities enabling radio, Wi-Fi, and mobile connectivity. Installation of these systems\nis currently in progress. The Company also assists the community with continuous support for local education\n(teachers’ salaries and supplies) and health care (medical and health care support workers support).\nIn Nevada, the Company maintains cultural liaison with representatives of all three tribal groups who are\nbased around Tonopah. A cultural monitoring agreement is in place for pre-disturbance cultural surveys with\none tribe, and the Company has engaged in early project consultation with two other nearby tribes. The\nCompany once again is a sponsor the Nevada State Mining Championships held in Tonopah, NV in May\n2024, and raised awareness of the Company and the TLC Project through sponsorship and staffing of a\nbooth at the AEMA conference in Reno in early December 2023. The Company continues an environmental\nreclamation and remediation study with researchers at the University of Nevada, Reno, on seed coatings to\npromote faster and more efficient floral remediation of disturbed lands in Nevada.\nQualified Person and Technical Reports\nThe scientific and technical information contained in this MD&A has been reviewed and approved by Ted\nO’Connor, Executive Vice President of American Lithium, who is a Qualified Person as defined in National\nInstrument 43-101.\nCertain scientific and technical information contained in this MD&A with respect to the following projects has\nbeen taken from their related technical reports as indicated below:\n TLC Project - “Tonopah Lithium Claims Project NI 43-101 Technical Report – Preliminary Economic\nAssessment” with an effective date of January 31, 2023 and prepared by John Joseph Riordan,\nValentine Eugene Coetzee, of DRA Pacific and Derek J.

Geo. and Mariea Kartick, P.Geo. of Stantec Consulting Services Inc.\n Macusani Uranium Project - “Macusani Project, Macusani, Peru, NI 43-101 Report – Preliminary\nEconomic Assessment” with an effective date of January 12, 2016 and prepared by Michael Short\nand Thomas Apelt of GBM Minerals Engineering Consultants Limited, David Young of The Mineral\nCorporation and Mark Mounde of Wardell Armstrong International Limited.\nThe most recent technical reports for the TLC project and the Falchani Lithium Project can be viewed on the\nCompany’s SEDAR+ profile at www.sedarplus.ca. The Macusani Uranium Project’s technical report can be\nfound under the SEDAR+ profile of the Company’s subsidiary, Plateau Energy Metals Inc.\nCertain technical information in this MD&A refers to the results of PEA’s prepared for the Projects. PEAs are\npreliminary in nature and include inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically\nto have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral\nreserves. There is no certainty the results of the PEA’s will be realized. Mineral resources are not mineral\nreserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. Additional work is required to upgrade the mineral\nresources to mineral reserves. In addition, the mineral resource estimates could be materially affected by\n5\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nenvironmental, geotechnical, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-political, marketing, or other relevant\nfactors.\nProject development updates\nThe Company’s plans are to continue to develop and de-risk the following projects:\nTLC Project - Targeting initiating a PFS in 2025\nBulk sample and exploration / expansion drilling has been completed at the TLC Project to provide additional\nmetallurgical samples and evaluate / add additional higher grade target areas at the TLC Project, with an\nupdated MRE nearing completion, and expected to be announced in later October 2024. 10-15 tonnes of\nhigh-grade lithium claystone mineralization have been prepared from the bulk sample drilling and will be used\nas material for the detailed preconcentration and metallurgical testing required to further refine and enhance\nthe TLC Flowsheet for its PFS and ahead of launching pilot operations.\nEnvironmental and cultural work is ongoing ahead of the full mine permitting process which will be formally\nlaunched at TLC following finalization of the PFS. To this end, SRK Consulting (U.S.) Inc. of Elko, Nevada\nhas been engaged to coordinate the preparation of a mine plan of Operations with the BLM and Nexus\nEnvironmental Consultants Inc. of Reno, Nevada has been engaged to complete biological baseline studies\nin support of the Mine Plan of Operations application.\nFalchani Lithium Project – Targeting the completion of a PFS in 2025\nEIA drilling has been completed with an updated MRE completed in October 2023, and filed on December\n15, 2023. Following this filing, an updated PEA was completed (filed on February 23, 2024) incorporating the\nupdated MRE, adding potential cesium and potassium by-products, with updated project economics including\nthe latest lithium pricing. Both reports are key steps in the finalization of the Falchani Lithium Project PFS,\nexpected in H2 2025. The Company also continues to optimize its flow sheet ahead of finalizing PFS.\nEnvironmental work required for pre-feasibility, feasibility studies and ultimately mine permitting on the\nFalchani Lithium Project commenced in the fall of 2022 with the initiation of an EIA which includes detailed\nhydrological / hydrogeological studies focusing on the upper 150m below surface to investigate water table\nparameters. This program also enabled the recovery of core for resource expansion and reclassification and\nreclassification and formed part of the updated MRE completed by Stantec Consulting Inc. (“Stantec”) in\nNovember 2023. The EIA drilling confirmed no water table issues at Falchani, and 4 piezometers were\ninstalled to monitor seasonal water flows. The EIA-sd for the Falchani Lithium Project has been submitted to\nMINEM. The EIA-sd provides a framework for approval of all major phases required to finalize the\ndevelopment of Falchani from mining reserve definition to completion of mine construction and when\napproved, provides authority to drill up to 420 drill platforms across the Falchani Lithium Project, with no\nadditional permits required. EIA-sd approvals are expected before calendar year end. It is anticipated that\nthe full EIA will be complete following completion of PFS at Falchani.\nIn addition to the in-fill, expansion, and resource reclassification drilling undertaken at the Falchani Lithium\nProject, the Company also launched initial exploration / discovery drilling at two new lithium target areas at\nQuelcaya, approximately 6 -11 km west of the Falchani Lithium Project. The initial exploration discovery at\nQuelcaya was announced September 26, 2023, with thick, large-scale lithium mineralization averaging 1,560\nppm Li over 222.5 m and up to 2,668 ppm. Follow up exploration and metallurgical work is recommended.\nMacusani Uranium Project – Targeting the completion of an updated PEA in Q1 2025\nWith the significant improvement noted in the uranium business environment and future outlook fostered by\ndemand for clean energy, the Company will continuously monitor and determine its activities in the light of\nfavourable developments.\nThe flowsheet is at an advanced stage, and it is currently anticipated that piloting will commence in respect\nof the Macusani Uranium Project in 2024. In addition, with numerous in-fill and expansion targets identified,\nfurther drilling is planned at Macusani to upgrade resource categories and expand the existing resource,\npending the finalization of the necessary exploration permits. This will lead to an updated MRE. The Company\n6\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nhas also commenced updating the historic PEA on the Macusani Project which will use the existing mineral\nresource model, establish an updated mine schedule incorporating results of the latest pre-concentration,\nmetallurgical and process improvements and update commodity pricing from the original US$50 per lb used\nin the historic PEA to reflect current more robust pricing.\nIn parallel with preparations for planned, upcoming work on the Macusani project, the Company continues to\nexplore various opportunities and structures to monetize the Peruvian uranium project for the immediate, and\nfuture benefit of the Company and all stakeholders.\nProperties – Background and Technical Reports\nTLC Project – Nevada, USA\nSince 2016, the Company has acquired, through a series of transactions, the control of unpatented lode\nmining claims in Nevada’s Nye and Esmeralda counties and now controls a total of approximately 12,511\nacres of contiguous land highly prospective for lithium and which comprise the TLC Project. The TLC Project\nhas been under exploration and development by the Company since 2019. Lithium claystone mineralization\nis found consistently in near surface drilling and sampling across a >20 km2 area and is open to expansion\nprimarily to the south and west sides of the project.\nIn addition, the Company has acquired agricultural lands with accompanying water rights to secure water for\nthe project for the long term. The outright ownership of the subject properties will provide close to 2,500 acre-\nfeet of combined water rights which should provide sufficient water for at least the initial phases of any future\nproduction at the TLC Project and a strong base for any future expansion phases. The water can be\ntransported by buried pipeline to the project utilizing existing public access routes and also with the potential\nto be transferred throughout the basin, including to the TLC site, via intra-basin transfer.\nThe Company has also acquired the option and right of first refusal to purchase further agricultural lands with\naccompanying 1135 acre-feet of water.\nA total of 26 diamond core holes and 16 Reverse Circulation (“RC”) holes drilled in 2022 and 2023 will be\nadded to an updated mineral resource block model and incorporated into an updated MRE, currently\nunderway by Stantec geoscientists. Thick, high grade lithium intersections in drill holes outside of the current\nMeasured Resource footprint should convert much of the Indicated Resource to Measured category,\nparticularly to the north-northeast (see: TLC Claim map with Drill Collar Locations, 2022 Mineral Resource\nOutline & select new drill holes, below). The updated MRE is expected in late October 2024.\n7\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nTLC Claim map with Drill Collar Locations, Mineral Resource Outline & select new drill holes\n8\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nTLC Project Mineral Resource Estimate\nThe current mineral resource estimate was prepared by Stantec Consulting Ltd., effective October 6, 2022,\nutilizing a total of 82 drill holes comprising 39,062’ (11,906 m) of combined RC, Sonic and diamond drilling\nfrom 2019 to 2022 drill campaigns. The Company has 42 diamond and RC drill holes yet to be included in\nthe current resource estimate and has initiated an update to the resource with Stantec.\nTLC Project Updated Lithium Mineral Resource Estimates (December 1, 2022)\nCutoff Volume Tonnes Li Million Tonnes (Mt)\nLi (ppm) (Mm^3) (Mt) (ppm) Li Li2CO3 LiOH*H2O\nMeasured\n500 506 860 924 0.79 4.20 4.78\n1000 203 345 1255 0.43 2.29 2.60\n1200 104 177 1401 0.25 1.33 1.51\nIndicated\n500 701 1192 727 0.87 4.63 5.26\n1000 80 136 1148 0.16 0.85 0.97\n1200 22 37 1328 0.05 0.27 0.30\nMeasured +Indicated\n500 1207 2052 809 1.66 8.83 10.04\n1000 283 481 1227 0.59 3.14 3.57\n1200 126 214 1402 0.30 1.60 1.81\nInferred\n500 286 486 713 0.35 1.86 2.12\n1000 31 53 1151 0.06 0.32 0.36\n1200 8 14 1315 0.02 0.11 0.12\n Mineral Resource surface pit extent has been estimated using a lithium carbonate price of US20,000 US$/tonne and mining cost of US$3.00 per\ntonne, a lithium recovery of 90%, fixed density of 1.70 g/cm3 (1.43 tons/yd3)\n Conversions: 1 metric tonne = 1.102 short tons, metric m3 = 1.308 yd3, Li2CO3:Li ratio = 5.32, LiOH.H2O:Li ratio =6.05\n Totals may not represent the sum of the parts due to rounding.\n The Mineral Resource estimate has been prepared by Joan Kester, PG and Derek Loveday, P.

The PEA\ndemonstrates that the TLC project has the potential to become a substantial, long-life producer of low-cost\nlithium carbonate with the potential to produce either battery grade LCE or lithium hydroxide (“LiOH”). The\nPEA base case envisions an initial 4.4 Million tonnes per annum (“Mtpa”) processing throughput expanding\nto 8.8Mtpa. The PEA alternative case is identical, but with added production of high purity magnesium sulfate\nas a by-product over life of operations. Unless otherwise stated, all dollar figures are in US currency.\n9\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nTLC Project PEA - Highlights (Base Case – Ramp-up Production Li only production):\n Pre-tax NPV : $3.64 billion at $20,000/t LCE; After-tax NPV : $3.26 billion at $20,000/t LCE\n8% 8%\n Pre-tax IRR: 28.8%; After-tax IRR: 27.5%\n PEA mine plan produces: 1.46 Mt LCE Life-of-Mine (“LOM”) over 40 years\n Pre-tax initial capital payback period: 3.6 years; after-tax payback: 3.7 years**\n Average LOM annual pre-tax cash flow: $435 million; annual after-tax cash flow: $396 million\n Initial Capital Costs (“Capex”): $819 million\n Total Capex: $1,431 million; Sustaining Capital: $792 million\n Opex: $7,443/t LCE inclusive of power credits\n** Payback is based on Phase 1 capital alone, with undiscounted cashflows\nTLC Project PEA - Highlights (Alternate Case – Ramp-Up Production Li + Magnesium Sulfate production):\n Pre-tax NPV : $6.06 billion at $20,000/t LCE & $150/t MgSO After-tax NPV : $5.16 billion at\n8% 4; 8%\n$20,000/t LCE & $150/t MgSO\n4\n Pre-tax IRR: 38.6%; After-tax IRR: 36.0%\n PEA mine plan produces:1.46 Mt LCE and 64.9 Mt MgSO LOM over 40 years\n4\n Pre-tax initial capital payback period: 2.6 years; after-tax payback: 2.8 years\n Average LOM pre-tax annual cash flow: $684 million; annual after-tax cash flow: $591 million\n Initial Capex: $827 million\n Total Capex: $1,439 million; Sustaining Capital: $763 million\n Opex: at $7,443/t LCE inclusive of power credits\n Opex: $817/t LCE, inclusive of power & MgSO credits\n4\nRefer to section “Qualified Person and Technical Reports” above in this MD&A for risks associated with PEAs.\nTLC Project PEA - Mine Life & Production\n Simple truck and shovel open pit mining of the shallow resource underpins the scalable, long-life, lithium\nproject producing approximately 24,000 tpa LCE over Years 1-6 once steady state production is achieved\nand expanding to 48,000 tpa LCE productionfor Years 7-19 when mining ceases.

The recent prospecting and mapping activities\ndemonstrate that new lithium occurrences in the vicinity of the Quelcaya village are more extensive than\ninitially modelled. In addition, and as set out above, the Company was able to expand and reclassify the\nexisting resource in Q4 2023 based on EIA drilling in 2022 and 2023. The Company is also targeting\nadditional infill and extension drilling at Falchani with these results to be incorporated into Falchani’s PFS.\nFurthermore, the Company has discovered a new area within the Quelcaya village, 6 kilometers west of the\nFalchani deposit. The discovery hole intersected lithium mineralization over 222.5 m in subvolcanic intrusive\nrocks averaging 1,560 ppm Li from 119.1 m downhole.\n14\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFalchani and Quelcaya Project Location Map\nA 10-hole hydrology diamond drill program that is part of the environmental work required for an\nEnvironmental Impact Assessment (“EIA”) on the project which will provide the framework for, and be a key\npart of, the Mine Permitting Process was completed in September 2023 on the Falchani Lithium Project, led\nby SRK Peru. No groundwater has been encountered in any of the EIA drill holes.\nAdditional exploration and development work has been planned to support further extension/in-fill drilling at\nthe Falchani Lithium Project should this prove necessary / desirable and would commence following approval\nof the EIA-sd filed in November 2023 with the Peruvian authorities and currently expected during H2 2024.\nLocal community acceptance and approvals have been granted and archeological and environmental\nsampling work has been concluded.\nANSTO continues to investigate optimizing the Falchani flow sheet with recent results announced June 27,\n2024. These positive results should improve Falchani economics further. Employing counter current\nleaching/recycling results in 50% reduction in acid consumption and significantly reduces reagent\nrequirements for neutralization. Employing solvent extraction (“SX”) improves the purity of lithium carbonate\nproduced with the potential to simplify the flow sheet reducing the number of impurity removal stages\nrequired, and improves the quality of potential by-products – cesium sulfate (“CS”) and sulfate of potash\n(“SOP).\nTECMMINE in Peru continues to run numerous additional full cycle tests on the existing “lithium-only” flow-\nsheet and continues to produce high purity LC with purities between 99.50% – 99.87% LC. (above typical\nbattery grade designation)\nFalchani Lithium Project PEA\nAn updated MRE was completed by Stantec Consulting Services Inc. and announced October 31, 2023,\nexpanding the contained lithium resources in the Measured & Indicated categories by 476%. The Falchani\nLithium Project resource is comprised primarily of three zones, namely the upper breccia unit (“UBX”), lithium-\nrich tuff unit (“LRT”) and lower breccia unit (“LBX”), in order of stratigraphy. A lower grade Li-rich subvolcanic\nintrusion (Coarse Felsic Intrusion) forms the basement to the Falchani volcanic stratigraphy, and contributes\nto the overall MRE Inferred category.\n15\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nUsing the updated MRE completed by Stantec (filed December 15, 2023), an updated PEA was completed\nby DRA Global and filed on February 23, 2024, demonstrating that the Falchani Lithium Project has the\npotential to become a substantial, low-cost, long-life producer of high purity lithium carbonate with the\npotential to also produce SOP and Cesium Sulfate (“CsS” or “Cs SO4”) by-products alongside LCE. Key\n2\nhighlights and figures of the updated PEA can be found below.\nThe Falchani Lithium Project’s updated MRE and updated PEA both include the Falchani and Ocacasa 4\nconcessions based on the most recent legal decision confirming the Company’s ownership of all concessions.\nHowever, please refer to the “Cautionary Note Regarding Concessions” section in this MD&A.\nThe PEA base case envisions an initial 1.5 Mtpa processing throughput (Years 1-5), expanding to 3.0 Mtpa\n(Years 6-10) and ultimately ramping up to 6.0 Mtpa (Years 11-43) with 32 years of mining followed by 11\nyears of stockpile processing. The PEA alternative processing case is identical, but with added production of\nhigh purity SOP and Cs SO as by-products from Years 6-43 alongside the initial expansion. Unless\n2 4\notherwise stated, all dollar figures are in US currency.\nFalchani Lithium Project PEA - Highlights (Base Case – Li only production):\n Pre-tax NPV : $8.41 billion at $22,500/tonne (“t”) LCE; After-tax NPV : $5.11 billion at $22,500/t\n8% 8%\nLCE\n Pre-tax IRR: 40.7%; After-tax IRR: 32.0%\n Pre-tax initial capital payback period: 2.5 years; After-tax payback: 3.0 years\n Average LOM annual pre-tax cash flow: $1,003 million; Annual after-tax cash flow: $628 million\n Initial Capex: $681 million\n Total Capex (Phases 1, 2 & 3): $2,565 million; Sustaining Capital: $236 million\n Opex: $5,092/t LCE\n PEA mine plan produces: 2.64 Mt LCE LOM over 43 years\no Phase 1: 23,000 tpa LCE; Phase 2: 45,000 tpa; and Phase 3: 84,000 tpa\nFalchani Lithium Project PEA Highlights (Alternate Case – Li-only in Phase 1; SOP + Cs SO added from\n2 4\nPhase 2):\n Identical LCE production scenario, but with added average production of 81,556 tpa of SOP and 3,796\ntpa of CsS from Years 6-43;\n Pre-tax NPV :$9.25 billion at $22,500/t LCE, $1,000/t SOP & $58,000/t Cs SO ; After-tax NPV :\n8% 2 4 8%\n$5.59 billion at $22,500/t LCE, $1,000/t SOP & $58,000/t Cs SO\n2 4\n Pre-tax IRR: 38.5%; After-tax IRR: 29.9%\n Pre-tax initial capital payback period: 2.5 years; after-tax payback: 3.0 years\n Average LOM pre-tax annual cash flow: $1,211 million; annual after-tax cash flow: $758 million\n Initial Capex: $681 million\n Total Capex: $3,466 million; Sustaining Capital: $260 million\n Opex: $5,705/t LCE (for all products)\n Opex: $1,361/t LCE, inclusive of SOP & Cs SO credits\n2 4\n PEA mine plan produces: 2.64 Mt LCE and 3.19 Mt SOP and 147,000t Cs SO LOM over 43 years\n2 4\nFalchani Lithium Project PEA - Mine Life & Production\n Simple drill, blast, truck and shovel open pit mining of the near-surface, high-grade (>2,700 ppm Li)\nresource.\n Mining ceases at the end of year 32 and rehandling of the <2,700 ppm Li stockpile allows production to\ncontinue for Years 33-43.\n Average LOM Production of approximately 61,400 tpa of 99.5% LCE for 43 years.\n LOM Strip Ratio (Waste:Ore) of 0.60:1 after accounting for processed stockpile material\n Sulfuric acid leaching using industry standard techniques and flowsheet produces high purity lithium\ncarbonate to enable the production of battery grade LCE.\n16\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\n SOP is an important fertilizer product for specialty crops, especially those grown in Peru (ex. avocado,\nblueberries, grapes & coffee) with a decent, and growing global market. SOP production from Falchani\nhas the potential to satisfy Peru’s domestic needs with additional export possibility.\n Cesium is used in high-pressure, high-temperature offshore oil and gas drilling and is used in infrared\ndetectors, optics, photoelectrical cells, scintillation counters and spectrometers. Isotopes of cesium are\natomic clocks necessary for aircraft guidance systems, global positioning satellites, and internet and cell\nphone applications.

Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. The effective date of the Mineral Resource Estimate is\nOctober 30,2023. There is no certainty that any mineral resource will be converted into mineral reserve.\nThe mineral resource estimates are based on 12,317 m from 67 drill holes from 35 Platforms (2017 to 2023).\nSampling was carried out at sampling intervals of between 0.5m and 1.0m. Samples used throughout the\nestimation process were composited to a downhole length of 2.5m (see Figure: Falchani Lithium Project\nMineral Classification and Drill Platform Location Map, below).\n20\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFalchani Lithium Project Mineral Classification and Drill Platform Location Map\nFalchani Lithium Project - Environmental\nA baseline environmental study (the “Baseline Study”) undertaken by ACOMISA, a Lima-based\nenvironmental consulting company, and continued in collaboration with Anddes Asociados S.A.C. is ongoing.\nThe Baseline Study was expanded to include each of the Falchani Lithium Project and Macusani Uranium\nProject areas and now covers the relevant areas belonging to the communities of Isivilla, Tantamaco, Corani,\nChimboya and Paquaje, and Chacaconiza. This expanded Baseline Study was accepted by the Peruvian\nGovernment Agency SENACE (Servicio Nacional de Certificacion Ambiental) and built on previous\nenvironmental monitoring that was started by the Company in 2010 during the exploration phase of work.\nThe Baseline Study has recently progressed into an EIA that includes community relations and impacts of\nfuture development, as well as flora, fauna, water, air and noise sampling and comprehensive archaeological\nstudies.\n21\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nThe Company has also subsequently completed and submitted the semi-detailed EIA, covering the project,\nbuilding on the Environmental Baseline Study. The environmental work required for the PFS on the Falchani\nLithium project was led by SRK Peru, and includes detailed hydrological / hydrogeological studies focusing\non investigating water table parameters within the upper 120-150 m below surface. The Company anticipates\napproval of the semi-detailed EIA shortly and the full EIA following completion of PFS.\nThe Falchani Lithium Project lies outside of the Corani-Macusani Area of Cultural and Archaeological\nSignificance (“Archaeological Area of Interest”). Archaeological studies completed as part of our exploration\nprogram permitting and recent EIA study work have shown that to date, there are no sites of cultural or\narchaeological significance affecting the Falchani Lithium Project. The local landscape, landforms, higher\nelevation and rock weathering style at the project was not conducive for hosting, or preservation of, sites of\narchaeological significance. An overview of the results of the archaeological studies, including excavations\navailable to date, is being prepared for presentation to the Ministry of Culture of Peru.\nMacusani Uranium Project – Puno, Peru\nThe Macusani Uranium Project is one of the largest undeveloped uranium projects in the world containing\nsignificant measured, indicated, and inferred uranium resources. Located approximately 25 kilometres away\nfrom the Company’s Falchani Lithium Project, the Macusani Uranium Project is proximal to excellent\ninfrastructure and although it currently has the benefit of significant historical work, includes a significantly\nunder explored land package. Planned near-term activities include the launch of a pilot operation to provide\nfinal validation of the flow sheet as well as to produce yellowcake for evaluation by interested strategic parties.\nA planned major expansion and infill drilling program to expand and reclassify the large historical resource\nwill follow upon receipt of final drill permits. In addition, the Company is currently updating the historic PEA\non Macusani for recent work, including on preconcentration, tank leaching vs heap leaching and updating the\nUS$50 commodity pricing for current market pricing.\nMacusani Uranium Project - PEA\nOn February 10, 2016, Plateau filed an updated PEA. The PEA was completed by UK based, mining\nengineering consultants Wardell Armstrong International and GBM Minerals Engineering Consultants Limited\nand contains a detailed base case which contemplates the construction of a conventional open pit mining\noperation, with a minor supplemental high-grade underground component feeding a centralized processing\nfacility.\nSix complexes covering multiple concessions contain mineral resources, four complexes are included in the\nMacusani Uranium Project PEA filed under Plateau’s profile on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca. Of these four\ncomplexes, three have portions of the mineral resources on concessions that have been subject to dispute\nand these have been protected by judicial rulings restoring concession title, rights, and validity to the\nCompany. (Refer to “Cautionary Note Regarding Concessions” section in this MD&A which contain details\non judicial processes relating to 32 of the Company’s concessions).\nProcessing work tailored towards upgrading, or pre-concentrating, through communition/concentration\nstudies on the uranium mineralization commenced in August 2020 with encouraging results released March\n30, 2021. The work utilized mineralization from 3 main deposits, with successful upgrading from all deposits\ntested. Uranium preferentially reports to the fine fraction with an upgrade factor of 2.3 in 30-35% of original\nmass. The upgrading results highlight the opportunity to bring in lower grade deposits previously not included\nin the PEA production schedule, and the higher-grade feed material should positively impact the PEA Capital\nCosts with a smaller plant footprint and PEA operating costs due to lower energy and reagent costs. Trade\noff studies between original heap leach processing and tank/vat leach processing options will be conducted\nusing the upgraded fraction achievable in a scrubbing and classification circuit.\nWork has started on updating the PEA for Macusani. DRA Global will use the existing historical resource\nestimate to develop a new mining block model and schedule with processing based on employing\npreconcentration in combination with tank leaching refinements developed and refined in recent years.\nPricing will also be updated to reflect the current more robust pricing environment.\n22\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nEnvironmental\nWithin the Macusani Uranium Project area lies an Archaeological Area of Interest which includes sites of\ncultural interest. The area boundaries are very clearly defined and are well-known to people working in the\nregion. The Company continues working with environmental and archaeological professionals, local\ncommunities, and Peruvian authorities to develop a plan to protect any sites located in proximity to the\nproposed future project operations. The Macusani Project and proposed future infrastructure for operations\ncurrently do not directly affect any such sites, and as such are not impacted by them.\nIn order to protect these sites of cultural interest and with the assistance of the Ministry of Culture of Peru,\nthe Company has spent the past three years conducting a professional archaeological study in the project\narea. This is a full archaeological research project that the Company’s team initiated and is still on-going.\nDesktop work is completed, and on-site work resumed in July 2022. Archeological study results will be\nsubmitted to the Peruvian Ministry of Culture following this final dry season field study.\nThe Company remains fully informed of the progress of this archeological study and is confident based on\nthe findings to date, that together with the qualified investigating team, it will work towards an outcome that\nrespects, salvages and preserves cultural heritage where it exists. In addition, all the recently validated\nartefacts are currently exposed to natural erosion and decay from the weather conditions that characterize\nthe Macusani plateau, therefore a preserving solution should be found. It is positive to see the government\nproactively working towards an actionable outcome on both accounts, and it is indicative of the level of\nsupport across the board for the Company’s projects.\nMacusani Project Exploration and Development Work\nSurface mapping, sampling and prospecting work for future target generation has continued while awaiting\ndrill permits. Exploration and resource expansion/extension drilling is expected to commence upon receipt of\npermitting approvals, expected in late 2024 to early 2025. An update of the existing Macusani PEA based on\nthe historical MRE and including pre-concentration and tank leach processing improvements should be\ncompleted in H2 2024 following which PFS work will commence. As previously announced, the Company\nhas had success in pre concentrating / upgrading Macusani uranium mineralization with the potential to\nsignificantly improve the economics of the existing PEA and to increase the resources included in the existing\nPEA. While the Company considers the latest PEA for the Macusani Uranium Project to be historical, it should\nbe noted that uranium prices have rebounded over the past 12 months with the spot price now above $80/lb\nand term pricing forecast to stay above $75/lb, well above the $50/lb U O pricing used in the historical PEA.\n3 8\nThe Company also has a plan to launch pilot plant test work for Macusani in early 2025.\n23\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nMacusani Project Location Map with new target areas\nCautionary Note Regarding Concessions\n32 of the 174 Falchani Lithium and Macusani Uranium project concessions now held through the Company’s\nsubsidiary Macusani Yellowcake S.A.C. have been subject to Administrative and Judicial processes\n(together, the “Processes”) in Peru to overturn resolutions issued by the Geological, Mining, and Metallurgical\nInstitute of Peru (“INGEMMET”) and the Mining Council of the Ministry of Energy and Mines of Peru\n(“MINEM”) in February 2019 and July 2019, respectively, which declared Macusani’s title to the 32\nconcessions invalid due to late receipt of the annual concessions validity payments. On November 15, 2023\nthe Superior Court of Peru unanimously upheld the prior ruling of the lower court in favour of the Company\nin relation to those 32 concessions, which clearly established that Macusani is the rightful owner of these\nconcessions. On December 29, 2023 the Company announced that INGEMMET and MINEM have petitioned\nthe Supreme Court to assume jurisdiction in a final attempt to reverse the ruling. If the petition is successful,\nMacusani’s title to the 32 concessions could be revoked. The Company believes that there are no grounds\nfor the Supreme Court to assume jurisdiction and that the petitions should be rejected immediately and thus\nmark the end of the case, and accordingly will continue to take all necessary actions, and pursue all available\nlegal options, to defend its interests.\n24\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nOutlook\nThe Company continues to believe that the growing demand for lithium-ion batteries will continue to drive\ndemand for lithium products and that the domestic market for lithium products will be under supplied for many\nyears to come. The uranium market is equally compelling with persistent supply/demand imbalance,\nimproving price environment and continuing steady demand growth. These developments position the\nCompany well should the Company be able to raise the required capital to continue its exploration and\ndevelopment efforts with the goal of successfully developing commercially viable lithium and uranium\ndeposits.\nWith large lithium and uranium resources, strategically located in Nevada and Peru, and with recent\nsuccessful development work on all its projects, the Company believes that it is well positioned to benefit\nfrom growing demand for sustainable, domestically sourced supplies of lithium and the need for clean/green\nbaseload energy that can only be answered with nuclear energy as a large part of the Global energy mix.\nSelected Annual Information\nThe financial information presented below for the current and comparative periods was derived from the\nconsolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS.\nYear ended Year ended Year ended\nFebruary 29 February 28 February 28\n2024 2023 2022\n$ $\nNet loss (39,904,090) (35,666,542) (23,546,760)\nComprehensive loss (39,883,230) (34,985,004) (23,697,875)\nTotal assets 173,594,831 194,280,141 193,493,125\nNon-current financial liabilities 1,130,763 151,308 8 28,237\nBasic and diluted loss per common share (0.19) (0.17) (0.13)\nOther items 3 42,357 1,778,616 1 14,906\n25\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nSummary of Quarterly Results\nThe following table sets out selected quarterly financial information for each of the eight most recently\ncompleted quarters.

Changes in the Company’s interest in its associated\ncompany resulting in dilution gains or losses, are recognized in the consolidated statements of loss and\ncomprehensive loss.\nThe Company determines whether any objective evidence of impairment exists at each reporting date. If\nimpaired, the carrying value of the investment is written down to its recoverable amount.\nAn assessment is made at each reporting date to determine whether there is an indication that previously\nrecognised impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased. If such indication exists, the Company\nestimates the asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount. A previously recognized impairment loss is reversed\nonly if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since\nthe last impairment loss was recognized. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does\nnot exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net\nof depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is\nrecognized in the consolidated statement of loss and comprehensive loss.\n29\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nAccounting pronouncements not yet adopted\nIFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements, which will replace IAS 1, Presentation of\nFinancial Statements aims to improve how companies communicate in their financial statements, with a focus\non information about financial performance in the statement of profit or loss, in particular additional defined\nsubtotals, disclosures about management-defined performance measures and new principles for aggregation\nand disaggregation of information. IFRS 18 is accompanied by limited amendments to the requirements in\nIAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows.\nThe Company has performed an assessment of new standards issued by the IASB that are not yet effective\nand has determined that any other standards that have been issued would have no or very minimal impact\non the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements.\nJudgements and estimates\nThe preparation of annual consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management\nto make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the\nreported amounts of assets, liabilities, and contingent liabilities as at the date of the annual consolidated\nfinancial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.\nEstimates and assumptions are continuously evaluated and are based on management’s experience and\nother factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the\ncircumstances. However, actual outcomes can differ from these estimates. The results of estimates form the\nbasis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from\nother sources.\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting\nestimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period\nor in the period of the revision and further periods if the review affects both current and future periods.\nThe key areas of judgement and estimation impacting these condensed interim consolidated financial\nstatements are as follows:\nCarrying value of exploration and evaluation assets\nThe Company’s exploration and evaluation assets represent its most significant asset in the\nstatement of financial position. The Company’s management applies its judgement, using facts and\ncircumstances available at the time, to determine whether the exploration and evaluation asset value\nmay be realized. For each of its projects, the Company reviews its right to the claims/concessions,\nfuture plans and exploration or development progress to determine if it should test the respective\nprojects for impairment. There is significant judgement involved in determining if a project shows\nimpairment indicators that may impact the carrying value of exploration and evaluation assets.\nValuation of share-based compensation awards\nStock options are valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with inputs that can\nsignificantly impact the calculated value. Typical inputs into the Black-Scholes option pricing model\ninclude: exercise price, historical volatility, time to expiration and risk-free discount rates. Historical\nvolatility and risk-free discount rates in particular require judgement around the reference period or\nbenchmark rate used as inputs into the Black-Scholes option pricing model.\n30\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nValuation of common shares and common share purchase warrants received from investment in Surge\nBattery Metals Inc.\nThe Company’s investment in Surge required the use of the Black-Scholes option pricing model to\ndetermine the discount for lack of marketability applied to the initial value of the Surge common\nshares and to value the Surge common share purchase warrants. Typical inputs into the Black-\nScholes option pricing model include: exercise price, historical volatility, time to expiration and risk-\nfree discount rates. Historical volatility and risk-free discount rates in particular require judgement\naround the reference period or benchmark rate used as inputs into the Black-Scholes option pricing\nmodel.\nDetermination of significant influence\nThe accounting for investments in other companies can vary depending on the degree of control and\ninfluence over those other companies. Management is required to assess at each reporting date the\nCompany’s control and influence over these other companies. Management has used its judgment\nto determine which companies are controlled and require consolidation and those which are\nsignificantly influenced and require equity accounting. As at August 31, 2024, the Company\ndetermined it has significant influence in Surge.\nFinancial Instruments and Risk Management\nFair value of financial instruments\nThe Company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, GICs, a short-term investment,\namounts receivable, deposits, reclamation deposits, accounts payable and accrued liabilities and lease\nliabilities. As at August 31, 2024, the Company classifies its short-term investment as FVTPL and its\nremaining financial assets at amortized cost. For financial instruments at amortized cost, their carrying values\napproximate their fair values because of their current nature. The carrying value of the Company’s lease\nliability is measured at the present value of the discounted future cash flows.\nThe Company classifies the fair value of these financial instruments according to the following hierarchy\nbased on the amount of observable inputs used to value the instrument:\nLevel 1 – Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting\ndate. Active markets are those in which transactions occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide\npricing information on an ongoing basis.\nLevel 2 – Fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices that are observable\nfor the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices).\nLevel 3 – Valuations in the level are those with inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable\nmarket data. The Company’s Surge Warrants (short-term investment) are classified under Level 3.\nThe Company’s financial instruments are exposed to the following risks:\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet\nits contractual obligations. Financial instruments which are potentially subject to credit risk for the Company\nconsist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, GICs and amounts receivable. The cash and cash equivalents\nand GICs are held at Canadian financial institutions and the Company considers the credit risk to be minimal.\nThe Company’s amounts receivable balance primarily consists of good and sales taxes receivables from the\nGovernment of Canada. As at August 31, 2024, the Company has gross credit exposure of $5,765,070.\n31\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nLiquidity Risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its obligations with respect to financial\nliabilities as they come due. The Company’s financial liabilities are comprised of accounts payable and\naccrued liabilities. The Company manages its liquidity risk by forecasting cash flows from operations and\nanticipating any investing and financing activities. Liquidity risk is assessed as low. As at August 31, 2024,\nthe Company had a cash and cash equivalents balance of $5,726,605 to settle financial liabilities of\n$1,481,785. Liquidity risk is assessed as low.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nThe Company is exposed to foreign currency risk on fluctuations related to cash and cash equivalents,\nreclamation deposits, and accounts payable and accrued liabilities that are denominated in a foreign\ncurrency. As at August 31, 2024, the Company had foreign currency net assets $795,513 in United States\ndollars, amounting to $1,073,227. A 10% fluctuation in the foreign exchange rate of foreign currencies against\nthe Canadian dollar would result in a foreign exchange gain/loss of approximately $107,322.\nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate\nbecause of changes in market interest rates. The Company has cash and cash equivalents balances and\nterm deposits with interest based on the prime rate. The Company’s current policy is to invest excess cash\nin investment-grade short-term deposit certificates issued by its banking institution. The Company periodically\nmonitors the investments it makes and is satisfied with the credit ratings of its banks.\nPrice Risk\nPrice risk is the risk that assets or liabilities carried at fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument\nwill fluctuate because of changes in market conditions. As at August 31, 2024, the Company’s maximum\nexposure to price risk on its short-term investment is $2,081,020.\nDuring the six months period ended August 31, 2024, and August 31, 2023, there were no transfers between\nlevel 1, level 2 and level 3 classified assets and liabilities.\nOutstanding Share Data\nAs at the date of this report:\na) Authorized: unlimited common shares without par value.\nb) Issued and outstanding: 217,784,501 common shares, 10,647,016 stock options, 2,530,000 restricted\nshare units and 2,000,000 performance share units.\nc) Outstanding stock options and their respective exercise prices are below.\nNumber of Number of\noptions options Exercise price Remaining\noutstanding exercisable $ life (years) Expiry date\n200,000 200,000 0.25 0.43 04-Feb-25\n1,729,167 1,729,167 1.28 1.05 17-Sep-25\n51,515 51,515 1.03 1.27 09-Dec-25\n5,758,334 5,758,334 2.17 1.78 10-Jun-26\n1,323,000 1,323,000 3.63 2.46 16-Feb-27\n250,000 250,000 1.91 2.84 04-Jul-27\n150,000 150,000 2.14 3.09 04-Oct-27\n1,185,000 1,185,000 4.85 3.42 02-Feb-28\n10,647,016 10,647,016\n32\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nInternal controls over financial reporting\nThe Company’s management is responsible for designing and maintaining an adequate system of internal\ncontrols over financial reporting as required under National Instrument 52-109 – Certification of Disclosure in\nIssuers’ Annual and Interim Filings. Management designed the internal control system based on the Internal\nControl – Integrated Framework (2013) published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (COSO). From this framework, an evaluation of the internal control system was\ncompleted, and management concluded that the system of internal controls over financial reporting was\neffective as at February 29, 2024.\nAny internal control system, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations. Therefore, internal controls\ncan only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.\nThere have not been any significant changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during\nthe six months period ended August 31, 2024 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting.\nDisclosure controls and procedures\nThe Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that\ninformation required to be disclosed by the Company is recorded, processed, summarized and reported\nwithin the time periods specified in the securities legislation. The Company’s management has concluded\nthat the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as at February 29, 2024.\nAny control system, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations. Therefore, disclosure controls and\nprocedures can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to timely disclosure of material information.\nRisk Factors\nThe Company is in the business of acquiring, exploring and, if warranted, developing and exploiting mineral\nproperties. Due to the nature of the Company’s business and the present stage of exploration of its mineral\nproperties (which are primarily early-stage exploration properties with no established reserves), there are a\nnumber of risks that may have a material and adverse impact on the future operating and financial\nperformance of the Company and could cause the Company’s operating and financial performance to differ\nmaterially from the estimates described in forward-looking statements relating to the Company. Readers are\nadvised to review and consider risk factors disclosed in the Annual Information Form for the fiscal year ended\nFebruary 29, 2024 available under the Company’s profile on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca.\nResource Exploration and Development is Generally a Speculative Business: Resource exploration and\ndevelopment is a speculative business and involves a high degree of risk, including, among other things,\nunprofitable efforts resulting not only from the failure to discover mineral deposits but from finding mineral\ndeposits which, though present, are insufficient in size or too metallurgically challenging to return a profit from\nproduction. The marketability of natural resources that may be acquired or discovered by the Company will\nbe affected by numerous factors beyond the control of the Company. These factors include market\nfluctuations, the proximity and capacity of natural resource markets, government regulations, including\nregulations relating to prices, taxes, royalties, land use, importing and exporting of minerals and\nenvironmental protection. The exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted, but the\ncombination of these factors may result in the Company not receiving an adequate return on invested capital.\nThe great majority of exploration projects do not result in the discovery of commercially mineable deposits of\nore.\n33\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nTitle to Property: The acquisition of title to resource properties is a detailed and time-consuming process.\nThe Company may acquire an interest in its properties through land use permits. Title to, and the area of, the\nproperties may be disputed. There is no guarantee that such title will not be challenged or impaired. There\nmay be challenges to the title of the property in which the Company may have an interest, including\nconcessions which, if successful, could result in the loss or reduction of the Company's interest in the\nproperty, including the Peru concessions. Refer to the Cautionary Note Regarding Concessions in this MD&A.\nPotential conflicts of Interest: Certain of the Company’s directors and officers may serve as directors and/or\nofficers of other public and private companies and devote a portion of their time to managing other business\ninterests. This may result in certain conflicts of interest, to the extent that such other companies may\nparticipate in ventures in which the Company is also participating. The laws of British Columbia require the\ndirectors and officers to act honestly, in good faith, and in the best interests of the Company. In addition, each\ndirector must declare his or her interest and abstain from voting on any contract or transaction in which the\ndirector may have a conflict of interest.\nPermits and Licenses: The operations of the Company will require licenses and permits from various\ngovernmental authorities. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain all necessary\nlicenses and permits that may be required to carry out exploration, development, and mining operations at\nits projects.\nMining Industry is Intensely Competitive: The Company’s business will be the acquisition, exploration and\ndevelopment of resource properties. The mining industry is intensely competitive, and the Company will\ncompete with other companies that have far greater resources.\nEnvironmental Matters: Existing and possible future environmental legislation, regulations and actions could\ncause significant expense, capital expenditures, restrictions, and delays in the activities of the Company, the\nextent of which cannot be predicted, and which may well be beyond the capacity of the Company to fund.\nThe Company’s right to exploit any mining properties will be subject to various reporting requirements and to\nobtaining certain government approvals and there can be no assurance that such approvals, including\nenvironment approvals, will be obtained without inordinate delay or at all.\nForeign Operations: The Company is exposed to risks of political instability and changes in government\npolicies, laws and regulations in Peru. The Company holds mineral interests in the Republic of Peru that may\nbe adversely affected in varying degrees by political instability, government regulations relating to the mining\nindustry and foreign investment therein, and the policies of other nations in respect of Peru. Any changes in\nregulations (including, without limitation, the New Uranium Regulations) or shifts in political conditions are\nbeyond the Company’s control and may adversely affect the Company’s business. New laws, regulations\nand requirements may be retroactive in their effect and implementation. The Company’s operations may be\naffected in varying degrees by government regulations, including those with respect to restrictions on\nproduction, price controls, export controls, income taxes, expropriation of property, employment, land use,\nwater use, environmental legislation and mine safety. The Company's operations may also be adversely\naffected in varying degrees by government regulations, including those with respect to restrictions on foreign\nownership, state-ownership of strategic resources, production, price controls, export controls, income taxes,\nexpropriation of property, employment, land use, water use, environmental legislation, and mine safety. There\nis no assurance that permits can be obtained, or that delays will not occur in obtaining all necessary permits\nor renewals of such permits for existing properties or additional permits required in connection with future\nexploration and development programs. In the event of a dispute arising at the Company’s foreign operations,\nthe Company may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or may not be successful in\nsubjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts in Canada. The Company may also be hindered or\nprevented from enforcing its rights with respect to a government entity or instrumentality because of the\ndoctrine of sovereign immunity. Government authorities in emerging market countries often have a high\ndegree of discretion and at times may appear to act selectively or arbitrarily, and sometimes in a manner that\nmay not be in full accordance with the rule of law or that may be influenced by political or commercial\nconsiderations. Unlawful, selective, or arbitrary governmental actions could include denial or withdrawal of\nlicenses, sudden and unexpected tax audits, and civil actions. Although unlawful, selective, or arbitrary\ngovernment action may be challenged in court, such action, if directed at the Company or its shareholders,\ncould have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition\nand future prospects.\n34\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFluctuation of Metal Prices: Even if commercial quantities of mineral deposits are discovered by the\nCompany, there is no guarantee that a profitable market will exist for the sale of the metals produced. Factors\nbeyond the control of the Company may affect the marketability of any substances discovered. The prices of\nvarious metals have experienced significant movement over short periods of time and are affected by\nnumerous factors beyond the control of the Company, including international economic and political trends,\nexpectations of inflation, currency exchange fluctuations, interest rates and global or regional consumption\npatterns, speculative activities, and increased production due to improved mining and production methods.\nThe supply of and demand for metals are affected by various factors, including political events, economic\nconditions, and production costs in major producing regions. There can be no assurance that the price of any\nmineral deposit will be such that any of its resource properties could be mined at a profit.\nNo Assurance of Profitability: The Company has no history of earnings and, due to the nature of its\nproposed business, there can be no assurance that the Company will ever be profitable. The Company has\nnot paid dividends on its shares and does not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future. The only present\nsource of funds available to the Company is from the sale of its common shares or, possibly, the sale or\noptioning of a portion of its interest in its resource properties. Even if the results of exploration are\nencouraging, the Company may not have sufficient funds to conduct the further exploration that may be\nnecessary to determine whether or not a commercially mineable deposit exists. While the Company may\ngenerate additional working capital through further equity offerings or through the sale or possible syndication\nof its properties, there can be no assurance that any such funds will be available on favourable terms, or at\nall. At present, it is impossible to determine what amounts of additional funds, if any, may be required. Failure\nto raise such additional capital could put the continued viability of the Company at risk.\nDependence Upon Others and Key Personnel: The success of the Company’s operations will depend\nupon numerous factors, many of which are beyond the Company’s control, including (i) the ability to design\nand carry out appropriate exploration programs on its resource properties; (ii) the ability to produce minerals\nfrom any resource deposits that may be located; (iii) the ability to attract and retain additional key personnel\nin exploration, marketing, mine development and finance; and (iv) the ability and the operating resources to\ndevelop and maintain the properties held by the Company. These and other factors will require the use of\noutside suppliers as well as the talents and efforts of the Company and its consultants and employees. There\ncan be no assurance of success with any or all of these factors on which the Company’s operations will\ndepend, or that the Company will be successful in finding and retaining the necessary employees, personnel\nand/or consultants in order to be able to successfully carry out such activities.\nEstimates of Mineral Resources May Prove to Be Inaccurate: Calculations of mineral resources, mineral\nreserves and metal recovery are estimates only, and there can be no assurance about the quantity and grade\nof minerals until reserves or resources are actually mined. Until reserves or resources are mined and\nprocessed, the quantity of reserves or resources and grades must be considered as estimates only. In\naddition, the quantity of reserves or resources may vary depending on commodity prices. Any material\nchanges in the quantity of resources, grade or stripping ratio or recovery rates may adversely affect the\neconomic viability of the Projects and the Company's financial condition and prospects.\nPEA Results Are Preliminary in Nature: PEA’s are preliminary in nature and include inferred mineral\nresources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to\nthem that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves. There is no certainty the results of the\nPEA’s will be realized. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic\nviability. Additional work is required to upgrade the mineral resources to mineral reserves. In addition, the\nmineral resource estimates could be materially affected by environmental, geotechnical, permitting, legal,\ntitle, taxation, socio-political, marketing, or other relevant factors.\nGovernment Regulation: The Company’s business interests and operations are subject to the laws and\nregulations of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. These laws and regulations are wide-ranging\nand oversee social license, exploration, development, taxes, employee labour standards, health and safety,\nenvironmental protection, human rights, anticorruption measures and matters related to later stage operating\ncompanies including but not limited to production, exports, waste disposal and tailings management, safe\nhandling of toxic substances, water usage and greenhouse gases. Compliance with such laws and\nregulations increases the costs of planning, designing, drilling, developing, constructing, operating,\nmanaging, closing, reclaiming, and rehabilitating a mine or other facilities. Introduction of new laws,\n35\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\namendments to current laws and regulations governing mining activities and operations or more stringent\nimplementation or arbitrary interpretation thereof could have a material adverse effect on the Company,\nincrease costs, cause a reduction in levels of production, and delay or prevent the development of the\nCompany’s projects. Regulatory enforcement, in the form of compliance or infraction notices, has occurred\nin the past and, while the current risks related to such enforcement are not expected to be material, the risk\nof material fines or corrective action cannot be ruled out in the future.\nUninsured or Uninsurable Risks: The Company may become subject to liability for pollution or hazards\nagainst which it cannot insure or against which it may elect not to insure where premium costs are\ndisproportionate to the Company’s perception of the relevant risks. The payment of such insurance premiums\nand of such liabilities would reduce the funds available for exploration and production activities.\nExploration and Development Activities Are Inherently Risky: The business of exploration and extraction\ninvolves a high degree of risk. Few properties that are explored are ultimately developed into production.\nUnusual or unexpected formations, formation pressures, power outages, labour disruptions, explosions,\ncave-ins, landslides, and the inability to obtain suitable or adequate machinery, equipment or labour are other\nrisks involved in the conduct of exploration programs. These factors can all affect the timing, cost and success\nof exploration programs and any future development. Although the Company carries liability insurance with\nrespect to its exploration operations, the Company may become subject to liability for damage to life and\nproperty, environmental damage, cave-ins, or hazards against which it cannot insure or against which it may\nelect not to insure.\nPrevious operations may have caused environmental damage at certain of the Company's properties. It may\nbe difficult or impossible to assess the extent to which such damage was caused by the Company or by the\nactivities of previous operators, in which case, any indemnities and exemptions from liability may be\nineffective, and the Company may be responsible for the costs of reclamation.\nPrice Fluctuations and Share Price Volatility: In recent years, the securities markets in the United States\nand Canada have experienced a high level of price and volume volatility, and the market price of securities\nof many companies, particularly those considered development stage companies, have experienced wide\nfluctuations in price which have not necessarily been related to the operating performance, underlying asset\nvalues or prospects of such companies. There can be no assurance that continual and extreme fluctuations\nin price will not occur.\nRights or Claims of Indigenous Groups: The Company’s properties may be located in areas presently or\npreviously inhabited or used by indigenous peoples and may be affected by evolving regulations regarding\nthe rights of indigenous peoples. The Company’s operations are subject to national and international laws,\ncodes, resolutions, conventions, guidelines, and other similar rules respecting the rights of indigenous\npeoples, including the provisions of ILO Convention 169. ILO Convention 169 mandates, among other things,\nthat governments consult with indigenous peoples who may be impacted by mining projects prior to granting\nrights, permits or approvals in respect of such projects. The Company's current or future operations are\nsubject to a risk that one or more groups of indigenous people may oppose continued operation, further\ndevelopment, or new development on those projects or operations on which the Company holds an interest.\nSuch opposition may be directed through legal or administrative proceedings or protests, roadblocks or other\nforms of public expression against the Company or the owner/operators' activities and may require the\nmodification of, or preclude operation or development of projects, or may require the entering into of\nagreements with indigenous people.\nSurface Rights and Access: Although the Company acquires the rights to some or all of the minerals in the\nground subject to the tenures that it acquires, or has a right to acquire, in most cases it does not thereby\nacquire any rights to, or ownership of, the surface to the areas covered by its mineral tenures. In such cases,\napplicable mining laws usually provide for rights of access to the surface for the purpose of carrying on mining\nactivities, however, the enforcement of such rights can be costly and time consuming. In areas where there\nare no existing surface rights holders, this does not usually cause a problem, as there are no impediments to\nsurface access. However, in areas where there are local populations or landowners, it is necessary, as a\npractical matter, to negotiate surface access. There can be no guarantee that, despite having the right at law\nto access the surface and conduct mining activities, the Company will be able to negotiate a satisfactory\nagreement with any such existing landowners/occupiers for such access, and therefore it may be unable to\n36\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\ncarry out mining activities. In addition, in circumstances where such access is denied, or no agreement can\nbe reached, the Company may need to rely on the assistance of local officials or the courts in such\njurisdictions. The Company’s properties are primarily located on land administered by the United States\nBureau of Land Management, and access is permitted subject to the completion of certain filings, tax\npayments and other obligations as are customary for mineral exploration companies operating in the State\nof Nevada.\nIf any of the Company's properties moves to a development stage, the Company would be subject to\nadditional risks respecting any development and production activities.\nNo Known Mineral Reserves: Despite exploration work on the Company’s mineral property interests, to\ndate no mineral reserves have been established thereon. In addition, the Company is still engaged in\nexploration on all of its material properties in order to determine if any economic deposits exist thereon. The\nCompany may expend substantial funds on exploring some of its properties only to abandon them and lose\nits entire expenditure on the properties if no commercial or economic quantities of minerals are found. Even\nif commercial quantities of minerals are discovered, the exploration properties might not be brought into a\nstate of commercial production. Finding mineral deposits is dependent on a number of factors, including the\ntechnical skill of exploration personnel involved. The commercial viability of a mineral deposit once\ndiscovered is also dependent on a number of factors, some of which are the particular attributes of the\ndeposit, such as content of the deposit including harmful substances, size, grade, and proximity to\ninfrastructure, as well as metal prices and the availability of power and water in sufficient supply to permit\ndevelopment. Most of these factors are beyond the control of the entity conducting such mineral exploration.\nThe Company is an exploration and development stage company with no history of pre-tax profit and no\nincome from its operations. There can be no assurance that the Company’s operations will be profitable in\nthe future. There is no certainty that the expenditures to be made by the Company in the exploration and\ndevelopment of its properties will result in discoveries of mineralized material in commercial quantities. Most\nexploration projects do not result in the discovery of commercially mineable deposits and no assurance can\nbe given that any particular level of recovery of mineral reserves will in fact be realized or that any identified\nmineral deposit will ever qualify as a commercially mineable (or viable) mineral deposit which can be legally\nand economically exploited. There can be no assurance that minerals recovered in small scale tests will be\nduplicated in large scale tests under on-site conditions or in production. If the Company is unsuccessful in its\nexploration and development efforts, it may be forced to acquire additional projects or cease operations.\nClimate Change Risks: The Company acknowledges climate change as an international and community\nconcern, and it supports and endorses various initiatives for voluntary actions consistent with international\ninitiatives on climate change. However, in addition to voluntary actions, governments are moving to introduce\nclimate change legislation and treaties at the international, national, state/provincial and local levels. Where\nlegislation already exists, regulation relating to emission levels and energy efficiency is becoming more\nstringent. Some of the costs associated with reducing emissions can be offset by increased energy efficiency\nand technological innovation. However, if the current regulatory trend continues, the Company expects that\nthis could result in increased costs at its operations in the future.\nLitigation Risk: In the ordinary course of the Company’s business, it may become party to new litigation or\nother proceedings in local or international jurisdictions in respect of any aspect of its business, whether under\ncriminal law, contract or otherwise. The causes of potential litigation cannot be known and may arise from,\namong other things, business activities, employment matters, including compensation issues, environmental,\nhealth and safety laws and regulations, tax matters, volatility in the Company’s stock price, failure to comply\nwith disclosure obligations or labour disruptions at its project sites. Regulatory and government agencies may\ninitiate investigations relating to the enforcement of applicable laws or regulations and the Company may\nincur expenses in defending them and be subject to fines or penalties in case of any violation and could face\ndamage to its reputation. The Company may attempt to resolve disputes involving foreign\ncontractors/suppliers through arbitration in another county and such arbitration proceedings may be costly\nand protracted, which may have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition. Litigation may be\ncostly and time-consuming and can divert the attention of management and key personnel from the\nCompany’s operations and, if adjudged adversely to the Company, may have a material and adverse effect\non the Company’s cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\n37\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nCosts of Land Reclamation: It is difficult to determine the exact amounts which will be required to complete\nall land reclamation activities in connection with the properties in which the Company holds an interest.\nReclamation bonds and other forms of financial assurance represent only a portion of the total amount of\nmoney that will be spent on reclamation activities over the life of a mine. Accordingly, it may be necessary to\nrevise planned expenditures and operating plans in order to fund reclamation activities. Such costs may have\na material adverse impact upon the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.\nForeign Currency Risk: The Company and its subsidiaries incur significant purchases denominated in\ncurrencies other than the presentation currency, the Canadian dollar, and are subject to foreign currency risk\non assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the Canadian dollar. Exploration expenditures\nare transacted in United States Dollars, Peruvian New Soles and Australian Dollars, and the Company is\nexposed to risk of exchange rate fluctuation between the Canadian dollar and these currencies. The\nCompany does not hedge the foreign currency balances.\nCorruption and Bribery Laws: The Company’s operations are governed by, and involve interactions with,\nmany levels of government in other countries. The Company is required to comply with anti-corruption and\nanti-bribery laws, including the Criminal Code, and the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act (Canada),\nas well as similar laws in the countries in which the Company conducts its business. In recent years, there\nhas been a general increase in both the frequency of enforcement and the severity of penalties under such\nlaws, resulting in greater scrutiny and punishment to companies convicted of violating anti-corruption and\nanti-bribery laws. Measures that the Company has adopted to mitigate these risks are not always effective in\nensuring that the Company, its employees, or third-party agents will comply strictly with such laws.\nFurthermore, a company may be found liable for violations by not only its employees, but also by its\ncontractors and third-party agents. If the Company finds itself subject to an enforcement action or is found to\nbe in violation of such laws, this may result in significant penalties, fines and/or sanctions imposed on the\nCompany resulting in a material adverse effect on the Company’s reputation and results of its operations.\nCautionary notice to US investors regarding mineral resource estimates\nDisclosure of mineral resource estimates and mineral classification terms herein are made in accordance\nwith the Canadian National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects. NI 43-101 is a\nrule established by the Canadian Securities Administrators (“CSA”) that sets the standards for all public\ndisclosure by issuers regarding scientific information and technical data concerning mineral projects. Unless\notherwise indicated, all mineral resource estimates contained in the technical disclosure have been prepared\nin accordance with NI 43-101 and the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum Definition\nStandards on Mineral Resources and Reserves (“CIM Definition Standards”). Canadian standards, including\nNI 43-101, differ significantly from the historical requirements of the United States Securities and Exchange\nCommission (“SEC”), and mineral resource information contained or incorporated by reference in this MD&A\nmay not be comparable to similar information disclosed by U.S. companies.\nThe SEC has adopted amendments to its disclosure rules to modernize the mineral property disclosure\nrequirements for issuers whose securities are registered with the SEC. These amendments became effective\nFebruary 25, 2019 (the “SEC Modernization Rules”) and, following a two-year transition period, the SEC\nModernization Rules replaced the historical property disclosure requirements for mining registrants that are\nincluded in SEC Industry Guide 7 for fiscal years beginning January 1, 2021 or later.\nUnder the SEC Modernization Rules, the definitions of “proven mineral reserves” and “probable mineral\nreserves” have been amended to be substantially similar to the corresponding CIM Definition Standards and\nthe SEC has added definitions to recognize “measured mineral resources”, “indicated mineral resources” and\n“inferred mineral resources” which are also substantially similar to the corresponding CIM Definition\nStandards; however, there are still differences in the definitions and standards under the SEC Modernization\nRules and the CIM Definition Standards. Therefore, the Company’s mineral resources as determined in\naccordance with NI 43-101 may be significantly different than if they had been determined in accordance with\nthe SEC Modernization Rules.\n38\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nOther MD&A Requirements\nAdditional information relating to the Company may be found on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca including,\nbut not limited to:\n the Company’s condensed interim consolidated financial Statement for the six months period ended\nAugust 31, 2024, and August 31, 2023;\n the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended February 29, 2024,\nand February 28, 2023\n the Company’s Annual Information Form.\n39"

To exercise this right, a Shareholder shall strike out the\nnames of the persons named in the accompanying form of proxy and insert the name of the\nShareholder’s nominee in the blank space provided or complete another suitable form of proxy.\nA proxy will not be valid unless it is duly completed, signed and deposited with the Company’s registrar and\ntransfer agent, Odyssey Trust Company (“Odyssey”) by hand or mail at the United Kingdom Building, Suite\n350, 409 Granville Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, V6C 1T2, or by fax within North America at 1-800-\n517-4553 or via email to proxy@odysseytrust.com, not less than 48 hours (excluding Saturdays, Sundays\nand holidays) before the time of the Meeting or any adjournment thereof. A proxy must be signed by the\nShareholder or by his attorney in writing, or, if the Shareholder is a corporation, it must either be under its\ncommon seal or signed by a duly authorized officer.\nVOTING BY PROXYHOLDER\nManner of Voting\nThe common shares represented by the Proxy will be voted or withheld from voting in accordance with the\ninstructions of the Shareholder on any ballot that may be called for and, if the Shareholder specifies a\nchoice on the Proxy with respect to any matter to be acted upon, the shares will be voted accordingly. On\nany poll, the persons named in the Proxy (the “Proxyholders”) will vote the shares in respect of which they\nare appointed. Where directions are given by the Shareholder in respect of voting for or against any\nresolution, the Proxyholder will do so in accordance with such direction.\nThe Proxy, when properly signed, confers discretionary authority on the Proxyholder with respect to\namendments or variations to the matters which may properly be brought before the Meeting. At the time of\nprinting this Circular, Management is not aware that any such amendments, variations or other matters are\nto be presented for action at the Meeting. However, if any other matters which are not now known to\nManagement should properly come before the Meeting, the proxies hereby solicited will be exercised on\nsuch matters in accordance with the best judgment of the Proxyholder.\nIn the absence of instructions to the contrary, the Proxyholders intend to vote the common shares\nrepresented by each Proxy, properly executed, in favour of the motions proposed to be made at the\nMeeting as stated under the headings in this Circular.\nRevocation of Proxy\nA Shareholder who has given a Proxy may revoke it at any time before it is exercised. In addition to\nrevocation in any other manner permitted by law, a Proxy may be revoked by instrument in writing executed\nby the Shareholder or by his or her attorney authorized in writing, or, if the Shareholder is a corporation, it\nmust either be under its common seal or signed by a duly authorized officer and deposited with the\nCompany’s registrar and transfer agent, Odyssey at Suite 350, 409 Granville Street, Vancouver, British\nColumbia, V6C 1T2, or by fax to 1-800-517-4553, or via email to proxy@odysseytrust.com at any time up\nto and including the last business day preceding the day of the Meeting, or any adjournment of it, at which\nthe Proxy is to be used, or to the Chair of the Meeting on the day of the Meeting or any adjournment of it.\nA revocation of a Proxy does not affect any matter on which a vote has been taken prior to the revocation.\nVoting Thresholds Required for Approval\nIn order to approve a motion proposed at the Meeting, a majority of not less than one-half of the votes cast\nwill be required (an “Ordinary Resolution”) unless the motion requires a special resolution (a “Special\nResolution”), in which case a majority of not less than two-thirds of the votes cast will be required. In the\nevent a motion proposed at the Meeting requires disinterested Shareholder approval, common shares held\nby Shareholders of the Company who are also “insiders”, as such term is defined under applicable\nsecurities laws, will be excluded from the count of votes cast on such motion.\nADVICE TO REGISTERED SHAREHOLDERS\nShareholders whose names appear on the records of the Company as the registered holders of common\nshares in the capital of the Company (the “Registered Shareholders”) may choose to vote by proxy\nwhether or not they are able to attend the Meeting in person.\nRegistered Shareholders who choose to submit a Proxy may do so by completing, signing, dating and\ndepositing the Proxy with Odyssey, by hand or mail at United Kingdom Building, Suite 350, 409 Granville\nStreet, Vancouver, British Columbia, V6C 1T2, or by fax within North America at 1-800-517-4553 or by\nemail at proxy@odysseytrust.com, not less than 48 hours (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays)\nbefore the time of the Meeting or any adjournment thereof. The Proxy may be signed by the Shareholder\nor by his or her attorney in writing, or, if the Registered Shareholder is a corporation, it must either be under\nits common seal or signed by a duly authorized officer.\n2\nReturning your proxy form\nTo be effective, we must receive your completed proxy form or voting instruction no later than 10:00 a.m.\n(Vancouver time) on November 25, 2024.\nIf the meeting is postponed or adjourned, we must receive your completed form of proxy by 5:00 p.m.\n(Vancouver time), two full business days before any adjourned or postponed meeting at which the proxy is\nto be used. Late proxies may be accepted or rejected by the Chairperson of the Meeting at their discretion\nand they are under no obligation to accept or reject a late proxy. The Chairperson of the Meeting may waive\nor extend the proxy cut-off without notice.\nADVICE TO BENEFICIAL SHAREHOLDERS\nThe information set forth in this section is of significant importance to many Shareholders as a\nsubstantial number of Shareholders do not hold shares in their own name.\nShareholders who do not hold their shares in their own name (referred to in this information circular as\n“Beneficial Shareholders”) should note that only proxies deposited by Registered Shareholders whose\nnames appear on the records of the Company as the registered holders of shares can be recognized and\nacted upon at the Meeting.\nIf shares are listed in an account statement provided to a Shareholder by an intermediary, such as a\nbrokerage firm, then, in almost all cases, those shares will not be registered in the Shareholder’s name on\nthe records of the Company. Such shares will more likely be registered under the name of the Shareholder’s\nintermediary or an agent of that intermediary, and consequently the Shareholder will be a Beneficial\nShareholder. In Canada, the vast majority of such shares are registered under the name CDS & Co. (being\nthe registration name for the Canadian Depositary for Securities, which acts as nominee for many Canadian\nbrokerage firms). The shares held by intermediaries, or their agents or nominees can only be voted (for or\nagainst resolutions) upon the instructions of the Beneficial Shareholder. Without specific instructions, an\nintermediary and its agents are prohibited from voting shares for the intermediary’s clients. Therefore,\nBeneficial Shareholders should ensure that instructions respecting the voting of their shares are\ncommunicated to the appropriate person.\nApplicable regulatory rules require intermediaries/brokers to seek voting instructions from Beneficial\nShareholders in advance of Shareholders’ meetings. Every intermediary/broker has its own mailing\nprocedures and provides its own return instructions to clients, which should be carefully followed by\nBeneficial Shareholders in order to ensure that their shares are voted at the Meeting. The purpose of the\nform of proxy or voting instruction form provided to a Beneficial Shareholder by its broker, agent or nominee\nis limited to instructing the registered holder of the shares on how to vote such shares on behalf of the\nBeneficial Shareholder.\nThe majority of brokers now delegate responsibility for obtaining instructions from clients to Broadridge\nInvestor Communications (“Broadridge”). Broadridge typically supplies a voting instruction form, mails\nthose forms to Beneficial Shareholders and asks those Beneficial Shareholders to return the forms to\nBroadridge or follow specific telephone or other voting procedures. Broadridge then tabulates the results of\nall instructions received by it and provides appropriate instructions respecting the voting of the shares to be\nrepresented at the Meeting. A Beneficial Shareholder receiving a voting instruction form from\nBroadridge cannot use that form to vote shares directly at the Meeting. Instead, the voting\ninstruction form must be returned to Broadridge or the alternate voting procedures must be\ncompleted well in advance of the Meeting in order to ensure such shares are voted.\nThere are two kinds of Beneficial Shareholders, those who object to their name being made known to the\nissuers of securities which they own (“OBOs” for Objecting Beneficial Owners) and those who do not object\nto the issuers of the securities they own knowing who they are (“NOBOs” for Non-Objecting Beneficial\nOwners). The Company does not intend to pay for intermediaries to deliver these securityholder materials\nto OBOs and, as a result, OBOs will not be sent paper copies unless their intermediary assumes the costs.\n3\nNon-Objecting Beneficial Owners\nPursuant to National Instrument 54-101 – Communication with Beneficial Owners of Securities of a\nReporting Issuer (“NI 54-101”), issuers can obtain a list of their NOBOs from intermediaries for distribution\nof proxy-related materials directly to NOBOs. This year, the Company will rely on those provisions of NI 54-\n101 that permit it to directly deliver proxy-related materials to its NOBOs. As a result, NOBOs can expect\nto receive a scannable voting instruction form (“VIF”) from the Company’s transfer agent, Odyssey. These\nVIFs are to be completed and returned to Odyssey in the envelope provided or by facsimile. In addition,\nOdyssey provides both telephone voting and internet voting as described on the VIF itself which contains\ncomplete instructions. Odyssey will tabulate the results of the VIFs received from NOBOs and will provide\nappropriate instructions at the Meeting with respect to the shares represented by the VIFs they receive.\nIf you are a Beneficial Shareholder and the Company or its agent has sent these proxy-related materials to\nyou directly, please be advised that your name, address and information about your holdings of securities\nhave been obtained in accordance with applicable securities regulatory requirements from the intermediary\nholding your securities on your behalf. By choosing to send these proxy-related materials to you directly,\nthe Company (and not the intermediaries holding securities your behalf) has assumed responsibility for (i)\ndelivering the proxy-related materials to you and (ii) executing your proper voting instructions as specified\nin the VIF.\nObjecting Beneficial Owners\nBeneficial Shareholders, who are OBOs, should follow the instructions of their intermediary carefully to\nensure that their shares are voted at the Meeting.\nApplicable regulatory rules require intermediaries to seek voting instructions from OBOs in advance of\nShareholders’ meetings. Every intermediary has its own mailing procedures and provides its own return\ninstructions to clients, which should be carefully followed by OBOs in order to ensure that their shares are\nvoted at the Meeting. The purpose of the form of proxy or voting instruction form provided to an OBO by its\nbroker, agent or nominee is limited to instructing the registered holder of the shares on how to vote such\nshares on behalf of the OBO. The Company does not intend to pay for intermediaries to deliver these\nsecurityholder materials to OBOs and, as a result, OBOs will not be sent paper copies unless their\nintermediary assumes the costs.\nThe form of proxy provided to OBOs by intermediaries will be similar to the Proxy provided to Registered\nShareholders. However, its purpose is limited to instructing the intermediary on how to vote your shares on\nyour behalf. The majority of intermediaries now delegate responsibility for obtaining instructions from OBOs\nto Broadridge Investor Communications (“Broadridge”). Broadridge typically supplies voting instruction\nforms, mails those forms to OBOs, and asks those OBOs to return the forms to Broadridge or follow specific\ntelephonic or other voting procedures. Broadridge then tabulates the results of all instructions received by\nit and provides appropriate instructions respecting the voting of the shares to be represented at the meeting.\nAn OBO receiving a voting instruction form from Broadridge cannot use that form to vote shares\ndirectly at the Meeting. Instead, the voting instruction form must be returned to Broadridge or the\nalternate voting procedures must be completed well in advance of the Meeting in order to ensure\nthat such shares are voted.\nNotice-and-Access\nThe Company is not relying on the notice-and-access delivery procedures outlined in NI 54-101 to distribute\ncopies of the Circular, Proxy or VIF.\nINTEREST OF CERTAIN PERSONS OR COMPANIES IN MATTERS TO BE ACTED UPON\nExcept as otherwise disclosed herein, none of the directors (“Directors”) or officers (“Officers”) of the\nCompany, at any time since the beginning of the Company’s last financial year, nor any proposed nominee\nfor election as a Director, or any associate or affiliate of the foregoing persons, has any material interest,\ndirect or indirect, by way of beneficial ownership of securities or otherwise, in any matters to be acted upon\nat the Meeting exclusive of the election of Directors or the appointment of auditors. Directors and Officers\nmay, however, be interested in the approval of the Compensation Plan as detailed in “Approval of\nCompensation Plan” below, as such persons are entitled to participate in the Compensation Plan.\n4\nRECORD DATE, VOTING SHARES AND PRINCIPAL HOLDERS THEREOF\nA Shareholder of record at the close of business on October 22, 2024 (the “Record Date”) who either\npersonally attends the Meeting or who has completed and delivered a proxy in the manner and subject to\nthe provisions described above, shall be entitled to vote or to have such shareholder’s shares voted at the\nMeeting, or any adjournment thereof.\nThe Company’s authorized capital consists of an unlimited number of common shares (the “Common\nShares”) without par value. As at the Record Date, the Company has 217,784,501 Common Shares issued\nand outstanding, each share carrying the right to one vote.\nPrincipal Holders of Voting Securities\nTo the best of knowledge of the Directors and executive officers of the Company, as of the date of the\nCircular, no persons or corporations beneficially own, directly or indirectly, or exercise control or direction\nover, Common Shares carrying more than 10% of the voting rights attached to all outstanding Common\nShares of the Company.\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\nStatement of Executive Compensation\nThe following information regarding executive compensation is presented in accordance with National\nInstrument Form 51-102F6 – Statement of Executive Compensation (“Form 51-102F6”), and sets forth\ncompensation for each of the NEOs, named executive officers and Directors of the Company.\nFor the purpose of this Circular:\n“CEO” means an individual who acted as chief executive officer of the Company, or acted in a\nsimilar capacity, for any part of the most recently completed financial year;\n“CFO” means an individual who acted as chief financial officer of the Company, or acted in a similar\ncapacity, for any part of the most recently completed financial year;\n“Director” means an individual who acted as a director of the Company, or acted in a similar\ncapacity, for any part of the most recently completed financial year;\n“equity incentive plan” means an incentive plan, or portion of an incentive plan, under which\nawards are granted and that falls within the scope of IFRS 2 Share-Based Payments;\n“NEO” or “named executive officer” means each of the following individuals:\n(a) a CEO;\n(b) a CFO;\n(c) each of the three most highly compensated executive officers, or the three most\nhighly compensated individuals acting in a similar capacity, other than the CEO\nand CFO, at the end of the most recently completed financial year whose total\ncompensation was, individually, more than $150,000, as determined in\naccordance with subsection 1.3(6) of National Instrument 51-102 – Continuous\nDisclosure Obligations (“NI 51-102”), for that financial year; and\n(d) each individual who would be an NEO under paragraph (c) but for the fact that the\nindividual was neither an executive officer of the company, nor acting in a similar\ncapacity, at the end of that financial year; and\n“option-based award” means an award under an equity incentive plan of options, including, for\ngreater certainty, share options, share appreciation rights, and similar instruments that have option-\nlike features.\n5\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis\nObjectives of Compensation Program\nGenerally, compensation provided by the Company is determined on an individual basis and is intended to\nbe competitive, motivating and rewarding for each NEO. The following objectives / principles form the basis\nof the Company’s executive compensation program:\n• align interest of executives and shareholders;\n• attract, retain and motivate executives to drive the annual and long-term business goals of the\nCompany and enhance the sustainable development and growth of the Company; and\n• encourage pay for performance mentality and results.\nIn light of these objectives, the Company believes that compensation should be fair and reasonable and be\nset with reference to the market for similar positions at comparable companies. The Company believes that\nan appropriate mix of total compensation be delivered as a combination of fixed pay (base salary) and\nvariable pay (annual cash bonus and equity grants). The compensation program is designed to reward and\nmotivate each NEO in accordance with their qualifications, experience, level of responsibility and position\nwith the Company. Overall, compensation for NEOs is based on determinations by the Board, with the\nassistance of the Corporate Governance, Nominating and Compensation Committee (“CGNC”).\nElements of Executive Compensation\nFor the year ended February 29, 2024, the elements of compensation earned, awarded or paid to the NEOs\nincluded annual compensation in the form of a base salary, a discretionary cash bonus and equity\ncompensation. The elements of compensation paid to NEOs are considered as part of a total compensation\naward and the decision to pay any one particular element does not have any impact on the decision to pay\nthe other element of compensation.\nBase Salary\nBase salaries are paid to NEOs as a means to provide a non-performance-based element of compensation\nthat is certain and predictable and generally competitive with market practices. Base salaries for NEOs are\nfixed and based on agreements between the Company and the NEOs. The level of base salary for each\nNEO is determined by the level of responsibility of his or her position, the individual’s qualifications and\nexperience and his or her performance.\nAnnual Cash Bonus\nThe Company, in its discretion, may award cash bonuses in order to motivate executives to achieve short-\nterm corporate goals. A discretionary bonus for each NEO is determined annually based on an assessment\nof performance of the executive throughout the year and the attainment of goals and objectives set for the\nexecutive. The Board approves annual incentives. The Company does not have a formal bonus plan but\nmay award discretionary bonuses that are recommended by the CEO and approved by the Board.\nAwards\nAwards granted to NEOs are intended to retain NEOs and motivate the NEOs by rewarding sustained,\nlong-term development and growth that will result in increases in stock value. Overall, such Awards are a\nvariable element of the NEOs’ compensation and are awarded in compliance with the Compensation Plan.\nThe Compensation Plan was established to attract and retain persons such as employees, consultants,\nofficers and Directors of the Company and to motivate them to advance the interests of the Company by\naffording them with the opportunity to acquire an equity interest in the Company through securities-based\ncompensation resulting in the acquisition of Common Shares.\nThe Company does not assess its compensation through benchmarks or peer groups at this time.\n6\nRisks Associated with Compensation\nConsidering the Company’s size, the Board does not deem it necessary to consider at this time the\nimplications of the risks associated with the Company’s compensation policies and practices. However, the\nCompany believes its compensation policies alleviate risk by having a balance of short term (salary) and\nlong-term compensation. The CGNC will also evaluate the risks and adjust the Company’s compensation\npolicies as necessary. As previously mentioned, Awards are granted to retain NEOs and motivate the NEOs\nby rewarding sustained, long-term development and growth that will result in increases in stock value. There\nis no formal process for assessing when such Awards are to be granted. Awards are granted at a time\ndetermined necessary by the CGNC and the Board in their discretion.\nFinancial Instruments\nThe Company does not currently have a policy that restricts NEOs or Directors from purchasing financial\ninstruments, including, for greater certainty, prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars, or\nunits of exchange funds that are designed to hedge or offset a decrease in market value of equity. However,\nas of the date of this Circular, no NEO or Director of the Company has participated in the purchase of such\nfinancial instruments pertaining to the Company.\nPerformance Graph\nThe following graph compares the yearly percentage change in the cumulative total shareholder return on\nthe Common Shares against the cumulative total shareholder return of the S&P/TSX Venture Composite\nTotal Return Index for the financial periods 2019 through 2024, assuming a $100 initial investment with all\ndividends reinvested.\nWhile overall compensation paid to the NEOs generally tracks the performance of the market price of the\nCommon Shares, the Common Share price may be affected by a number of factors beyond the control of\nthe Company, including macro- and industry-specific economic and market conditions and therefore\ndepartures from performance may arise in any given year. As discussed under “Executive Compensation -\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis”, the Company’s executive compensation consists of base salary,\ndiscretionary cash bonuses and equity compensation through the Company’s incentive plan. The CGNC\nevaluates performance by reference to the overall direction and success of the Company rather than by\nany short-term fluctuations in the trading price of the shares. The grant of securities-based awards is\nintended to provide long term rewards to motivate and retain talented and capable board members and\nexecutive management.\n7\nShare-based and Option-Based Awards\nGrants of Awards to executive officers are determined by the Board and the CGNC, as applicable, in\naccordance with the Compensation Plan. Previous grants of Awards are taken into account when\nconsidering new grants. The Compensation Plan was established to attract and retain persons such as\nemployees, consultants, officers and Directors of the Company and to motivate them to advance the\ninterests of the Company by affording them with the opportunity to acquire an equity interest in the Company\nthrough Awards granted under the Compensation Plan to acquire Common Shares. Options are exercisable\nby the optionee giving the Company notice and payment of the exercise price for the number of Common\nShares to be acquired. Restricted share units (“RSUs”) and deferred share units (“DSUs”) contain vesting\ncriteria and upon satisfaction of such criteria Common Shares are issued.\nAt this year’s meeting, the Shareholders will be asked to approve the Company’s omnibus incentive plan\n(the “Compensation Plan”) for Directors, officers, employees, management company employees and\nconsultants, as amended. The Compensation Plan allows for the Company to issue stock options\n(“Options” and, together with the RSUs and DSUs, “Awards”).\nThe purpose of the Compensation Plan is to permit the Company to grant awards to eligible participants\nunder the Compensation Plan, subject to certain conditions as hereinafter set forth, for the following\npurposes:\n(a) to increase the interest in the Company’s welfare of those participants, who share\nresponsibility for the management, growth and protection of the business of the Company;\n(b) to provide an incentive to such participants to continue their services for the Company and\nto encourage such participants whose skills, performance and loyalty to the objectives and\ninterests of the Company are necessary or essential to its success, image, reputation or\nactivities;\n(c) to reward participants for their performance of services while working for the Company;\nand\n(d) to provide a means through which the Company may attract and retain able persons to\nenter its employment or service.\nThe following is a summary of certain provisions of the Compensation Plan and is subject to, and qualified\nin its entirety by, the full text of the Compensation Plan:\n• the maximum aggregate number of Common Shares that are issuable pursuant to all\nSecurity Based Compensation (as such term is defined pursuant to the policies of the\nExchange) granted or issued to Insiders (as a group) must not exceed 10% of the Common\nShares at any point in time;\n• the maximum aggregate number of Common Shares issuable pursuant to all Security\nBased Compensation granted or issued in any 12 month period to Insiders of the Company\n(as a group) must not exceed 10% of the issued and outstanding Common Shares,\ncalculated as at the date any Security Based Compensation is granted or issued to any\nInsider;\n• the maximum aggregate number of Common Shares issuable pursuant to all Security\nBased Compensation granted or issued in any 12 month period to any one person (and\nwhere permitted under Exchange Policy 4.4 – Security Based Compensation (“Policy\n4.4”), any companies that are wholly owned by that person) must not exceed 5% of the\nissued and outstanding Common Shares, calculated as at the date an any Security Based\nCompensation is granted or issued to the person;\n• the maximum aggregate number of Common Shares that are issuable pursuant to all\nSecurity Based Compensation granted or issued in any 12 month period to any one\nConsultant must not exceed 2% of the issued and outstanding Common Shares, calculated\nas at the date any Security Based Compensation is granted or issued to the Consultant;\n8\n• Investor Relations Service Providers (as such term is defined in Policy 4.4) may not receive\nany Security Based Compensation, other than Options;\n• upon expiry of an Option, or in the event an Option is otherwise terminated for any reason,\nthe number of shares in respect of the expired or terminated Option shall again be available\nfor the purposes of the Compensation Plan. All Options granted under the Compensation\nPlan may not have an expiry date exceeding ten (10) years from the date on which the\nBoard grants and announces the granting of the Option;\n• if a provision is included that the Participant’s (as such term is defined in the Compensation\nPlan) heirs or administrators are entitled to any portion of the outstanding Security Based\nCompensation, the period in which they can make such claim must not exceed one year\nfrom the Participant’s death; and\n• any Security Based Compensation granted or issued to any Participant who is a Director,\nofficer, employee, consultant or management company employee must expire within a\nreasonable period, not exceeding 12 months, following the date the Participant ceases to\nbe an eligible Participant under the Security Based Compensation Plan.\nCompensation Governance\nDisclosure relating to the compensation governance practices of the Company as required under Form 51-\n102F6 is set out in Schedule “A”.\nThe Company has not, at any time since the Company’s most recently completed financial year, retained\na compensation consultant or advisor to assist the Board in determining compensation for any of the\nCompany’s Directors or executive officers.\nSummary Compensation Table\nThe following table sets out all compensation paid, payable, awarded, granted, given, or otherwise\nprovided, directly or indirectly, by the Company to each NEO, in any capacity, and each Director, in any\ncapacity, during the three most recently completed financial years ended February 29, 2024, and February\n28, 2023 and 2022:\nNon-equity Incentive\nPlan Compensation\nSalary or\nName and Share- Option- Long- Pension All other Total\nPrincipal Position Year (1) eaf re ne es d (2) based based InA cn en nu tia vl e Term value compensation compensation\nAwards(3) Awards(4) Incentive ($) ($) ($)\n($) Plans(5)\nPlans\n($)\n($)\nAndrew 2024 231,000 1,108,556 107,386 Nil Nil Nil Nil 1,446,942\nBowering(6)\n2023 213,500 584,252 160,782 25,000 Nil Nil Nil 983,534\nChairman and\nDirector 2022 375,000 17,803 982,045 25,000 Nil Nil Nil 1,399,848(13)\n2024 168,000 747,085 161,080 Nil Nil Nil Nil 1,076,165\nAlex Tsakumis\nInterim CEO and 2023 118,000 306,159 153,355 15,000 Nil Nil Nil 592,514\nDirector(7)\n2022 66,000 8,901 469,839 10,000 Nil Nil Nil 554,740\n2024 330,000 1,335,835 161,080 Nil Nil Nil Nil 1,826,915\nSimon Clarke\nFormer CEO and 2023 305,000 600,777 197,264 30,000 Nil Nil Nil 1,133,041\nDirector(7)\n2022 452,500 17,803 918,493 30,000 Nil Nil Nil 1,418,796(14)\n2024 330,000 1,335,835 161,080 Nil Nil Nil Nil 1,826,915\nLaurence Stefan\nPresident, COO 2023 305,000 600,777 197,264 30,000 Nil Nil Nil 1,133,041\nand Director\n2022 623,587 17,803 977,208 30,000 Nil Nil Nil 1,648,598(15)\nPhilip Gibbs\n2024 231,000 1,021,273 107,386 Nil Nil Nil Nil 1,359,659\nFormer CFO(8) 2023 213,500 494,002 304,250 25,000 Nil Nil Nil 1,036,752\n9\nNon-equity Incentive\nPlan Compensation\nSalary or\nPrinN cia pm ale P a on sd i tion Year (1) eaf re ne es d (2) S bh aa sere d- O bp at sio edn - InA cn en nu tia vl e L To en rmg- Pe vn als uio e n comA pll eo nt sh ae tr i on compT eo nta sl a tion\nAwards(3) Awards(4) Incentive ($) ($) ($)\n($) Plans(5)\nPlans\n($)\n($)\n2022 298,796 14,836 750,586 25,000 Nil Nil Nil 1,089,218(16)\nTerrence\n2024 252,000 1,108,556 107,386 Nil Nil Nil Nil 1,467,942\nO’Connor(9)\nExecutive Vice- 2023 232,000 584,252 304,250 25,000 Nil Nil Nil 1,145,502\nPresident of\nExploration and\n2022 274,794 17,803 833,264 25,000 Nil Nil Nil 1,150,861(17)\nDevelopment\n2024 54,996 667,917 53,693 Nil Nil Nil Nil 776,606\nG.A.

(“Plateau”) which is subject to a cease\ntrade order issued by the Ontario Securities Commission (“OSC”) on June 1, 2022 as a result of failure to\nfile audited annual financial statements for the year-ended September 30, 2021, along with interim financial\nstatements for the periods ended March 31, 2021, June 30, 2021, December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022.\nPlateau is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Mr. Bowering joined the board of directors of Plateau\non May 11, 2021, at the request of the Company, following its acquisition of Plateau.\nFollowing the acquisition, Plateau applied to the OSC for an order to cease reporting on the basis that the\nCompany was now the sole shareholder. The OSC was ultimately unable to consent to the application at\nthe time due to the existence of share purchase warrants which were still outstanding in Plateau and as a\nresult issued a cease trade order. The financial results of Plateau are now made publicly available by the\nCompany on a consolidated basis.\nPlateau completed a settlement with the OSC on November 2, 2022, a copy of which is available here\n(https://www.capitalmarketstribunal.ca/sites/default/files/2022-11/rad_20221102_plateau_energy_0.pdf).\nThe settlement addressed allegations made by the OSC with respect to disclosure made by Plateau in\n2019. Mr. Bowering was a Director of Plateau at the time of the settlement, but had no involvement with\nPlateau at the time the relevant disclosure arose or the allegations were made.\nOn March 3, 2024, Mr. Tsakumis was a Director of Magna Gold Corp (“Magna”) when it filed a Notice of\nIntention to make a Proposal under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (Canada) which provides creditor\nprotection while corporations seek to restructure their affairs. As a result of the foregoing, the Exchange\ntransferred trading of Magna’s common shares to the NEX Board of the Exchange (the “NEX Board”)\neffective at the opening of market on March 8, 2023. On March 27, 2023, Magna was granted an order (the\n“Order”) pursuant to the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (the “CCAA”) by the Ontario Superior\nCourt of Justice (Commercial List) (the “Court”) on application by Magna seeking court protection from its\ncreditors to allow it to restructure its business and property as a going concern. The Order, among other\nthings, provided a stay of proceedings (the “Stay of Proceedings”) barring all creditors from taking action\nto recover debts owed by Magna during the stay period. As a result of the foregoing, the Exchange\nsuspended trading of Magna’s common shares on the NEX Board. The Stay of Proceedings was granted\nuntil April 6, 2023 and extended by the Court until November 15, 2023. Magna was unable to finalize a plan\nof compromise or arrangement with its creditors by November 15, 2023. Accordingly, on November 21,\n2023 pursuant to a further order of the Court, the CCAA protections and proceedings, as they applied to\nMagna, were terminated. Mr. Tsakumis resigned as a Director and officer of Magna on April 4, 2024.\n19\nCompensation Plan\nAt this year’s meeting, the Shareholders will be asked to approve the Compensation Plan for Directors,\nofficers, employees, management company employees and consultants.\nThe Compensation Plan is a ten (10%) percent rolling plan, and the text of the Compensation Plan is\nattached to this Circular as Schedule “B”. The Exchange requires listed companies that have “rolling”\nincentive plans in place to obtain shareholder approval of such plans on an annual basis at the listed\ncompany’s annual meeting. Accordingly, Shareholders will be asked to pass an ordinary resolution\napproving the Company’s Compensation Plan to accommodate the Exchange’s policies governing security-\nbased compensation plans.\nThere are presently 10,647,016 Options, 2,530,000 RSUs and 2,000,000 PSUs outstanding under the\nCompensation Plan, of which 4,190,600 Options,985,000 RSUs and 1,020,000 PSUs are held by NEOs or\nDirectors of the Company.\nThe Compensation Plan remains subject to the approval of the Exchange.\nThe Compensation Plan Resolution\nAt the Meeting, Shareholders will be asked to pass the following Ordinary Resolution to re-approve the\nCompensation Plan (the “Compensation Plan Resolution”), substantially in the following form:\n“BE IT RESOLVED THAT as an ordinary resolution of the Company that:\n1. the Compensation Plan, in substantially the form as attached as Schedule “B” to the management\ninformation circular of the Company dated October 23, 2024, be and is hereby ratified, confirmed\nand approved with such additional provisions and amendments, provided that such are not\ninconsistent with the Policies of the Exchange, as the Directors of the Company may deem\nnecessary or advisable;\n2. in connection therewith, a maximum of 10% of the issued and outstanding common shares of the\nCompany at the time of each grant of awards be and are hereby approved for granting upon the\nexercise of such awards; and\n3. the Directors of the Company be authorized to perform all such other acts and things as may be\nnecessary or desirable to effect the adoption of the Compensation Plan; and that the Directors of\nthe Company be authorized to implement or abandon these resolutions in whole or in part, at any\ntime and from time to time in their sole discretion, all without further approval, ratification or\nconfirmation by shareholders.”\nManagement recommends that Shareholders approve the Compensation Plan Resolution.

The Board ensures\nopen and candid discussion among its independent Directors by continuously monitoring situations where a conflict\nof interest or perceived conflict of interest with respect to a Director may exist. The Board may determine that it is\nappropriate to hold an in-camera session excluding a Director with a conflict of interest or perceived conflict of\ninterest, or such director may consider that it is appropriate to recuse him or herself from considering and voting\nwith respect to the matter under consideration.\nItem 2: Mandate for the Board of Directors\nThe following is a reproduction of the “Mandate for the Board of Directors” as approved by the Board on June 10,\n2021:\n----------\nThe term “Corporation” herein shall refer to American Lithium Corp. and the term “Board” shall refer to the Board of\nDirectors of the Corporation.\nThe Board is responsible for establishing and maintaining a culture of integrity in the conduct of the affairs of the\nCorporation. The Board seeks to discharge this responsibility by satisfying itself as to the integrity of the Chair &\nChief Executive Officer and Management and by overseeing and monitoring Management to ensure a culture of\nintegrity is maintained.\nAlthough Directors may be nominated by certain persons to bring special expertise or a point of view to Board\ndeliberations, they are not chosen to represent a particular constituency. The best interests of the Corporation must\nbe paramount at all times.\nA-2\nDUTIES OF THE DIRECTORS\nThe Board discharges its responsibilities directly and through its committees; namely, the Audit Committee, the\nCorporate Governance, Nominating and Compensation Committee (“NCG”), and the Health, Safety and\nSustainability Committee (“HSS”). In addition to these regular committees, the Board may appoint ad hoc\ncommittees periodically to address issues of a more short-term nature. The Board's primary roles are overseeing\ncorporate performance and providing quality, depth and continuity of management to meet the Corporation's\nstrategic objectives. In addition to the Board’s primary roles of overseeing the affairs of the Corporation, principal\nduties include, but are not limited to the following categories:\nOversight of Management\n1. The Board has the responsibility for approving the appointment of the Chief Executive Officer and any\nother officers of the Corporation (collectively, the “Officers”), and approving the compensation of the Chief\nExecutive Officer and the employees of the Corporation following a review of the recommendations of the\nCompensation Committee.\n2. The Board has delegated authority to the Chief Executive Officer for the overall management of the\nCorporation, including strategy and operations to ensure the long-term success of the Corporation and to\nmaximize shareholder value.\n3. The Board may from time-to-time delegate authority to the Officers, subject to specified limits. Matters\nwhich are outside the scope of the authority delegated to the Officers and material transactions are\nreviewed by and subject to the prior approval of the Board.\n4. The Board is responsible for monitoring the performance of Management.\nBoard Organization\n5. The Board retains the responsibility for managing its own affairs by giving its approval for its composition,\nthe selection of the Chair of the Board, candidates nominated for election to the Board, Committee and\nCommittee chair appointments, Committee charters and executive compensation.\n6. The Board may delegate to Board Committees matters it is responsible for, including the approval of\ncompensation of the Board and Management, the approval of interim financial results, the conduct of\nperformance evaluations and oversight of internal controls systems, as well as safety matters. However,\nthe Board retains its oversight function and ultimate responsibility for these matters and all other delegated\nresponsibilities.\nComposition\n7. The Board believes that better corporate governance is promoted when a board of directors is made up\nof highly qualified individuals i) from diverse backgrounds who reflect the changing population\ndemographics of the markets in which the Corporation operates, ii) of each gender, and iii) reflective of\nthe talent available with the required expertise. When considering recommendations for nomination to the\nBoard, the Board shall consider:\n(a) diversity criteria including gender, age, ethnicity, and geographic background; and\n(b) candidates who are highly qualified based on their experience, functional expertise, and personal\nskills and qualities.\nNotwithstanding this, the Corporation does not support the adoption of quotas to support its belief in the\nimportance of diversity. In addition to the criteria set out above and elsewhere herein, employees and\ndirectors of the Corporation (“Directors”) will be recruited and promoted based upon their ability and\ncontributions.\n8. The Directors shall consist of persons who possess skills and competencies in areas that are:\nA-3\n(a) necessary to enable the Board and Board committees to properly discharge their duties and\nresponsibilities; and\n(b) relevant to the Corporation’s activities.\n9. At least 50% of the directors shall be individuals who are “independent” directors in accordance with\napplicable securities laws and stock exchange policies. Subject to the size and operations of the\nCorporation, the Board is committed to setting measurable objectives for the long-term goal of improving\ngender representation across all levels of the organisation.\n10. The Board does not believe it should establish term limits for directors as term limits could result in the\nloss of Directors who have been able to develop, over a period of time, significant insight into the\nCorporation and its operations and an institutional memory that benefits the Board as well as the\nCorporation and its stakeholders. The Board, on its initiative and on an exceptional basis, may exercise\ndiscretion to introduce maximum terms or mandatory retirement where it considers that such a limitation\nwould benefit the Corporation and its stakeholders.\n11. Subject to the limitations herein, the Corporate Governance, Nominating and Compensation (“NCG”)\nCommittee of the Board will annually (and more frequently, if appropriate) recommend candidates to the\nBoard for election or appointment as Directors, taking into account the Board’s conclusions with respect\nto the appropriate size and composition of the Board and Board committees, the competencies and skills\nrequired to enable the Board and Board Committees to properly discharge their responsibilities, and the\ncompetencies and skills of the current Board.\n12.

Without limitation, the Board may determine\n11\nin its discretion that such Cashless Exercise Right, if any, grants a Participant the right\nto terminate such Option in whole or in part by notice in writing to the Company and in\nlieu of receiving Shares pursuant to the exercise of the Option, receive, without payment\nof any cash other than pursuant to Section 8.2, that number of Shares, disregarding\nfractions, which when multiplied by the VWAP (within the meaning of the policies of the\nTSX Venture Exchange) on the day immediately prior to the exercise of the Cashless\nExercise Right, have a total value equal to the product of that number of Shares subject\nto the Option multiplied by the difference between the VWAP (within the meaning of the\npolicies of the TSX Venture Exchange) on the day immediately prior to the exercise of\nthe Cashless Exercise Right and the Option Price; or\n(4) In the event the Company determines to accept the Participant’s request pursuant to a\nCashless Exercise Right, the Company shall make an election pursuant to subsection\n110(1.1) of the Tax Act.\nSection 3.7 Option Agreements.\nOptions shall be evidenced by an Option Agreement, in such form not inconsistent with the Plan\nas the Board may from time to time determine. The Option Agreement may contain any such\nterms that the Company considers necessary in order that the Option will comply with any\nprovisions respecting options in the income tax or other laws in force in any country or jurisdiction\nof which the Participant may from time to time be resident or citizen or the rules of any regulatory\nbody having jurisdiction over the Company.\nSection 3.8 Incentive Stock Options.\n(1) ISOs are available only for Participants who are employees of the Company, or a “parent\ncorporation” or “subsidiary corporation” (as such terms are defined in Section 424(e) and\n(f) of the U.S. Tax Code), on the date the Option is granted. In addition, a Participant\nwho holds an ISO must continue as an employee, except that upon termination of\nemployment the Option will continue to be treated as an ISO for up to three months,\nafter which the Option will no longer qualify as an ISO, except as provided in this Section\n3.8(1). A Participant’s employment will be deemed to continue during period of sick\nleave, military leave or other bona fide leave of absence, provided the leave of absence\ndoes not exceed three months, or the Participant’s return to employment is guaranteed\nby statute or contract. If a termination of employment is due to permanent disability, an\nOption may continue its ISO status for up to one year, and if the termination is due to\ndeath, the ISO status may continue for the balance of the Option’s term. Nothing in this\nSection 3.8(1) will be deemed to extend the original expiry date of an Option.\n(2) A Participant who owns, or is deemed to own, pursuant to Section 424(e) of the U.S.\nTax Code, Shares possessing more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting\npower of all classes of stock of the Company may not be granted an Option that is an\nISO unless the Option Price is at least one hundred and ten percent (110%) of the\nMarket Value of the Shares, as of the date of the grant, and the Option is not exercisable\nafter the expiration of five (5) years from the date of grant.\n(3) To the extent the aggregate Market Value (determined as of the date of grant) of Shares\nwith respect to which ISOs are exercisable for the first time by a Participant during any\ncalendar year (under all plans of the Company and any affiliates) exceeds One Hundred\nThousand United States Dollars (US$100,000), the Options or portions thereof that\nexceed such limit (according to the order in which they were granted) shall be treated\n12\nas Options other than ISOs, notwithstanding any contrary provision in the applicable\nOption Agreement.\nARTICLE 4\nRESTRICTED SHARE UNITS\nSection 4.1 Nature of RSUs.\nA “Restricted Share Unit” (or “RSU”) is an Award in the nature of a bonus for services rendered\nthat, upon settlement, entitles the recipient Participant to acquire Shares as determined by the\nBoard or to receive the Cash Equivalent or a combination thereof, as the case may be, pursuant\nand subject to such restrictions and conditions as the Board may determine at the time of grant,\nunless such RSU expires prior to being settled. Vesting conditions may, without limitation, be\nbased on continuing employment (or other service relationship) and/or achievement of\nPerformance Criteria. Unless otherwise determined by the Board in its discretion, the Award of\nan RSU is considered a bonus for services rendered in the calendar year in which the Award is\nmade.\nSection 4.2 RSU Awards.\n(1) The Board shall, from time to time by resolution, in its sole discretion, (i) designate the\nParticipants who may receive RSUs under the Plan, (ii) fix the number of RSUs, if any,\nto be granted to each Participant and the date or dates on which such RSUs shall be\ngranted, (iii) determine the relevant conditions and vesting provisions (including the\napplicable Performance Period and Performance Criteria, if any) and the Restriction\nPeriod of such RSUs, (provided, however, that no such Restriction Period shall exceed\nthe 3 years referenced in Section 4.3) and (iv) any other terms and conditions applicable\nto the granted RSUs, which need not be identical and which, without limitation, may\ninclude non-competition provisions, subject to the terms and conditions prescribed in\nthis Plan and in any RSU Agreement.\n(2) Subject to the vesting and other conditions and provisions in this Plan and in the RSU\nAgreement, each vested RSU awarded to a Participant shall entitle the Participant to\nreceive one Share, the Cash Equivalent or a combination thereof upon confirmation by\nthe Board that the vesting conditions (including the Performance Criteria, if any) have\nbeen met and no later than the last day of the Restriction Period. For greater certainty,\nRSUs that are subject to Performance Criteria may not become fully vested by the last\nday of the Restricted Period.\nSection 4.3 Restriction Period.\nThe applicable restriction period in respect of a particular RSU shall be determined by the Board\nbut in all cases shall end no later than the 31st of December of the calendar year which\ncommences three years after the calendar year in which the performance of services for which\nsuch RSU is granted, occurred (“Restriction Period”). All unvested RSUs shall be cancelled on\nthe RSU Vesting Determination Date (as such term is defined in Section 4.4) and, in any event:\n(i) all unvested RSUs shall be cancelled no later than the last day of the Restriction Period.\nSection 4.4 RSU Vesting Determination Date.\nThe vesting determination date means the date on which the Board determines if the Performance\nCriteria and/or other vesting conditions with respect to an RSU have been met (the “RSU Vesting\nDetermination Date”), and as a result, establishes the number of RSUs that become vested, if\nany. For greater certainty, the RSU Vesting Determination Date must fall after the end of the\n13\nPerformance Period, if any, but no later than; (i) the 15th of December of the calendar year which\ncommences three years after the calendar year in which the performance of services for which\nsuch RSU is granted, occurred.

Settlement of RSUs shall be subject to Section 8.2 and\nshall take place through:\n(a) in the case of settlement of RSUs for their Cash Equivalent, delivery of a cheque\nto the Participant representing the Cash Equivalent;\n(b) in the case of settlement of RSUs for Shares (which may include Shares\npurchased in the secondary market by a trustee or administrative agent appointed\nby the Board):\n(i) delivery to the Participant (or to the liquidator, executor or administrator, as\nthe case may be, of the estate of the Participant) of a certificate in the name\nof the Participant representing in the aggregate such number of Shares as\nthe Participant (or to the liquidator, executor or administrator, as the case\nmay be, of the estate of the Participant) shall be entitled to receive (unless\nthe Participant intends to simultaneously dispose of any such Shares); or\n(ii) in the case of Shares issued in uncertificated form, issuance of the\naggregate number of Shares as the Participant (or the liquidator, executor\nor administrator, as the case may be, of the estate of the Participant) shall\nbe entitled to receive to be evidenced by a book position on the register of\nthe shareholders of the Company to be maintained by the transfer agent\nand registrar of the Shares; or\n(c) in the case of settlement of the RSUs for a combination of Shares and the Cash\nEquivalent, a combination of (a) and (b) above.\n(3) Notwithstanding the foregoing, for any U.S. Participant, the RSU Settlement Date and\ndelivery of Shares or Cash Equivalent, if any, shall each occur no later than March 15\nof the calendar year following the end of the Performance Period.\nSection 4.6 Determination of Amounts.\n(1) For purposes of determining the Cash Equivalent of RSUs to be made pursuant to\nSection 4.5, such calculation will be made on the RSU Settlement Date based on the\nMarket Value on the RSU Settlement Date multiplied by the number of vested RSUs in\nthe Participant’s Account to settle in cash.\n14\n(2) For the purposes of determining the number of Shares to be issued or delivered to a\nParticipant upon settlement of RSUs pursuant to Section 4.5, such calculation will be\nmade on the RSU Settlement Date based on the whole number of Shares equal to the\nwhole number of vested RSUs then recorded in the Participant’s Account to settle in\nShares.\nSection 4.7 RSU Agreements.\nRSUs shall be evidenced by an RSU Agreement in such form not inconsistent with the Plan as\nthe Board may from time to time determine. The RSU Agreement may contain any such terms\nthat the Company considers necessary in order that the RSU will comply with any provisions\nrespecting restricted share units in the income tax or other laws in force in any country or\njurisdiction of which the Participant may from time to time be resident or citizen or the rules of any\nregulatory body having jurisdiction over the Company.\nSection 4.8 Award of Dividend Equivalents.\nDividend Equivalents may, as determined by the Board in its sole discretion, be awarded in\nrespect of unvested RSUs in a Participant’s Account on the same basis as cash dividends\ndeclared and paid on Shares as if the Participant was a shareholder of record of Shares on the\nrelevant record date, provided that any such Dividend Equivalents must be payable in cash to the\nextent the issuance of Shares would exceed the TSXV Share Limits or any other limitations\nprescribed by this Plan.\nIn the event that the Participant’s applicable RSUs do not vest, all Dividend Equivalents, if any,\nassociated with such RSUs will be forfeited by the Participant and returned to the Company’s\naccount.\nARTICLE 5\nDEFERRED SHARE UNITS\nSection 5.1 Nature of DSUs.\nA Deferred Share Unit is an Award attributable to a Participant’s duties as a director or executive\nofficer of the Company or a Subsidiary and that, upon settlement, entitles the recipient Participant\nto receive such number of Shares (which may include Shares purchased in the secondary market\nby a trustee or administrative agent appointed by the Board) as determined by the Board, or to\nreceive the Cash Equivalent or a combination thereof, as the case may be, and is payable after\nTermination of Service of the Participant.\nSection 5.2 DSU Awards.\nThe Board shall, from time to time by resolution, in its sole discretion, (i) designate the Participants\nwho may receive DSU Awards under the Plan, and (ii) fix the number of DSU Awards to be\ngranted to each Participant and the date or dates on which such DSU Awards shall be granted,\nsubject to the terms and conditions prescribed in this Plan and in any DSU Agreement. Each DSU\nawarded shall entitle the Participant to one Share, or the Cash Equivalent, or a combination\nthereof.\nSection 5.3 Payment of Annual Base Compensation.\n(1) Each Participant may elect to receive in DSUs any portion or all of their Annual Base\nCompensation by completing and delivering a written election to the Company on or\nbefore the 15th day of November of the calendar year ending immediately before the\ncalendar year with respect to which the election is made. Such election will be effective\n15\nwith respect to compensation payable for fiscal quarters beginning during the calendar\nyear following the date of such election. Elections hereunder shall be irrevocable with\nrespect to compensation earned during the period to which such election relates.\n(2) Further, where an individual becomes a Participant for the first time during a fiscal year\nand, for individuals that are U.S. Participants, such individual has not previously\nparticipated in a plan that is required to be aggregated with this Plan for purposes of\nSection 409A of the U.S. Tax Code, such individual may elect to defer Annual Base\nCompensation with respect to fiscal quarters of the Company commencing after the\nCompany receives such individual’s written election, which election must be received by\nthe Company no later than thirty days after the later of the Plan’s adoption or such\nindividual’s appointment as a Participant. For greater certainty, new Participants will not\nbe entitled to receive DSUs for any Annual Base Compensation earned pursuant to an\nelection for the quarter in which they submit their first election to the Company or any\nprevious quarter.\n(3) All DSUs granted with respect to Annual Base Compensation will be credited to the\nParticipant’s Account when such Annual Base Compensation is payable (the “Grant\nDate”).\n(4) The Participant's Account will be credited with the number of DSUs calculated to the\nnearest thousandths of a DSU, determined by dividing the dollar amount of\ncompensation payable in DSUs on the Grant Date by the Market Value of the Shares.\nFractional Deferred Share Units will not be issued and any fractional entitlements will be\nrounded down to the nearest whole number.\nSection 5.4 Additional Deferred Share Units.\nIn addition to DSUs granted pursuant to Section 5.3, the Board may award such number of DSUs\nto a Participant as the Board deems advisable to provide the Participant with appropriate equity-\nbased compensation for the services they render to the Company. The Board shall determine the\ndate on which such DSUs may be granted and the date as of which such DSUs shall be credited\nto a Participant’s Account. An award of DSUs pursuant to this Section 5.4 shall be subject to a\nDSU Agreement evidencing the Award and the terms applicable thereto.\nSection 5.5 Settlement of DSUs.\n(1) A Participant may receive their Shares, or Cash Equivalent, or a combination thereof, to\nwhich such Participant is entitled upon Termination of Service, by filing a redemption\nnotice on or before the 15th day of December of the first calendar year commencing after\nthe date of the Participant’s Termination of Service, and provided that all such entitles\nwill be settled no later then twelve months following the Participant’s Termination of\nService. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Participant does not file such notice on or\nbefore that 15th day of December, the Participant will be deemed to have filed the\nredemption notice on 15th day of December (the date of the filing or deemed filing of the\nredemption notice, the “Filing Date”). In all cases for each U.S. Participant, the U.S.\nParticipant will be deemed to have filed the redemption notice on the date of their\nTermination of Service.\n(2) The Company will make payment of the DSU Settlement Amount as soon as reasonably\npossible following the Filing Date and in any event no later than the end of the first\ncalendar year commencing after the Participant’s Termination of Service. In all cases for\neach U.S. Participant, the Company will make payment of the DSU Settlement Amount\n16\nas soon as reasonably possible following the Filing Date and in any event no later than\nthe 1st day of March of the calendar year following Termination of Service.\n(3) In the event of the death of a Participant, the Company will, subject to Section 8.2, make\npayment of the DSU Settlement Amount within two months of the Participant’s death to\nor for the benefit of the legal representative of the deceased Participant.

The Company and the administrative agent will\nmaintain records showing the number of Awards granted to each Participant under the Plan.\nSection 8.2 Tax Withholding.\n(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, all distributions, delivery of Shares or\npayments to a Participant (or to the liquidator, executor or administrator, as the case\nmay be, of the estate of the Participant) under the Plan shall be made net of such\nwithholdings, including in respect of applicable taxes and source deductions, as the\nCompany determines, subject to Policy 4.4 of the TSX Venture Exchange. If the event\ngiving rise to the withholding obligation involves an issuance or delivery of Shares, then,\nthe withholding may be satisfied in such manner as the Company determines, including\nby (a) having the Participant elect to have the appropriate number of such Shares sold\nby the Company, the Company’s transfer agent and registrar or any trustee appointed\nby the Company pursuant to Section 8.1 hereof, on behalf of and as agent for the\nParticipant as soon as permissible and practicable, with the proceeds of such sale being\ndelivered to the Company, which will in turn remit such amounts to the appropriate\n23\ngovernmental authorities, or (b) any other mechanism as may be required or determined\nby the Company as appropriate.\n(2) Notwithstanding Section 8.2(1), the applicable tax withholdings may be waived where a\nParticipant directs in writing that a payment be made directly to the Participant’s\nregistered retirement savings plan in circumstances to which subsection 100(3) of the\nregulations made under the Tax Act apply.\nSection 8.3 US Tax Compliance.\n(1) DSU Awards granted to U.S. Participants are intended to comply with, and Option and\nRSU Awards granted to U.S. Participants are intended to be exempt from, all aspects of\nSection 409A of the U.S. Tax Code and related regulations (“Section 409A”).\nNotwithstanding any provision to the contrary, all taxes associated with participation in\nthe Plan, including any liability imposed by Section 409A, shall be borne by the U.S.\nParticipant.\n(2) For purposes of interpreting and applying the provisions of any DSU or other Award to\nsubject to Section 409A, the term “termination of employment” or similar phrase will be\ninterpreted to mean a “separation from service,” as defined under Section 409A,\nprovided, however, that with respect to an Award subject to the Tax Act, if the Tax Act\nrequires a complete termination of the employment relationship to receive the intended\ntax treatment, then “termination of employment” will be interpreted to only include a\ncomplete termination of the employment relationship.\n(3) If payment under any DSU or other Award subject to Section 409A is in connection with\nthe U.S. Participant’s separation from service, and at the time of the separation from\nservice the Participant is subject to the U.S. Tax Code and is considered a “specified\nemployee” (within the meaning of Section 409A), then any payment that would otherwise\nbe payable during the six-month period following the separation from service will be\ndelayed until after the expiration of the six-month period, to the extent necessary to avoid\ntaxes and penalties under Section 409A, provided that any amounts that would have\nbeen paid during the six-month period may be paid in a single lump sum on the first day\nof the seventh month following the separation from service.\nSection 8.4 Clawback.\nNotwithstanding any other provisions in this Plan, any Award which is subject to recovery under\nany law, government regulation or stock exchange listing requirement, will be subject to such\ndeductions and clawback as may be required to be made pursuant to such law, government\nregulation or stock exchange listing requirement (or any policy adopted by the Company pursuant\nto any such law, government regulation or stock exchange listing requirement).

In addition, the Board may require forfeiture and\ndisgorgement to the Company of outstanding Awards and the proceeds from the exercise or\ndisposition of Awards or Shares acquired under Awards, with interest and other related earnings,\nto the extent required by law or applicable stock exchange listing standards, including and any\n24\nrelated policy adopted by the Company.

Neither the Board nor the Company nor any other\nperson, other than the Participant and his or her permitted transferees, if any, will be responsible\nfor any adverse tax or other consequences to a Participant or his or her permitted transferees, if\nany, that may arise in connection with this Section 8.4.\nSection 8.5 Securities Law Compliance.\n(1) The Plan (including any amendments to it), the terms of the grant of any Award under\nthe Plan, the grant of any Award and exercise of any Option, and the Company’s\nobligation to sell and deliver Shares in respect of any Awards, shall be subject to all\napplicable federal, provincial, state and foreign laws, rules and regulations, the rules and\nregulations of applicable Stock Exchanges and to such approvals by any regulatory or\ngovernmental agency as may, as determined by the Company, be required.

NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND GOING CONCERN\nAmerican Lithium Corp. (the “Company”) was incorporated in the Province of British Columbia. The\nCompany is engaged in the business of identification, acquisition, and exploration of mineral interests\nin the United States of America and Peru. The Company’s head office is located at 710 – 1030 West\nGeorgia Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, V6E 2Y3, Canada, and its registered and records office is\nlocated at Suite 2200, 885 West Georgia Street, Vancouver, BC, V6C 3E8, Canada. The Company’s\ncommon shares are listed for trading on Tier 2 of the TSX Venture Exchange (the “Exchange”) under\nthe symbol “LI”, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the symbol “5LA”, and on the NASDAQ exchange\nunder the symbol “AMLI”.\nThe Company is in the process of exploring its principal mineral properties and has not yet determined\nwhether the properties contain ore reserves that are economically recoverable. The recoverability of\namounts shown as exploration and evaluation assets is dependent upon the discovery of economically\nrecoverable reserves, the confirmation of the Company's interest in the underlying mineral claims, the\nability of the Company to obtain necessary financing to complete the development and upon future\nprofitable production or proceeds from the disposition thereof.\nThese condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of\naccounting principles applicable to a going concern which assumes that the Company will be able to\nrealize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. As at November 30, 2023,\nthe Company had a working capital position of $21,365,132 (February 28, 2023 - $41,394,150), and for\nthe nine months ended November 30, 2023, incurred a net loss of $32,890,980 (November 30, 2022 –\n$25,475,302). In addition, as at November 30, 2023, the Company had an accumulated deficit of\n$152,158,227 (February 28, 2023 – $119,267,247), which has been funded primarily by the issuance of\nequity. The Company's ability to continue as a going concern and to realize assets at their carrying\nvalues is dependent upon obtaining additional financing. Though the Company has raised financing in\nthe past, there is no guarantee that it will be able to in the future. As at November 30, 2023, management\nbelieves that the Company has sufficient working capital to meet the Company’s obligations over the\nensuing twelve-month period from the date of the statement of financial position.\n2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nStatement of compliance\nThese condensed interim consolidated financial statements, including comparatives, have been\nprepared in accordance with International Accounting Standards (“IAS”) 34, “Interim Financial Reporting”\nusing accounting policies consistent with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued\nby the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and Interpretations issued by the International\nFinancial Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”).\nCertain accounts have been reclassified to be consistent with the current period classification.\nThese condensed interim consolidated financial statements were approved and authorized for issue by\nthe Board of Directors on January 11, 2024.\n8\nAmerican Lithium Corp.\nNotes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the three and nine months ended November 30, 2023 and 2022\n(Expressed in Canadian Dollars – unaudited)\n2.

In addition, the condensed\ninterim consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the accrual basis of accounting\nexcept for cash flow disclosure.\nThe condensed interim consolidated financial statements are presented in Canadian dollars unless\notherwise noted. The Canadian dollar is also the functional currency of the Company and its\nsubsidiaries, except for Macusani Yellowcake and Macusani Uranium where the functional currency is\nthe United States dollar.\nPrinciples of consolidation\nThe condensed interim consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and the\nfollowing subsidiaries:\n9\nN\nA\nB\nT\nM\nP\nM\nM\na m e\nm e ric a n L ith iu m H o ld in g s C o rp .\nig S m o k y H o ld in g s , In c .\no n o p a h L ith iu m C o rp .\na ra n V e n tu re s L td .

MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\nThese condensed interim consolidated financial statements do not include all the information required\nof the audited annual consolidated financial statements and is intended to provide users with an update\nin relation to events and transactions that are significant to an understanding of the changes in the\nfinancial position and performance of the Company since the end of the last annual reporting period.\nThe accounting policies followed in these condensed consolidated interim financial statements are the\nsame as those applied in the Company’s most recent audited consolidated annual financial statements\nfor the year ended February 28, 2023, except for the adoption of Disclosure of Accounting Policies\n(Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2) and the change in accounting policy for expired\nshare-based payment arrangements mentioned below. Therefore, it is recommended that these\ncondensed interim consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the audited annual\nconsolidated financial statements of the Company for the years ended February 28, 2023 and 2022.\nAmerican Lithium Corp.\nNotes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the three and nine months ended November 30, 2023 and 2022\n(Expressed in Canadian Dollars – unaudited)\n3. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES (continued)\nInvestment in associate\nThe Company accounts for its investment, over which it has significant influence, as an investment in\nassociate using the equity method, whereby the investment is initially recorded at cost, and\nsubsequently adjusted to recognize the Company’s share of earnings or losses from the associated\ncompany. The condensed interim consolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss reflect the\nshare of the net loss of the associated company from the acquisition date forward. Changes in the\nCompany’s interest in its associated company resulting in dilution gains or losses, are recognized in the\ncondensed interim consolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss.\nThe Company determines whether any objective evidence of impairment exists at each reporting date.\nIf impaired, the carrying value of the investment is written down to its recoverable amount.\nAccounting standards adopted during the period\nThe Company adopted the following new IFRS standard effective January 1, 2023. The nature and\nimpact of the standard on the Company’s consolidated annual audited financial statements is indicated\nbelow.\nIn February 2021, the IASB issued Disclosure of Accounting Policies (amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS\nPractice Statement 2 Making Materiality Judgements). IAS 1 is amended to require that an entity\ndiscloses its material accounting policies, instead of its significant accounting policies. Further\namendments explain how an entity can identify a material accounting policy and clarify that information\nmay be material because of its nature, even if the related amounts are immaterial. These amendments\nto IAS 1 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, and have not\nhad a material impact on the Company’s condensed interim consolidated financial statements nor are\nthey expected to for the Company’s annual financial statements.\nChange in accounting policy for expiry of share-based payment arrangements\nThe Company previously had an accounting policy to reclassify to deficit any balance in reserves upon\nthe expiry of share-based awards under a view that IFRS 2 does not preclude an entity from recognizing\na transfer within equity (from one component to another) in the event of an expiration; however, IFRS 2\ndoes not mandatorily require the Company to perform such reclassifications. The Company has\ndetermined not to reclassify reserves to deficit upon expiry for all share-based awards as management\nbelieves that the expiry of a fully vested equity instrument does not result in a gain to the entity and is\nmore accurately reflected outside of deficit. Additionally, upon examining other accounting frameworks,\nspecifically United States generally accepted accounting principles, a movement within equity for\nexpired share-based awards is not permitted and further supports the Company’s decision to no longer\nreclassify reserves to deficit.\nAs a result, in the current period, the Company has changed its existing policy for the expiry of share-\nbased payments and will no longer reclassify such reserves to deficit upon expiry. The consolidated\nequity is not modified by this change in presentation. As per IAS 8, financial information from previous\nyears presented for comparative purposes has been restated so that the information is comparable. As\na result of the restatement, the deficit no longer includes the effects arising from the expiry of share-\nbased payment awards which have been reclassified to reserves amounting to $1,157,471 during the\nyear ending February 28, 2023 and $2,318,600 cumulatively to February 28, 2022.\n10\nAmerican Lithium Corp.\nNotes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the three and nine months ended November 30, 2023 and 2022\n(Expressed in Canadian Dollars – unaudited)\n3. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES (continued)\nJudgements and estimates\nThe preparation of condensed interim consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires\nmanagement to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting\npolicies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities as at the date of the\ncondensed interim consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and\nexpenses during the reporting period. Estimates and assumptions are continuously evaluated and are\nbased on management’s experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are\nbelieved to be reasonable under the circumstances. However, actual outcomes can differ from these\nestimates. The results of estimates form the basis for making the judgments about carrying values of\nassets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting\nestimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that\nperiod or in the period of the revision and further periods if the review affects both current and future\nperiods.\nThe key areas of judgement and estimation impacting these condensed interim consolidated financial\nstatements are as follows:\nCarrying value of exploration and evaluation assets\n• The Company’s exploration and evaluation assets represent its most significant asset on the\nstatement of financial position. The Company’s management applies its judgement, using facts\nand circumstances available at the time, to determine whether the exploration and evaluation\nasset value may be realized. For each of its projects, the Company reviews its right to the\nclaims/concessions, future plans and exploration or development progress to determine if it\nshould test the respective projects for impairment. There is significant judgement involved in\ndetermining if a project shows impairment indicators that may impact the carrying value of\nexploration and evaluation assets.\nValuation of share-based compensation awards\n• Stock options are valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with inputs that can\nsignificantly impact the calculated value. Typical inputs into the Black-Scholes option pricing\nmodel include: exercise price, historical volatility, time to expiration and risk-free discount rates.\nHistorical volatility and risk-free discount rates in particular require judgement around the\nreference period or benchmark rate used as inputs into the Black-Scholes option pricing model.\nValuation of common shares and common share purchase warrants received from investment in Surge\nBattery Metals Inc. (note 7)\n• The Company’s investment in Surge Battery Metals Inc. (note 7) required the use of the Black-\nScholes option pricing model to determine the initial value of the Surge common shares and\ncommon share purchase warrants. Typical inputs into the Black-Scholes option pricing model\ninclude: exercise price, historical volatility, time to expiration and risk-free discount rates.\nHistorical volatility and risk-free discount rates in particular require judgement around the\nreference period or benchmark rate used as inputs into the Black-Scholes option pricing model.\n11\nAmerican Lithium Corp.\nNotes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the three and nine months ended November 30, 2023 and 2022\n(Expressed in Canadian Dollars – unaudited)\n3. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES (continued)\nAccounting pronouncements not yet adopted\nThe Company has performed an assessment of new standards issued by the IASB that are not yet\neffective and has determined that any standards that have been issued would have no or very minimal\nimpact on the Company’s condensed interim consolidated financial statements.\n4.

INVESTMENT IN SURGE BATTERY METALS INC.\nOn June 9, 2023, the Company completed a strategic investment in Surge, a company incorporated in\nCanada, whose principal business activity is the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral\nproperties in Nevada. The Company, through a combination of its shareholding and its board\nrepresentation, has significant influence over Surge, and therefore accounts for the investment using\nthe equity method.\nSurge closed the first tranche of a non-brokered private placement financing by issuing 13,400,000 units\n(“Units”) at a price of $0.40 per Unit to the Company for a total transaction value of $5,360,000. Each\nUnit consists of one common share and one Warrant exercisable at $0.55 per Warrant for a period of\nthree years from the date of issuance, and were subject to a 4-month hold.\nThe allocation of the transaction value to the Surge common shares and Warrants at June 9, 2023 was\ndetermined based on the relative fair values of each asset, $3,062,857 and $2,297,143, respectively,\nboth calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and reflecting the 4-month hold period.\nSurge’s common shares and warrants were valued at June 9, 2023, using the following Black-Scholes\nassumptions:\nCommon Shares Warrants\n4-month hold\nExpected volatility 102% 132%\nRisk-free interest rate 4.08% 4.08%\nSpot Price(1) 0 .62 0 .48\nExercise Price 0 .62 0.55\nTime to expiration 4 months 3 years\nDividend yield Nil Nil\n(1) The spot price for the Warrants was based on the market price of Surge's common shares, less a\ndiscount to reflect the 4-month hold period.\nThe Company determined that the fair value of Surge’s Warrants acquired was $4,824,000 at June 9,\n2023. Since the fair value of this financial instrument exceeded the Unit offering’s allocated transaction\nvalue of $2,297,143, and the fair value is not based solely on observable inputs, $2,526,857 was\nrecorded as a deferred gain, which will be recognized over the three-year life of the Warrants. The fair\nvalue of the Warrants will be determined at each reporting date, and gains or losses on the fair value\nchanges will be recognized in the statements of loss and comprehensive loss each period.\nAmerican Lithium Corp.\nNotes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the three and nine months ended November 30, 2023 and 2022\n(Expressed in Canadian Dollars – unaudited)\n7. INVESTMENT IN SURGE BATTERY METALS INC. (continued)\nFor the nine months ended November 30, 2023 the Company recognized $421,143 (November 30, 2022\n– $nil) of the deferred gain. The Company determined that the fair value of the Surge Warrants at\nNovember 30, 2023 was $4,171,420 (February 28, 2023 – $nil) and therefore recognized an unrealized\nloss of $652,580 for the nine months ended November 30, 2023 (November 30, 2022 – $nil).\nDue to the fact that Surge’s financial statements are typically not publicly available at the time the\nCompany files its financial statements, the share of Surge’s results are recognized using a reporting\nperiod which is two months prior to that of the Company.\n$\nBalance, February 28, 2023 -\nAllocated transaction value of Surge's common shares 3 ,062,857\nShare of loss for the one-month period ended June 30, 2023 (1) (60,878)\nShare of loss for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 (1) (457,667)\nDilution loss on investment in Surge(2) (366,179)\nBalance, November 30, 2023 2 ,178,133\n(1) Since the investment in Surge was purchased on June 9, 2023, the share of Surge’s loss is only\ncalculated from the date of acquisition to September 30, 2023.\n(2) The Company’s investment in Surge represented 9.73% of the outstanding share capital of Surge,\ndecreasing to 8.59% by the end of the current period which resulted in a dilution loss of $366,179.\nThe trading price of Surge’s common shares on November 30, 2023 was $0.47.

The TLC Project\nwas subject to an overriding 2.5% gross royalty, however, as at February 28, 2023, the royalty had been\nbought back in full.\nThe Company made the following payments for the TLC Project in during the year ended February 28,\n2023:\n• June 2022 – the Company paid cash of $4,083,681 to acquire certain privately held agricultural\nlands along with certain water rights, in the Big Smoky Valley, close to the Company’s TLC\nProject.\n• January 2023 – the Company issued 950,000 common shares of the Company at a fair value\nof $4,503,000 to buy back the remaining one percent (1%) gross overriding royalty on the\nCompany’s wholly owned TLC Project.\n• January 2023 – the Company issued 200,000 common shares of the Company at a fair value\nof $946,000 to acquire eight lode mining claims located in Nye County, Nevada, contiguous to\nthe TLC Project through the acquisition of Maran Ventures Ltd.\nOption – Nevada, USA\nDuring August 2023, the Company entered into an option and right-of-first refusal to purchase a property\nwith certain water rights for $201,645, expiring in 3 years.\nFalchani Lithium Project (“Falchani Project”), Macusani Uranium Project (“Macusani Project”) –\nPuno, Peru\nFollowing the acquisition in May 2021 of Plateau and its Peruvian subsidiary, Macusani SAC, the\nCompany holds title, or has court injunctions preserving title, on mineral concessions in the Province of\nCarabaya, Department of Puno in southeastern Peru.\nIn June 2022, the Company entered into a mining rights transfer agreement to acquire additional\nconcessions in Southern Peru, close to the Company’s Falchani Project. The Company paid $517,130\nand issued 2,250,000 common shares of the Company with a fair value of $4,635,000 to the vendor.\n32 of the 174 Falchani Project and Macusani Project concessions now held by the Company’s\nsubsidiaries Macusani Yellowcake and Macusani Uranium, have been subject to Administrative and\nJudicial processes (together, the “Processes”) in Peru to overturn resolutions issued by the Geological,\nMining, and Metallurgical Institute of Peru (“INGEMMET”) and the Mining Council of the Ministry of\nEnergy and Mines of Peru (“MINEM”) in February 2019 and July 2019, respectively, which declared\nMacusani Yellowcake’s title to the 32 concessions invalid due to late receipt of the annual validity\npayment. On November 15, 2023 the Superior Court of Peru unanimously upheld the prior ruling of the\nlower court in favour of the Company in relation to those 32 concessions which clearly established that\nMacusani Yellowcake is the rightful owner of these concessions and highlights that the action launched\nby INGEMMET and MINEM was baseless and unsubstantiated. On December 29, 2023 the Company\nannounced that INGEMMET and MINEM have petitioned the Supreme Court in a final attempt to reverse\nthe ruling. If the petition is successful, Macusani Yellowcake’s title to the 32 concessions could be\nrevoked. The Company will continue to take all necessary actions, and pursue all available legal options,\nto defend its interests.\n18\nAmerican Lithium Corp.\nNotes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the three and nine months ended November 30, 2023 and 2022\n(Expressed in Canadian Dollars – unaudited)\n12.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\nThe Company’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Company’s ability to continue\nas a going concern in order to pursue the exploration of its mineral properties and to maintain a flexible\ncapital structure for its projects for the benefit of its stakeholders, to maintain creditworthiness and to\nmaximize returns for shareholders over the long-term. The Company does not have any externally\nimposed capital requirements to which it is subject. As the Company is in the exploration stage, its\nprincipal source of funds is from the issuance of common shares. The Company includes the\ncomponents of shareholders’ equity in its management of capital.\nThe Company manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in\neconomic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. To maintain or adjust the\ncapital structure, the Company may attempt to issue new shares to raise cash and obtain bridging loans\nfrom related parties. The Company’s investment policy is to invest its cash in low-risk investment\ninstruments in financial institutions with terms to maturity selected with regards to the expected time of\nexpenditures from continuing operations.\nThere were no changes in the Company’s management of capital during the nine months ended\nNovember 30, 2023.\n15. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\nThe Company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, GICs, short-term\ninvestments, amounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities and lease liabilities. As at\nNovember 30, 2023, the Company classifies its short-term investment as FVTPL and its remaining\nfinancial instruments at amortized cost. For financial instruments at amortized cost, their carrying values\napproximate their fair values because of their current nature. The carrying value of the Company’s\nlease liabilities is measured at the present value of the discounted future cash flows.\nThe Company classifies financial instruments carried at fair value according to the following hierarchy\nbased on the amount of observable inputs used to value the financial instrument:\nLevel 1 – Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the\nreporting date. Active markets are those in which transactions occur in sufficient frequency and volume\nto provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.\nLevel 2 – Fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices that are\nobservable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices).\nLevel 3 – Valuations in this level are those with inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on\nobservable market data. The Company’s Surge Warrants (short-term investment) is classified under\nLevel 3.\n24\nAmerican Lithium Corp.\nNotes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the three and nine months ended November 30, 2023 and 2022\n(Expressed in Canadian Dollars – unaudited)\n15.

The Company’s financial liabilities are comprised of accounts payable and\naccrued liabilities. The Company manages its liquidity risk by forecasting cash flows from operations\nand anticipating any investing and financing activities.

A\n10% fluctuation in the foreign exchange rate of foreign currencies against the Canadian dollar would\nresult in a foreign exchange gain/loss of approximately $654,647.\nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risk is the risk the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate\nbecause of changes in market interest rates. The Company has cash and cash equivalents balances\nand term deposits with interest based on the prime rate. The Company’s current policy is to invest\nexcess cash in investment-grade short-term deposit certificates issued by its banking institution.

The Company has been actively\ninvolved in lithium exploration since April 2016 when the initial focus was on lithium projects in Nevada\nthrough which process the Company explored, discovered, and is now developing the TLC Lithium Project\n(“TLC Project” or “TLC”) in Nevada. Drilling in 2019 and 2020 lead to the publication of a maiden mineral\nresource in April 2020 with a subsequent resource update and publication of a maiden Preliminary Economic\nAssessment (“PEA”) in 2023. Through the acquisition of Plateau Energy Metals Inc. (“Plateau”) in May 2021,\nthe Company added additional significant lithium properties and uranium properties in Peru.\nAs such, the Company is pursuing development of two lithium projects, the TLC Project and the Falchani\nLithium Project in Peru (“Falchani Project” or “Falchani”), and has initiated work on Prefeasibility Studies\n(“PFS”) on both projects. In addition, the Company has the Macusani Uranium Project (“Macusani Project”\nor “Macusani”) in Peru and is engaged in work to update the existing PEA (which was published in February\nof 2016) and then move to PFS. The Company recognizes that each of these projects has the potential for\ncontinued development and future commercialization.\nCautionary Note Regarding Peru Project Concessions\n32 of the 174 Falchani Project and Macusani Project concessions now held by American Lithium’s subsidiary\nMacusani, have been subject to Administrative and Judicial processes (together, the “Processes”) in Peru to\noverturn resolutions issued by the Geological, Mining, and Metallurgical Institute of Peru (“INGEMMET”) and\nthe Mining Council of the Ministry of Energy and Mines of Peru (“MINEM”) in February 2019 and July 2019,\nrespectively, which declared Macusani’s title to the 32 concessions invalid due to late receipt of the annual\nvalidity payment. On November 15, 2023 the Superior Court of Peru unanimously upheld the prior ruling of\nthe lower court in favour of the Company in relation to those 32 concessions which clearly established that\nMacusani is the rightful owner of these concessions and highlights that the action launched by INGEMMET\nand MINEM was baseless and unsubstantiated. On December 29, 2023 the Company announced that\nINGEMMET and MINEM have petitioned the Supreme Court in a final attempt to reverse the ruling. If the\npetition is successful, Macusani’s title to the 32 concessions could be revoked. The Company will continue\nto take all necessary actions, and pursue all available legal options, to defend its interests.\nRecent Developments\n• On January 10, 2024, the Company announced results from the updated Preliminary Economic\nAssessment (“PEA”) for the Falchani Lithium Project completed by DRA Global. The results highlight\nFalchani as a long-life, low-cost potential lithium production centre with the opportunity to produce\nsulfate of potash (“SOP”) fertilizer and cesium sulfate as valuable by-products. The updated PEA Li-\nonly base case highlights include: After-tax NPV of $5.11 billion at $22,500/t Lithium Carbonate\n8%\n(“LCE”) selling price; After-tax IRR of 32.0%; with Operating Costs (“Opex”) of $5,092/t LCE. Unless\notherwise stated, all dollar figures are in United States dollars.\n• On December 29, 2023, the Company announced that it had received notification that INGEMMET\nand MINEM have filed petitions to the Supreme Court of Peru to assume jurisdiction in the\nproceedings relating to the title of 32 disputed concessions out of a total of 174 owned by the\nCompany's subsidiary, Macusani Yellowcake. The Company believes there are no grounds for the\nSupreme Court to assume jurisdiction and the petitions should be rejected as soon as possible to\nmark the end of the case.\n• On December 15, 2023, the Company Filed Updated Mineral Resource Technical Report on Falchani\nSupporting 476% Increase in Measured & Indicated Lithium Resource all as previously reported on\nOctober 31, 2023.\n4\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\n• On December 8, 2023, the Company announced results from 14 step out drill holes expanding the\nmeasured resource footprint at the TLC Project. A total of 26 diamond core holes and 16 Reverse\nCirculation (“RC”) holes drilled in 2022 and 2023 will be added to the updated mineral resource block\nmodel and incorporated into an updated Mineral Resource Estimate (“MRE”), currently underway. In\naddition, SRK Consulting (U.S.) Inc. of Elko, Nevada has been engaged to coordinate the preparation\nof a mine plan of Operations with the BLM and Nexus Environmental Consultants Inc. of Reno,\nNevada has been engaged to complete biological baseline studies in support of the Mine Plan of\nOperations application.\n• On November 28, 2023, the Company announced that it completed and submitted the Semi-Detailed\nEnvironmental Impact Assessment Study (“EIA-sd”) for the Falchani Lithium Project to the Ministry\nof Energy and Mines (“MINEM”). The EIA-sd provides a framework for approval of all major phases\nrequired to finalize the development of Falchani from mining reserve definition to completion of mine\nconstruction and, when approved, the EIA-sd provides authority to drill multiple holes from up to 420\ndrill platforms across the Falchani Project, with no additional permits required.\n• On November 15, 2023, the Company announced that the three-judge tribunal of Peru’s Superior\nCourt SALA 4, specialized in administration disputes, unanimously upheld the ruling of the lower\ncourt judge from Court SALA 6 announced on November 2, 2021 in favour of the Company’s\nsubsidiary, Macusani Yellowcake (“Macusani”) in relation to title over 32 disputed concessions out of\n172 owned by Macusani. The Court ruling, consistent with prior legal proceedings, clearly establishes\nthat Macusani is the rightful owner of these concessions and highlights that the actions launched by\nINGEMMET and MINEM in October 2018 were baseless and unsubstantiated.\n• On October 31, 2023, the Company announced an updated Mineral Resource Estimate (“MRE”) for\nthe Falchani Project increasing the Measured and Indicated lithium resources 476% over the\nprevious March 2019 MRE for Falchani. The Current MRE for Falchani is: Measured Resource –\n1.01 Mt Lithium Carbonate Equivalent (“LCE”) (69 Mt @ 2,792 ppm Li); Indicated Resource – 4.52\nMt LCE (378 Mt @ 2,251 ppm Li); and Inferred Resource – 3.99 Mt LCE (506 Mt @ 1,481 ppm Li).\nThe accompanying NI 43-101 Technical Report titled: “Technical Report and Mineral Resource\nEstimate - Falchani Property, Carabaya Province, Department of Puno, South-Eastern Peru” dated\nDecember 14, 2023, with an effective date of October 31, 2023, prepared by Stantec Consulting Inc.\nwas filed on December 15, 2023.\n• On September 26, 2023, the Company announced a new lithium discovery at the Quelcaya\nexploration target, located 6 km west of the Falchani Lithium deposit in Peru. The initial exploration\ndiscovery drill hole intersected large-scale lithium mineralization with 222.5 metres averaging 1,560\nppm Li from 119.1 m downhole with a maximum 1 m interval sample of 2,668 ppm Li at 335 m.\n• On September 7, 2023, the Company announced results of ongoing process work on the TLC\nProject, which show an increase in lithium carbonate purity, higher extraction rates at lower leach\ntemperatures, significant potential for lower acid consumption and potential for lower lithium losses\nduring impurity removal. Further optimization work and process improvements are expected to\nenhance project returns.\n• On August 31, 2023, the Company published its maiden Environmental, Social and Governance\nReport (“ESG Report”), prepared using the Onyen Corporation’s software and online platform.\n• On August 24, 2023, the Company announced the results of a further four diamond drill holes from\nthe Falchani EIA drill program including lithium mineralization up to 5,025ppm and cesium grades to\n8,290ppm. This drilling extended the lithium mineralization by 400 metres to the west of the previous\nresource boundary.\n• On July 12. 2023, the Company announced positive results from three diamond drill holes from the\nFalchani EIA drill program, including the highest-grade lithium (5,645ppm Li) and cesium (1.2% Cs)\ncontents from 1 m interval samples drilled on the project, to date.\n• On June 9, 2023, the Company completed a $5,360,000 strategic investment in Surge Battery Metals\nInc. (“Surge”) and received common shares and common share purchase warrants of Surge.\n• On May 8, 2023, the Company announced receipt of the first of three drill permits to commence\nadditional development and discovery drilling at and around Falchani. Exploration drilling has\ncommenced at the Quelcaya target, approximately 6 – 11 km west of Falchani.\n• On March 6, 2023, the Company announced the appointment of DRA Global (“DRA”) as lead\nengineer to fast-track completion of a Pre-Feasibility Study (“PFS”) on the Company’s Falchani\nProject.\n5\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nEnvironmental, Sustainability, Safety and Governance\nThe Company places a large emphasis on Environmental, Sustainability, Safety and Governance (“ESG”)\nmatters, enhancing its protocols through the engagement of Onyen Corporation to assist with implementation\nof ESG best practices and systems to measure and monitor performance in these areas. In August, 2023 the\nCompany published its maiden ESG Report for the 2022 year, which included the following highlights:\n• Environmental Stewardship: Zero instances of non-compliance with environmental\nregulations.\n• Ethics & Integrity: Anti-corruption training has been implemented for the Board of Directors\nand senior management.\n• Human Rights and Diversity Policy: Commitments reference the Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights, the United Nations Guiding Principles, and international humanitarian law.\n• Social Risk Management: Mechanisms in place through which early alerts are launched on\nrisks identified for the continuity of operations, and to address concerns, requests, and claims.\nThe full report may be accessed via the following link, or from the Company’s website:\nhttp://www.americanlithiumcorp.com/esg/\nOne Health and Safety incident, which involved a Company owned vehicle, occurred in late April 2023. The\ntragic single vehicle accident near the Company’s project site in Southern Peru resulted in the death of a\npassenger from the local community and injury to two Company employees. Peruvian authorities were\ninformed and confirmed the incident as a motor vehicle accident. Peru-based management and staff have\nworked closely with all parties involved including the family, local community leaders and relevant authorities,\nand, in consultation with the victim’s family, an educational endowment for youth in the local communities is\nbeing established in remembrance and honour of the person who died in the accident.\nThe Company continues to focus on environmental best practices and to prioritize community relations. The\nCompany conducted the annual community Christmas food and gift package distribution and facilitated the\nsemi-annual Mobile Medical and Dental Clinics in the local Andean communities near our Peruvian Projects\nin late 2022 and throughout 2023. Recently the Company has launched an initiative in conjunction with the\nPeruvian Army to fund and install solar / battery systems into homes in its communities to supply lighting and\ncharging capabilities enabling Wi-Fi and mobile connectivity. The Company also assists the community with\ncontinuous support for local education (teachers’ salaries and supplies) and health care (doctor and health\ncare support workers support).\nIn Nevada, the Company maintains cultural liaison with representatives of three tribal groups who are based\naround Tonopah. A cultural monitoring agreement is in place for pre-disturbance cultural surveys with one\ntribe, and the Company has engaged in early project consultation with two other nearby tribes. The Company\nonce again sponsored the Nevada State Mining Championships held in Tonopah, NV in May 2023, and raised\nawareness of the Company and the TLC project through sponsorship and staffing a booth at the AEMA\nconference in Reno in early December 2023. The Company continues an environmental reclamation and\nremediation study with researchers at the University of Nevada, Reno, on seed coatings to promote faster\nand more efficient floral remediation of disturbed lands in Nevada.\nQualified Person and Technical Reports\nThe scientific and technical information contained in this MD&A relating to the TLC, Falchani and Macusani\nProjects has been reviewed and approved by Ted O’Connor, Executive Vice President of American Lithium,\nwho is a Qualified Persons as defined in National Instrument 43-101.\n6\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nCertain scientific and technical information with respect to the TLC Project contained in this MD&A has been\ntaken from the technical report entitled “Tonopah Lithium Claims Project NI 43-101 Technical Report –\nPreliminary Economic Assessment” with an effective date of January 31, 2023 and prepared by John Joseph\nRiordan, Valentine Eugene Coetzee, of DRA Pacific and Derek J. Loveday, Satjeet Pandher, Joan C. Kester\nand Sean Ennis of Stantec Consulting Inc., a copy of which is available on American Lithium’s SEDAR+\nprofile at www.sedarplus.ca. Certain scientific and technical information with respect to: (a) the Falchani\nProject contained in this MD&A has been taken from technical reports entitled: “Technical Report and Mineral\nResource Estimate - Falchani Property, Carabaya Province, Department of Puno, South-Eastern Peru” dated\nDecember 14, 2023, with an effective date of October 31, 2023, prepared by Derek Loveday, P. Geo. and\nMariea Kartick, P.Geo. of Stantec Consulting Services Inc.; and “Falchani Lithium Project NI 43-101\nTechnical Report – Preliminary Economic Assessment” with an effective date of February 4, 2020 and\nprepared by John Joseph Riordan, David Alan Thompson, Valentine Eugene Coetzee and Stewart Nupen of\nDRA Pacific; and (b) the Macusani Project contained in this MD&A has been taken from the technical report\nentitled “Macusani Project, Macusani, Peru, NI 43-101 Report – Preliminary Economic Assessment” with an\neffective date of January 12, 2016 and prepared by Michael Short and Thomas Apelt of GBM Minerals\nEngineering Consultants Limited, David Young of The Mineral Corporation and Mark Mounde of Wardell\nArmstrong International Limited, copies of both of which are available on Plateau’s SEDAR+ profile at\nwww.sedarplus.ca. The preliminary economic assessments included herein are preliminary in nature and\ninclude inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic\nconsiderations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is\nno certainty that the preliminary economic assessments will be realized. Additional work is required to\nupgrade the mineral resources to mineral reserves. In addition, the mineral resource estimates could be\nmaterially affected by environmental, geotechnical, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-political, marketing\nor other relevant factors.\nProject Highlights\nThe Company is currently advancing three projects: the TLC Project, the Falchani Project, and the Macusani\nProject. Current targets are to continue to advance and complete the prefeasibility studies for both the\nFalchani Project and the TLC Project. These studies were launched during 2023 with completion of the PFS\nfor Falchani targeted for Q2 2024 and later 2024 for TLC.\nWork to update the existing Macusani Uranium Project PEA has commenced and with piloting as well as\ndrilling planned for 2024 to update the existing resource.\nCommunity agreements are in place in Peru for the upcoming work programs. Related cultural and\nenvironmental work is completed, and, where required, final drill permits are expected shortly.\nTo achieve these targets:\nEnvironmental Impact Assessment drilling has been completed with an updated Mineral Resource Estimate\n(“MRE”) completed in October 2023, and filed December 15, 2023. An updated PEA has recently been\ncompleted incorporating the updated MRE, adding potential cesium and potassium by-products, with updated\nproject economics including the latest lithium pricing. The updated PEA technical report will be filed in late\nFebruary 2024. Both reports are key steps in the finalization of the PFS on Falchani, expected Q2, 2024.\nAt Falchani, environmental work required for feasibility and ultimately mine permitting on the Falchani Project\ncommenced in the fall of 2022 with the initiation of an Environmental Impact Assessment (“EIA”) which\nincludes detailed hydrological / hydrogeological studies focusing on the upper 150m to 180m below surface\nto investigate water table parameters. This program also enabled the recovery of core for resource expansion\nand reclassification and will be part of the updated MRE currently being finalized by Stantec Consulting Inc.\n(“Stantec”). The EIA drilling confirmed no water table issues at Falchani, and 4 piezometers were installed to\nmonitor seasonal water flows. The Semi-Detailed Environmental Impact Assessment Study (“EIA-sd”) for the\nFalchani Lithium Project was submitted to the Ministry of Energy and Mines (“MINEM”). The EIA-sd provides\na framework for approval of all major phases required to finalize the development of Falchani from mining\nreserve definition to completion of mine construction and when approved, provides authority to drill up to 420\ndrill platforms across the Falchani Project, with no additional permits required. It is anticipated that the full\n7\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nEIA will be complete mid 2024.\nIn addition to the in-fill, expansion, and resource reclassification drilling undertaken at the Falchani Project,\nthe Company also launched initial exploration / discovery drilling at two new lithium target areas at Quelcaya,\napproximately 6 -11 km west of the Falchani Project. The initial exploration discovery at Quelcaya was\nannounced September 26, 2023, with thick, large-scale lithium mineralization averaging 1,560 ppm Li over\n222.5 m and up to 2,668 ppm.\nDrilling will be expanded beyond the recently completed EIA drilling at the Falchani Project following grant of\nthe environmental exploration permit or EIA-sd, expected imminently. Drilling is also planned at the Macusani\nProject once the necessary exploration permits have been finalized. 2024 plans are to advance the Macusani\nProject with this drill program and through updating the PEA, and to include pre-concentration and tank\nleaching as processing improvements.\nWith its flowsheet at an advanced stage, it is anticipated that piloting will commence in respect of the\nMacusani Project in 2024. In addition, with numerous in-fill and expansion targets identified, further drilling is\nplanned at Macusani to upgrade resource categories and expand the existing resource. This will lead to an\nupdated MRE and also enable an updated PEA on the Macusani Project which will also incorporate results\nof the latest pre concentration and metallurgical improvements. Both will feed into PFS for Macusani expected\nto commence in 2024.\nIn Nevada, bulk sample and exploration / expansion drilling has been completed at the TLC Project to provide\nadditional metallurgical samples and evaluate / add additional higher grade target areas at the TLC Project,\nwith an updated MRE also initiated. 10-15 tonnes of high-grade lithium claystone mineralization have been\nprepared from the bulk sample drilling and will be used as material for the detailed metallurgical testing\nrequired to further refine and enhance the TLC Flowsheet for the prefeasibility study (“PFS”) and ahead of\nlaunching pilot operations.\nEnvironmental and cultural studies were conducted to support the TLC Project’s Plan of Operations which\nreceived Bureau of Land Management approval in January 2022. Further environmental and cultural work\nhas commenced to support the full mine permitting process which will be formally launched at TLC following\nfinalization of the PFS. To this end, SRK Consulting (U.S.) Inc. of Elko, Nevada has been engaged to\ncoordinate the preparation of a mine plan of Operations with the BLM and Nexus Environmental Consultants\nInc. of Reno, Nevada has been engaged to complete biological baseline studies in support of the Mine Plan\nof Operations application.\nTLC Lithium Project (“TLC Project”) – Nevada, USA\nSince 2016, the Company has acquired, through a series of transactions, the control of unpatented lode\nmining claims in Nevada’s Nye and Esmeralda counties and now controls a total of approximately 12,511\nacres of contiguous land highly prospective for lithium and which comprise the TLC Project. The TLC Project\nhas been under exploration and development by the Company since 2019. Lithium claystone mineralization\nis found consistently in near surface drilling and sampling across a >20 km2 area and is open to expansion\nprimarily to the south and west sides of the project.\nIn addition, the Company has acquired agricultural lands with accompanying water rights to secure water for\nthe project for the long term. The outright ownership of the subject properties will provide close to 2,500 acre-\nfeet of combined water rights which should provide sufficient water for at least the initial phases of any future\nproduction at the TLC Project and a strong base for any future expansion phases. The water can be\ntransported by buried pipeline to the project utilizing existing public access routes and may also be transferred\nthroughout the basin, including to the TLC site, via intra-basin transfer.\n8\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nThe water rights come by way of the acquisition of:\n- a 326-acre farm whose accompanying 1,110 acre-feet of water rights are part of the same\nhydrographic basin as the TLC Project, Basin 137-a, or ‘Big Smoky Valley – Tonopah Flat’. The\npurchase of this farm is a critical step in securing the required makeup water for the lithium\nrecovery process planned to be implemented for lithium recovery from TLC’s unique lithium\nbearing claystones. Such recovery process is expected to minimize water usage, but some\nmakeup water will be required. Total consideration of US$1,300,000 was paid in cash in three\ntranches for this property;\n- certain privately held agricultural lands along with 1,468 acre-feet of water rights, in the Big Smoky\nValley, close to the TLC Project. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the Company paid the\nvendors a total of $4,083,681 (US$3,155,822) on closing in June 2022; and\n- the Company also has an option over approximately a further 600 acre-feet of water.\nTransactions relating to mining claims since January of 2021 are disclosed below:\n- In April 2021, the Company closed a share purchase agreement with the shareholder of 1301420\nB.C. Ltd. (“1301420 BC”) whereby the Company purchased 100% of the outstanding shares of\n1301420 BC, whose only asset was an interest in a series of mining claims located in Nye and\nEsmeralda County, Nevada, contiguous and to the west of the Company’s TLC Project. The\nclaims are not subject to any royalties or encumbrances. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company\nissued 4,000,000 common shares of the Company at a fair value of $7,200,000, which has been\naccounted for as an asset acquisition.\n- In September 2021, the Company announced that with the completion of the acquisition of Big\nSmoky, the Company had acquired the Crescent Dunes Project (“Crescent Dunes”) comprising\n3,886 acres of land highly prospective for lithium, north and contiguous to TLC, and with this\nacquisition, as well as additional contiguous staking to the east and south of TLC, the project has\ngrown to a total of approximately 12,511 acres.\nPursuant to a share purchase agreement with Big Smoky and each of the shareholders of Big\nSmoky (the “Vendors”) dated September 7, 2021, the Company acquired all of the outstanding\nshare capital of Big Smoky. The acquisition consolidates more of the known shallow occurrences\nof TLC lithium claystone mineralization. The claims acquired through the acquisition are not\nsubject to any royalties or encumbrances. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company issued\n2,500,000 common shares of the Company to the Vendors at a fair value of $6,300,000, which\nhas been accounted for as an asset acquisition.\n- In January 2023, the Company entered into a royalty buyback agreement under which the\nCompany agreed to buy back the remaining one percent (1.0%) gross overriding royalty pertaining\nto the TLC Project for consideration of 950,000 common shares to the TLC Royalty Holder at a\nfair value of $4,503,000. This transaction leaves the TLC project unencumbered by any royalty.\n- Also in January 2023, the Company agreed to acquire 8 additional lode mining claims in Nye\nCounty, Nevada, contiguous to the northwest of the TLC land package from an arms-length\nvendor. These claims will provide further improved access to the project from the northwest and\ncontrol of the region immediately surrounding the project. In consideration for the acquisition, the\nCompany issued a total of 200,000 common shares to the vendors at a fair value of $946,000.\nOn February 1, 2023, the Company announced the results of its maiden Preliminary Economic Assessment\n(“PEA”) for the TLC Project, completed jointly by DRA Global and Stantec Consulting Ltd. (“Stantec”), and\ndemonstrating that the TLC project has the potential to become a substantial, long-life producer of low-cost\nlithium carbonate (“LCE” or “Li CO ”) with the potential to produce either battery grade LCE or lithium\n2 3\n9\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nhydroxide (“LiOH”).

The report entitled “Tonopah Lithium Claims Project NI 43-101\nTechnical Report – Preliminary Economic Assessment” with an effective date of January 31, 2023 and\nprepared by John Joseph Riordan, Valentine Eugene Coetzee, Derek J. Loveday, Satjeet Pandher, Joan C.\nKester and Sean Ennis of DRA Pacific, was filed on American Lithium’s SEDAR+ profile at www.sedarplus.ca.\nThe PEA demonstrates that the TLC project has the potential to become a substantial, long-life producer of\nlow-cost lithium carbonate (“LCE” or “Li CO ”) with the potential to produce either battery grade LCE or lithium\n2 3\nhydroxide (“LiOH”). The PEA base case envisions an initial 4.4 Million tonnes per annum (“Mtpa”) processing\n11\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nthroughput expanding to 8.8Mtpa. The PEA alternative case is identical, but with added production of high\npurity magnesium sulfate as a by-product over life of operations. Unless otherwise stated, all dollar figures\nare in US currency.\nTLC Project PEA Highlights (Base Case – Ramp-up Production Li only production):\n• Pre-tax Net Present Value (“NPV”) $3.64 billion at $20,000/tonne (“t”) LCE\n8%\n• After-tax NPV $3.26 billion at $20,000/t LCE\n8%\n• Pre-tax Internal Rate of Return (“IRR”) of 28.8%\n• After-tax IRR of 27.5%\n• PEA mine and processing plan produces 1.46 Mt LCE LOM over 40 years\n• Pre-tax initial capital payback period 3.6 years; after-tax payback 3.7 years**\n• Average LOM annual pre-tax cash flow: $435 million; annual after tax cash flow: $396 million\n• Initial Capital Costs (“Capex”) estimated at $819 million\n• Total Capex estimated at $1,456 million; Sustaining Capital estimated at $767 million\n• Operating cost (“Opex”) estimated at $7,443/t LCE inclusive of power credits\n** Payback is based on Phase 1 capital alone, with undiscounted cashflows\nTLC Project PEA Highlights (Alternate Case – Ramp-Up Production Li + Magnesium Sulfate\nproduction):\n• Identical LCE production scenario, but with added LOM average production of 1,681,856 tpa of\nmagnesium sulfate (“MgSO ” - monohydrate and heptahydrate) by-products\n4\n• Pre-tax NPV $6.06 billion at $20,000/t LCE & $150/t MgSO\n8% 4\n• After-tax NPV $5.16 billion at $20,000/t LCE & $150/t MgSO ;\n8% 4\n• Pre-tax IRR of 38.6%\n• After-tax IRR of 36.0%\n• Pre-tax initial capital payback period 2.6 years; after-tax payback 2.8 years\n• Average LOM pre-tax annual cash flow: $684 million; annual after tax cash flow: $ 591 million\n• Initial Capex estimated at $827 million\n• Total Capex estimated at $1,464 million; Sustaining Capital estimated at $738 million\n• Opex estimated at $7,443/t LCE inclusive of power credits\n• Opex estimated at $817/t LCE, inclusive of power & MgSO credits\n4\n• PEA mine plan produces 1.46 Mt LCE and 64.9 Mt MgSO LOM over 40 years\n4\nReaders are cautioned that the PEA is preliminary in nature and includes inferred mineral resources that are\nconsidered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would\nenable them to be categorized as mineral reserves. There is no certainty the results of the PEA will be\nrealized. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability.\nAdditional work is required to upgrade the mineral resources to mineral reserves. In addition, the mineral\nresource estimates could be materially affected by environmental, geotechnical, permitting, legal, title,\ntaxation, socio-political, marketing, or other relevant factors.\nMine Life & Production\n• Simple truck and shovel open pit mining of the shallow resource underpins the scalable, long-life, lithium\nproject producing approximately 24,000 tpa LCE over Years 1-6 expanding to 48,000 tpa LCE production\nfor Years 7-19 years when mining ceases. Rehandling of the >1,000 parts per million (“ppm”) stockpile\nallows production to continue for Years 20-40.\n• Average LOM Production of approximately 38,000 tpa LCE for 40 years.\n12\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\n• Targeted 1,400 ppm Li average feed grade pit-constrained resource supports mining for 19 years and\nprocessing >1,000 ppm Li stockpile for an additional 21 years.\n• 1,400 ppm feed material beneficiation increases the head grade to leaching to 2,000 ppm Li.\n• LOM Strip Ratio (Waste:Ore) of 0.93:1 with a maximum final pit depth of ~325-350’, well above the water\ntable depth.\n• Where possible progressive reclamation of mining areas is planned along with in-pit back-filling of waste\nrock and filtered tailings.\n• Sulfuric acid leaching using industry standard techniques and flowsheet produces high purity lithium\ncarbonate to enable the production of battery grade LCE or LiOH.\n▪ PEA study estimates that for an additional $100M (Installed) Capex, and $406/t LCE Opex, a final\nconversion and refining processing step will enable the production of battery grade LiOH; or\n▪ End users have the flexibility of acquiring high purity LCE from TLC and converting it themselves to\nwhichever product is required.\n• Magnesium sulphate (monohydrate) is an increasingly important fertilizer add-on product with a large\nand growing global market. High-purity hydrated products (heptahydrate & epsom salts) are used in the\nfood, personal care and water quality industries.\nTLC Project PEA Key Highlights\nDescription Units Base Case Alternate Case\nLCE Selling Price $/tonne $20,000 $20,000\nLife of Mine years 40 40\nROM\nProcessing Rate P1 / P21 Mtpa 4.4 / 8.8 4.4 / 8.8\nAverage Throughput (LOM) tpa 8,112,415 8,112,415\nLCE Produced (average LOM)1 tpa 38,157 38,157\nP1 LCEProduction (steady state) tpa 24,000 24,000\nP2 LCEProduction (steady state) tpa 48,000 48,000\nLCE Produced (total LOM)1 tonnes 1,462,913 1,462,913\n$/LCE\nUnit Operating Cost (OPEX) LOM2 7,443 817\ntonne\nMgSO Produced (average LOM)1 tpa n/a 1,663,213\n4\nMgSO Selling Price $/tonne n/a 150\n4\nGross Revenue incl.

This project land position was the result\nof several consolidation transactions between 2007 and 2014 (see map below).\nThrough a mining rights transfer agreement entered into in June 2022, the Company acquired an additional\n18 concessions in Peru and now holds 174 concessions covering an area in excess of 1090 km2. The\nCompany paid $517,130 (US$400,000) and issued 2,250,000 common shares of the Company with a fair\nvalue of $4,635,000 to the vendor of these 18 concessions.\n16\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nCautionary Note Regarding Concessions\n32 of the 174 Falchani Project and Macusani Project concessions now held by American Lithium’s subsidiary\nMacusani, have been subject to Administrative and Judicial processes (together, the “Processes”) in Peru to\noverturn resolutions issued by the Geological, Mining, and Metallurgical Institute of Peru (“INGEMMET”) and\nthe Mining Council of the Ministry of Energy and Mines of Peru (“MINEM”) in February 2019 and July 2019,\nrespectively, which declared Macusani’s title to the 32 concessions invalid due to late receipt of the annual\nvalidity payment. On November 15, 2023 the Superior Court of Peru unanimously upheld the prior ruling of\nthe lower court in favour of the Company in relation to those 32 concessions which clearly established that\nMacusani is the rightful owner of these concessions and highlights that the action launched by INGEMMET\nand MINEM was baseless and unsubstantiated... On December 29, 2023 the Company announced that\nINGEMMET and MINEM have petitioned the Supreme Court in a final attempt to reverse the ruling. If the\npetition is successful, Macusani’s title to the 32 concessions could be revoked. The Company will continue\nto take all necessary actions, and pursue all available legal options, to defend its interests.\nFalchani Project Highlights\nFollowing the initial discovery in November 2017, accelerated exploration efforts led to the maiden mineral\nresource estimates being announced on July 24, 2018, followed by an updated mineral resource estimate on\nMarch 4, 2019, increasing the total lithium resources by more than 90%. A new updated MRE was completed\nby Stantec Consulting Services Inc. and announced October 31, 2023, expanding the contained lithium\nresources in the Measured & Indicated categories by 476%. The Falchani Project resource is comprised\nprimarily of three zones, namely the upper breccia unit (“UBX”), lithium-rich tuff unit (“LRT”) and lower breccia\nunit (“LBX”), in order of stratigraphy. A lower grade Li-rich subvolcanic intrusion (Coarse Felsic Intrusion)\nforms the basement to the Falchani volcanic stratigraphy, and contributes to the overall MRE Inferred\ncategory.\nThe results of an updated, independent PEA, prepared by DRA Global (“DRA”), were announced on February\n4, 2020, demonstrating that the Falchani Project has the potential to become a large, long-life producer of\nlow cost, high quality, low impurity battery grade Li CO . An updated PEA was recently completed by DRA\n2 3\nGlobal and announced January 10, 2024. Unless otherwise stated, all dollar figures for the PEA are in United\nStates dollars and the economic highlights represent the Company’s 100% interest in the Falchani Project.\nThe updated Falchani Project 2023 MRE and 2024 PEA both include the Falchani and Ocacasa 4\nconcessions based on the most recent legal decision confirming the Company’s ownership of all concessions.\nHowever, please refer to the Cautionary Note Regarding Concessions section in this MD&A.\nThe PEA was completed by DRA Global based on the updated mineral resource estimate recently completed\nby Stantec Consulting Services Ltd. The updated PEA demonstrates that the Falchani project has the\npotential to become a substantial, low-cost, long-life producer of high purity lithium carbonate (“LC” or\n“Li CO ”) with the potential to also produce Sulfate of Potash (“SOP”) and Cesium Sulfate (“CsS” or\n2 3\n“Cs SO4”) by-products alongside LC. The PEA base case envisions an initial 1.5 Million tonnes per annum\n2\n(“Mtpa”) processing throughput (Years 1-5), expanding to 3.0 Mtpa (Years 6-10) and ultimately ramping up\nto to 6.0 Mtpa (Years 11-43) with 32 years of mining followed by 11 years of stockpile processing.

Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. The effective date of the Mineral Resource Estimate is\nOctober 30,2023. There is no certainty that any mineral resource will be converted into mineral reserve.\nThe mineral resource estimates are based on 12,317 m from 67 drill holes from 35 Platforms (2017 to 2023).\nSampling was carried out at sampling intervals of between 0.5m and 1.0m. Samples used throughout the\nestimation process were composited to a downhole length of 2.5m (see Figure: Falchani Project Mineral\nClassification and Drill Platform Location Map, below).\n22\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFalchani Project Mineral Classification and Drill Platform Location Map\nEnvironmental\nA baseline environmental study (the “Baseline Study”) undertaken by ACOMISA, a Lima-based\nenvironmental consulting company, and continued in collaboration with Anddes Asociados S.A.C. is ongoing.\nThe Baseline Study was expanded to include each of the Falchani Lithium Project and Macusani Uranium\nProject areas and now covers the relevant areas belonging to the communities of Isivilla, Tantamaco, Corani,\nChimboya and Paquaje, and Chacaconiza. This expanded Baseline Study was accepted by the Peruvian\nGovernment Agency SENACE (Servicio Nacional de Certificacion Ambiental) and built on previous\nenvironmental monitoring that was started by the Company in 2010 during the exploration phase of work.\nThe Baseline Study has recently progressed into an EIA that includes community relations and impacts of\nfuture development, as well as flora, fauna, water, air and noise sampling and comprehensive archaeological\nstudies.\n23\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nThe Company has also subsequently completed and submitted the semi-detailed EIA covering the project,\nbuilding on the Environmental Baseline Study. The environmental work required for the pre-feasibility study\non the Falchani Lithium project was led by SRK Peru, and includes detailed hydrological / hydrogeological\nstudies focusing on investigating water table parameters within the upper 120-150 m below surface. The\nCompany anticipates approval of the semi-detailed EIA shortly and the full EIA later in 2024.\nThe Falchani Lithium Project lies outside of the Corani-Macusani Area of Cultural and Archaeological\nSignificance (“Archaeological Area of Interest”). Archaeological studies completed as part of our exploration\nprogram permitting and recent EIA study work have shown that to date, there are no sites of cultural or\narchaeological significance affecting the Falchani Lithium Project. The local landscape, landforms, higher\nelevation and rock weathering style at the project was not conducive for hosting, or preservation of, sites of\narchaeological significance. An overview of the results of the archaeological studies, including excavations\navailable to date, is being prepared for presentation to the Ministry of Culture of Peru.\nFalchani Lithium Project Exploration and Development Work\nLithium exploration work at Falchani, including trenching and sampling started in the Quelcaya village area\nwhere new occurrences of Li-rich rocks were initially reported in 2019. The recent prospecting and mapping\nactivities demonstrate that the new lithium occurrences in the vicinity of the Quelcaya village are more\nextensive than initially modelled. These results were released May 20, 2021, with exploration and resource\nextension/expansion drilling planned and currently being permitted (see Map Figure, below). In addition, and\nas set out above, the Company was able to expand and reclassify the existing resource in Q4 2023 based\non EIA drilling and 2022 and 2023. The Company is also targeting additional infill and extension drilling at\nFalchani itself with these results to be incorporated into the already initiated PFS work.\nOn May 5, 2023, the Company announced that it had been awarded drill permits (“DIA”) [Declaración de\nImpacto Ambiental] for exploration / discovery drilling on key targets in and around the community of\nQuelcaya 6kms west of Falchani. Following the receipt of drill permits, two contractor diamond drill rigs and\ncrews were mobilized to commence Quelcaya exploration drilling. On September 26, 2023, the Company\nannounced results from a discovery hole highlighting lithium mineralization intersected over 222.5 m in\nsubvolcanic intrusive rocks averaging 1,560 ppm Li from 119.1 m downhole.\nFalchani and Quelcaya Project Location Map\n24\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nA 10-hole hydrology diamond drill program that is part of the environmental work required for a pre-feasibility\nstudy was completed in September 2023 on the Falchani Project as part of the EIA program, led by SRK\nPeru. The hydrological drilling commenced in late 2022, and restarted in late April 2023, following protest-\nrelated hiatus. No groundwater has been encountered in any of the EIA drill holes.\nAdditional exploration and development work is currently being planned and permitted to support further\nextension/in-fill drilling at the Falchani Project and will commence following receipt of exploration permits\n(DIA) or the approval of the EIA-sd from Peruvian authorities, currently expected in early 2024. Local\ncommunity acceptance and approvals have been granted and archeological and environmental sampling\nwork has been concluded.\nMacusani Uranium Project Highlights\nThe Macusani Project is one of the largest undeveloped uranium projects in the world containing significant\nmeasured, indicated, and inferred uranium resources. Located approximately 25 kilometres away from the\nCompany’s Falchani Project, the Macusani Project is proximal to excellent infrastructure and has a significant\nunexplored land package. The Company has elected to defer its previously announced intent to spin out the\nuranium assets into a separate listed entity and is advancing the project internally. Planned activities include\nthe launch of a pilot operation to provide final validation of the flow-sheet as well as to produce yellowcake\nfor evaluation by interested strategic parties. A planned major expansion and infill drilling program to expand\nand reclassify the large historical resource will follow upon receipt of final drill permits.\nPreliminary Economic Assessment\nOn February 10, 2016, Plateau filed an updated PEA. The PEA was completed by UK based, mining\nengineering consultants Wardell Armstrong International and GBM Minerals Engineering Consultants Limited\nand contains a detailed base case which contemplates the construction of a conventional open pit mining\noperation with a centralized processing facility.\nSix complexes covering multiple concessions contain mineral resources, four complexes are included in the\nMacusani Uranium Project PEA filed under Plateau’s profile on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca. Of these four\ncomplexes, three have portions of the mineral resources on concessions that have been subject to dispute\nand these have been protected by judicial rulings restoring concession title, rights, and validity to the\nCompany. (Refer to Cautionary Note Regarding Concessions section in this MD&A and to commentary under\nthe Falchani section above, which contain details on judicial processes relating to 32 of the Company’s\nconcessions).\nUnless otherwise stated, all dollar figures for the PEA are in United States dollars and the economic highlights\nrepresent Plateau’s 100% interest in the Macusani Uranium Project.\nKey Highlights of the Macusani Uranium Project PEA:\n• Net Present Value : ($50/lb U O selling price): $852.7 M pre-tax / $603.1 M after-tax\n(8%) 3 8\n• Internal Rate of Return: ($50/lb U O ): 47.6% pre-tax / 40.6% after-tax\n3 8\n• Payback Period: ($50/lb U O ): 1.69 years pre-tax / 1.76 years after-tax\n3 8\n• Initial Capital Expenditures: $249.7 M plus $50.1 M contingencies\n• Total Sustaining Capital Costs1: $43.9 M\n• Cash Operating Costs1: $17.28/lb U O average life of mine (“LOM”)\n3 8\n• Production Profile: 6.09 Mlbs/yr average LOM\n• Operating Profile: near surface open pit mining of five deposits along with a small high-grade\nunderground mine operation, heap leach process plant\n• Mining Rate: 109.0 Mt/yr at 289 ppm U O for 10 years at an average strip ratio of 2:1\n3 8\n(waste:mineralized material)\n• Processing Throughput: 10.9 M tonne per annum\n• High-grade scenarios were also considered with both heap leach and tank leach processing options\nand the Company continues to evaluate optimization scenarios\n1 Financial metrics which are not measures recognized under IFRS and do not have a standardized meaning\nprescribed by IFRS. See Alternative Performance Measurements section in this MD&A for additional\ninformation.\n25\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nProcessing work tailored towards upgrading, or pre-concentrating, through communition/concentration\nstudies on the uranium mineralization was planned for early 2020. The test work programs were deferred\nand the research and development work recommenced in August 2020 with encouraging results released\nMarch 30, 2021. The work utilized mineralization from 3 main deposits, with the following results: Colibri II-\nIII Deposits – 81.6% of U retained in 35.3% of original mass passing 300 μm; Calculated Head Grade of 270\nppm U upgraded to 623 ppm U (Upgrade factor 2.3) using double scrubbing for 12 minutes each cycle;\nCorachapi Deposit – 73% of U retained in 31% of original mass passing 212 μm; Calculated Head Grade\nof 245 ppm U upgraded to 570 ppm U (Upgrade factor 2.3) using initial scrubbing for 15 minutes at 60%\nsolids (by mass) followed by secondary scrubbing for 5 minutes at 45% solids. The upgrading results highlight\nthe opportunity to bring in lower grade deposits previously not included in the PEA production schedule, and\nthe higher grade feed material should positively impact the PEA Capital Costs with a smaller plant footprint\nand PEA operating costs due to lower energy and reagent costs. Trade off studies between original heap\nleach processing and tank/vat leach processing options will be conducted using the upgraded fraction\nachievable in a scrubbing and classification circuit.\nReaders are cautioned that the PEA is preliminary in nature and includes inferred mineral resources that are\nconsidered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would\nenable them to be categorized as mineral reserves. There is no certainty the results of the PEA will be\nrealized. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability.\nAdditional work is required to upgrade the mineral resources to mineral reserves. In addition, the mineral\nresource estimates could be materially affected by environmental, geotechnical, permitting, legal, title,\ntaxation, socio-political, marketing, or other relevant factors.\nThe completed technical report on the PEA entitled “Macusani Project, Macusani, Peru, NI 43-101 Report –\nPreliminary Economic Assessment” prepared by Mr. Michael Short and Mr. Thomas Apelt, of GBM Minerals\nEngineering Consultants Limited; Mr. David Young, of The Mineral Corporation; and Mr. Mark Mounde, of\nWardell Armstrong International Limited dated January 12, 2016, can be located under Plateau’s profile on\nSEDAR+ (www.sedarplus.ca) and on the Company's website.\nEnvironmental\nWithin the Macusani Project area lies an Archaeological Area of Interest which includes sites of cultural\ninterest. The area boundaries are very clearly defined and are well-known to people working in the region.\nThe Company continues working with environmental and archaeological professionals, local communities,\nand Peruvian authorities to develop a plan to protect any sites located in proximity to the proposed future\nproject operations. The Macusani Project and proposed future infrastructure for operations currently does not\ndirectly affect any such sites.\nWith the assistance of the Ministry of Culture of Peru, the Company has spent the past three years conducting\na professional archaeological study in the project area. This is a full archaeological research project that the\nCompany’s team initiated and is still on-going. Whilst initial completion of field work was targeted for H1 2020,\nfollowed by presentation of the archaeological study to the Ministry of Culture in 2020, timing was subject to\neasing of the Peru government’s COVID-19 lockdown restrictions, which have impacted access to the site.\nDesktop work is completed, and on-site work resumed in July 2022. Archeological study results have been\nsubmitted to the Peruvian Ministry of Culture.\nThe Company remains fully informed of the progress of this archeological study and is confident based on\nthe findings to date, that together with the qualified investigating team, it will work towards an outcome that\nrespects, salvages and preserves cultural heritage where it exists. In addition, all the recently validated\nartefacts are currently exposed to natural erosion and decay from the weather conditions that characterize\nthe Macusani plateau, therefore a preserving solution should be found. It is positive to see the government\nproactively working towards an actionable outcome on both accounts, and it is indicative of the level of\nsupport across the board for the Company’s projects.\nThe Company, and its predecessor companies, have been exploring continuously in the Macusani area since\nthe initial land acquisition in 2005. All exploration activities are completed under fully approved social/\ncommunity agreements and exploration/mining permits.\n26\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nMacusani Project Exploration and Development Work\nExploration activities at the Macusani Project included mapping, prospecting, and sampling work. Five areas\nspread between various drilled targets with reported uranium resources were covered by radiometric mapping\nand surface sampling. The results of this surface uranium exploration activity were released on January 25,\n2021, and September 28, 2021 (see map below). Additional surface mapping, sampling and prospecting work\nfor future target generation has continued while awaiting drill permits. Exploration and resource\nexpansion/extension drilling is expected to commence upon receipt of permitting approvals, possibly in late\n2023. An update of the existing Macusani PEA with the results of this planned drill program and including\npre-concentration and tank leach processing improvements should follow during 2024 prior to PFS late 2024.\nAs previously announced, the Company has had success in pre concentrating / upgrading Macusani uranium\nmineralization with the potential to significantly improve the already robust economics of the existing PEA\nand to increase the resources included in the existing PEA. The latest PEA Technical Report is out of date;\nhowever, it should be noted that uranium prices have rebounded over the past 12 months and are now above\n$90/lb and forecast to be well above the $50/lb U O pricing used in the January 2016 PEA. This, coupled\n3 8\nwith potential process enhancements, is expected to more than cover potential increased reagent prices,\ncosts, and inflation. The Company also intends to launch pilot operations in respect of the Macusani flowsheet\nin 2024.\nMacusani Project Location Map with new target areas\n27\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nOutlook\nThe Company continues to believe that the growing demand for lithium-ion batteries will continue to drive\ndemand for lithium products and that the domestic market for lithium products will be under supplied for many\nyears to come. The uranium market is equally compelling with persistent supply/demand imbalance,\nimproving price environment and continuing steady demand growth. These developments position the\nCompany well should the Company be able to raise the required capital to continue its exploration and\ndevelopment efforts with the goal of successfully developing commercially viable lithium and uranium\ndeposits.\nWith large lithium and uranium resources, strategically located in Nevada and Peru, and with recent\nsuccessful development work on all its projects, the Company believes that it is well positioned to benefit\nfrom growing demand for sustainable, domestically sourced supplies of lithium and the need for clean/green\nbaseload energy that can only be answered with nuclear energy as a large part of the Global energy mix.\nSelected Quarterly Information\nThe following financial information is derived from the Company’s financial statements for the three and nine\nmonths, ended November 30, 2023, and 2022, has been prepared in accordance with IFRS and is presented\nin Canadian dollars, unless otherwise indicated:\nFor the three months ended For the nine months ended\nNovember 30, November 30,\n2023 2022 2023 2022\n$ $ $ $\nRevenues - - - -\nOperating expenses (8,749,969) (6,582,866) (32,860,163) (26,846,538)\nNet loss (11,184,352) (5,508,459) (32,890,980) (25,475,302)\nComprehensive loss (11,169,972) (5,436,973) (32,871,414) (25,139,717)\nBasic and diluted loss per common share (0.05) (0.03) (0.15) (0.12)\nWorking capital 21,365,132 36,058,791 21,365,132 36,058,791\nTotal assets 177,178,511 183,914,633 177,178,511 183,914,633\nTotal liabilities 4,389,041 2,362,560 4,389,041 2,362,560\nAs at November 30, 2023, the Company had not yet achieved profitable operations and has accumulated\nlosses of $152,158,227 (February 28, 2023 - $119,267,247) since inception. The basic and diluted loss per\nshare for the nine months ended November 30, 2023, and 2022 were $0.15 and $0.12, respectively.\nThe Company’s future financial success will be dependent upon the ability to obtain necessary financing to\ncomplete the development of reserves or the discovery and development of a body of commercial ore. Such\ndiscovery and development may take years, if at all, to complete and the amount of resulting income, if any,\nis impossible to determine.\nSummary of Quarterly Results\nThe following table sets out selected quarterly financial information for each of the eight recently completed\nquarters. The financial information has been reported in accordance with IFRS and is presented in Canadian\ndollars, unless otherwise indicated. The Company has not yet earned revenue from any of its mineral\nproperties.

The\ndecrease in interest and miscellaneous income was partially offset by an increase in interest rates\nthe Company was able to obtain on its deposit certificates.\n30\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nCash Flows\nNet cash used in operating activities for the three months ended November 30, 2023, was $4,760,662 (three\nmonths ended November 30, 2022 - $5,552,129). The cash used consisted primarily of exploration and\nevaluation expenditures of $2,986,485 (three months ended November 30, 2022 - $2,370,755) and corporate\noverhead expenditures net of non-cash expenditures and a net change in non-cash working capital, detailed\nin the statement of cash flows.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended November 30, 2023, was $18,355,174 (nine\nmonths ended November 30, 2022 - $16,702,348). Cash used in operating activities consisted primarily of\nfunding exploration and evaluation expenditures of $13,115,716 (November 30, 2022 - $11,401,964) and\ncorporate overhead expenditures net of non-cash expenditures and a net change in non-cash working capital,\ndetailed in the statement of cash flows.\nDuring the three months ended November 30, 2023, cash used in investing activities was $1,969,096 (three\nmonths ended November 30, 2022 - net cash provided by investing activities of $16,218,673). Cash\nmovements were mainly the result of investments and redemptions of guaranteed investment certificates\n(“GICs”).\nDuring the nine months ended November 30, 2023, cash provided by investing activities was $18,546,801\n(nine months ended November 30, 2022 - net cash provided by investing activities of $11,672,860). Cash\nwas mainly received from the redemption of GICs partly offset by GIC purchases and the strategic investment\nin Surge.\nDuring the three months ended November 30, 2023, cash used in financing activities was $24,574 (three\nmonths ended November 30, 2022 – cash provided by financing activities of $343,880). During the prior\nperiod, total cash of $348,614 was received from the exercises of stock options and warrants.\nDuring the nine months ended November 30, 2023, cash provided by financing activities was $778,564 (nine\nmonths ended November 30, 2022 – $1,865,879). The Company received proceeds of $801,908 (November\n30, 2022 – $2,547,229) in connection with the exercise of stock options and $45,801 (November 30, 2022 –\n$382,805) in connection with the exercise of warrants. The Company repaid long term debt of $Nil (November\n30, 2022 - $1,051,075).\nThe Company’s cash increased by $1,078,933 from $11,985,766 at February 28, 2023 to $13,064,699 at\nNovember 30, 2023, and in addition the Company held $4,021,803 in a GIC and $4,171,420 in a short-term\ninvestment.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company’s liquidity and capital resources at the following dates are as follows:\nFor the three months ended For the nine months ended\nNovember 30, November 30,\n2023 2022 2023 2022\n$ $\nRevenues - - - -\nOperating expenses (8,749,969) (6,582,866) (32,860,163) (26,846,538)\nNet loss (11,184,352) (5,508,459) (32,890,980) (25,475,302)\nComprehensive loss (11,169,972) (5,436,973) (32,871,414) (25,139,717)\nBasic and diluted loss per common share (0.05) (0.03) (0.15) (0.12)\nWorking capital 21,365,132 36,058,791 21,365,132 36,058,791\nTotal assets 177,178,511 183,914,633 177,178,511 183,914,633\nTotal liabilities 4,389,041 2,362,560 4,389,041 2,362,560\n31\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nNovember 30, 2023 February 28, 2023\n$ $\nCash and cash equivalents 13,064,699 11,985,766\nGuaranteed investment certificates 4,021,803 28,636,414\nShort-term investment 4,171,420 -\nAmounts receivable 485,414 400,804\nPrepaid expenses and deposits 1,817,023 2,109,932\nAccounts payables and accrued liabilities (1,992,266) (1,663,785)\nDeferred revenue (120,000) -\nCurrent portion of lease liabilities (82,961) (74,981)\nWorking capital 21,365,132 41,394,150\nThe Company has no revenue-generating operations from which it can internally generate funds and\ntherefore has been incurring losses since inception. The Company has financed its operations and met its\ncapital requirements primarily through the sale of capital stock by way of private placements and the\nsubsequent exercise of share purchase warrants issued in connection with such private placements and the\nexercise of stock options. When acquiring interests in resource properties through purchase or option, the\nCompany issues common shares or a combination of cash and shares to the vendors of the property as\nconsideration for the property in order to conserve its cash. The Company expects that it will continue to\noperate at a loss for the foreseeable future and will require additional financing to fund the development of\nits existing properties and the acquisition of potential resource properties.\nAs at November 30, 2023, the Company had working capital of $21,365,132 (February 28, 2023 –\n$41,394,150). During the nine months ended November 30, 2023, the Company’s cash position increased\nby $1,078,933, compared to a decrease of $2,792,946 during the nine months ended November 30, 2022.\nThe increase in the current period was mainly due to the redemption of guaranteed investment certificates of\n$35,594,712. The increase was partly offset by GIC purchases of $11,257,649, the Company’s $5,360,000\nstrategic investment in Surge, corporate overhead expenses and exploration activities. The decrease in the\ncomparative period was mainly due to corporate overhead expenses, exploration activities, long-term debt\nrepayment and exploration asset purchases of $4,600,811; partly offset by a GIC redemption and stock option\nexercises of $2,547,229.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company has not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nRisk Factors\nThe Company is in the business of acquiring, exploring and, if warranted, developing and exploiting mineral\nproperties. Due to the nature of the Company’s business and the present stage of exploration of its mineral\nproperties (which are primarily early-stage exploration properties with no established reserves), the following\nrisk factors will apply:\nResource Exploration and Development is Generally a Speculative Business: Resource exploration and\ndevelopment is a speculative business and involves a high degree of risk, including, among other things,\nunprofitable efforts resulting not only from the failure to discover mineral deposits but from finding mineral\ndeposits which, though present, are insufficient in size or too metallurgically challenging to return a profit from\nproduction. The marketability of natural resources that may be acquired or discovered by the Company will\nbe affected by numerous factors beyond the control of the Company. These factors include market\nfluctuations, the proximity and capacity of natural resource markets, government regulations, including\nregulations relating to prices, taxes, royalties, land use, importing and exporting of minerals and\nenvironmental protection. The exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted, but the\ncombination of these factors may result in the Company not receiving an adequate return on invested capital.\nThe great majority of exploration projects do not result in the discovery of commercially mineable deposits of\nore.\n32\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nTitle to Property: The acquisition of title to resource properties is a detailed and time-consuming process.\nThe Company may acquire an interest in its properties through land use permits. Title to, and the area of, the\nproperties may be disputed. There is no guarantee that such title will not be challenged or impaired. There\nmay be challenges to the title of the property in which the Company may have an interest, including\nconcessions which, if successful, could result in the loss or reduction of the Company's interest in the\nproperty, including the Peru concessions. As noted under the Cautionary Note Regarding Concessions in\nthis MD&A, 32 of the 174 Falchani Project and Macusani Project concessions now held by American Lithium’s\nsubsidiary Macusani, have been subject to Judicial processes in Peru to overturn resolutions issued by the\nGeological, Mining, and Metallurgical Institute of Peru (“INGEMMET”) and the Mining Council of the Ministry\nof Energy and Mines of Peru (“MINEM”) in February 2019 and July 2019, respectively, which declared\nMacusani’s title to the 32 concessions invalid due to late receipt of the annual validity payment. On November\n15, 2023 the Superior Court of Peru unanimously upheld the prior ruling of the lower court in favour of the\nCompany in relation to those 32 concessions which clearly established that Macusani is the rightful owner of\nthese concessions and highlights that the action launched by INGEMMET and MINEM was baseless and\nunsubstantiated. On December 29, 2023 the Company announced that INGEMMET and MINEM have\npetitioned the Supreme Court in a final attempt to reverse the ruling. If the petition is successful, Macusani’s\ntitle to the 32 concessions could be revoked. . The Company will continue to take all necessary actions, and\npursue all available legal options, to defend its interests.\nPotential conflicts of Interest: Certain of the Company’s directors and officers may serve as directors and/or\nofficers of other public and private companies and devote a portion of their time to managing other business\ninterests. This may result in certain conflicts of interest, to the extent that such other companies may\nparticipate in ventures in which the Company is also participating. The laws of British Columbia require the\ndirectors and officers to act honestly, in good faith, and in the best interests of the Company. In addition, each\ndirector must declare his or her interest and abstain from voting on any contract or transaction in which the\ndirector may have a conflict of interest.\nPermits and Licenses: The operations of the Company will require licenses and permits from various\ngovernmental authorities. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain all necessary\nlicenses and permits that may be required to carry out exploration, development, and mining operations at\nits projects.\nMining Industry is Intensely Competitive: The Company’s business will be the acquisition, exploration and\ndevelopment of resource properties. The mining industry is intensely competitive, and the Company will\ncompete with other companies that have far greater resources.\nEnvironmental Matters: Existing and possible future environmental legislation, regulations and actions\ncould cause significant expense, capital expenditures, restrictions, and delays in the activities of the\nCompany, the extent of which cannot be predicted, and which may well be beyond the capacity of the\nCompany to fund. The Company’s right to exploit any mining properties will be subject to various reporting\nrequirements and to obtaining certain government approvals and there can be no assurance that such\napprovals, including environment approvals, will be obtained without inordinate delay or at all.\nForeign Operations: The Company is exposed to risks of political instability and changes in government\npolicies, laws and regulations in Peru. The Company holds mineral interests in the Republic of Peru that may\nbe adversely affected in varying degrees by political instability, government regulations relating to the mining\nindustry and foreign investment therein, and the policies of other nations in respect of Peru. Any changes in\nregulations (including, without limitation, the New Uranium Regulations) or shifts in political conditions are\nbeyond the Company’s control and may adversely affect the Company’s business. New laws, regulations\nand requirements may be retroactive in their effect and implementation. The Company’s operations may be\naffected in varying degrees by government regulations, including those with respect to restrictions on\nproduction, price controls, export controls, income taxes, expropriation of property, employment, land use,\nwater use, environmental legislation and mine safety. The Company's operations may also be adversely\naffected in varying degrees by government regulations, including those with respect to restrictions on foreign\nownership, state-ownership of strategic resources, production, price controls, export controls, income taxes,\nexpropriation of property, employment, land use, water use, environmental legislation, and mine safety. There\n33\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nis no assurance that permits can be obtained, or that delays will not occur in obtaining all necessary permits\nor renewals of such permits for existing properties or additional permits required in connection with future\nexploration and development programs. In the event of a dispute arising at the Company’s foreign operations,\nthe Company may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or may not be successful in\nsubjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts in Canada. The Company may also be hindered or\nprevented from enforcing its rights with respect to a government entity or instrumentality because of the\ndoctrine of sovereign immunity. Government authorities in emerging market countries often have a high\ndegree of discretion and at times may appear to act selectively or arbitrarily, and sometimes in a manner that\nmay not be in full accordance with the rule of law or that may be influenced by political or commercial\nconsiderations. Unlawful, selective, or arbitrary governmental actions could include denial or withdrawal of\nlicenses, sudden and unexpected tax audits, and civil actions. Although unlawful, selective, or arbitrary\ngovernment action may be challenged in court, such action, if directed at the Company or its shareholders,\ncould have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition\nand future prospects.\nSince December 2022, Peru has experienced an increased level of civil unrest and political protests. Civil\nunrest has led to disruptions in the ability of foreign nationals to travel to and from Peru, and has limited the\nability of the Company to ensure the safety of personnel visiting operations in Peru. On-ground exploration\nwork in Peru has been suspended due to protests and unrest in the Puno region near the projects. The\nCompany’s cessation of exploration activities was supported by the local communities, all of which are not\nprotesting but do not wish to become targets of the protests. The Company continues to closely monitor the\nsituation and will only resume exploration activities once it is safe to do so for all employees, contractors and\ncommunity members.\nFluctuation of Metal Prices: Even if commercial quantities of mineral deposits are discovered by the\nCompany, there is no guarantee that a profitable market will exist for the sale of the metals produced. Factors\nbeyond the control of the Company may affect the marketability of any substances discovered. The prices of\nvarious metals have experienced significant movement over short periods of time and are affected by\nnumerous factors beyond the control of the Company, including international economic and political trends,\nexpectations of inflation, currency exchange fluctuations, interest rates and global or regional consumption\npatterns, speculative activities, and increased production due to improved mining and production methods.\nThe supply of and demand for metals are affected by various factors, including political events, economic\nconditions, and production costs in major producing regions. There can be no assurance that the price of any\nmineral deposit will be such that any of its resource properties could be mined at a profit.\nNo Assurance of Profitability: The Company has no history of earnings and, due to the nature of its\nproposed business, there can be no assurance that the Company will ever be profitable. The Company has\nnot paid dividends on its shares and does not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future. The only present\nsource of funds available to the Company is from the sale of its common shares or, possibly, the sale or\noptioning of a portion of its interest in its resource properties. Even if the results of exploration are\nencouraging, the Company may not have sufficient funds to conduct the further exploration that may be\nnecessary to determine whether or not a commercially mineable deposit exists. While the Company may\ngenerate additional working capital through further equity offerings or through the sale or possible syndication\nof its properties, there can be no assurance that any such funds will be available on favourable terms, or at\nall. At present, it is impossible to determine what amounts of additional funds, if any, may be required. Failure\nto raise such additional capital could put the continued viability of the Company at risk.\nFinancing Risks: The Company has no source of operating cash flow and has no assurance that additional\nfunding will be available to it for further exploration and development of its projects. Although the Company\nhas been successful in the past in obtaining financing through the sale of equity securities, there can be no\nassurance that it will be able to obtain adequate financing in the future or that the terms of such financing will\nbe favourable. Failure to obtain such additional financing could result in delay or indefinite postponement of\nfurther exploration and development of its projects with the possible loss of such properties.\n34\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFinancial Resources: The nature of the development of the Company’s properties will depend upon the\nCompany’s ability to obtain financing through the joint venturing of projects, private placement financing,\npublic financing or other means. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in obtaining\nthe required financing. Failure to raise the required funds could result in the Company losing, or being\nrequired to dispose of, its interest in its properties. In particular, failure by the Company to raise the funding\nnecessary to maintain in good standing its various option agreements could result in the loss of its rights to\nsuch properties.\nDependence Upon Others and Key Personnel: The success of the Company’s operations will depend\nupon numerous factors, many of which are beyond the Company’s control, including (i) the ability to design\nand carry out appropriate exploration programs on its resource properties; (ii) the ability to produce minerals\nfrom any resource deposits that may be located; (iii) the ability to attract and retain additional key personnel\nin exploration, marketing, mine development and finance; and (iv) the ability and the operating resources to\ndevelop and maintain the properties held by the Company. These and other factors will require the use of\noutside suppliers as well as the talents and efforts of the Company and its consultants and employees. There\ncan be no assurance of success with any or all of these factors on which the Company’s operations will\ndepend, or that the Company will be successful in finding and retaining the necessary employees, personnel\nand/or consultants in order to be able to successfully carry out such activities.\nEstimates of Mineral Resources May Prove to Be Inaccurate: Calculations of mineral resources, mineral\nreserves and metal recovery are estimates only, and there can be no assurance about the quantity and grade\nof minerals until reserves or resources are actually mined. Until reserves or resources are mined and\nprocessed, the quantity of reserves or resources and grades must be considered as estimates only. In\naddition, the quantity of reserves or resources may vary depending on commodity prices. Any material\nchange in the quantity of resources, grade or stripping ratio or recovery rates may adversely affect the\neconomic viability of the Projects and the Company's financial condition and prospects.\nPEA Results Are Preliminary in Nature: PEA’s are preliminary in nature and include inferred mineral\nresources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to\nthem that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves. There is no certainty the results of the\nPEA’s will be realized. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic\nviability. Additional work is required to upgrade the mineral resources to mineral reserves. In addition, the\nmineral resource estimates could be materially affected by environmental, geotechnical, permitting, legal,\ntitle, taxation, socio-political, marketing, or other relevant factors.\nGovernment Regulation: The Company’s business interests and operations are subject to the laws and\nregulations of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. These laws and regulations are wide-ranging\nand oversee social license, exploration, development, taxes, employee labour standards, health and safety,\nenvironmental protection, human rights, anticorruption measures and matters related to later stage operating\ncompanies including but not limited to production, exports, waste disposal and tailings management, safe\nhandling of toxic substances, water usage and greenhouse gases. Compliance with such laws and\nregulations increases the costs of planning, designing, drilling, developing, constructing, operating,\nmanaging, closing, reclaiming, and rehabilitating a mine or other facilities. Introduction of new laws,\namendments to current laws and regulations governing mining activities and operations or more stringent\nimplementation or arbitrary interpretation thereof could have a material adverse effect on the Company,\nincrease costs, cause a reduction in levels of production, and delay or prevent the development of the\nCompany’s projects. Regulatory enforcement, in the form of compliance or infraction notices, has occurred\nin the past and, while the current risks related to such enforcement are not expected to be material, the risk\nof material fines or corrective action cannot be ruled out in the future.\nUninsured or Uninsurable Risks: The Company may become subject to liability for pollution or hazards\nagainst which it cannot insure or against which it may elect not to insure where premium costs are\ndisproportionate to the Company’s perception of the relevant risks. The payment of such insurance premiums\nand of such liabilities would reduce the funds available for exploration and production activities.\n35\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nExploration and Development Activities Are Inherently Risky: The business of exploration and extraction\ninvolves a high degree of risk. Few properties that are explored are ultimately developed into production.\nUnusual or unexpected formations, formation pressures, power outages, labour disruptions, explosions,\ncave-ins, landslides, and the inability to obtain suitable or adequate machinery, equipment or labour are other\nrisks involved in the conduct of exploration programs. These factors can all affect the timing, cost and success\nof exploration programs and any future development. Although the Company carries liability insurance with\nrespect to its exploration operations, the Company may become subject to liability for damage to life and\nproperty, environmental damage, cave-ins, or hazards against which it cannot insure or against which it may\nelect not to insure.\nPrevious operations may have caused environmental damage at certain of the Company's properties. It may\nbe difficult or impossible to assess the extent to which such damage was caused by the Company or by the\nactivities of previous operators, in which case, any indemnities and exemptions from liability may be\nineffective, and the Company may be responsible for the costs of reclamation.\nPrice Fluctuations and Share Price Volatility: In recent years, the securities markets in the United States\nand Canada have experienced a high level of price and volume volatility, and the market price of securities\nof many companies, particularly those considered development stage companies, have experienced wide\nfluctuations in price which have not necessarily been related to the operating performance, underlying asset\nvalues or prospects of such companies. There can be no assurance that continual and extreme fluctuations\nin price will not occur.\nRights or Claims of Indigenous Groups: The Company’s properties may be located in areas presently or\npreviously inhabited or used by indigenous peoples and may be affected by evolving regulations regarding\nthe rights of indigenous peoples. The Company’s operations are subject to national and international laws,\ncodes, resolutions, conventions, guidelines and other similar rules respecting the rights of indigenous\npeoples, including the provisions of ILO Convention 169. ILO Convention 169 mandates, among other things,\nthat governments consult with indigenous peoples who may be impacted by mining projects prior to granting\nrights, permits or approvals in respect of such projects. The Company's current or future operations are\nsubject to a risk that one or more groups of indigenous people may oppose continued operation, further\ndevelopment, or new development on those projects or operations on which the Company holds an interest.\nSuch opposition may be directed through legal or administrative proceedings or protests, roadblocks or other\nforms of public expression against the Company or the owner/operators' activities and may require the\nmodification of, or preclude operation or development of projects, or may require the entering into of\nagreements with indigenous people.\nSurface Rights and Access: Although the Company acquires the rights to some or all of the minerals in the\nground subject to the tenures that it acquires, or has a right to acquire, in most cases it does not thereby\nacquire any rights to, or ownership of, the surface to the areas covered by its mineral tenures. In such cases,\napplicable mining laws usually provide for rights of access to the surface for the purpose of carrying on mining\nactivities, however, the enforcement of such rights can be costly and time consuming. In areas where there\nare no existing surface rights holders, this does not usually cause a problem, as there are no impediments to\nsurface access. However, in areas where there are local populations or landowners, it is necessary, as a\npractical matter, to negotiate surface access. There can be no guarantee that, despite having the right at law\nto access the surface and conduct mining activities, the Company will be able to negotiate a satisfactory\nagreement with any such existing landowners/occupiers for such access, and therefore it may be unable to\ncarry out mining activities. In addition, in circumstances where such access is denied, or no agreement can\nbe reached, the Company may need to rely on the assistance of local officials or the courts in such\njurisdictions. The Company’s properties are primarily located on land administered by the United States\nBureau of Land Management, and access is permitted subject to the completion of certain filings, tax\npayments and other obligations as are customary for mineral exploration companies operating in the State\nof Nevada.\nIf any of the Company's properties moves to a development stage, the Company would be subject to\nadditional risks respecting any development and production activities.\n36\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nNo Known Mineral Reserves: Despite exploration work on the Company’s mineral property interests, to\ndate no mineral reserves have been established thereon. In addition, the Company is still engaged in\nexploration on all of its material properties in order to determine if any economic deposits exist thereon. The\nCompany may expend substantial funds on exploring some of its properties only to abandon them and lose\nits entire expenditure on the properties if no commercial or economic quantities of minerals are found. Even\nif commercial quantities of minerals are discovered, the exploration properties might not be brought into a\nstate of commercial production. Finding mineral deposits is dependent on a number of factors, including the\ntechnical skill of exploration personnel involved. The commercial viability of a mineral deposit once\ndiscovered is also dependent on a number of factors, some of which are the particular attributes of the\ndeposit, such as content of the deposit including harmful substances, size, grade, and proximity to\ninfrastructure, as well as metal prices and the availability of power and water in sufficient supply to permit\ndevelopment. Most of these factors are beyond the control of the entity conducting such mineral exploration.\nThe Company is an exploration and development stage company with no history of pre-tax profit and no\nincome from its operations. There can be no assurance that the Company’s operations will be profitable in\nthe future. There is no certainty that the expenditures to be made by the Company in the exploration and\ndevelopment of its properties will result in discoveries of mineralized material in commercial quantities. Most\nexploration projects do not result in the discovery of commercially mineable deposits and no assurance can\nbe given that any particular level of recovery of mineral reserves will in fact be realized or that any identified\nmineral deposit will ever qualify as a commercially mineable (or viable) mineral deposit which can be legally\nand economically exploited. There can be no assurance that minerals recovered in small scale tests will be\nduplicated in large scale tests under on-site conditions or in production. If the Company is unsuccessful in its\nexploration and development efforts, it may be forced to acquire additional projects or cease operations.\nClimate Change Risks: The Company acknowledges climate change as an international and community\nconcern, and it supports and endorses various initiatives for voluntary actions consistent with international\ninitiatives on climate change. However, in addition to voluntary actions, governments are moving to introduce\nclimate change legislation and treaties at the international, national, state/provincial and local levels. Where\nlegislation already exists, regulation relating to emission levels and energy efficiency is becoming more\nstringent. Some of the costs associated with reducing emissions can be offset by increased energy efficiency\nand technological innovation. However, if the current regulatory trend continues, the Company expects that\nthis could result in increased costs at its operations in the future.\nLitigation Risk: In the ordinary course of the Company’s business, it may become party to new litigation or\nother proceedings in local or international jurisdictions in respect of any aspect of its business, whether under\ncriminal law, contract or otherwise. The causes of potential litigation cannot be known and may arise from,\namong other things, business activities, employment matters, including compensation issues, environmental,\nhealth and safety laws and regulations, tax matters, volatility in the Company’s stock price, failure to comply\nwith disclosure obligations or labour disruptions at its project sites. Regulatory and government agencies may\ninitiate investigations relating to the enforcement of applicable laws or regulations and the Company may\nincur expenses in defending them and be subject to fines or penalties in case of any violation and could face\ndamage to its reputation. The Company may attempt to resolve disputes involving foreign\ncontractors/suppliers through arbitration in another county and such arbitration proceedings may be costly\nand protracted, which may have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition. Litigation may be\ncostly and time-consuming and can divert the attention of management and key personnel from the\nCompany’s operations and, if adjudged adversely to the Company, may have a material and adverse effect\non the Company’s cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. In May 2021, the Ontario\nSecurities Commission (“OSC”) issued a Notice of Hearing and Statement of Allegations to Plateau and two\nof its officers (collectively, the “Executives”), commencing regulatory proceedings to consider whether\nPlateau met obligations related to continuous disclosure, associated filings, and related activities with respect\nto the status of Plateau’s title to 32 mineral concessions in Peru. In November 2022, Plateau and the\nExecutives concluded a settlement with the OSC and the matter is now closed. In addition, proceeds from a\ndirectors & officers insurance claim recouped a portion of the legal fees associated with these proceedings.\nCosts of Land Reclamation: It is difficult to determine the exact amounts which will be required to complete\nall land reclamation activities in connection with the properties in which the Company holds an interest.\nReclamation bonds and other forms of financial assurance represent only a portion of the total amount of\nmoney that will be spent on reclamation activities over the life of a mine. Accordingly, it may be necessary to\n37\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nrevise planned expenditures and operating plans in order to fund reclamation activities. Such costs may have\na material adverse impact upon the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.\nForeign Currency Risk: The Company and its subsidiaries incur significant purchases denominated in\ncurrencies other than the presentation currency, the Canadian dollar, and are subject to foreign currency risk\non assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the Canadian dollar. Exploration expenditures\nare transacted in United States Dollars, Peruvian New Soles and Australian Dollars, and the Company is\nexposed to risk of exchange rate fluctuation between the Canadian dollar and these currencies. The\nCompany does not hedge the foreign currency balances.\nCorruption and Bribery Laws: The Company’s operations are governed by, and involve interactions with,\nmany levels of government in other countries. The Company is required to comply with anti-corruption and\nanti-bribery laws, including the Criminal Code, and the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act (Canada),\nas well as similar laws in the countries in which the Company conducts its business. In recent years, there\nhas been a general increase in both the frequency of enforcement and the severity of penalties under such\nlaws, resulting in greater scrutiny and punishment to companies convicted of violating anti-corruption and\nanti-bribery laws. Measures that the Company has adopted to mitigate these risks are not always effective in\nensuring that the Company, its employees or third-party agents will comply strictly with such laws.\nFurthermore, a company may be found liable for violations by not only its employees, but also by its\ncontractors and third-party agents. If the Company finds itself subject to an enforcement action or is found to\nbe in violation of such laws, this may result in significant penalties, fines and/or sanctions imposed on the\nCompany resulting in a material adverse effect on the Company’s reputation and results of its operations.\nRelated Party Transactions\nKey management personnel include those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing,\nand controlling the activities of the Company as a whole. The Company has determined that key management\npersonnel consist of executive and non-executive members of the Company’s Board of Directors and\ncorporate officers.\n38\nE x p lo ra tio n\ne x p e n d itu\nM a n a g e m e\nS h a re -b a s e\na n dre\ns\nn t fe\nd c o\ne\ne s\nm\nv a lu\np e n\na\ns\ntio n\na tio n\nT h r e\n2 0 2\n-\n5 1 6 ,7 5 0\n2 ,4 4 4 ,4 6 3\n2 ,9 6 1 ,2 1 3\ne\n3\n$\nm\nN\no n\no\nt h\nv e\n1\n1\ns\nm\n3\n,3\n,7\ne n d e d\nb e r 3 0\n2 0 2 2\n$\n3 9 ,7 7 0\n9 3 ,7 1 3\n1 4 ,4 4 0\n4 7 ,9 2 3\nN in e\n2 0 2 3\n$\n-\n1 ,5 5 0 ,2 5 0\n8 ,3 6 7 ,5 3 4\n9 ,9 1 7 ,7 8 4\nm\nN\no n\no\nt h\nv e\n1\n4\n5\ns\nm\n2\n,2\n,4\n,8\ne n d e d\nb e r 3 0\n2 0 2 2\n$\n5 4 ,2 4 2\n2 2 ,6 6 7\n1 9 ,0 7 0\n9 5 ,9 7 9\nAs at November 30, 2023, the Company owed $64,050 (February 28, 2023 - $4,608) to companies controlled\nby officers and directors of the Company for unpaid management fees and exploration and evaluation\nexpenses which is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.\nTransactions with Surge, which is deemed to be a related party, have been disclosed in note 7 of the\nCompany’s condensed interim consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended November 30,\n2023 and 2022.\nThese transactions were in the normal course of operations.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nMaterial accounting policies, judgements and estimates\nInvestment in associate\nThe Company accounts for its investment, over which it has significant influence, as an investment in\nassociate using the equity method, whereby the investment is initially recorded at cost, and subsequently\nadjusted to recognize the Company’s share of earnings or losses from the associated company. The\ncondensed interim consolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss reflect the share of the net loss\nof the associated company from the acquisition date forward. Changes in the Company’s interest in its\nassociated company resulting in dilution gains or losses, are recognized in the condensed interim\nconsolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss.\nThe Company determines whether any objective evidence of impairment exists at each reporting date. If\nimpaired, the carrying value of the investment is written down to its recoverable amount.\nAccounting standards adopted during the period\nThe Company adopted the following new IFRS standard effective January 1, 2023. The nature and impact of\nthe standard on the Company’s consolidated annual audited financial statements is indicated below.\nIn February 2021, the IASB issued Disclosure of Accounting Policies (amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS\nPractice Statement 2 Making Materiality Judgements). IAS 1 is amended to require that an entity discloses\nits material accounting policies, instead of its significant accounting policies. Further amendments explain\nhow an entity can identify a material accounting policy and clarify that information may be material because\nof its nature, even if the related amounts are immaterial. These amendments to IAS 1 are effective for annual\nreporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, and have not had a material impact on the\nCompany’s condensed interim consolidated financial statements nor are they expected to for the Company’s\nannual financial statements.\nChange in accounting policy for expiry of share-based payment arrangements\nThe Company previously had an accounting policy to reclassify to deficit any balance in reserves upon the\nexpiry of share-based awards under a view that IFRS 2 does not preclude an entity from recognizing a\ntransfer within equity (from one component to another) in the event of an expiration; however, IFRS 2 does\nnot mandatorily require the Company to perform such reclassifications. The Company has determined not to\nreclassify reserves to deficit upon expiry for all share-based awards as management believes that the expiry\nof a fully vested equity instrument does not result in a gain to the entity and is more accurately reflected\noutside of deficit. Additionally, upon examining other accounting frameworks, specifically United States\ngenerally accepted accounting principles, a movement within equity for expired share-based awards is not\npermitted and further supports the Company’s decision to no longer reclassify reserves to deficit.\nAs a result, in the current period, the Company has changed its existing policy for the expiry of share-based\npayments and will no longer reclassify such reserves to deficit upon expiry. The consolidated equity is not\nmodified by this change in presentation. As per IAS 8, financial information from previous years presented\nfor comparative purposes has been restated so that the information is comparable. As a result of the\nrestatement, the deficit no longer includes the effects arising from the expiry of share-based payment awards\nwhich have been reclassified to reserves amounting to $1,157,471 during the year ending February 28, 2023\nand $2,318,600 cumulatively to February 28, 2022.\nJudgements and estimates\nThe preparation of condensed interim consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires\nmanagement to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies\nand the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities as at the date of the condensed interim\nconsolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting\nperiod. Estimates and assumptions are continuously evaluated and are based on management’s experience\nand other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the\n39\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\ncircumstances. However, actual outcomes can differ from these estimates. The results of estimates form the\nbasis for making the judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent\nfrom other sources.\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting\nestimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period\nor in the period of the revision and further periods if the review affects both current and future periods.\nThe key areas of judgement and estimation impacting these condensed interim consolidated financial\nstatements are as follows:\nCarrying value of exploration and evaluation assets\n• The Company’s exploration and evaluation assets represent its most significant asset on the\nstatement of financial position. The Company’s management applies its judgement, using facts and\ncircumstances available at the time, to determine whether the exploration and evaluation asset value\nmay be realized. For each of its projects, the Company reviews its right to the claims/concessions,\nfuture plans and exploration or development progress to determine if it should test the respective\nprojects for impairment. There is significant judgement involved in determining if a project shows\nimpairment indicators that may impact the carrying value of exploration and evaluation assets.\nValuation of share-based compensation awards\n• Stock options are valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with inputs that can\nsignificantly impact the calculated value. Typical inputs into the Black-Scholes option pricing model\ninclude: exercise price, historical volatility, time to expiration and risk-free discount rates. Historical\nvolatility and risk-free discount rates in particular require judgement around the reference period or\nbenchmark rate used as inputs into the Black-Scholes option pricing model.\nValuation of common shares and common share purchase warrants received from investment in Surge\nBattery Metals Inc.\n• The Company’s investment in Surge Battery Metals Inc. required the use of the Black-Scholes option\npricing model to determine the initial value of the Surge common shares and common share purchase\nwarrants. Typical inputs into the Black-Scholes option pricing model include: exercise price, historical\nvolatility, time to expiration and risk-free discount rates. Historical volatility and risk-free discount\nrates in particular require judgement around the reference period or benchmark rate used as inputs\ninto the Black-Scholes option pricing model.\nFinancial Instruments and Risk Management\nFair value of financial instruments\nThe Company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, GICs, a short-term investment,\namounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities and lease liabilities. As at November 30, 2023,\nthe Company classifies its short-term investments as FVTPL and its cash and cash equivalents, guaranteed\ninvestment certificates, amounts receivable, prepaid expenses and deposits, and accounts payable and\naccrued liabilities at amortized cost. For financial instruments at amortized cost, their carrying values\napproximate their fair values because of their current nature. The carrying value of the Company’s lease\nliabilities is measured at the present value of the discounted future cash flows.\nThe Company classifies the fair value of these financial instruments according to the following hierarchy\nbased on the amount of observable inputs used to value the instrument:\nLevel 1 – Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting\ndate. Active markets are those in which transactions occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide\npricing information on an ongoing basis.\n40\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nLevel 2 – Fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices that are observable\nfor the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices).\nLevel 3 – Valuations in the level are those with inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable\nmarket data. The Company’s common share purchase warrants in Surge (short-term investment) are\nclassified under Level 3.\nThe Company’s financial instruments are exposed to the following risks:\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument\nfails to meet its contractual obligations. Financial instruments which are potentially subject to credit risk for\nthe Company consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and a short-term investment. The carrying\namount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. As at November 30, 2023, the Company\nhas gross credit exposure relating to cash and cash equivalents and GICs of $17,086,502. The cash and\ncash equivalents and GICs are held at Canadian financial institutions and the Company considers the credit\nrisk to be minimal.\nLiquidity Risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its obligations as they come due. The\nCompany’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on management’s ability to raise the required\ncapital necessary to sustain operations through future equity or debt issuances. There can be no assurance\nthat such financing will be available on a timely basis under terms acceptable to the Company. The Company\nmanages its liquidity risk by forecasting cash flows from operations and anticipating any investment and\nfinancing activities. As at November 30, 2023, the Company had a cash and cash equivalents balance of\n$13,064,699 to settle current liabilities of $2,195,227. Liquidity risk is assessed as low.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nThe Company is exposed to foreign currency risk on fluctuations related to cash and cash equivalents,\nreclamation deposits, and accounts payable and accrued liabilities that are denominated in a foreign\ncurrency. As at November 30, 2023, the Company had foreign currency net assets (liabilities) of $6,546,468.\nA 10% fluctuation in the foreign exchange rate of foreign currencies against the Canadian dollar would result\nin a foreign exchange gain/loss of approximately $654,647.\nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risk is the risk the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because\nof changes in market interest rates. The Company has cash and cash equivalents balances and GICs with\ninterest based on the prime rate. The Company’s current policy is to invest excess cash in investment-grade\nshort-term deposit certificates issued by its banking institution. The Company periodically monitors the\ninvestments it makes and is satisfied with the credit ratings of its banks.\nPrice Risk\nThe Company is exposed to price risk related to its short-term investment, specifically on its Surge Warrants.\nThe risk results from potential adverse fair value changes as a result of a change in market conditions. The\nCompany’s potential exposure to price risk is $4,171,420.\nIn addition, the Company’s ability to raise capital to fund exploration or development activities is subject to\nrisks associated with fluctuations in the market price of lithium and uranium. The Company closely monitors\ncommodity prices to determine the appropriate course of action to be taken.\nDuring the nine months, ended November 30, 2023, and the year ended February 28, 2023, there were no\ntransfers between level 1, level 2 and level 3 classified assets and liabilities.\n41\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nCapital Management\nThe Company’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Company’s ability to continue as a\ngoing concern in order to pursue the exploration of its mineral properties and to maintain a flexible capital\nstructure for its projects for the benefit of its stakeholders, to maintain creditworthiness and to maximize\nreturns for shareholders over the long-term. The Company does not have any externally imposed capital\nrequirements to which it is subject. As the Company is in the exploration stage, its principal source of funds\nis from the issuance of common shares. The Company includes the components of shareholders’ equity in\nits management of capital.\nThe Company manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic\nconditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. To maintain or adjust the capital structure,\nthe Company may attempt to issue new shares to raise cash and obtain bridging loans from related parties.\nThe Company’s investment policy is to invest its cash in low-risk investment instruments in financial\ninstitutions with terms to maturity selected with regards to the expected time of expenditures from continuing\noperations.\nThere were no changes in the Company’s management of capital during the nine months ended November\n30, 2023.\nOutstanding Share Data\nAs at the date of this report:\na) Authorized: unlimited common shares without par value.\nb) Issued and outstanding: 214,655,814 common shares.\nc) Outstanding stock options:\nNumber of options Number of options\noutstanding exercisable Exercise price Expiry date\n$\n166,750 166,750 2.24 23-Apr-24\n200,000 200,000 0.25 04-Feb-25\n1,729,167 1,729,167 1.28 17-Sep-25\n51,515 51,515 1.03 09-Dec-25\n5,758,334 5,758,334 2.17 10-Jun-26\n1,323,000 1,323,000 3.63 16-Feb-27\n100,000 100,000 2.74 29-Jun-27\n250,000 250,000 1.91 04-Jul-27\n150,000 150,000 2.14 04-Oct-27\n1,215,000 809,996 4.85 02-Feb-28\n75,000 25,000 2.73 18-Jul-28\n11,018,766 10,563,762\n42\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nd) Restricted Stock Unit (“RSU”):\n43\nN u m b e r o\n2 ,9\n2\n1\n2 ,3\n5 ,7\nf R\n0 0\n2 5\n5 0\n8 0\n7 5\n3 0\nS\n,0\n,0\n,0\n,0\n,0\n,0\nU\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\ns\nF e b\nO\nF e\nV e\nru a\nJ\nc to\nb ru\nJ u\ns tin g\nry 1 6\nu ly 4\nb e r 4\na ry 2\nly 1 8\nD\n, 2\n, 2\n, 2\n, 2\n, 2\na\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nte\n2 4\n2 4\n2 4\n2 5\n2 5\ne) Performance share units (“PSUs”) outstanding: 2,000,000\nf) Outstanding warrants:\nN u m b e r o f w\n2\n1 6\n2 0\na\n,9\n,5\n3 72\n5\n,1\nr\n5\n0\n83\n5\n0\nr a n\n6 ,2\n7 ,6\n,5 3,9\n0\n,0 2\n1 ,3\nts\n5 0\n0 8\n3 *5\n*\n3 *\n1 9\nE x e r c is e p r ic\n3 .0\n3 .0\n1 .3 7\n1 .3 7\n1 .3 7\ne\n$0\n0\n99\n9\nA\nM\nAM\nM\nE x p ir\np ril 2 9\na y 1 1\np ril 2 7a\ny 1 2\na y 1 3\ny d\n, 2\n, 2\n, 2,\n2\n, 2\na\n0\n0\n00\n0\nte\n2 4\n2 4\n2 42\n4\n2 4\n*Upon the exercise of each of these warrants, the holder will receive one common share and one-half share\npurchase warrant, each full share purchase warrant exercisable at $3.00 for one common share.\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over disclosure\ncontrols and procedures, as defined in National Instrument 52-109 Certification of Disclosure in Issuers’\nAnnual and Interim Filings of the Canadian Securities Administrators. Disclosure controls and procedures are\ndesigned to provide reasonable assurance that all relevant information is gathered and reported to senior\nmanagement, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, on a timely basis\nso that appropriate decisions can be made regarding public disclosure, and that at information required to be\ndisclosed by the Company which it files or submits under Canadian securities laws is recorded, processed,\nsummarized and reported within the time periods specified by those laws. Any control system, no matter how\nwell designed, has inherent limitations. Therefore, disclosure controls and procedures can only provide\nreasonable assurance with respect to timely disclosure of material information.\nInternal controls over financial reporting\nInternal controls have been designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the\nCompany’s financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in\naccordance with IFRS. The Company is required under Canadian securities laws to disclose herein any\nchange in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company’s most\nrecent period that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial\nreporting during the quarter ended November 30, 2023, that management believes have materially affected,\nor are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. It should\nbe noted that a control system, including the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures system and\ninternal control over financial reporting system, no matter how well conceived can provide only reasonable,\nbut not absolute, assurance that the objective of the control system will be met and it should not be expected\nthat the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures system and internal control over financial reporting\nwill prevent or detect all reporting deficiencies whether caused by either error or fraud.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nOther MD&A Requirements\nAdditional information relating to the Company may be found on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca including,\nbut not limited to:\n• The Company’s unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements for the three and\nnine months, ended November 30, 2023, and 2022; and\n• the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended February 28, 2023,\nand 2022.\n44"
