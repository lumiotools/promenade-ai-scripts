(Nasdaq: NGNE), a clinical-stage company founded to bring life-changing genetic medicines to patients and families affected by rare neurological diseases, today announced third quarter 2024 financial results and highlighted recent corporate updates. \n\n“The recently announced interim data from participants dosed with 1E15 vg in the NGN-401 clinical trial showed consistent improvements across multiple domains that define Rett syndrome, in contrast to what is expected based on the natural history of the disease,” stated Rachel McMinn, Ph.D., Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Neurogene. “We have observed girls gaining complex skills rarely ever learned in this population, as well as skills that were once present and lost during the phase of developmental regression. The favorable safety and efficacy data for NGN-401 at the 1E15 vg dose demonstrate its potential to have a meaningful impact on the disease course of Rett syndrome. We will continue to engage with the FDA on the planning for a future registrational clinical trial and anticipate providing an update on the trial design in the first half of 2025.” \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 and Recent Highlights, and Anticipated Milestones**\n\n_Phase 1/2 Trial of NGN-401 Gene Therapy for Treatment of Rett Syndrome_\n\nNGN-401 is currently being evaluated in an ongoing, open-label Phase 1/2 trial. Key updates include: \n\n  * Announced [today](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fir.neurogene.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Fneurogene-provides-update-ngn-401-gene-therapy-clinical-trial&esheet=54154664&newsitemid=20241118092522&lan=en-US&anchor=today&index=1&md5=e5a8bea9b5372759823385e1a5b87c49) an update to the NGN-401 clinical trial \n    * Following a treatment-related serious adverse event (SAE) in the third participant dosed with 3E15 vg, Neurogene paused further use of the 3E15 vg dose and does not plan to enroll any further participants at the 3E15 vg dose \n    * The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has completed a review of the safety data for NGN-401 and has allowed Neurogene to proceed with the Phase 1/2 trial using the 1E15 vg dose \n    * Neurogene’s prior guidance of completing enrollment this quarter in the 1E15 vg dose cohort was updated as a result of the need to revise the protocol to remove the 3E15 vg dose; Neurogene expects to resume dosing once the revisions to the protocol are completed \n  * Previously [announced](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fir.neurogene.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Fneurogene-reports-positive-interim-efficacy-data-first-four-low&esheet=54154664&newsitemid=20241118092522&lan=en-US&anchor=announced&index=2&md5=5d819606329e05b371fa3e65e658813c) positive interim clinical data from the participants dosed with 1E15 vg: \n    * The first four participants showed consistent, concordant improvements across key Rett syndrome scales; all achieved clinically meaningful rating of “much improved” on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) scale and improved by 28 to 52 percent on the Rett Syndrome Behavioral Questionnaire (RSBQ) \n    * Participants achieved meaningful gains of function and developmental milestones in the core clinical domains of Rett syndrome – hand function/fine motor, communication/language, and ambulation/gross motor; these improvements were achieved despite heterogeneous clinical presentation at baseline, and not expected based on the natural history of Rett syndrome \n    * NGN-401 was well-tolerated with a favorable safety profile in the first five participants who received the 1E15 vg dose; all treatment-related adverse events (AEs) in these participants were Grade 1 (mild) \n  * Gained alignment with the FDA on CMC scale-up plans to support commercial launch and potency assay strategy for the program \n  * Plans to provide an update on registrational trial design in the first half of 2025 \n  * Expects to announce additional interim Phase 1/2 clinical data in the second half of 2025 \n\n\n\n_CLN5 Batten Disease Update_\n\nNeurogene completed enrollment (n=6) in the NGN-101 gene therapy for CLN5 Batten disease dose-escalation Phase 1/2 trial in 3Q:24. Key updates include: \n\n  * Announced that the Company does not expect to move forward with the NGN-101 gene therapy program at this time \n  * Given the rarity of the disease, continued investment in the program was predicated on alignment on a streamlined registrational pathway with FDA \n  * To support a streamlined pathway, Neurogene submitted a Regenerative Medicine Advance Therapy (RMAT) application to the FDA; despite the Company’s belief that the application met the standard of preliminary clinical evidence required to obtain an RMAT designation, the RMAT application was denied \n  * Neurogene is currently evaluating options for the program \n\n\n\n_Additional Corporate Updates_\n\n  * Executed an oversubscribed private placement of approximately [$200 million](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fir.neurogene.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Fneurogene-announces-oversubscribed-200-million-private-placement&esheet=54154664&newsitemid=20241118092522&lan=en-US&anchor=%24200+million&index=3&md5=d9c88b8e25e17643a0ae177da4266da9) in gross proceeds to Neurogene with participation from top-tier healthcare funds, extending cash runway into the second half of 2027 \n    * Post financing, there are approximately 21.0 million shares of common stock outstanding (assuming the exercise in full of all pre-funded warrants) \n  * Expects to advance an additional product candidate into the clinic in 2025 \n\n\n\n**Upcoming Events**\n\n  * Stifel 2024 Healthcare Conference: Management will participate in a fireside chat at 12:40 p.m. ET on November 19 and participate in 1x1 meetings \n  * British Paediatric Neurology Association Annual Meeting: Encore oral poster presentation of NGN-401 interim clinical data at 11:40 a.m. GMT on January 10, 2025\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * **Cash Position:** Cash, cash equivalents and investments as of September 30, 2024 were $139.0 million. The Company continues to expect current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, together with an estimated $189.5 million in net proceeds from the private placement, to fund operations into the second half of 2027. \n  * **Research & Development (“R&D”) Expenses:** R&D expenses were $16.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $11.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in R&D expenses was primarily driven by an increase in NGN-401 clinical trial costs, increased preclinical costs related to the Company’s early discovery programs, and an increase in compensation and benefits expenses due to an increase in R&D headcount. \n  * **General & Administrative (“G&A”) Expenses: **G&A expenses were $5.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $3.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in G&A expenses was primarily driven by an increase in employee-related expenses due to an increase in headcount, professional fees, rent, and other corporate-related expenses and market research costs. \n  * **Net Loss:** Net loss was $20.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net loss of $14.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. \n\n\n\n**About Neurogene**\n\nThe mission of Neurogene is to treat devastating neurological diseases to improve the lives of patients and families impacted by these rare diseases.

(Nasdaq: NGNE), a clinical-stage company founded to bring life-changing genetic medicines to patients and families affected by rare neurological diseases, today announced an update on its ongoing Phase 1/2 open-label clinical trial evaluating NGN-401 gene therapy for the treatment of Rett syndrome. \n\nAs previously disclosed, on November 11,2024, Neurogene became aware of an emerging treatment-related serious adverse event (SAE) in a trial participant who received NGN-401 at a dose of 3E15 vg (high-dose cohort). This participant, who was dosed on November 5, subsequently experienced signs of a systemic hyperinflammatory syndrome, a rare and life-threatening immune response that has been reported with systemic exposure to high doses of AAV. Hyperinflammatory syndromes are associated with aberrant cytokine release and include hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and multisystem inflammatory syndrome. The participant is in critical condition, and the case is continuing to evolve. \n\n“We are deeply saddened for the family. While no words could possibly provide comfort to her family, we ask the Rett syndrome community to join us in sending heartfelt thoughts to her family, friends and the dedicated clinicians who are caring for her,” said Rachel McMinn, Ph.D., Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Neurogene. “The safety of the participants in our clinical trial is and remains our foremost priority as we work to find solutions for this devastating disease.” \n\nIn a commitment to full transparency with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Neurogene proactively engaged with the FDA under the START program following the Company’s notification of the SAE. The FDA completed a review of the safety data for NGN-401 and allowed Neurogene to proceed with the Phase 1/2 trial using the 1E15 vg dose (low-dose cohort). Neurogene paused further use of the 3E15 vg dose (high-dose cohorts) upon initial notification of the SAE and does not plan to enroll any further participants at the 3E15 vg dose level. \n\nTo date, there have been no other treatment-related SAEs in the clinical trial, including in the five participants who received the 1E15 vg dose (low-dose cohort) and in the first two participants who received the 3E15 vg dose (high-dose cohort) of NGN-401. All treatment-related AEs in the 1E15 vg cohort (low-dose cohort) have been Grade 1 (mild). Most treatment-related AEs are known potential risks of AAV, have been responsive to steroids, and have resolved or are resolving. There have been no signs or symptoms indicative of MeCP2 overexpression toxicity. In addition, there have been no intracerebroventricular (ICV) procedure-related AEs. \n\nNeurogene no longer anticipates completing enrollment in the 1E15 vg cohort (low-dose cohort) of NGN-401 in the fourth quarter of 2024 as the Company updates the protocol to reflect the discontinuation of the 3E15 vg dose. \n\n**About Neurogene**\n\nThe mission of Neurogene is to treat devastating neurological diseases to improve the lives of patients and families impacted by these rare diseases. Neurogene is developing novel approaches and treatments to address the limitations of conventional gene therapy in central nervous system disorders.

Data were also concordant across multiple scales and show consistency of effect across patients, despite their unique clinical presentations at baseline,” said Rachel McMinn, Ph.D., Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Neurogene. “We are incredibly thankful to the participants, caregivers and Rett syndrome trial sites who are participating in our study.” \n\n“Rett syndrome is a devastating neurodevelopmental disease that is incredibly challenging for patients and their caregivers given there are no treatment options available to address the underlying cause of the disease,” said Aleksandra Jacobs, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Pediatric Neurology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Director of the Center for Rett Syndrome in the Children’s Hospital at Montefiore Medical Center. “The totality of the outcomes shared today with NGN-401 gene therapy have never been seen before in the treatment of Rett syndrome. Notably, these initial participants acquired developmental skills post-treatment during the period in which the natural history of Rett syndrome indicates girls would not. I look forward to the continued progress in this program and additional data to come.” \n\n**Interim Clinical Data as of Data Cut-Off Date of October 17, 2024**\n\n**_Interim Safety Data (N=7)*_**\n\nLow-dose (1E15 vg) and high-dose (3E15 vg) NGN-401 have been well-tolerated with a favorable safety profile in the first seven pediatric participants (N=5 low-dose; N=2 high-dose): \n\n  * No treatment-related serious adverse events (SAEs) \n  * No signs or symptoms indicative of MeCP2 overexpression toxicity \n  * Most treatment-related adverse events (AEs) are known potential risks of adeno-associated virus (AAV), have been responsive to steroids, and are resolved or are resolving \n  * No intracerebroventricular (ICV)-related AEs \n  * No seizures for any participants following NGN-401 treatment \n\n\n\n*Today, Neurogene became aware of an emerging treatment-related SAE consistent with known risks of AAV gene therapy in the third high-dose participant who was recently dosed. \n\n**_Low-Dose Interim Efficacy Data (N=4)_**\n\nThe first four participants (age range 4-7 years old, efficacy assessments at 15, 12, 9, and 3 months post-dosing) in low-dose Cohort 1 showed consistent, concordant and durable improvements across key Rett syndrome assessments: \n\n  * All participants achieved a rating of “much improved,” or a score of 2, on the clinician-rated Clinical Global Impression Scale of Improvement (CGI-I) from baseline; a score of < 3 is considered clinically meaningful \n  * All participants improved in the caregiver-completed Rett Syndrome Behavior Questionnaire (RSBQ), ranging from 28 to 52 percent improvement from baseline \n  * All participants acquired skills and/or developmental milestones in one or more core clinical domains of Rett syndrome - hand function/fine motor, language/communication and ambulation/gross motor \n    * These improvements include complex skills that are rarely learned in this population and skills that are rarely relearned after developmental regression when compared to the NIH-sponsored Rett syndrome natural history \n    * New skills and milestones have increased and deepened over time \n\n\n\n**Initiation of Adolescent/Adult Cohort in NGN-401 Clinical Trial**\n\nNeurogene announced today that it has initiated an adolescent/adult Cohort 3 to gain initial data on the potential of NGN-401 to treat a broader patient population. This cohort is designed to enroll three participants ages 16 and above at the high dose. \n\n**FDA Alignment on CMC Requirements to Initiate Future Registrational Trial and Support Potential Product Launch**\n\nNeurogene also announced today that it has gained alignment with the FDA on its potency assay strategy for NGN-401, which is necessary to have in place prior to initiating a registrational trial. In addition, the FDA is aligned with Neurogene’s manufacturing scale-up plans for NGN-401, which is important to support a future commercial product launch. \n\n**Completed and Upcoming Milestones for the NGN-401 Program**\n\n  * Expect to complete enrollment in the low-dose pediatric Cohort 1 (N=8) in the fourth quarter of 2024 \n  * Plans to provide an update of registrational trial design in the first half of 2025 \n  * Plans to announce additional interim Phase 1/2 clinical data in the second half of 2025 \n\n\n\n**CLN5 Batten Disease Program Update**\n\nNeurogene announced today that the Company does not expect to move forward with the NGN-101 CLN5 Batten disease gene therapy program at this time. Given the rarity of the disease, continued investment in the program was predicated on alignment on a streamlined registrational pathway with FDA. To support a streamlined pathway, Neurogene submitted a Regenerative Medicine Advance Therapy (RMAT) application to the FDA. Despite the Company’s belief that the application met the standard of preliminary clinical evidence required to obtain an RMAT designation, the RMAT application was denied. Neurogene is currently evaluating options for the program. \n\n**Investor/Analyst Webcast Details**\n\nManagement will host a live webcast and conference call today, November 11, 2024, at 4:30 p.m. ET to review the interim data from the NGN-401 clinical trial. Access information is available in the Investor Relations section of Neurogene’s website under Events, where the webcast replay will also be available for a limited time. \n\n**About NGN-401**\n\nNGN-401 is an investigational AAV9 gene therapy being developed as a one-time treatment for Rett syndrome. It is the first clinical candidate to deliver the full-length human _MECP2_ gene under the control of Neurogene’s EXACT™ transgene regulation technology. EXACT technology is an important advancement in gene therapy for Rett syndrome, specifically because the disorder requires a treatment approach that enables targeted levels of _MECP2_ transgene expression without causing overexpression-related toxic effects associated with conventional gene therapy. \n\nNGN-401 was selected by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its START Pilot Program and has also received Regenerative Medicine Advance Therapy (RMAT) designation, orphan drug designation, Fast Track designation and rare pediatric designation from the FDA. Neurogene was previously granted an INTERACT meeting with the FDA regarding the EXACT technology. NGN-401 also received orphan designation and advanced therapy medicinal product designation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the Innovative Licensing and Application Pathway (ILAP) designation from the United Kingdom (UK) Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). \n\n**About Neurogene** The mission of Neurogene is to treat devastating neurological diseases to improve the lives of patients and families impacted by these rare diseases. Neurogene is developing novel approaches and treatments to address the limitations of conventional gene therapy in central nervous system disorders. This includes selecting a delivery approach to maximize distribution to target tissues and designing products to maximize potency and purity for an optimized efficacy and safety profile. The Company’s novel and proprietary EXACT transgene regulation platform technology allows for the delivery of therapeutic levels while limiting transgene toxicity associated with conventional gene therapy. Neurogene has constructed a state-of-the-art gene therapy manufacturing facility in Houston, Texas. CGMP production of NGN-401 was conducted in this facility and will support pivotal clinical development activities.
