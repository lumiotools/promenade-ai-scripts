securities_ _-_\n\nSOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Nov. 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sutro Biopharma, Inc. (Sutro or the Company) (NASDAQ: STRO), a clinical-stage oncology company pioneering site-specific and novel-format antibody drug conjugates (ADCs), today reported its financial results for the third quarter of 2024 and its recent business highlights.\n\nWith its lead program, luveltamab tazevibulin (luvelta), Sutro recently initiated a registrational trial for a rare form of pediatric leukemia, a clinical trial for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and presented expansion data in combination with bevacizumab. The randomized portion of Sutro’s registrational trial for patients with advanced ovarian cancer is underway. Sutro expects to provide an update following alignment with the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) on the selected dose for the pivotal portion of this trial around the end of the year.\n\nRecognizing the potential patient benefit and commercial opportunity for luvelta, Sutro engaged Lazard to assist in its efforts to identify a partner for luvelta who can provide financial resources and expertise for the multi-indication development and commercialization of luvelta.\n\nAdditionally, Sutro showcased at a recent Research Forum a portfolio of emerging next-generation ADCs, made possible by our unique cell-free platform, which are expected to drive value creation beyond luvelta. During the event, Sutro announced three planned IND filings over the next three years for wholly owned programs, including STRO-004, a tissue-factor targeting ADC, featuring a DAR8 exatecan payload and site-specific linker design, which is expected to enter the clinic next year.\n\n**Recent** **Business** **Highlights** **and****Select****Anticipated** **Milestones**\n\n**Luveltamab Tazevibulin (luvelta), FRα-Targeting ADC Franchise:**\n\n  * Sutro presented updated data from the Phase 1b study of luvelta in combination with bevacizumab for patients with ovarian cancer in a poster presentation at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress 2024, demonstrating a 56% response rate at the recommended Phase 2 dose of luvelta (4.3 mg/kg) for this study. An expansion study of this combination is ongoing, with data expected in the first half of 2025.\n  * Part 2 (randomized portion) of the Phase 3 trial, REFRαME-O1, for treatment of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (PROC), is ongoing.\n  * REFRαME-P1, a registration-enabling trial for pediatric patients with CBFA2T3::GLIS2 (CBF/GLIS; RAM phenotype) AML, is underway.\n  * A Phase 2 trial for the treatment of NSCLC is underway, with initial data expected in 2025.\n\n\n\n**Additional Pipeline Development and Collaboration Updates:**\n\n  * In October 2024, Sutro hosted a Research Forum highlighting next-generation ADC innovation and near-term pipeline milestones, including: \n    * STRO-004, a tissue factor-targeting ADC, which features a drug-antibody-ratio (DAR) of eight exatecan payloads and site-specific linker design, demonstrated greater anti-tumor activity and lower toxicities than a tissue factor benchmark ADC in preclinical models. Sutro anticipates filing an IND for STRO-004 in the second half of 2025.\n    * Dual-payload ADCs (ADC2) provide therapeutic benefits compared to standard ADCs, including potential to overcome tumor resistance mechanisms, and show increased anti-tumor activity and desirable properties in preclinical models.\n    * iADCs provide a novel mechanism of action, bridging innate and adaptive immunity to enable broad protection in a single molecule, and show increased and durable anti-tumor activity in a preclinical model compared to standalone ADCs or immune-stimulating antibody conjugates.\n    * Sutro’s proprietary and partnered preclinical ADC portfolio has potential across a broad range of tumor types and the Company plans to deliver three INDs over the next three years.\n  * Sutro continues to seek to maximize the value of its proprietary cell-free platform by working with partners on programs in multiple disease spaces and geographies and has generated from collaborators an aggregate of approximately $975 million in payments through September 30, 2024, including equity investments.\n\n\n\n**Upcoming Events:** Sutro plans to participate in three upcoming investor conferences. Webcasts of the presentations will be accessible through the News & Events page of the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at www.sutrobio.com. Archived replays will be available for at least 30 days after the events.\n\n  * Jefferies London Healthcare Conference, November 19-21, 2024, in London\n  * The Citizens JMP Hematology and Oncology Summit, December 2, 2024, Virtual\n  * Piper Sandler 36th Annual Healthcare Conference, December 3-5, 2024, in New York \n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024** **Financial** **Highlights**\n\n_Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities_ As of September 30, 2024, Sutro had $388.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.\n\n_Realized Gain on Sale of Vaxcyte Common Stock_ Included in non-operating interest and other income (expense), net, on the Statement of Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was a realized gain of $32.1 million from the sale of approximately 0.7 million shares of Vaxcyte common stock, with net proceeds of approximately $74.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, Sutro does not hold any shares of Vaxcyte common stock.\n\n_Revenue_ Revenue was $8.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $16.9 million for the same period in 2023, with the 2024 amount related principally to the Astellas collaboration and the Vaxcyte agreement. Future collaboration and license revenue under existing agreements, and from any additional collaboration and license partners, will fluctuate as a result of the amount and timing of revenue recognition of upfront, milestones, and other agreement payments.\n\n_Operating Expenses_ Total operating expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were $76.4 million, as compared to $60.9 million for the same period in 2023. The 2024 quarter includes non-cash expenses for stock-based compensation of $6.5 million and depreciation and amortization of $1.8 million, as compared to $6.0 million and $1.7 million, respectively, in the comparable 2023 period. Total operating expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were comprised of research and development expenses of $62.1 million and general and administrative expenses of $14.3 million.\n\n**About Sutro Biopharma** Sutro Biopharma, Inc., is a clinical-stage company relentlessly focused on the discovery and development of precisely designed cancer therapeutics, to transform what science can do for patients.

Patients with CBF/GLIS AML\n\nNovember 01, 2024 8:00am EDT  [ Download as PDF

Registration-enabling REFRαME-P1 Trial with Luvelta for Pediatric Patients with CBF/GLIS AML\")\n\nSOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Nov. 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sutro Biopharma, Inc. (Sutro or the Company) (NASDAQ: STRO), a clinical-stage oncology company pioneering site-specific and novel-format antibody drug conjugates (ADCs), today announced that REFRαME-P1, the registration-directed study of luveltamab tazevibulin (luvelta) for pediatric patients with CBFA2T3::GLIS2 (CBF/GLIS; RAM phenotype) acute myeloid leukemia (AML), has been initiated and is open for enrollment.\n\n“We are excited to announce the initiation of our second pivotal trial, the registration-enabling clinical trial of luvelta in infants and toddlers with a rare and aggressive form of leukemia,” said Anne Borgman, M.D., Sutro’s Chief Medical Officer. “We look forward to bringing this promising targeted therapy to a pediatric patient group with limited effective treatment options.”\n\n“Beginning this trial is an important next step in the clinical development pathway for luvelta, as it has the opportunity to address the unmet in many types of cancer that express Folate Receptor-α (FRα) beyond ovarian,” said Soheil Meshinchi, M.D., Ph.D. “With my focus on the biology of AML, I am honored to have been a part of making this medicine available to patients in dire need via a compassionate use mechanism sponsored by Sutro, through which we have seen encouraging results in this devastating disease.”\n\nIn December 2023, Dr. Meshinchi presented data on anti-leukemic activity from the compassionate use of luvelta in 25 pediatric patients with relapsed/refractory CBFA2T3-GLIS2 (CBF/GLIS) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and Exposition. Data demonstrated that treatment with luvelta produced meaningful clinical responses, including complete remission in 42% of patients with ≥5% blasts, and prolonged overall survival, enabling some patients to receive hematopoietic stem cell transplant, a potentially curative therapy.\n\nCBF/GLIS subtype AML is a rare and highly lethal form of leukemia found exclusively in infants and young children, with the average age of onset at 18 months1. There are no therapies specifically approved to target this form of leukemia and it is resistant to conventional chemotherapy, with an induction failure rate of over 80%2. Due to a lack of effective treatment, children diagnosed with the disease have a dismal two-year survival rate3. Recent studies have shown that FOLR1, which encodes for FRα, is silent in normal hematopoiesis, but is uniquely induced by the CBF/GLIS gene fusion4.\n\nREFRaME-P1 is a registration-enabling study evaluating the efficacy and safety of luvelta in infants and children under 12 years of age with CBF/GLIS AML. This will be a global study, with the majority of sites planned to be open by the end of the year.\n\n*1: National Institutes of Health [NIH], 2022; Quessada et al 2021; Masseti et al 2019*2: Smith JL, et al.

(Sutro or the Company) (NASDAQ: STRO), a clinical-stage oncology company pioneering site-specific and novel-format antibody drug conjugates (ADCs), today reported its financial results for the third quarter of 2024 and its recent business highlights.\n\nWith its lead program, luveltamab tazevibulin (luvelta), Sutro recently initiated a registrational trial for a rare form of pediatric leukemia, a clinical trial for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and presented expansion data in combination with bevacizumab. The randomized portion of Sutro’s registrational trial for patients with advanced ovarian cancer is underway. Sutro expects to provide an update following alignment with the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) on the selected dose for the pivotal portion of this trial around the end of the year.\n\nRecognizing the potential patient benefit and commercial opportunity for luvelta, Sutro engaged Lazard to assist in its efforts to identify a partner for luvelta who can provide financial resources and expertise for the multi-indication development and commercialization of luvelta.\n\nAdditionally, Sutro showcased at a recent Research Forum a portfolio of emerging next-generation ADCs, made possible by our unique cell-free platform, which are expected to drive value creation beyond luvelta. During the event, Sutro announced three planned IND filings over the next three years for wholly owned programs, including STRO-004, a tissue-factor targeting ADC, featuring a DAR8 exatecan payload and site-specific linker design, which is expected to enter the clinic next year.\n\n**Recent** **Business** **Highlights** **and****Select****Anticipated** **Milestones**\n\n**Luveltamab Tazevibulin (luvelta), FRα-Targeting ADC Franchise:**\n\n  * Sutro presented updated data from the Phase 1b study of luvelta in combination with bevacizumab for patients with ovarian cancer in a poster presentation at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress 2024, demonstrating a 56% response rate at the recommended Phase 2 dose of luvelta (4.3 mg/kg) for this study. An expansion study of this combination is ongoing, with data expected in the first half of 2025.\n  * Part 2 (randomized portion) of the Phase 3 trial, REFRαME-O1, for treatment of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (PROC), is ongoing.\n  * REFRαME-P1, a registration-enabling trial for pediatric patients with CBFA2T3::GLIS2 (CBF/GLIS; RAM phenotype) AML, is underway.\n  * A Phase 2 trial for the treatment of NSCLC is underway, with initial data expected in 2025.\n\n\n\n**Additional Pipeline Development and Collaboration Updates:**\n\n  * In October 2024, Sutro hosted a Research Forum highlighting next-generation ADC innovation and near-term pipeline milestones, including: \n    * STRO-004, a tissue factor-targeting ADC, which features a drug-antibody-ratio (DAR) of eight exatecan payloads and site-specific linker design, demonstrated greater anti-tumor activity and lower toxicities than a tissue factor benchmark ADC in preclinical models. Sutro anticipates filing an IND for STRO-004 in the second half of 2025.\n    * Dual-payload ADCs (ADC2) provide therapeutic benefits compared to standard ADCs, including potential to overcome tumor resistance mechanisms, and show increased anti-tumor activity and desirable properties in preclinical models.\n    * iADCs provide a novel mechanism of action, bridging innate and adaptive immunity to enable broad protection in a single molecule, and show increased and durable anti-tumor activity in a preclinical model compared to standalone ADCs or immune-stimulating antibody conjugates.\n    * Sutro’s proprietary and partnered preclinical ADC portfolio has potential across a broad range of tumor types and the Company plans to deliver three INDs over the next three years.\n  * Sutro continues to seek to maximize the value of its proprietary cell-free platform by working with partners on programs in multiple disease spaces and geographies and has generated from collaborators an aggregate of approximately $975 million in payments through September 30, 2024, including equity investments.\n\n\n\n**Upcoming Events:** Sutro plans to participate in three upcoming investor conferences. Webcasts of the presentations will be accessible through the News & Events page of the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at www.sutrobio.com. Archived replays will be available for at least 30 days after the events.\n\n  * Jefferies London Healthcare Conference, November 19-21, 2024, in London\n  * The Citizens JMP Hematology and Oncology Summit, December 2, 2024, Virtual\n  * Piper Sandler 36th Annual Healthcare Conference, December 3-5, 2024, in New York \n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024** **Financial** **Highlights**\n\n_Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities_ As of September 30, 2024, Sutro had $388.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.\n\n_Realized Gain on Sale of Vaxcyte Common Stock_ Included in non-operating interest and other income (expense), net, on the Statement of Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was a realized gain of $32.1 million from the sale of approximately 0.7 million shares of Vaxcyte common stock, with net proceeds of approximately $74.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, Sutro does not hold any shares of Vaxcyte common stock.\n\n_Revenue_ Revenue was $8.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $16.9 million for the same period in 2023, with the 2024 amount related principally to the Astellas collaboration and the Vaxcyte agreement. Future collaboration and license revenue under existing agreements, and from any additional collaboration and license partners, will fluctuate as a result of the amount and timing of revenue recognition of upfront, milestones, and other agreement payments.\n\n_Operating Expenses_ Total operating expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were $76.4 million, as compared to $60.9 million for the same period in 2023. The 2024 quarter includes non-cash expenses for stock-based compensation of $6.5 million and depreciation and amortization of $1.8 million, as compared to $6.0 million and $1.7 million, respectively, in the comparable 2023 period. Total operating expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were comprised of research and development expenses of $62.1 million and general and administrative expenses of $14.3 million.\n\n**About Sutro Biopharma** Sutro Biopharma, Inc., is a clinical-stage company relentlessly focused on the discovery and development of precisely designed cancer therapeutics, to transform what science can do for patients.

(Sutro or the Company) (NASDAQ: STRO), a clinical-stage oncology company\npioneering site-specific and novel-format antibody drug conjugates (ADCs), today reported\nits financial results for the third quarter of 2024 and its recent business highlights.\nWith its lead program, luveltamab tazevibulin (luvelta), Sutro recently initiated a registrational\ntrial for a rare form of pediatric leukemia, a clinical trial for non-small cell lung cancer\n(NSCLC), and presented expansion data in combination with bevacizumab. The randomized\nportion of Sutro’s registrational trial for patients with advanced ovarian cancer is underway.\nSutro expects to provide an update following alignment with the U.S. Food & Drug\nAdministration (FDA) on the selected dose for the pivotal portion of this trial around the end\nof the year.\nRecognizing the potential patient benefit and commercial opportunity for luvelta, Sutro\nengaged Lazard to assist in its efforts to identify a partner for luvelta who can provide\nfinancial resources and expertise for the multi-indication development and commercialization\nof luvelta.\nAdditionally, Sutro showcased at a recent Research Forum a portfolio of emerging next-\ngeneration ADCs, made possible by our unique cell-free platform, which are expected to\ndrive value creation beyond luvelta. During the event, Sutro announced three planned IND\nfilings over the next three years for wholly owned programs, including STRO-004, a tissue-\nfactor targeting ADC, featuring a DAR8 exatecan payload and site-specific linker design,\nwhich is expected to enter the clinic next year.\nRecent Business Highlights and Select Anticipated Milestones\nLuveltamab Tazevibulin (luvelta), FRα-Targeting ADC Franchise:\nSutro presented updated data from the Phase 1b study of luvelta in combination with\nbevacizumab for patients with ovarian cancer in a poster presentation at the European\nSociety for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress 2024, demonstrating a 56% response\nrate at the recommended Phase 2 dose of luvelta (4.3 mg/kg) for this study. An\nexpansion study of this combination is ongoing, with data expected in the first half of\n2025.\nPart 2 (randomized portion) of the Phase 3 trial, REFRαME-O1, for treatment of\nplatinum-resistant ovarian cancer (PROC), is ongoing.\nREFRαME-P1, a registration-enabling trial for pediatric patients with CBFA2T3::GLIS2\n(CBF/GLIS; RAM phenotype) AML, is underway.\nA Phase 2 trial for the treatment of NSCLC is underway, with initial data expected in\n2025.\nAdditional Pipeline Development and Collaboration Updates:\nIn October 2024, Sutro hosted a Research Forum highlighting next-generation ADC\ninnovation and near-term pipeline milestones, including:\nSTRO-004, a tissue factor-targeting ADC, which features a drug-antibody-ratio\n(DAR) of eight exatecan payloads and site-specific linker design, demonstrated\ngreater anti-tumor activity and lower toxicities than a tissue factor benchmark\nADC in preclinical models. Sutro anticipates filing an IND for STRO-004 in the\nsecond half of 2025.\nDual-payload ADCs (ADC2) provide therapeutic benefits compared to standard\nADCs, including potential to overcome tumor resistance mechanisms, and show\nincreased anti-tumor activity and desirable properties in preclinical models.\niADCs provide a novel mechanism of action, bridging innate and adaptive\nimmunity to enable broad protection in a single molecule, and show increased\nand durable anti-tumor activity in a preclinical model compared to standalone\nADCs or immune-stimulating antibody conjugates.\nSutro’s proprietary and partnered preclinical ADC portfolio has potential across a\nbroad range of tumor types and the Company plans to deliver three INDs over\nthe next three years.\nSutro continues to seek to maximize the value of its proprietary cell-free platform by\nworking with partners on programs in multiple disease spaces and geographies and\nhas generated from collaborators an aggregate of approximately $975 million in\npayments through September 30, 2024, including equity investments.\nUpcoming Events: Sutro plans to participate in three upcoming investor conferences.\nWebcasts of the presentations will be accessible through the News & Events page of the\nInvestor Relations section of the Company’s website at www.sutrobio.com. Archived replays\nwill be available for at least 30 days after the events.\nJefferies London Healthcare Conference, November 19-21, 2024, in London\nThe Citizens JMP Hematology and Oncology Summit, December 2, 2024, Virtual\nPiper Sandler 36th Annual Healthcare Conference, December 3-5, 2024, in New York\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nAs of September 30, 2024, Sutro had $388.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and\nmarketable securities.\nRealized Gain on Sale of Vaxcyte Common Stock\nIncluded in non-operating interest and other income (expense), net, on the Statement of\nOperations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was a realized gain of $32.1\nmillion from the sale of approximately 0.7 million shares of Vaxcyte common stock, with net\nproceeds of approximately $74.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, Sutro does not hold any\nshares of Vaxcyte common stock.\nRevenue\nRevenue was $8.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $16.9\nmillion for the same period in 2023, with the 2024 amount related principally to the Astellas\ncollaboration and the Vaxcyte agreement. Future collaboration and license revenue under\nexisting agreements, and from any additional collaboration and license partners, will\nfluctuate as a result of the amount and timing of revenue recognition of upfront, milestones,\nand other agreement payments.\nOperating Expenses\nTotal operating expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were $76.4 million, as\ncompared to $60.9 million for the same period in 2023.

Organization and Principal Activities\n\nDescription of Business\n\nSutro Biopharma, Inc. (the “Company”), is a clinical-stage oncology company developing site-specific and novel-format antibody drug conjugates, or ADCs. The Company was incorporated on April 21, 2003, and is headquartered in South San Francisco, California.\n\nThe Company operates and manages its business as one operating segment. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer reviews financial information on an aggregate basis for the purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance.\n\nAll the Company’s long-lived assets are maintained in the United States.\n\nLiquidity\n\nThe Company has incurred significant losses and has negative cash flows from operations. As of September 30, 2024, there was an accumulated deficit of $714.4 million. Management expects to continue to incur additional substantial losses in the foreseeable future as a result of the Company’s research and development and other operational activities.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $388.3 million which are available to fund future operations. The Company will need to raise additional capital to support the completion of its research and development activities and to support its operations.\n\nThe Company believes that its unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024 will enable the Company to maintain its operations for a period of at least 12 months following the filing date of its condensed financial statements.\n\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nBasis of Presentation and Use of Estimates\n\nThe accompanying interim condensed financial statements of the Company are unaudited. These interim condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. The December 31, 2023 condensed balance sheet was derived from the audited financial statements as of that date but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and market-specific or other relevant assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the Company’s condensed Balance Sheets and the amounts of expenses and income reported for each of the periods presented are affected by estimates and assumptions, which are used for, but are not limited to, determining research and development periods under collaboration arrangements, stock-based compensation expense, impairment of long-lived assets, income taxes, deferred royalty obligation related to the sale of future royalties and related non-cash interest expense, and certain accrued liabilities. Actual results could differ from such estimates or assumptions.\n\n7\n\nThe accompanying unaudited interim condensed financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the audited financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature considered necessary to state fairly the Company’s financial position, results of operations, comprehensive loss, and cash flows for the interim periods. The interim results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024, or for any other future annual or interim period.\n\nThe information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\n\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (“ASU 2023-07”), which requires all public entities, including public entities with a single reportable segment, to provide in interim and annual periods one or more measures of segment profit or loss used by the chief operating decision maker to allocate resources and assess performance. Additionally, the standard requires disclosures of significant segment expenses and other segment items as well as incremental qualitative disclosures. The guidance in this update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods after December 15, 2024. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the effects of this pronouncement on its related disclosures.\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures(“ASU 2023-09”). This new guidance is designed to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The amendments of this update are related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting standard will have on its financial statements.\n\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported within the Company's condensed Balance Sheets that sum to the total of the same amounts shown in the Company's condensed Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nSeptember 30,  \n---  \n2024 | 2023  \n(in thousands)  \nCash and cash equivalents | $ | 174,579 | $ | 81,834  \nRestricted cash | 857 | 872  \nTotal cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash shown in the condensed Statements of Cash Flows | $ | 175,436 | $ | 82,706  \n  \nInvestments in Equity Securities\n\nVaxcyte common stock held by the Company is measured at fair value at each reporting period based on the closing price of Vaxcyte’s common stock on the last trading day of each reporting period, with any realized or unrealized gains and losses recorded in the Company’s condensed Statements of Operations.\n\n8\n\nFair Value Measurements\n\nFair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability, or an exit price, in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date and establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available, and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The Company determined the fair value of financial assets and liabilities using the fair value hierarchy that describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value, as follows:\n\nLevel 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities;\n\nLevel 2—Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; and\n\nLevel 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\n\nThe carrying amounts of accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and accrued compensation and benefits approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these items.\n\nThe carrying value of the deferred royalty obligation related to the sale of future royalties under the 2015 License Agreement with Vaxcyte approximates its fair value as of September 30, 2024, and is based on our current estimates of future royalties expected to be earned over the estimated life of the royalty term arrangement.

Deferred Royalty Obligation Related to the Sale of Future Royalties for a description of the Level 3 inputs used to estimate the fair value of the liability.\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nWhen the Company enters into collaboration agreements, it assesses whether the arrangements fall within the scope of ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements (\"ASC 808\") based on whether the arrangements involve joint operating activities and whether both parties have active participation in the arrangement and are exposed to significant risks and rewards. To the extent that the arrangement falls within the scope of ASC 808, the Company assesses whether the payments between the Company and its collaboration partner fall within the scope of other accounting literature. If it concludes that payments from the collaboration partner to the Company represent consideration from a customer, such as license fees and contract research and development activities, the Company accounts for those payments within the scope of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09 (Topic 606), Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”).\n\nUnder ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of ASC 606, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies a performance obligation. However, if the Company concludes that its collaboration partner is not a customer for certain activities and associated payments, such as for certain collaborative research, development, manufacturing and commercial activities, the Company presents such payments as a reduction of research and development expense or general and administrative expense, based on where the Company presents the underlying expense.\n\nThe Company has no products approved for commercial sale and has not generated any revenue from commercial product sales. The total revenue to date has been generated principally from collaboration and license agreements and to a lesser extent, from manufacturing, supply and services, and materials the Company provides to its collaboration partners.\n\nCollaboration Revenue: The Company derives revenue from collaboration arrangements, under which the Company may grant licenses to its collaboration partners to further develop and commercialize its proprietary product candidates. The Company may also perform research and development activities under the collaboration agreements. Consideration under these contracts generally includes a nonrefundable upfront payment, development, regulatory and commercial milestones and other contingent payments, and royalties based on net sales of approved products. Additionally, the\n\n9\n\ncollaborations may provide options for the customer to acquire from the Company materials and reagents, clinical product supply or additional research and development services under separate agreements.\n\nThe Company assesses which activities in the collaboration agreements are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately. The Company develops assumptions that require judgement to determine whether the license to the Company’s intellectual property is distinct from the research and development services or participation in activities under the collaboration agreements.\n\nAt the inception of each agreement, the Company determines the arrangement transaction price, which includes variable consideration, based on the assessment of the probability of achievement of future milestones and contingent payments and other potential consideration. The Company recognizes revenue over time by measuring its progress towards the complete satisfaction of the relevant performance obligation using an appropriate input or output method based on the nature of the service promised to the customer.\n\nFor arrangements that include multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price to the identified performance obligations based on the standalone selling price (\"SSP\"), of each distinct performance obligation. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, the Company develops assumptions that require judgment to determine the SSP for each performance obligation identified in the contract. These key assumptions may include full-time equivalent (\"FTE\"), personnel effort, estimated costs, discount rates and probabilities of clinical development and regulatory success.\n\nUpfront Payments: For collaboration arrangements that include a nonrefundable upfront payment, if the license fee and research and development services cannot be accounted for as separate performance obligations, the transaction price is deferred and recognized as revenue over the expected period of performance using a cost-based input methodology. The Company uses judgement to assess the pattern of delivery of the performance obligation. In addition, amounts paid in advance of services being rendered may result in an associated financing component to the upfront payment. Accordingly, the interest on such borrowing cost component will be recorded as interest expense and revenue, based on an appropriate borrowing rate applied to the value of services to be performed by the Company over the estimated service performance period.\n\nLicense Grants: For collaboration arrangements that include a grant of a license to the Company’s intellectual property, the Company considers whether the license grant is distinct from the other performance obligations included in the arrangement. For licenses that are distinct, the Company recognizes revenues from nonrefundable, upfront payments and other consideration allocated to the license when the license term has begun and the Company has provided all necessary information regarding the underlying intellectual property to the customer, which generally occurs at or near the inception of the arrangement.\n\nMilestone and Contingent Payments: At the inception of the arrangement and at each reporting date thereafter, the Company assesses whether it should include any milestone and contingent payments or other forms of variable consideration in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue would not occur upon resolution of the uncertainty, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, the Company re-evaluates the probability of achievement of each milestone and any related constraint and, if necessary, adjusts its estimate of the overall transaction price. Since milestone and contingent payments may become payable to the Company upon the initiation of a clinical study or filing for or receipt of regulatory approval, the Company reviews the relevant facts and circumstances to determine when the Company should update the transaction price, which may occur before the triggering event. When the Company updates the transaction price for milestone and contingent payments, the Company allocates the changes in the total transaction price to each performance obligation in the agreement on the same basis as the initial allocation. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period of adjustment, which may result in recognizing revenue for previously satisfied performance obligations in such period. The Company’s collaborators generally pay milestones and contingent payments subsequent to achievement of the triggering event.\n\nResearch and Development Services: For amounts allocated to the Company’s research and development obligations in a collaboration arrangement, the Company recognizes revenue over time using a cost-based input methodology, representing the transfer of goods or services as activities are performed over the term of the agreement.\n\nMaterials Supply: The Company provides materials and reagents, clinical materials, and services to certain of its collaborators under separate agreements. The consideration for such services is generally based on FTE personnel effort used to manufacture those materials, reimbursed at an agreed upon rate in addition to agreed-upon pricing for the provided materials. The amounts billed are recognized as revenue as the performance obligations are met by the Company.\n\n10\n\nRevenue subject to governmental withholding taxes is recognized on a gross basis with the withholding taxes recorded as a component of income tax expense.\n\n3. Fair Value Measurements\n\nThe following table sets forth the fair value of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis by level within the fair value hierarchy:\n\nSeptember 30, 2024  \n---  \nTotal | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3  \n(in thousands)  \nAssets:  \nMoney market funds | $ | 60,363 | $ | 60,363 | $ | - | $ | -  \nCommercial paper | 76,720 | - | 76,720 | -  \nCorporate debt securities | 53,633 | - | 53,633 | -  \nAsset-backed securities | 58,161 | - | 58,161 | -  \nU.S. government securities | 134,237 | 134,237 | - | -  \nU.S. agency securities | 4,977 | - | 4,977 | -  \nTotal | $ | 388,091 | $ | 194,600 | $ | 193,491 | $ | -  \nDecember 31, 2023  \n---  \nTotal | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3  \n(in thousands)  \nAssets:  \nMoney market funds | $ | 56,397 | $ | 56,397 | $ | - | $ | -  \nCommercial paper | 82,152 | - | 82,152 | -  \nCorporate debt securities | 61,894 | - | 61,894 | -  \nEquity securities | 41,937 | 41,937 | - | -  \nAsset-backed securities | 10,505 | - | 10,505 | -  \nU.S. government securities | 113,652 | 113,652 | - | -  \nU.S. agency securities | 4,961 | - | 4,961 | -  \nTotal | $ | 371,498 | $ | 211,986 | $ | 159,512 | $ | -  \n  \nWhere applicable, the Company uses quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets to determine fair value. This pricing methodology applies to Level 1 investments, which are comprised of money market funds and U.S. government securities.\n\nIf quoted prices in active markets for identical assets are not available, then the Company uses quoted prices for similar assets or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, either directly or indirectly. These investments are included in Level 2 and consist of commercial paper, corporate debt securities, asset-backed securities, and U.S. agency securities. These assets are valued using market prices when available, adjusting for accretion of the purchase price to face value at maturity.\n\nA financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires management to make judgments and consider factors specific to the asset or liability.\n\nIn certain cases where there is limited activity or less transparency around inputs to valuation, securities are classified as Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the deferred royalty obligation related to the sale of future Vaxcyte royalties was classified as Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy. Refer to Note 8 below for information relating to the Purchase Agreement between the Company and Blackstone, pursuant to which the Company sold to Blackstone its 4% royalty, or revenue interest, in potential future net sales of Vaxcyte’s pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, or PCV, products, including VAX-24 and VAX-31.\n\n11\n\nInvestment in Equity Securities\n\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold 667,780 shares of Vaxcyte common stock it held at their fair market value of approximately $74.0 million, net of transaction costs.\n\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized a gain of $23.7 million and $32.1 million on the Vaxcyte common stock sold, respectively, which is recorded under interest and other income (expense), net, in the Statements of Operations. No shares of Vaxcyte common stock were sold during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company did not hold any shares of Vaxcyte common stock. As of December 31, 2023, the Company held 667,780 shares of Vaxcyte common stock with an estimated fair value of $41.9 million.\n\n4. Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\n\nCash equivalents and marketable securities consisted of the following:\n\nSeptember 30, 2024  \n---  \nAmortizedCost Basis | UnrealizedGains | UnrealizedLosses | FairValue  \n(in thousands)  \nMoney market funds | $ | 60,363 | $ | - | $ | - | $ | 60,363  \nCommercial paper | 76,713 | 13 | (6 | ) | 76,720  \nCorporate debt securities | 53,617 | 16 | - | 53,633  \nAsset-based securities | 58,146 | 16 | (1 | ) | 58,161  \nU.S. government securities | 134,171 | 66 | - | 134,237  \nU.S. agency securities | 4,975 | 2 | - | 4,977  \nTotal | 387,985 | 113 | (7 | ) | 388,091  \nLess amounts classified as cash equivalents | (174,406 | ) | (16 | ) | 6 | (174,416 | )  \nTotal marketable securities | $ | 213,579 | $ | 97 | $ | (1 | ) | $ | 213,675  \nDecember 31, 2023  \n---  \nAmortizedCost Basis | UnrealizedGains | UnrealizedLosses | FairValue  \n(in thousands)  \nMoney market funds | $ | 56,397 | $ | - | $ | - | $ | 56,397  \nCommercial paper | 82,179 | 1 | (28 | ) | 82,152  \nCorporate debt securities | 61,887 | 12 | (5 | ) | 61,894  \nAsset-based securities | 10,505 | - | – | 10,505  \nU.S. government securities | 113,612 | 40 | – | 113,652  \nU.S. agency securities | 4,960 | 1 | – | 4,961  \nTotal | 329,540 | 54 | (33 | ) | 329,561  \nLess amounts classified as cash equivalents | (65,144 | ) | (4 | ) | - | (65,148 | )  \nTotal marketable securities | $ | 264,396 | $ | 50 | $ | (33 | ) | $ | 264,413  \n  \nNo marketable securities had maturities of more than one year as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n\nThere were $56.7 million and $110.9 million of investments in an unrealized loss position of $7,000 and $33,000 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, the Company did not record any other-than-temporary impairment charges on its available-for-sale securities. Based on the Company’s procedures under the expected credit loss model, including an assessment of unrealized losses on the portfolio after September 30, 2024, and 2023, the Company concluded that the unrealized losses for its marketable securities were not attributable to credit and therefore an allowance for credit losses for these securities has not been recorded as of September 30, 2024. Also, based on the scheduled maturities of the investments, the Company was more likely than not to hold these investments for a period of time sufficient for a recovery of the Company’s cost basis.\n\nThe Company recognized no material gains or losses on its cash equivalents and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and as a result, the Company did not reclassify any amounts out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the period then ended.\n\n12\n\n5. Collaboration and License Agreements and Supply Agreements\n\nThe Company has entered into collaboration and license agreements and supply agreements with various pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. See “Note 5. Collaboration and License Agreements and Supply Agreements” to the Company’s financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, or as further described below, for additional information on each of its collaboration agreements.\n\nThe Company’s accounts receivable balances may contain billed and unbilled amounts from upfront payments, milestones and other contingent payments, as well as reimbursable costs from collaboration and license agreements and supply agreements. The Company performs a regular review of its customers’ credit risk and payment histories, including payments made after the period end. Historically, the Company has not experienced credit loss from its accounts receivable and, therefore, has not recorded a reserve for estimated credit losses as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n\nIn accordance with the collaboration, license and supply agreements, the Company recognized revenue as follows:\n\nThree Months Ended | Nine Months Ended  \n---|---  \nSeptember 30, | September 30,  \n2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \n(in thousands) | (in thousands)  \nAstellas Pharma Inc.

(\"Vaxcyte\") | 656 | 1,592 | 2,149 | 2,970  \nIpsen Pharma SAS (“Ipsen”) | 166 | - | 261 | -  \nMerck Sharp & Dohme Corporation (“Merck”) | 5 | 83 | 19 | 2,776  \nBristol Myers Squibb Company (“BMS”) | - | 189 | - | 5,591  \nMerck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany (operating in the United States and Canada under the name “EMD Serono”) | - | - | - | 8  \nTotal revenue | $ | 8,520 | $ | 16,924 | $ | 47,234 | $ | 40,010  \n  \nThe following table presents the changes in the Company’s deferred revenue balance from the agreements during the nine months ended September 30, 2024:\n\nNine Months Ended  \n---  \nSeptember 30, 2024  \n(in thousands)  \nDeferred revenue—December 31, 2023 | $ | 74,045  \nAdditions to deferred revenue | 50,429  \nRecognition of revenue in current period | (33,915 | )  \nDeferred revenue—September 30, 2024 | $ | 90,559  \n  \nThe Company’s balance of deferred revenue contains upfront and contingent payments for obligations from our agreements which remain partially unsatisfied. The Company expects to recognize approximately $72.6 million of the deferred revenue over the next twelve months.\n\nAstellas License and Collaboration Agreement\n\nIn June 2022, the Company entered into a License and Collaboration Agreement (the “Astellas Agreement”) with Astellas for the development of immunostimulatory antibody-drug conjugates for up to three biological targets, to be identified by Astellas. The Company will conduct research and pre-clinical development of any compound (as designated by Astellas) in each of the three programs in accordance with the terms of a research plan between the Company and Astellas. Astellas will have an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize any such designated compound, subject to the Company’s rights to participate in cost and profit sharing in the United States, as described below.\n\nPursuant to the Astellas Agreement, the Company received from Astellas a one-time, nonrefundable, non-creditable, upfront payment of $90.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. Under ASC 808 and ASC 606, the Company determined that both parties are active participants in the activities and are exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the success of the development program, and identified four performance obligations under the Astellas Agreement as: (1) performance of services related to the first target program; (2) performance of services related to the second target program; (3) performance of services related to the third target program; and (4) the Company’s estimated future services on the collaboration JSC. The transaction price of $90.0 million was allocated among the performance\n\n13\n\nobligations using the Company’s best estimate of the standalone selling price, or SSP, for each of the associated performance obligations. Revenue allocated to the three target programs, which totaled $89.1 million, was being recognized on a proportional performance basis, using FTE cost as the basis of measurement, with such performance expected to occur over an estimated service period of four years for each target program. For the JSC performance obligation, revenue allocated to such performance obligation was $0.9 million, and was being recognized on a proportional performance basis using FTE cost as the basis of measurement, and such effort is expected to be incurred on a relatively consistent basis throughout the term of the Astellas Agreement.\n\nAdditionally, under ASC 606, the Company determined a financing component associated with the $90.0 million upfront payment and has calculated $25.0 million as of September 30, 2024, on the unearned revenue portion beyond one year from the effective date of the agreement, which amount is being recognized as interest expense and revenue over the estimated service period for the target programs.\n\nThe Company is also eligible to receive up to $422.5 million in development, regulatory and commercial milestones for each product candidate, and tiered royalties ranging from low double-digit to mid-teen percentages on worldwide sales of any commercial products that may result from the collaboration, subject to customary deductions under certain circumstances. The Company can also elect to convert any product candidate into a cost and profit-sharing arrangement, for the United States only. In the event the Company makes such election, it will share commercialization costs and profits relating to such product candidate equally with Astellas in the United States, and no royalties will be due from Astellas for net sales of such product candidates in the United States.\n\nIn June 2024, Astellas notified the Company that it would not be nominating a third target program. This decision was based on Astellas' strategic portfolio considerations. Pursuant to ASC 606, Astellas' decision to not elect a third target program is a change in the scope of the original contract and thus represents a contract modification. At the date of the modification, the Company determined that the remaining research and development activities related to the first target program and the second target program to be undertaken by the Company after the notice of termination were not distinct from the related activities performed on each target prior to the modification. Accordingly, after re-allocation of the updated transaction price, the Company updated the cost-based input measure of progress for the remaining performance obligations and recorded a cumulative catch-up adjustment to revenue of $17.8 million on the modification date relating to the ongoing unsatisfied performance obligations. For the JSC performance obligation, as the remaining services were determined to be distinct from those already provided, the Company determined that the contract modification should be treated as a termination of the existing contract and the creation of a new contract, to be accounted for prospectively.\n\nRevenues under the Astellas Agreement were as follows:\n\nThree Months Ended | Nine Months Ended  \n---|---  \nSeptember 30, | September 30,  \n2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \n(in thousands) | (in thousands)  \nOngoing performance related to unsatisfied performance obligations | $ | 5,095 | $ | 5,612 | $ | 33,915 | $ | 11,423  \nResearch and development services | 1,274 | 1,920 | 4,278 | 4,639  \nFinancing component on unearned revenue | 1,268 | 2,456 | 5,186 | 7,531  \nMaterials supply | 24 | - | 419 | -  \nTotal revenue | $ | 7,661 | $ | 9,988 | $ | 43,798 | $ | 23,593  \n  \nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was $35.1 millionand $69.0 million of deferred revenue, respectively, related to the upfront payment received by the Company under the Astellas Agreement.\n\nCollaboration with Tasly\n\nTasly License Agreement\n\nIn December 2021, the Company entered into a license agreement with Tasly to grant Tasly an exclusive license to develop and commercialize STRO-002, or luveltamab tazevibulin, or luvelta, in Greater China (the “Tasly License Agreement”). Tasly will pursue the clinical development, regulatory approval, and commercialization of luvelta in multiple indications, including ovarian cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, and other indications in\n\n14\n\nGreater China. The Company will retain development and commercial rights of luvelta globally outside of Greater China, including the United States.\n\nThe Company determined that the Tasly License Agreement falls within the scope of ASC 808, as both parties are active participants in the activities and are exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the success of the commercialization of indications for luvelta in Greater China. The Company concluded that the Tasly License Agreement contained the following units of account: i) licensed know-how and Sutro patents, license to trademark rights, and initial regulatory data and information necessary to prepare an IND; and ii) collaboration governance and information sharing activities, such as JSC participation and ongoing regulatory and pharmacovigilance support.\n\nThe promises related to the licensed know-how and Sutro patents, license to trademark rights, and initial regulatory data and information necessary to prepare an IND are considered to be interdependent and not distinct from each other, representing a combined output. The Company determined that these promises are capable of being distinct from the collaboration governance and information sharing activities discussed below and further determined that this unit of account is a vendor-customer relationship and accounted for it in accordance with ASC 606. All potential future milestones and other payments were considered constrained at the inception of the Tasly License Agreement since the Company could not conclude it was probable that a significant reversal in the amount of revenue recognized would not occur. Since there is only one performance obligation accounted for under ASC 606, no allocation of the transaction price was necessary.\n\nThe Company determined that the unit of account consisting of collaboration governance and information sharing activities, such as JSC participation and ongoing regulatory and pharmacovigilance support, do not represent a customer-vendor relationship between the Company and Tasly. These promises are considered to be interdependent and not distinct from each other, representing a combined output. However, the Company determined that these promises are capable of being distinct from the intellectual property and data license promises discussed above. As such, based on the nature of the agreement and collaborative activities, the Company determined that the costs associated with these governance and information sharing activities performed under the agreement will be included in research and development expenses in the Statements of Operations, with any reimbursement of costs by Tasly reflected as a reduction of such expenses. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, the Company did not recognize any material reduction of research and development expenses under the Tasly License Agreement.\n\nIn April 2022, the Company entered into amendment No. 1 (the “Tasly Amendment”) to the Tasly License Agreement with Tasly. Pursuant to the Tasly Amendment, the initial nonrefundable upfront payment due by Tasly was amended to $25.0 million, and a $15.0 million payment will become payable to the Company upon the achievement of certain regulatory milestones. The Tasly Amendment also added an additional regulatory milestone payment to the Tasly License Agreement, providing additional potential payments totaling up to $350.0 million related to development, regulatory and commercialization milestones, beyond the payments described above, and made certain other ministerial edits.\n\nDuring 2023, the Company recognized a $5.0 million contingentpayment as revenue, net of withholding tax, after Tasly received its first IND clearance by National Medical Products Administration, or NMPA, in Greater China. The withholding tax of $0.5 million was recorded as an income tax charge related to the contingent payment.\n\nDuring 2023, the Company also recorded a $5.0 million contingent payment, received by the Company from Tasly related to the first patient dosed in the Company’s REFRaME-O1 trial for luvelta, as deferred revenue, net of withholding tax of $0.5 million. The REFRaME-O1 study consists of two parts, Part I being the dose-finding portion and Part II being the portion of the study that will focus on the selected dose from Part I, and is intended to generate data to enable the potential registration of luvelta. Although it currently intends to conduct the REFRaME-O1 study to completion, the Company has the sole discretion to terminate the REFRaME-O1 study at any time. Given the above, the contingent payment received by the Company was considered constrained for accounting purposes during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, since the Company could not conclude it was probable that a significant reversal in the amount of revenue recognized would not occur. The withholding tax was recorded by the Company as a tax charge related to the received contingent payment.\n\n2023 Tasly Supply Agreement\n\nIn June 2023, the Company entered into a Master Development and Clinical Supply Agreement (the “2023 Tasly Supply Agreement”) with Tasly, wherein Tasly requested the Company to provide development, manufacturing and supply chain management services, including clinical product supply.\n\n15\n\nRevenues under the Tasly agreements were as follows:\n\nThree Months Ended | Nine Months Ended  \n---|---  \nSeptember 30, | September 30,  \n2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \n(in thousands) | (in thousands)  \nContingent payment | $ | - | $ | 5,000 | $ | - | $ | 5,000  \nResearch and development services | 32 | 72 | 70 | 72  \nMaterials supply | - | - | 937 | -  \nTotal revenue | $ | 32 | $ | 5,072 | $ | 1,007 | $ | 5,072  \n  \nAgreements with Vaxcyte\n\nVaxcyte Supply Agreement\n\nIn May 2018, the Company entered into a Supply Agreement (the “Supply Agreement”) with Vaxcyte, wherein Vaxcyte engaged the Company to provide research and development services and to supply extracts and custom reagents, as requested by Vaxcyte. The pricing is based on an agreed upon cost-plus arrangement.\n\nDuring 2020, upon Vaxcyte’s request and their agreement to reimburse the related costs, the Company entered into agreements with third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to conduct process transfers to allow for such CMOs to manufacture and supply extract and custom reagents for Vaxcyte. As part of the agreement with Vaxcyte, should the Company decide to purchase extract from the extract CMO, the Company would be required to reimburse Vaxcyte for a portion of all incurred process transfer costs. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was $9.4 million and $6.9 million, respectively, in such accruals related to the Vaxcyte Supply Agreement.\n\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the agreed-upon reimbursements by Vaxcyte of the costs associated with such arrangements, principally for pass-through costs from the CMOs, were $2.8 million and $7.0 million, respectively, and were accounted for by the Company as a reduction to research and development expense based on the Company’s conclusion that Vaxcyte was not a customer for such activities and associated payments.\n\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the agreed-upon reimbursements by Vaxcyte of the costs associated with such arrangements, principally for pass-through costs from the CMOs, were $2.8 million and $5.6 million, respectively.\n\nVaxcyte Agreement\n\nIn December 2022, the Company entered into a letter agreement (the “Vaxcyte Agreement”) with Vaxcyte under which the Company granted to Vaxcyte (i) authorization to enter into an agreement with an independent alternate CMO to source cell-free extract solely for the products it licensed from the Company, allowing Vaxcyte to have direct oversight over financial and operational aspects of the relationship with the CMO (“CMO Relationship Rights”), and (ii) a right, but not an obligation, to obtain certain exclusive rights to internally manufacture and/or source extract from certain CMOs and the right to independently develop and make improvements to extract for use in connection with the exploitation of certain vaccine compositions (the “Option”).\n\nIn November 2023 (the \"Exercise Date\"), Vaxcyte exercised the Option by submitting written notice thereof to the Company and concurrently paid the Company $50.0 million in cash as the first of two installment payments for the Option exercise price. In May 2024, Vaxcyte paid the Company an additional $25.0 million in cash as the second of two installment payments for the Option exercise price under the Vaxcyte Agreement.\n\nUpon the occurrence of certain regulatory milestones, Vaxcyte would be obligated to pay the Company certain additional payments totaling up to $60.0 million in cash. In the event that Vaxcyte undergoes a change of control, certain rights and payments may be accelerated. These contingent payments were considered constrained variable consideration or otherwise not eligible for revenue recognition at inception and as of September 30, 2024.\n\n16\n\nRevenues under the Vaxcyte agreements were as follows:\n\nThree Months Ended | Nine Months Ended  \n---|---  \nSeptember 30, | September 30,  \n2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \n(in thousands) | (in thousands)  \nResearch and development services | $ | 563 | $ | 636 | $ | 1,860 | $ | 1,707  \nMaterials supply | 93 | 956 | 289 | 1,263  \nTotal revenue | $ | 656 | $ | 1,592 | $ | 2,149 | $ | 2,970  \n  \nRefer to Note 8 below for information relating to the Purchase Agreement between the Company and Blackstone, pursuant to which the Company sold to Blackstone its 4% royalty, or revenue interest, in potential future net sales of Vaxcyte products, including VAX-24 and VAX-31.\n\nIpsen Agreements\n\nIn March 2024, the Company and Ipsen Pharma SAS (“Ipsen”) entered into an Exclusive License Agreement (the “Ipsen License Agreement”) pursuant to which the Company licensed to Ipsen, on an exclusive basis, the right to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize STRO-003.\n\nIn consideration for the rights and licenses granted by the Company to Ipsen in the Ipsen License Agreement, (i) Ipsen paid the Company an upfront license fee in the amount of $50.0 million in April 2024 and (ii) Ipsen Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. (USA) (“Ipsen USA”), a fully-owned Affiliate of Ipsen, purchased 4,827,373 shares of the Company’s common stock for $25.0 million, at a price of approximately $5.18 per share, in accordance with the terms set forth in a certain investment agreement by and between the Company and Ipsen USA dated March 29, 2024 (the “Ipsen Investment Agreement”, and, together with the Ipsen License Agreement, the “Ipsen Agreements”). The fair market value of the common stock issued to Ipsen USA in April 2024 was $24.6 million, based on the stock price on the date of issuance, resulting in a $0.4 million premium on the Ipsen Investment Agreement.\n\nFurther, pursuant to the Ipsen License Agreement, upon the occurrence of a specified developmental milestone according to a specified timetable, the Company will receive a payment of up to $7.0 million and Ipsen is obligated to purchase up to an additional $10.0 million in shares of the Company’s common stock at a price per share representing a 17% premium to the VWAP of the Company’s common stock for the twenty trading day period prior to such milestone achievement, in accordance with the terms set forth in the Ipsen Investment Agreement. The Company is also eligible to receive up to an additional $447.0 million in developmental and regulatory milestones, assuming multiple indications, and up to $360.0 million in sales milestones, as well as tiered royalty payments ranging from low double-digit to mid-teen digit percentages of annual net sales of STRO-003, subject to certain adjustments specified in the Ipsen License Agreement.\n\nThe royalty payment obligations under the Ipsen License Agreement expire on a country-by-country basis no earlier than ten years following the first commercial sale of STRO-003 in the applicable country. Ipsen may terminate the Ipsen License Agreement for convenience with sixty calendar days prior written notice or for certain other specified reasons. The Company may terminate the Ipsen License Agreement if Ipsen or any of its Affiliates challenge the validity of any patents controlled by the Company that are licensed under the agreement. Both Ipsen and the Company may terminate the Ipsen License Agreement (i) for material breach by the other party and a failure to cure such breach within the time period specified in the Ipsen License Agreement or (ii) the other party’s bankruptcy event.\n\nThe Company concluded that the Ipsen License Agreement contains three promised goods and services consisting of the STRO-003 license, technology transfer, and IND-enabling activities. The Company concluded that these promised goods and services are not distinct from each other, and all play an integral role in allowing Ipsen to file an IND and begin its development of STRO-003. As such, the STRO-003 license, technology transfer, and IND-enabling activities are accounted for as one single performance obligation.\n\nThe Ipsen License Agreement and the Ipsen Investment Agreement are being accounted for as one arrangement because they were entered into at or near the same time and negotiated in contemplation of one another. The Company determined that the total transaction price of the Ipsen License Agreement was $50.4 million, comprised of the one-time, nonrefundable, non-creditable upfront payment of $50.0 million paid by Ipsen under the Ipsen License Agreement, and a $0.4 million premium from the Ipsen Investment Agreement.\n\nRevenue for the performance obligation will be recognized at a point in time when the Company has completed all its deliverables, i.e., STRO-003 license, technology transfer, and IND-enabling activities, at which time Ipsen would have what it needs from the Company to file an IND for STRO-003.\n\n17\n\nIpsen Transition Services Agreement (\"TSA\") and Material Transfer Agreement (\"MTA\")\n\nIn July 2024, the Company executed the Transition Services Agreement (“TSA”) with Ipsen. The TSA outlines the terms and conditions for transition services requested by Ipsen as part of the Ipsen License Agreement. Further, as part of the transition activities under the TSA, Ipsen and the Company executed a Material Transfer Agreement (\"MTA\") to govern the transfer of certain materials from the Company to Ipsen for research and development purposes. The pricing for the services and material supply is outlined in the TSA and MTA.\n\nRevenues under the Ipsen agreements were as follows:\n\nThree Months Ended | Nine Months Ended  \n---|---  \nSeptember 30, | September 30,  \n2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \n(in thousands) | (in thousands)  \nResearch and development services | $ | 93 | $ | – | $ | 111 | $ | –  \nMaterials supply | 73 | – | 150 | –  \nTotal revenue | $ | 166 | $ | – | $ | 261 | $ | –  \n  \nAs of September 30, 2024, there was $50.4 million of deferred revenue related to the Ipsen Agreements.\n\nCollaboration with Merck\n\nIn August 2024, Merck informed the Company of its decision to discontinue the clinical trial of MK-1484 in patients. Merck stated that the decision was based on strategic portfolio considerations.\n\n6. Commitments and Contingencies\n\nLeases\n\nThe Company leases certain office, laboratory and manufacturing facilities in South San Francisco, California and San Carlos, California. These leases require monthly lease payments that may be subject to annual increases throughout the lease term. Certain of these leases also include renewal options at the election of the Company to renew or extend the lease for an additional 5 years. These renewal options have not been considered in the determination of the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities associated with these leases as the Company has determined it is not reasonably certain it will exercise such options.\n\nThe Company recognizes rent expense for these operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease period. The components of lease costs, which the Company includes in operating expenses in the Company's condensed Statements of Operations, were as follows (in thousands): \n\nThree Months Ended | Nine Months Ended  \n---|---  \nSeptember 30, | September 30,  \n2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \nOperating lease cost | $ | 1,984 | $ | 1,979 | $ | 5,952 | $ | 5,055  \nShort-term lease cost | 49 | 59 | 140 | 102  \nVariable lease cost | 680 | 580 | 2,127 | 1,431  \nTotal lease costs | $ | 2,713 | $ | 2,618 | $ | 8,219 | $ | 6,588  \n  \nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded operating lease expense of $2.0 million and $6.0 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company paid $6.9 million of operating lease payments related to the lease liabilities, which the Company includes in net cash used in operating activities in the Company's condensed Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded operating lease expense of $2.0 million and $5.1 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company paid $5.7 million of operating lease payments related to the lease liabilities, which the Company includes in net cash used in operating activities in the Company's condensed Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the weighted-average remaining lease term was 3.1 years and 3.8 years, respectively, and the weighted-average discount rate used to determine the operating lease liability was 10.8% for both periods.\n\n18\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the maturities of the Company’s operating lease liabilities were as follows (in thousands):\n\nYear Ending December 31, | Amount  \n---|---  \n(in thousands)  \nRemaining in 2024 | $ | 2,343  \n2025 | 9,533  \n2026 | 8,994  \n2027 | 8,289  \nTotal lease payments | 29,159  \nLess: imputed interest | (4,295 | )  \nOperating lease liabilities | 24,864  \nLess: current portion | (7,203 | )  \nTotal lease liabilities, non-current | $ | 17,661  \n  \nIndemnification & Other\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to vendors, lessors, business partners, board members, officers, and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of breach of such agreements, services to be provided by the Company, negligence or willful misconduct of the Company, violations of law by the Company, or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with directors and certain officers and employees that will require the Company, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors, officers, or employees. No demands have been made upon the Company to provide indemnification under such agreements, and thus, there are no claims that the Company is aware of that could have a material effect on the Company’s condensed Balance Sheets, condensed Statements of Operations, or condensed Statements of Cash Flows. The Company currently has directors’ and officers’ liability insurance.\n\nIn addition, the Company enters into agreements in the normal course of business, including with contract research organizations for clinical trials, contract manufacturing organizations for certain manufacturing services, and vendors for preclinical studies and other services and products for operating purposes, which are generally cancelable upon written notice.\n\n7. Accrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities\n\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities consist of the following:\n\nSeptember 30, | December 31,  \n---|---  \n2024 | 2023  \n(in thousands)  \nVaxcyte-related accrual under Vaxcyte Supply Agreement | $ | 9,440 | $ | 6,933  \nCMO-related accrual | 10,929 | 8,195  \nClinical trials-related accrual | 8,288 | 4,283  \nTax and related expenses | 18 | 15,165  \nOther | 3,460 | 3,897  \nTotal accrued expenses and other current liabilities | $ | 32,135 | $ | 38,473  \n  \n8. Deferred Royalty Obligation related to the Sale of Future Royalties\n\nIn June 2023, the Company entered into the Purchase Agreement with Blackstone, pursuant to which the Company sold to Blackstone its 4% royalty, or revenue interest, in the potential future net sales of Vaxcyte products, including the Purchased Interest under the 2015 License Agreement. As described in Note 5. Collaboration and License Agreements and Supply Agreements, Vaxcyte Agreement, following agreement with Vaxcyte on the Form Definitive Agreement and upon effectiveness of the amendment No. 3 to the 2015 License Agreement, the revenue interest in the 4% royalty on potential future net sales of Vaxcyte products other than Vaxcyte’s PCV products reverted to the Company. The Company retains the right to discover and develop vaccines for the treatment or prophylaxis of any disease that is not caused by an infectious pathogen, including cancer.\n\nIn June 2023, Blackstone made an upfront payment of $140.0 million to the Company and will also pay up to an additional $250.0 million upon the achievement of various return thresholds as set forth in the Purchase Agreement.\n\n19\n\nUnder the Purchase Agreement, and in connection with its sale of the Purchased Interest, the Company has agreed to certain covenants with respect to the exercise of its rights under the 2015 License Agreement, including with respect to the Company’s right to amend, assign and terminate the 2015 License Agreement. The Purchase Agreement contains other customary terms and conditions, including representations and warranties, covenants, and indemnification obligations in favor of each party.\n\nThe Company recorded the $140.0 million upfront payment from Blackstone as a deferred royalty obligation related to the sale of future royalties on the Company's condensed Balance Sheets. Due to the Company's then ongoing manufacturing obligations under the 2015 License Agreement, the Company accounted for the proceeds as imputed debt and, therefore, will recognize future non-cash royalty revenues. Non-cash interest expense will be recognized over the estimated life of the royalty term arrangement using the effective interest method based on the imputed interest rate derived from estimated amounts and timing of potential future royalty payments to be received from Vaxcyte. As part of the sale, the Company incurred approximately $3.8 million in transaction costs, which are being amortized over the estimated life of the royalty term arrangement using the effective interest method. As future royalties are earned from Vaxcyte by Blackstone, the balance of the deferred royalty obligation will be amortized over the estimated life of the royalty term arrangement.\n\nThere are a number of factors that could materially affect the fair value of the deferred royalty obligation. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of potential future royalty payments to be earned and received by Blackstone from Vaxcyte under the 2015 License Agreement, changing standards of care, the introduction of competing products, manufacturing or other delays, intellectual property matters, adverse events that result in governmental health authority imposed restrictions on the use of the vaccine products, and other events or circumstances that could result in reduced royalty payments from Vaxcyte to Blackstone, which are not within the Company's control, and all of which would result in a reduction or increase of non-cash royalty revenues and the non-cash interest expense over the estimated life of the royalty term arrangement. The Company periodically assesses the estimated royalty payments to be earned by Blackstone from Vaxcyte and, to the extent that the amount or timing of such payments is materially different than its original estimates, the Company prospectively adjusts the imputed interest rate and the related amortization of the deferred royalty obligation. As of September 30, 2024, the effective interest rate used by the Company to amortize the liability is 18.89%.\n\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized approximately $7.9 million and $22.4 million, respectively, of non-cash interest expense on the deferred royalty obligation, which amount will increase such balance. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized approximately $5.9 million and $6.4 million, respectively, of non-cash interest expense on the deferred royalty obligation. As of September 30, 2024, Blackstone has not received any royalty payment from Vaxcyte and, therefore, the deferred royalty obligation has not begun to be amortized.\n\nThe following table shows the activity of the deferred royalty obligation for the nine months ended September 30, 2024:\n\nSeptember 30, 2024  \n---  \n(in thousands)  \nLiability related to sale of future Vaxcyte royalties - beginning balance | $ | 149,114  \nNon-cash interest expense associated with the sale of future Vaxcyte royalties | 22,380  \nAmortization of issuance costs | 473  \nLiability related to the sale of future Vaxcyte royalties - ending balance | $ | 171,967  \n  \n20\n\n9. Stockholders’ Equity\n\nCommon Stock\n\nHolders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters to be voted upon by the stockholders of the Company.\n\nThe Company has reserved common stock, on an if-converted basis, for issuance as follows:\n\nSeptember 30, | December 31,  \n---|---  \n2024 | 2023  \nCommon stock options issued and outstanding | 8,904,562 | 7,905,032  \nCommon stock awards issued and outstanding | 6,022,734 | 5,244,873  \nRemaining shares reserved for issuance under 2018 Equity Incentive Plan and 2021 Equity Inducement Plan | 1,495,378 | 1,777,919  \nShares reserved for issuance under 2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan | 1,213,418 | 914,911  \nWarrants to purchase common stock | 127,616 | 127,616  \nTotal | 17,763,708 | 15,970,351  \n  \nPreferred Stock\n\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized with a par value of $0.001 per share. No shares of preferred stock were outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n\n10. Equity Incentive Plans, Equity Inducement Plans, Employee Stock Purchase Plan and Stock-Based Compensation\n\n2004 Equity Incentive Plan, 2018 Equity Incentive Plan, 2021 Equity Inducement Plan, and Amended and Restated 2021 Equity Inducement Plan\n\nIn September 2018, the Company adopted the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (“2018 Plan”), which became effective on September 25, 2018. As a result, the Company will not grant any additional awards under the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (“2004 Plan”). The terms of the 2004 Plan and applicable award agreements will continue to govern any outstanding awards thereunder. In addition to the shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under the 2004 Plan that were added to the 2018 Plan upon its effective date, the Company initially reserved 2,300,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the 2018 Plan. In addition, the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 2018 Plan will automatically increase on the first day of January for a period of up to ten years, commencing on January 1, 2019, in an amount equal to 5% of the total number of shares of the Company’s capital stock outstanding on the last day of the preceding year (rounded to the nearest whole share), or a lesser number of shares determined by the Company’s board of directors. As a result, common stock reserved for issuance under the 2018 Plan was increased by 3,050,491 shares on January 1, 2024.\n\nIn August 2021, the Company adopted the 2021 Equity Inducement Plan (“2021 Plan”), which became effective on August 4, 2021. Upon its effective date, the Company initially reserved 750,000 shares of common stock for issuance pursuant to non-qualified stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) under the 2021 Plan. In accordance with Rule 5635(c)(4) of the Nasdaq listing rules, equity awards under the 2021 Plan may only be made to an employee if he or she is granted such equity awards in connection with his or her commencement of employment with the Company and such grant is an inducement material to his or her entering into employment with the Company or such subsidiary. In addition, awards under the 2021 Plan may only be made to employees who have not previously been an employee or member of the Board (or any parent or subsidiary of the Company) or following a bona fide period of non-employment of the employee by the Company (or a parent or subsidiary of the Company). At all times, the Company will reserve and keep available a sufficient number of shares as will be required to satisfy the requirements of all outstanding awards granted under the 2021 Plan.\n\nIn August 2022, the Company amended and restated the 2021 Plan (the “Amended and Restated 2021 Plan”) and reserved an additional 750,000 shares of common stock available for issuance under the Amended and Restated 2021 Plan to be granted by the Company to certain employees as a material inducement to their acceptance of employment with the Company in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c)(4).\n\n21\n\nAdditionally, in February 2023, the Company amended and restated the Amended and Restated 2021 Plan and reserved an additional 500,000 shares of common stock available for issuance under the Amended and Restated 2021 Plan to be granted by the Company to certain employees as a material inducement to their acceptance of employment with the Company in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c)(4). The total number of shares reserved for issuance pursuant to the Amended and Restated 2021 Plan is 2,000,000 shares.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had a total of 1,495,378 shares available for grant under the 2018 Plan and the 2021 Plan.\n\nThe following table summarizes option activity under the Company’s 2004 Plan, 2018 Plan and 2021 Plan:\n\nShares | Weighted-AverageExercise Price  \n---|---  \nStock options outstanding at December 31, 2023 | 7,905,032 | $ | 11.24  \nGranted | 1,545,209 | 4.18  \nExercised | (63,748 | ) | 4.24  \nCanceled and forfeited | (481,931 | ) | 10.91  \nStock options outstanding at September 30, 2024 | 8,904,562 | 10.08  \nStock options exercisable at September 30, 2024 | 6,349,762 | $ | 11.85  \n  \nRestricted Stock Units\n\nThe RSUs vest annually, and generally, will become fully vested over four years.

The Company initially reserved 230,000 shares of common stock for sale under the ESPP. The aggregate number of shares reserved for sale under the ESPP will automatically increase on the first day of January for a period of up to ten years, commencing on January 1, 2019, in an amount equal to 1% of the total number of shares of the Company’s capital stock outstanding on the last day of the preceding year (rounded to the nearest whole share), or a lesser number of shares determined by the Company’s board of directors. As a result, common stock reserved for issuance under the ESPP was increased by 114,754 shares on January 1, 2024. The aggregate number of shares issued over the term of the Company’s ESPP, subject to stock-splits, recapitalizations or similar events, may not exceed 2,300,000 shares of the Company’s common stock.\n\nAt the Company’s annual stockholder meeting in June 2024, the Company amended the ESPP (the “Amended ESPP”) to increase the overall limit on the number of shares that may be issued under the Amended ESPP throughout its ten-year term from 2,300,000 shares to 3,050,0000 shares of the Company’s common stock.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, 1,836,582 shares had been purchased and 1,213,418 shares were available for future issuance under the ESPP.\n\n22\n\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\n\nTotal stock-based compensation expense recognized was as follows:\n\nThree Months Ended | Nine Months Ended  \n---|---  \nSeptember 30, | September 30,  \n2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \n(in thousands) | (in thousands)  \nResearch and development expense: | $ | 3,268 | $ | 2,877 | $ | 9,514 | $ | 8,825  \nGeneral and administrative expense: | 3,277 | 3,126 | 9,258 | 9,860  \nTotal | $ | 6,545 | $ | 6,003 | $ | 18,772 | $ | 18,685  \n  \nAs of September 30, 2024, unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to the unvested stock options and RSUs granted was $9.4 million and $28.1 million, respectively.

These statements are inherently uncertain and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these statements.\n\nOverview\n\nWe are a clinical-stage oncology company developing site-specific and novel-format antibody drug conjugates, or ADCs, enabled by our proprietary integrated cell-free protein synthesis platform, XpressCF®, and our site-specific conjugation platform, XpressCF+®. We aim to design and develop therapeutics using the most relevant and potent modalities, including ADCs, bispecific ADCs, immunostimulatory ADCs, or iADCs, dual conjugate ADCs, or ADC2s, and cytokine derivatives. Our molecules are directed primarily against clinically validated targets where the current standard of care is suboptimal. We believe that our platform allows us to accelerate the discovery and development of potential first-in-class and/or best-in-class molecules by enabling the rapid and systematic evaluation of protein structure-activity relationships to create optimized homogeneous product candidates. Our mission is to transform the lives of patients by creating medicines with improved therapeutic profiles for areas of unmet need.\n\nOnce identified, production of protein drug candidates can be rapidly and predictably scaled in our current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, compliant manufacturing facility. We have the ability to manufacture our proprietary cell-free extract that supports our production of proteins on a large scale using a semi-continuous fermentation process. Ourmost advanced product candidate is STRO-002, or luveltamab tazevibulin, or luvelta, an ADC directed against folate receptor-alpha, or FRα, for patients with FRα-expressing cancers, including ovarian cancer.\n\nLuvelta was designed and optimized for an improved therapeutic index by placing a precise number of linker-warheads at four specific locations within the antibody using our proprietary XpressCF+® platform. Our first Phase 1 trial for luvelta is an open-label study evaluating luvelta as a monotherapy for patients with ovarian and endometrial cancers. This trial is being conducted in two-parts, dose escalation and dose expansion. The primary objectives of the clinical trial are to determine the safety and tolerability profile, to define the recommended Phase 2 dose level and interval and to evaluate preliminary anti-tumor activity. Our secondary objectives are to characterize the human pharmacokinetics and additional safety, tolerability, and efficacy measures.\n\nIn 2019, we began luvelta development by enrolling a cohort of patients in a Phase 1 trial of luvelta that focused on ovarian cancer. The Phase 1 trial assessing safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of luvelta to treat platinum resistant ovarian cancer has been completed, and results from this Phase 1 trial reported at ASCO 2023 showed that luvelta exhibited a manageable safety profile together with promising preliminary efficacy data in the tested patient population.\n\nIn January 2024, we presented an aggregated data set from our Phase I trials of luvelta. This data set included data from all ovarian cancer patients treated with luvelta as a monotherapy in Phase 1 studies, regardless of FRα expression levels, dose level of luvelta, or platinum sensitivity or resistance, corresponding to a total of 99 patients, of which 92 were RECIST-evaluable, with 21% platinum sensitive patients and 78% platinum resistant patients. Patients received a median\n\n24\n\nof three prior lines of therapy. There were 72% of the patients that had experienced prior bevacizumab therapy and 70% had been treated with a PARP inhibitor. These patients were not selected for FRα expression levels and were treated at starting dose levels ≤2.9 mg/kg, 4.3 mg/kg, 5.2 mg/kg or ≥5.6 mg/kg.\n\nThe safety profile of luvelta from these aggregated data was shown to be manageable, with a low rate of discontinuation of treatment resulting from neutropenia. The predominant TEAE was neutropenia, encompassing neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and decreased neutrophil count, with 69.7% patients reporting any grade neutropenia and 64.6% patients reporting Grade 3 or higher neutropenia. Neuropathy and arthralgia were the other most commonly reported significant TEAEs, with 57.6% and 16% of patients reporting any grade and Grade 3 or higher arthralgia, respectively, and 44% and 7% patients reporting any grade and Grade 3 or higher neuropathy, respectively. The observed neutropenia was primarily uncomplicated, with less than 5% incidence of febrile neutropenia. Neutropenia and arthralgia each led to discontinuation of treatment in 1.5% of patients. Neuropathy led to discontinuation of treatment in 2.9% of patients. There were six patients that experienced grade 5 safety events on study, with one such event assessed as probably luvelta related and the remainder assessed as unrelated to luvelta.\n\nWe also presented a subset of the aggregated data from our Phase 1 trials of luvelta, for which 43 patients with platinum resistant ovarian cancer selected for FRα TPS ≥25%, or tumors with ≥25% of the tumor cells expressing FRα at any level of staining intensity, were treated with 4.3 mg/kg or 5.2 mg/kg doses of luvelta, corresponding to patients treated across phase 1 studies that would be similar to the target population for the REFRαME-O1 registrational study. The Objective Response Rate, or ORR, observed for this subset population was 28%, with a DOR of 5.7 months and an estimated PFS of 5.8 months.\n\nBased on the data from our Phase 1 program, we selected FRα expression TPS ≥25% as the target eligibility cutoff or threshold for further study in clinical development of luvelta. We estimate that approximately 80% of the platinum resistant ovarian cancer patients would be eligible for luvelta treatment based on this TPS ≥25% threshold for FRα expression.\n\nIn 2022, we initiated an additional exploratory cohort, or cohort C, of 15 patients to assess the safety of treatment with luvelta at 5.2 mg/kg in combination with prophylactic pegfilgrastim and presented preliminary data from ten patients from this cohort in January 2023. In January 2024 we announced updated data from this cohort based on 16 patients. In particular:\n\n•\n\nGrade 3+ neutropenia was reduced from 66.7% to 6.3%, resulting in a 90.6% decrease in Grade 3+ neutropenia rates at the first cycle of luvelta (p=0.0002); Grade 3 neutropenia was reduced from 71.4% to 18.8%, resulting in a 73.7% decrease in Grade 3+ neutropenia rates at the first and second cycle (p=0.0015)\n\n•\n\nOverall Grade 3+ neutropenia was reduced from 76.2% to 37.5%\n\nFollowing the studies discussed above, we initiated a Phase 2/3 study, the REFRαME-O1 study, of luvelta for the treatment of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer in June 2023. This study comprises two parts; in Part 1, we enrolled 57 patients randomized 1:1 to two different doses of luvelta, either 4.3 mg/kg or 5.2 mg/kg plus prophylactic pegfilgrastim for two cycles, followed by reduction to 4.3 mg/kg. After proceeding to Part 2 of the study and selecting an optimized dose, the non-optimized dose of luvelta will be dropped and approximately 516 patients will be randomized 1:1 to the selected luvelta dose or investigator’s choice of chemotherapy. The protocol includes an optional interim analysis for ORR and DOR to support a potential application for accelerated approval and the endpoints that will be assessed to support a potential full approval are PFS and OS. The REFRαME-O1 study patient population includes those who have platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, have received 1-3 lines of prior treatment, have received prior bevacizumab treatment unless not available or contraindicated, and whose tumors express FRα at TPS≥25%. In April 2024, we announced that we had completed enrollment of Part 1 of this study and had initiated enrollment of Part 2 of the study.\n\nBeyond our development of luvelta as a monotherapy for treatment of platinum resistant ovarian cancer, we are assessing the activity of luvelta as part of a combination treatment for ovarian cancer and in connection with certain other FRα-expressing cancers.\n\nWe initiated a Phase 1 trial to assess the combination of luvelta and bevacizumab for treatment of ovarian cancer in December 2021 and presented initial preliminary results of this study in January 2024 and updated results at the 2024 ESMO Congress in September 2024. Safety signals from this study were generally consistent with those previously reported, and the combination treatment with luvelta and bevacizumab demonstrated clinical activity in treated patients regardless of their FRα expression status and prior bevacizumab exposure. At the recommended Phase 2 dose (4.3 mg/kg), an ORR of 56% (5/9) was observed, while no (0/6) patients had a response at 3.5 mg/kg and 50% (1/2) of patients had a response at 5.2 mg/kg. An ORR of 35% (6/17) was observed in the overall population of RECIST evaluable patients with a median duration of response of 9.3 months. In patients with ≥25% FRα expression, an ORR of 44% (4/9) was observed; in patients with <25% FRα expression, an ORR of 29% (2/7) was observed. No new safety signals were observed compared with either agent alone; consistent with previous reported luvelta safety results, the most common\n\n25\n\nadverse event was neutropenia. In addition, we are enrolling patients in the expansion phase of the bevacizumab combination Phase 1b study and expect to present initial data from this trial in in the first half of 2025.\n\nWe also began enrolling patients in an expansion cohort for FRα-selected endometrial cancer in the fourth quarter of 2021 and presented initial preliminary results from the study at the 2023 ESMO Congress in October 2023. In this trial, luvelta showed encouraging preliminary anti-tumor activity in FRα-selected patients, defined by a TPS of >25% FRα expression, and the safety profile was consistent with prior data in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.\n\nOur IND for the treatment of FRα-expressing non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, with luvelta was cleared by the FDA in the first half of 2024 and we initiated the Phase 2 study in August 2024. Initial preliminary data is expected in 2025.\n\nIn addition, we have been offering compassionate use of luvelta to treat pediatric patients with relapsed/refractory CBFA2T3-GLIS2, or CBF/GLIS, acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, commonly known as RAM phenotype AML, via single patient INDs. Updated compassionate use data continued to show anti-leukemic activity of luvelta in pediatric patients with relapsed/refractory CBF/GLIS AML and was presented at ASH 2023 in December 2023. The data showed that luvelta was well tolerated as a monotherapy agent and in combination with standard cancer therapies. Luvelta was granted Rare Pediatric Disease and Orphan Drug Designations by the FDA in November and December 2022, respectively, in this pediatric patient population. We initiated a registration-directed trial of luvelta for treatment of pediatric RAM phenotype AML in October 2024.\n\nRecognizing the potential patient benefit and commercial opportunity for luvelta, we engaged a financial advisor to assist in our efforts to identify a partner for luvelta who can provide financial resources and expertise for the multi-indication development and commercialization of luvelta.\n\nOur most advanced asset in preclinical development is STRO-004. a tissue factor, or TF, targeting ADC, which features a DAR8 exatecan payload and site-specific linker design. We believe STRO-004 has the potential to be a best-in-class ADC targeting TF. Preclinical data suggest that STRO-004 has potent antitumor activity and the potential for a differentiated safety profile. We anticipate filing an IND for STRO-004 in the second half of 2025. Our other preclinical assets include dual-payload ADCs, or ADC2, and immunostimulatory ADCs, or iADCs. We plan to file three INDs over the next three years, including for STRO-004.\n\nEnabled through our proprietary XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms, we have entered into multi-target, product-focused collaborations with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in the field of oncology, with our ongoing relationships that include licensing to Ipsen, on an exclusive basis, the right to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize STRO-003; an immunostimulatory ADC collaboration with Astellas;and a licensing agreement for luvelta in Greater China with Tasly. In August 2023, Tasly received its first IND clearance by NMPA in Greater China for luvelta.\n\nOur XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms have also supported Vaxcyte, focused on discovery and development of vaccines for the treatment and prophylaxis of infectious disease. The lead programs for Vaxcyte are VAX-31 and VAX-24, its 31-valent and 24-valent, respectively, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine candidates. Vaxcyte is responsible for performing all research and development activities, and we provide technical support and supply XtractCF®and other materials to Vaxcyte. In June 2023, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Blackstone, in which Blackstone acquired the right to receive our 4% revenue interest in Vaxcyte’s pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, or PCV, products such as VAX-24 and VAX-31. Following agreement with Vaxcyte on the Form Definitive Agreement and upon effectiveness of an amendment to the licensing agreement, the revenue interest in the 4% royalty on potential future sales of Vaxcyte products other than Vaxcyte’s PCV products reverted to us. Thus, we retain the right to receive a 4% royalty on sales of Vaxcyte’s products other than PCV products. In November 2023, Vaxcyte exercised its option to access expanded rights to develop and manufacture cell-free extract for use in development and manufacture of its vaccine products, among certain other rights.\n\nSince the commencement of our operations, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to performing research and development and manufacturing activities in support of our own product development efforts and those of our collaborators, raising capital to support and expand such activities and providing general and administrative support for these operations. We have funded our operations to date primarily from upfront, milestone and other payments under our collaboration agreements with BMS, Merck, Astellas, Vaxcyte, Ipsen, EMD Serono, BioNova, and Tasly, the issuance and sale of redeemable convertible preferred stock, our initial public offering, or IPO, follow-on public and other offerings of common stock, sales of our common stock through our At-the-Market Facility (“ATM Facility”) pursuant to our Open Market Sales AgreementSM dated April 2, 2021 (the “Sales Agreement”) with Jefferies LLC (“Jefferies”), debt financing, sale of our holdings of Vaxcyte common stock, and the royalty monetization agreement with Blackstone.\n\n26\n\nWe do not have any products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from commercial product sales. We had a loss from operations of $173.2 million and a net loss of $155.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which net loss included the non-operating, realized gain of $32.1 million related to the sale of our holdings of Vaxcyte common stock. We had a loss from operations of $132.4 million and a net loss of $137.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which net loss included the non-operating, unrealized gain of $2.0 million related to our holdings of Vaxcyte common stock. Substantially all of our losses have resulted from expenses incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We cannot assure you that we will have net income or that we will generate positive cash flow from operating activities in the future. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $714.4 million. We do not expect to generate any revenue from commercial product sales unless and until we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval for one or more of our product candidates, which we expect will take a number of years. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, access, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. Our operating expenses would significantly increase due to continued activities to develop, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates, engage in other research and development activities, expand our pipeline of product candidates, continue to develop our manufacturing facility and capabilities, maintain and expand our intellectual property portfolio, seek regulatory and marketing approval for any product candidates that we may develop, acquire or in-license other assets or technologies, ultimately establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain marketing approval, and operate as a public company. In light of our current resources and the cost of development, we are continuing our process of evaluating our programs and spending. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, depending on the timing of our clinical trials, our expenditures on other research and development activities and the timing of achievement and receipt of upfront, milestones and other collaboration agreement payments.\n\nFinancial Operations Overview\n\nRevenue\n\nWe do not have any products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from commercial product sales. Our total revenue to date has been generated principally from our collaboration and license agreements with BMS, Merck, Astellas, Vaxcyte, Tasly, and Ipsen, and to a lesser extent, from manufacturing, supply and services and materials we provide to the above collaborators.\n\nWe derive revenue from collaboration arrangements, under which we may grant licenses to our collaboration partners to further develop and commercialize our proprietary product candidates. We may also perform research and development activities under the collaboration agreements. Consideration under these contracts generally includes a nonrefundable upfront payment, development, regulatory and commercial milestones and other contingent payments, and royalties based on net sales of approved products. Additionally, the collaborations may provide options for the customer to acquire from us materials and reagents, clinical product supply, or additional research and development services under separate agreements. We assess which activities in the collaboration agreements are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately. We develop assumptions that require judgement to determine whether the license to our intellectual property is distinct from the research and development services or participation in activities under the collaboration agreements.\n\nAt the inception of each agreement, we determine the arrangement transaction price, which includes variable consideration, based on the assessment of the probability of achievement of future milestones and contingent payments and other potential consideration. We recognize revenue over time by measuring our progress towards the complete satisfaction of the relevant performance obligation using an appropriate input or output method based on the nature of the service promised to the customer.\n\nFor arrangements that include multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to the identified performance obligations based on the standalone selling price, or SSP, of each distinct performance obligation. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, we develop assumptions that require judgment to determine the SSP for each performance obligation identified in the contract. These key assumptions may include full-time equivalent, or FTE, personnel effort, estimated costs, discount rates and probabilities of clinical development and regulatory success.\n\nOperating Expenses\n\nResearch and Development\n\nResearch and development expenses represent costs incurred in performing research, development and manufacturing activities in support of our own product development efforts and those of our collaborators, and include salaries, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, laboratory supplies, outsourced research and development\n\n27\n\nexpenses, professional services, and allocated facilities and IT-related costs. We expense both internal and external research and development costs as they are incurred. Nonrefundable advance payments for services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses and recognized as expenses as the related services are performed.\n\nOur research and development expenses would increase in the future due to continued activities to advance our product candidates into and through preclinical studies and clinical trials, pursue regulatory approval of our product candidates, expand our pipeline of product candidates, and continue to develop our manufacturing facility and capabilities. The process of conducting the necessary preclinical and clinical research to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time consuming. The actual probability of success for our product candidates may be affected by a variety of factors including: the safety and efficacy of our product candidates, early clinical data, investment in our clinical programs, the ability of collaborators to successfully develop our licensed product candidates, competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. As a result of the uncertainties discussed above, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when and to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of our product candidates.\n\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses incurred during the indicated periods. The internal costs include personnel, facility costs and research and scientific related activities associated with our pipeline. The external program costs reflect external costs attributable to our clinical development candidates and preclinical candidates selected for further development. Such expenses include third-party costs for preclinical and clinical studies and research, development and manufacturing services, and other consulting costs.\n\nThree Months Ended | Nine Months Ended  \n---|---  \nSeptember 30, | September 30,  \n2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \n(in thousands) | (in thousands)  \nInternal costs:  \nResearch and drug discovery | $ | 10,481 | $ | 8,391 | $ | 30,832 | $ | 25,825  \nProcess and product development | 5,995 | 5,047 | 18,528 | 15,264  \nManufacturing | 12,503 | 10,074 | 36,645 | 32,804  \nClinical development | 4,024 | 3,083 | 11,697 | 9,101  \nTotal internal costs | 33,003 | 26,595 | 97,702 | 82,994  \nExternal Program Costs:  \nResearch and drug discovery | 949 | 1,522 | 2,449 | 2,366  \nProcess and product development | 322 | 759 | 1,108 | 2,189  \nManufacturing | 18,613 | 11,033 | 50,643 | 21,353  \nClinical development | 9,221 | 5,760 | 29,104 | 17,758  \nTotal external program costs | 29,105 | 19,074 | 83,304 | 43,666  \nTotal research and development expenses | $ | 62,108 | $ | 45,669 | $ | 181,006 | $ | 126,660  \n  \nGeneral and Administrative\n\nOur general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, expenses for outside professional services, including legal, human resources, audit, accounting and tax services and allocated facilities-related costs. Personnel costs include salaries, employee benefits and stock-based compensation. We expect to incur expenses operating as a public company, including expenses related to compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC and listing standards applicable to companies listed on the Nasdaq Global Market, additional insurance expenses, investor relations activities and other administrative and professional services. The size of our administrative function and our general and administrative expenses to support the anticipated growth of our business would increase as we continue to advance our product candidates into and through the clinic.\n\nInterest Income\n\nInterest income consists primarily of interest earned on our invested funds.\n\nUnrealized Gain (Loss) on Equity Securities\n\nUnrealized gain (loss) on equity securities consists of the remeasurement of our investment in Vaxcyte common stock.\n\n28\n\nNon-cash interest expense related to the sale of future royalties\n\nNon-cash interest expense related to the sale of future Vaxcyte royalties represents the imputed interest expense on our deferred royalty obligation related to the sale of future Vaxcyte royalties pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, using the effective interest method. As further described in the interim condensed financial statements Note 8. Deferred Royalty Obligation related to the Sale of Future Royalties, in June 2023, we entered into the Purchase Agreement with Blackstone, pursuant to which we sold to Blackstone our 4% royalty, or revenue interest, in the potential future net sales of Vaxcyte’s PCV products, such as VAX-24 and VAX-31.\n\nNon-cash interest expense will be recognized over the estimated life of the royalty term arrangement using the effective interest method based on the imputed interest rate derived from estimated amounts and timing of potential future royalty payments to be earned and received by Blackstone from Vaxcyte under the 2015 License Agreement.\n\nInterest and Other Income (Expense), Net\n\nInterest expense includes interest incurred on our debt and amortization of debt issuance costs, including accretion of the final payment. Additionally, we identified a financing component under the Astellas Agreement and recorded interest expense associated with the upfront payment. Other income (expense), net, also includes the realized gain on the sale of Vaxcyte common stock.\n\nComparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024, and 2023\n\nThree Months Ended  \n---  \nSeptember 30,  \n2024 | 2023 | Change | Change(%)  \n(in thousands)  \nRevenue | $ | 8,520 | $ | 16,924 | $ | (8,404 | ) | (50 | )%  \nOperating expenses  \nResearch and development | 62,108 | 45,669 | 16,439 | 36 | %  \nGeneral and administrative | 14,331 | 15,269 | (938 | ) | (6 | )%  \nTotal operating expenses | 76,439 | 60,938 | 15,501 | 25 | %  \nLoss from operations | (67,919 | ) | (44,014 | ) | (23,905 | ) | 54 | %  \nInterest income | 4,875 | 4,550 | 325 | 7 | %  \nUnrealized gain on equity securities | - | 694 | (694 | ) | (100 | )%  \nNon-cash interest expense related to the sale of future royalties | (7,910 | ) | (5,936 | ) | (1,974 | ) | 33 | %  \nInterest and other income (expense), net | 22,167 | (2,739 | ) | 24,906 | (909 | )%  \nLoss before provision for income taxes | (48,787 | ) | (47,445 | ) | (1,342 | ) | 3 | %  \nProvision for income taxes | - | 1,839 | (1,839 | ) | (100 | )%  \nNet loss | $ | (48,787 | ) | $ | (49,284 | ) | $ | 497 | (1 | )%  \n  \nRevenue\n\nWe have recognized revenue as follows during the indicated periods:\n\nThree Months Ended  \n---  \nSeptember 30,  \n2024 | 2023 | Change | Change(%)  \n(in thousands)  \nAstellas Pharma Inc.

This was primarily due to an earned $5.0 million contingent payment from Tasly in 2023, a $2.3 million decrease from Astellas, of which $1.2 million was from the financing component related to the Astellas Agreement, $0.6 million was from research and development services, and $0.5 million was from the ongoing performance related to partially unsatisfied performance obligations, a $0.9 million decrease in Vaxcyte revenue, primarily due to a decrease in research and development services and materials supply, a $0.2 million decrease in BMS revenue due to its decision to end clinical development of CC-99712 in 2023, and a $0.1 million decrease in Merck revenue due to its decision to end clinical development of MK-1484 during the three months ended September 30, 2024. These decreases were partially offset by a $0.2 million in Ipsen revenue from research and development services and materials supply, which commenced in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nResearch and Development Expense\n\nResearch and development expense increased by $16.4 million, or 36%, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The overall increase was due primarily to increases of $6.9 million in outside services mainly due to increased CMO-related activities, $3.1 million in preclinical research and clinical development expenses, $2.4 million in facilities expenses and IT-related expenses, $2.2 million in personnel-related expenses due to higher headcount, $1.0 million in laboratory supplies, and $0.8 million in equipment and office-related expenses.\n\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\n\nGeneral and administrative expense decreased by $0.9 million, or 6%, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The overall decrease was due primarily to decreases of $2.6 million in IT-related expenses and $0.1 million in equipment-related expenses, partially offset by increases of $1.0 million in outside services, $0.6 million in personnel-related expenses, and $0.2 million in travel-related expenses.\n\nInterest Income\n\nInterest income increased by $0.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, due primarily to higher average investment balances and higher average rates of return in 2024.\n\nUnrealized Gain on Equity Securities\n\nWe sold the remaining shares of Vaxcyte common stock, resulting in no unrealized gain on equity securities during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to an unrealized gain of $0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we do not hold any shares of Vaxcyte common stock.\n\nNon-cash Interest Expense related to the Sale of Future Royalties\n\nNon-cash interest expense increased by $2.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Non-cash interest expense was recognized on our deferred royalty obligation related to the June 2023 sale of future Vaxcyte royalties pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, using the effective interest method based on the imputed interest rate derived from estimated amounts and timing of potential future royalty payments to be earned and received by Blackstone from Vaxcyte under the 2015 License Agreement.\n\nInterest and Other Income (Expense), Net\n\nInterest and other income (expense), net, decreased by $24.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 2023, primarily due to a recognized gain of $23.7 million on the sale of Vaxcyte common stock, and a decrease of $1.2 million from the financing component related to the Astellas Agreement.\n\n30\n\nComparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024, and 2023\n\nNine Months Ended  \n---  \nSeptember 30,  \n2024 | 2023 | Change | Change(%)  \n(in thousands)  \nRevenues | $ | 47,234 | $ | 40,010 | $ | 7,224 | 18 | %  \nOperating expenses  \nResearch and development | 181,006 | 126,660 | 54,346 | 43 | %  \nGeneral administrative | 39,423 | 45,780 | (6,357 | ) | (14 | )%  \nTotal operating expenses | 220,429 | 172,440 | 47,989 | 28 | %  \nLoss from operations | (173,195 | ) | (132,430 | ) | (40,765 | ) | 31 | %  \nInterest income | 13,882 | 9,952 | 3,930 | 39 | %  \nUnrealized gain on equity securities | - | 2,023 | (2,023 | ) | (100 | )%  \nNon-cash interest expense related to the sale of future royalties | (22,380 | ) | (6,378 | ) | (16,002 | ) | 251 | %  \nInterest and other income (expense), net | 26,683 | (8,640 | ) | 35,323 | (409 | )%  \nLoss before provision for income taxes | (155,010 | ) | (135,473 | ) | (19,537 | ) | 14 | %  \nProvision for income taxes | 8 | 2,385 | (2,377 | ) | (100 | )%  \nNet loss | $ | (155,018 | ) | $ | (137,858 | ) | $ | (17,160 | ) | 12 | %  \n  \nRevenue\n\nWe have recognized revenue as follows during the indicated periods:\n\nNine Months Ended  \n---  \nSeptember 30,  \n2024 | 2023 | Change | Change(%)  \n(in thousands)  \nAstellas Pharma Inc.

This was primarily due to a $20.2 million increase from Astellas, of which $22.5 million was from the ongoing performance related to partially unsatisfied performance obligations, and included a cumulative catch-up adjustment of $17.8 million on the contract modification date from Astellas' decision not to nominate a third target program under the Astellas Agreement and $0.4 million from materials supply, which were partially offset by decreases of $2.3 million from the financing component related to the Astellas Agreement and $0.4 million from research and development services. Additionally, there was a $0.3 million increase in Ipsen revenue from research and development services and materials supply, which commenced in the second quarter of 2024. These increases were partially offset by a $5.6 million combined decrease in BMS and EMD Serono revenue due to their decisions to end clinical development of CC-99712 and M1231, respectively, in 2023, a $4.1 million decrease in Tasly revenue, primarily due to an earned $5.0 million contingent payment from Tasly in 2023, which was partially offset by a $0.9 million increase in clinical product supply under the 2023 Tasly Supply Agreement, a $2.8 million decrease in Merck revenue, primarily due to a $2.6 million decrease in manufacturing activities supporting clinical trial supply and a $0.2 million decrease in research and development services. Further, Merck decided to end clinical development of MK-1484 during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Lastly, Vaxcyte revenue decreased by $0.8 million, primarily due to a $1.0 million decrease in materials supply, partially offset by a $0.2 million increase in research and development services.\n\n31\n\nResearch and Development Expense\n\nResearch and development expense increased by $54.3 million, or 43%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The overall increase was due primarily to increases of $30.3 million in outside services mainly due to increased CMO-related activities, $9.3 million in preclinical research and clinical development expenses, $8.2 million in facilities expenses and IT-related expenses, $5.2 million in personnel-related expenses due to higher headcount, $2.4 million in equipment and office-related expenses, and $0.2 million in travel-related expenses, partially offset by a decrease of $1.3 million in laboratory supplies.\n\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\n\nGeneral and administrative expense decreased by $6.4 million, or 14%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The overall decrease was due primarily to decreases of $7.8 million in IT-related expenses and $1.2 million in personnel-related expenses, partially offset by increases of $1.8 million in outside services, $0.4 million in equipment and office-related expenses, and $0.4 million in allocated facilities-related expenses.\n\nInterest Income\n\nInterest income increased by $3.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due primarily to higher average investment balances and higher average rates of return in 2024.\n\nUnrealized Gain on Equity Securities\n\nWe sold the remaining shares of Vaxcyte common stock and there was no unrealized gain on equity securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to an unrealized gain of $2.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we do not hold any shares of Vaxcyte common stock.\n\nNon-cash interest expense related to the sale of future royalties\n\nNon-cash interest expense increased by $16.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Non-cash interest expense was recognized on our deferred royalty obligation related to the June 2023 sale of future Vaxcyte royalties pursuant to the Purchase Agreement using the effective interest method based on the imputed interest rate derived from estimated amounts and timing of future royalty payments to be earned and received by Blackstone from Vaxcyte under the 2015 License Agreement.\n\nInterest and Other Income (Expense), Net\n\nInterest and other income (expense), net, decreased by $35.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due primarily to a recognized gain of $32.1 million on the sale of Vaxcyte common stock and decreases of $2.3 million from the financing component related to the Astellas Agreement and $0.9 million in interest incurred on our loan which was fully paid in March 2024.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nSources of Liquidity\n\nTo date, we have incurred significant net losses, and negative cash flows from operations. Our operations have been funded primarily by payments received from our collaborators, and net proceeds from equity sales, debt, sale of shares of Vaxcyte common stock, and a royalty monetization. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $388.3 million, and an accumulated deficit of $714.4 million.\n\nVaxcyte Equity Ownership\n\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, we sold the remaining 667,780 shares of Vaxcyte common stock for net proceeds of $74.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, we do not hold any shares of Vaxcyte common stock.\n\n32\n\nVaxcyte Agreement\n\nIn May 2024, Vaxcyte paid us $25.0 million as the second of two installment payments for the Option exercise price under the Vaxcyte Agreement.\n\nUnderwritten Offering\n\nIn April 2024, we closed an underwritten offering with BofA Securities, Inc., pursuant to which we issued and sold 14,478,764 shares of our common stock at an offering price of $5.18 per share. The gross proceeds from these sales were approximately $75.0 million, before deducting fees and offering expenses.\n\nIpsen Agreements\n\nIn March 2024, we and Ipsen Pharma SAS (“Ipsen”) entered into an Exclusive License Agreement (the “Ipsen License Agreement”) pursuant to which we licensed to Ipsen, on an exclusive basis, the right to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize STRO-003.\n\nIn consideration for the rights and licenses granted by us to Ipsen in the Ipsen License Agreement, Ipsen (i) paid us an upfront license fee in the amount of $50.0 million in April 2024 and (ii) Ipsen Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. (USA) (“Ipsen USA”) purchased 4,827,373 shares of our common stock for $25.0 million, at a price of approximately $5.18 per share, in accordance with the terms set forth in a certain investment agreement by and between us and the Ipsen USA dated March 29, 2024 (the “Ipsen Investment Agreement”, and, together with the Ipsen License Agreement, the “Ipsen Agreements”).\n\nFurther, pursuant to the Ipsen License Agreement, upon the occurrence of a specified developmental milestone according to a specified timetable, we will receive a payment of up to $7.0 million and Ipsen is obligated to purchase up to an additional $10.0 million in shares of our common stock at a price per share representing a 17% premium to the VWAP of our common stock for the twenty trading day period prior to such milestone achievement, in accordance with the terms set forth in the Ipsen Investment Agreement. We are also eligible to receive up to an additional $447.0 million in developmental and regulatory milestones, assuming multiple indications, and up to $360.0 million in sales milestones, as well as tiered royalty payments ranging from low double-digit to mid-teen digit percentages of annual net sales of STRO-003, subject to certain adjustments specified in the Ipsen License Agreement.\n\nThe royalty payment obligations under the Ipsen License Agreement expire on a country-by-country basis no earlier than ten years following the first commercial sale of STRO-003 in the applicable country. Ipsen may terminate the Ipsen License Agreement for convenience with sixty calendar days prior written notice or for certain other specified reasons. We may terminate the Ipsen License Agreement if Ipsen or any of its Affiliates challenge the validity of any patents controlled by us that are licensed under the agreement. Both Ipsen and we may terminate the Ipsen License Agreement (i) for material breach by the other party and a failure to cure such breach within the time period specified in the Ipsen License Agreement or (ii) the other party’s bankruptcy event.\n\nLeases\n\nIn June 2021, we entered into a third amendment, (the \"Third Amendment\") to our manufacturing facility lease, dated May 18, 2011, as amended, by and between Alemany Plaza LLC, located at San Carlos, California, or San Carlos Lease, as an extension to the term of the San Carlos Lease for a period of five years, (the \"Lease Extension Period\"). Pursuant to the Third Amendment, the San Carlos Lease will expire on July 31, 2026, and it includes an option to renew the San Carlos Lease for an additional five years. The aggregate estimated base rent payments due over the Lease Extension Period is approximately $4.2 million, subject to certain terms contained in the San Carlos Lease.\n\nIn June 2021, we entered into a first amendment, or First Amendment, to our manufacturing facility lease, dated March 4, 2015, as amended, by and between 870 Industrial Road LLC, located at San Carlos, California, (the \"Industrial Lease\"), as an extension to the term of the Industrial Lease for a period of five years, (the \"Industrial Lease Extension Period\"). Pursuant to the first Amendment, the Industrial Lease will expire on June 30, 2026, and it includes an option to renew the Industrial Lease for an additional five years. The aggregate estimated base rent payments due over the Industrial Lease Extension Period is approximately $4.3 million, subject to certain terms contained in the Industrial Lease.\n\nIn September 2020, we entered into a sublease agreement, (the \"Sublease with Five Prime Therapeutics, Inc.\"), or (the \"Sublessor\"), for approximately 115,466 square feet, in a building located in South San Francisco, California, or (the \"Premises\"). We use the Premises as our corporate headquarters and to conduct (or expand) research and development activities. We commenced making monthly payments for the first 85,755 square feet of the Premises, or Initial Premises, in July 2021, with occupancy of such space commencing in August 2021. We were provided early access to the Initial\n\n33\n\nPremises in the fourth quarter of 2020 to conduct certain planning and tenant improvement work. The Sublease is subordinate to the lease agreement, effective December 12, 2016, between the Sublessor and HCP Oyster Point III LLC (the \"Landlord\"). We commenced using the remaining 29,711 square feet of the Premises, (the \"Expansion Premises\"), on July 1, 2023 under the sublease agreement. The Sublease for both the Initial Premises and Expansion Premises will expire on December 31, 2027. With a commencement date on the Initial Premises of July 1, 2021, and Expansion Premises of July 1, 2023, the aggregate estimated base rent payments due over the term of the Sublease are approximately $39.1 million, including the approximately $5.2 million in potential financial benefit to us of base rent abatement to be provided by the Sublessor, subject to certain terms contained in the Sublease. The Sublease contains customary provisions requiring us to pay our pro rata share of utilities and a portion of the operating expenses and certain taxes, assessments and fees of the Premises and provisions allowing the Sublessor to terminate the Sublease upon the termination of the lease with the Landlord or if we fail to remedy a breach of certain of our obligations within specified time periods. Additionally, we posted a security deposit of $0.9 million, which is reflected as restricted cash in non-current assets on our Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n\nFunding Requirements\n\nBased upon our current operating plan, we believe that our existing capital resources will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next twelve months after the date of this filing. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. We will continue to require additional financing to advance our current product candidates into and through clinical development, to develop, acquire or in-license other potential product candidates, pay our obligations and to fund operations for the foreseeable future.\n\nWe may seek to raise any necessary additional capital through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements, marketing and distribution arrangements, royalty monetizations, or other sources of financing. Adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Any failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on our financial condition and on our ability to pursue our business plans and strategies, and may cause us to delay, reduce the scope of or suspend one or more of our pre-clinical and clinical studies, research and development programs or commercialization efforts, and may necessitate us to delay, reduce or terminate planned activities in order to reduce costs. Due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates and the extent to which we may enter into additional collaborations with third parties to participate in their development and commercialization, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical studies.\n\nTo the extent we raise additional capital through new collaborations, strategic alliances, or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our product candidates, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we do raise additional capital through public or private equity or convertible debt offerings, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our stockholders’ rights. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, we may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, or declaring dividends.\n\nCash Flows\n\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows during the periods indicated:\n\nNine Months Ended  \n---  \nSeptember 30,  \n2024 | 2023  \n(in thousands)  \nNet cash used in operating activities | $ | (119,802 | ) | $ | (125,688 | )  \nNet cash provided by investing activities | 131,020 | 19,589  \nNet cash provided by financing activities | 94,078 | 140,679  \nNet increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash | $ | 105,296 | $ | 34,580  \n  \n34\n\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\n\nCash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $119.8 million. Our net loss of $155.0 million included non-cash amounts of $32.1 million for the realized gain on the sale of Vaxcyte common stock, $22.4 million for non-cash interest expense on our deferred royalty obligation, $18.8 million for stock-based compensation, $8.2 million for the accretion of discount on marketable securities, $5.4 million for depreciation and amortization, and $3.8 million for non-cash lease expense. Cash used in operating activities also reflected a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $24.6 million, due to a decrease of $29.4 million in accounts receivable primarily from receiving $25.0 million from Vaxcyte as the second of two installment payments for the Option exercise price under the Vaxcyte Agreement, and an increase of $16.1 million in deferred revenue primarily due to the upfront payment from Ipsen, partially offset by revenue recognized under the Astellas Agreement, which were partially offset by a decrease of $10.0 million in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities due to timing of payments, a decrease of $4.7 million in our operating lease liability, an increase of $4.6 million in prepaid expenses and other assets, and a decrease of $1.5 million in accrued compensation expense primarily due to bonuses paid in 2024 in connection with certain company 2023 goal achievements.\n\nCashused in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $125.7 million. Our net loss of $137.9 million included non-cash amounts of $18.7 million for stock-based compensation, $6.4 million for non-cash interest expense on our deferred royalty obligation, $6.0 million for the accretion of discount on marketable securities, $5.1 million for depreciation and amortization, $2.4 million for non-cash lease expense, and $2.0 million for the unrealized gain on equity securities as a result of the remeasurement of the estimated fair value of our investment in Vaxcyte common stock. Cash used in operating activities also reflected a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $12.8 million, due to an increase of $9.5 million in accounts receivable from our collaborators, a decrease of $4.5 million in deferred revenue from revenue recognized under our collaboration agreements, a decrease of $3.1 million in our operating lease liability, and a decrease of $1.8 million in accrued compensation expense, which were partially offset by an increase of $5.3 million in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities due to timing of payments, and a decrease of $0.8 million in prepaid expenses and other assets.\n\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\n\nCash provided by investing activities of $131.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily related to maturities and sales of marketable securities of $394.5 million, and net proceeds from the sale of Vaxcyte common stock of $74.0 million, partially offset by purchases of marketable securities of $335.5 million, and purchases of property and equipment of $2.0 million, principally for laboratory equipment.\n\nCash provided by investing activities of $19.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily related to maturities and sales of marketable securities of $402.2 million, partially offset by purchases of marketable securities of $379.7 million, and purchases of property and equipment of $2.9 million, principally for laboratory equipment.\n\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\n\nCash provided by financing activities of $94.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily related to $71.5 million of net proceeds from the underwritten offering, $25.0 million of proceeds from Ipsen USA upon the purchase of our common stock under the Ipsen Investment Agreement, $1.8 million of net proceeds received from participants in our employee equity plans, and $0.3 million of proceeds received from the exercise of common stock options, partially offset by debt repayment of $4.1 million and a $0.5 million tax payment related to the net shares settlement of vested restricted stock units.\n\nCash provided by financing activities of $140.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily related to $136.2 million of net proceeds from the sale of future royalties, $12.0 million of net proceeds from our ATM Facility sales of common stock, $2.0 million of net proceeds received from participants in our employee equity plans, and $0.3 million of proceeds received from the exercise of common stock options, partially offset by a debt repayment of $9.4 million and a $0.5 million tax payment related to the net shares settlement of vested restricted stock units.\n\nContractual Obligations and Other Commitments\n\nIn addition to the contractual obligations and commitments as noted above and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q with regards to the leases and term loans, we enter into agreements in the normal course of business, including with contract research organizations for clinical trials, contract manufacturing organizations for certain manufacturing services, and vendors for preclinical studies and other services and products for operating purposes, which are generally cancelable upon written notice.\n\n35\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nOur management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenue generated, and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n\nThere have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nSee Note 2 to our financial statements included elsewhere in this report for more information.\n\n36\n\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\n\nWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate sensitivities. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital to fund our operations. We also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk. To achieve our objectives, we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities of high credit quality.\n\nWe had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $388.3 million and $333.7 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which consisted primarily of money market funds, commercial paper, corporate debt securities, asset-based securities, U.S. government securities, and U.S. agency securities. Such interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk; however, historical fluctuations in interest income have not been significant.\n\nWe do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure. We have not been exposed nor do we anticipate being exposed to material risks due to changes in interest rates. A hypothetical 10% change in market interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial statements. We do not believe that our cash, cash equivalents or marketable securities have a significant risk of default or illiquidity.\n\n37\n\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures.\n\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial officer), performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\n\nDisclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objective and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

Legal Proceedings.\n\nFrom time to time, we may be involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not presently a party to any legal proceedings that, in the opinion of management, would have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us due to defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, negative publicity and reputational harm, and other factors.\n\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\n\nRISK FACTORS\n\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before making your decision to invest in shares of our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including our interim condensed financial statements and the related notes and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that affect us. We cannot assure you that any of the events discussed below will not occur. These events could have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. If that were to happen, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\n\nSummary of Risk Factors\n\nOur business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those highlighted in the section titled “Risk Factors” immediately following this summary. Some of these risks include:\n\n•\n\nWe have a history of significant losses and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\n\n•\n\nWe will need substantial additional funds to advance development of our product candidates and failure to obtain sufficient funding may force us to delay, limit or terminate our product development programs, commercialization efforts or other operations. We may have difficulties accessing the required additional capital on reasonable, or even any, terms to continue our product and platform development or other operations, and may have to make difficult prioritization decisions regarding development and potential partnering of our clinical and preclinical product candidates.\n\n•\n\nOur product candidates are in development and may fail, be impacted by competitive products or suffer delays that materially and adversely affect their commercial viability.\n\n•\n\nOur business is dependent on the success of our product candidates, including Iuvelta, which is generated from our proprietary XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms. \n\n•\n\nIf we do not achieve our development goals in the timeframes we anticipate and project, the commercialization of our products may be delayed and, as a result, our stock price may decline.\n\n•\n\nOur approach to the discovery and development of our therapeutic treatments is based on novel technologies that are unproven and may not result in marketable products.\n\n•\n\nWe depend on our information technology systems, and any failure of these systems, or those of our CROs, third-party vendors, or other contractors or consultants we may utilize, could harm our business. Security breaches, cyber-attacks, loss of data, and other disruptions could compromise sensitive information related to our business or other personal information or prevent us from accessing critical information and expose us to liability, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\n\n•\n\nOur information technology systems could face serious disruptions that could adversely affect our business.\n\n39\n\n•\n\nOur failure to comply with privacy and data protection laws or to adequately secure the personal information we hold could result in significant liability or reputational harm and, in turn, a material adverse effect on our client base, member base and revenue.\n\n•\n\nIf our collaborations with third parties to develop and commercialize certain product candidates are not successful, we may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms and the product candidates.\n\n•\n\nOur inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of our product candidates or such materials, or the loss of our third-party suppliers, or our or their failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements or to supply sufficient quantities at acceptable quality levels or prices, or at all, would materially and adversely affect our business.\n\n•\n\nWe face competition from entities that have developed or may develop product candidates for cancer, including companies developing novel treatments and technology platforms. If these companies develop technologies or product candidates more rapidly than we do or their technologies are more effective, our ability to develop and successfully commercialize product candidates may be adversely affected.\n\n•\n\nIf we are not able to obtain and enforce patent protection for our technologies or product candidates, development and commercialization of our product candidates may be adversely affected.\n\n•\n\nOur collaborators may fail to abide by the terms of the agreements with us, which would require us to seek to enforce our agreements in accordance with the dispute resolution procedures set forth therein. These procedures may require us to engage in litigation or arbitration to enforce our rights, which can be expensive, time-consuming, and distracting to our management and Board of Directors and that may ultimately end up being unsuccessful.\n\n•\n\nIf we are unable to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed. Changes in regulatory policy may render our strategies for obtaining regulatory approval less effective or completely ineffective, preventing us from obtaining regulatory approval for our product candidates on time or at all.\n\nRisks Related to Our Business\n\nWe are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company with no products approved for commercial sale. We have a history of significant losses, expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or maintain profitability, which could result in a decline in the market value of our common stock.\n\nWe are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company. Biotechnology product development is a highly speculative undertaking and involves a substantial degree of risk.\n\nTo date, we have no products approved for commercial sale, have not generated any revenue from commercial product sales and, as of September 30, 2024, had an accumulated deficit of $714.4 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023, our net loss was $155.0 million and $106.8 million, respectively. Substantially all of our losses have resulted from expenses incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations. In addition, our expenses could increase beyond expectations if we are required by the FDA, or foreign regulatory agencies, to perform studies or clinical trials in addition to those studies and clinical trials that we currently anticipate conducting for our product candidates, or if there are any delays in our or our partners completing clinical trials or the development of any of our product candidates. Our technologies and product candidates are in varying stages of development, and we are subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development of product candidates based on novel technologies. In addition, we have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully overcome many of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving fields, particularly in the biotechnology industry. Furthermore, we do not expect to generate any revenue from commercial product sales for the foreseeable future, and we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future due to the cost of research and development, preclinical studies and clinical trials and the regulatory approval process for our product candidates and manufacturing clinical and early commercial supply of our product candidates. We expect our net losses to increase substantially as we progress further into clinical development of our lead programs and create additional infrastructure to support operations as a public company. However, the amount of our future losses is uncertain. We may never generate revenues from the commercial sale of our or our collaborators’ products. Our ability to achieve profitability, if ever, will depend on, among other things,\n\n40\n\nour, or our existing or future collaborators’, successful development of product candidates, evaluating the related commercial opportunities, obtaining regulatory approvals to market and commercialize product candidates, manufacturing any approved products on commercially reasonable terms, establishing a sales and marketing organization or suitable third-party alternatives for any approved product, and raising sufficient funds to finance business activities. If we, or our existing or future collaborators, are unable to develop our technologies and commercialize one or more of our product candidates or if sales revenue from any product candidate that receives approval is insufficient, we will not achieve profitability, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods.\n\nWe will need substantial additional funds to advance development of our product candidates and failure to obtain sufficient funding may force us to delay, limit or terminate our product development programs, commercialization efforts or other operations. We may have difficulty accessing additional capital on reasonable, or even any, terms to continue our product and platform development or other operations and may have to make difficult prioritization decisions regarding development and potential partnering of our clinical and preclinical product candidates.\n\nThe development of biopharmaceutical product candidates is capital-intensive. As our product candidates advance through preclinical studies and clinical trials, we will need substantial additional funds to expand our development, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities. We have used substantial funds to develop our technology and product candidates and will require significant funds to conduct further research and development and preclinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates, to seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates, to manufacture extract and products, if any, which may be approved for commercial sale, to establish marketing and sales capabilities to commercialize our product candidates, and to provide support to our collaborators in the development of their products. In addition, we expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.\n\nSince our inception, we have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in research and development activities for our clinical-stage product candidates and the development of our technology platform, including our in-house manufacturing capabilities. Clinical trials for our product candidates have required substantial funds to date and will continue to require substantial funds to complete. As of September 30, 2024, we had $388.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. We expect to incur substantial expenditures in the foreseeable future as we seek to advance multiple product candidates through clinical development, manufacturing, the regulatory approval process and, if approved, commercial launch activities, as well as in connection with the continued development of our technology platform and manufacturing capabilities. Based on our current operating plan, we believe that our available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operations through at least the next 12 months. However, our future capital requirements and the period for which we expect our existing resources to support our operations may vary significantly from what we expect, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned. Our monthly spending levels vary based on new and ongoing research and development and other corporate activities. Because the length of time and activities associated with successful research and development of our product candidates is highly uncertain, we are unable to estimate the actual funds we will require for development and any marketing and commercialization activities for approved products. For example, the timing and amount of our operating expenditures will depend largely on:\n\n•\n\nthe timing, progress and results of preclinical and worldwide clinical development activities;\n\n•\n\nthe costs associated with the development of our internal manufacturing and research and development facilities and processes;\n\n•\n\nthe number and scope of preclinical and clinical programs we decide to pursue;\n\n•\n\nour ability to partner luvelta and the economic terms of any such partnership; \n\n•\n\nthe progress of the development efforts of parties with whom we have entered or may in the future enter into collaborations and research and development agreements;\n\n•\n\nthe timing and amount of milestone and other payments we may receive under our collaboration and/or research and development agreements;\n\n41\n\n•\n\nour ability to establish and maintain collaborations, strategic partnerships or marketing, distribution, licensing or other strategic arrangements with third parties on favorable terms, if at all; \n\n•\n\nour ability to achieve sufficient market acceptance, adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors and adequate market share and revenue for any approved product candidates;\n\n•\n\nthe costs involved in prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent and other intellectual property claims;\n\n•\n\nthe costs of manufacturing our product candidates and those of our collaborators using our proprietary XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms;\n\n•\n\nthe cost and timing of regulatory approvals;\n\n•\n\nthe cost of commercialization activities if our product candidates or any future product candidates are approved for sale, including marketing, sales and distribution costs;\n\n•\n\nour efforts to enhance operational systems and hire and retain key personnel, including personnel to support development of our product candidates and satisfy our obligations as a public company; and\n\n•\n\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions, including market volatility, high levels of inflation, changes in interest rates, uncertainty with respect to the federal debt ceiling and budget and potential government shutdowns related thereto.\n\nIf we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis or on acceptable terms, we may have to delay, reduce or terminate our research and development programs and preclinical studies or clinical trials, limit strategic opportunities or undergo reductions in our workforce or other corporate restructuring activities. We also could be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise pursue on our own. We cannot provide assurance that anticipated collaborator payments will, in fact, be received. We do not expect to realize revenue from sales of commercial products or royalties from licensed products in the foreseeable future, if at all, and, in no event, before our product candidates are clinically tested, approved for commercialization and successfully marketed. To date, we have primarily financed our operations through payments received under our collaboration and other associated agreements, the sale of equity securities, debt financing and a royalty monetization agreement. We will be required to seek additional funding in the future and currently intend to do so through additional collaborations and/or licensing agreements, public or private equity offerings or debt financings, credit or loan facilities, royalty monetization or a combination of one or more of these funding sources. Additional funds may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.\n\nIf we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders will suffer dilution and the terms of any financing may adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. If we raise additional funds through licensing or collaboration arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. In addition, as a condition to providing additional funds to us, future investors may demand, and may be granted, rights superior to those of existing stockholders. Any future debt financings, if available, are likely to involve, restrictive covenants limiting our flexibility in conducting future business activities, and, in the event of insolvency, debt holders would be repaid before holders of our equity securities receive any distribution of our corporate assets. Failure to obtain capital when needed on acceptable terms may force us to delay, limit or terminate our product development and commercialization of our current or future product candidates, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nOur product candidates are in varying development stages and may fail in development or be impacted by competitive products or suffer delays that materially and adversely affect their commercial viability. If we or our collaborators are unable to complete development of or commercialize our product candidates or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\n\nWe have no products on the market and all of our product candidates for cancer therapy are in clinical development. Our most advanced product candidate, luvelta, is being evaluated in REFRαME-O1, a Phase 2/3 pivotal trial for treatment of women with platinum resistant ovarian cancer, as well as non-small cell lung cancer and children with pediatric AML. Additionally, we have programs that are being evaluated by partners in clinical trials and by us in earlier stages of discovery and preclinical development and may never advance to clinical-stage development. Our ability to achieve and\n\n42\n\nsustain profitability depends on obtaining regulatory approvals for and successfully commercializing our product candidates, either alone or with third parties, and we cannot guarantee you that we will ever obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. We have limited experience in conducting and managing the clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approvals, including approval by the FDA. Before obtaining regulatory approval for the commercial distribution of our product candidates, we or an existing or future collaborator must conduct extensive preclinical tests and clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy in humans of our product candidates.\n\nWe may not have the financial resources to continue development of, or to modify existing or enter into new collaborations for, a product candidate if we experience any issues that delay or prevent regulatory approval of, or our ability to commercialize, product candidates, including:\n\n•\n\nnegative or inconclusive results from our, or our licensees’ clinical trials, or the clinical trials of others for product candidates similar to ours, leading to a decision or requirement to conduct additional preclinical testing or clinical trials or abandon a program;\n\n•\n\nproduct-related side effects experienced by patients in our clinical trials or by individuals using drugs or therapeutic biologics similar to our product candidates;\n\n•\n\ndifficulty achieving successful continued development, or transfer to third-parties, of our internal manufacturing processes, including process development and scale-up activities to supply products for preclinical studies, clinical trials and commercial sale;\n\n•\n\ndelays in submitting INDs or comparable foreign applications or delays or failures in obtaining the necessary approvals from regulators to commence a clinical trial, or a suspension or termination of a clinical trial once commenced;\n\n•\n\nconditions imposed by the FDA or comparable foreign authorities regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials;\n\n•\n\ndelays in enrolling patients or high drop-out rates in our clinical trials;\n\n•\n\ninadequate supply or quality of product candidate components or materials or other supplies necessary for the conduct of our clinical trials;\n\n•\n\ninability to obtain alternative sources of supply for which we have a single source for product candidate components or materials;\n\n•\n\noccurrence of epidemics, pandemics or contagious diseases and potential effects on our business, clinical trial sites, highly complex supply chain and manufacturing facilities;\n\n•\n\ngreater than anticipated costs of our clinical programs;\n\n•\n\nharmful side effects or inability of our product candidates to meet efficacy endpoints during clinical trials, which can be unpredictable even in light of earlier non-clinical and clinical data;\n\n•\n\nfailure to demonstrate in our clinical trials a sufficient response rate or duration of response;\n\n•\n\nfailure to demonstrate a benefit-risk profile acceptable to the FDA or other regulatory agencies;\n\n•\n\nunfavorable FDA or other regulatory agency inspection and review of one or more of our clinical trial sites or manufacturing facilities;\n\n•\n\nfailure of our third-party contractors or investigators to comply with regulatory requirements or otherwise meet their contractual obligations in a timely manner, or at all;\n\n•\n\ndelays and changes in regulatory requirements, policy and guidelines, including the imposition of additional regulatory oversight around clinical testing generally or with respect to our technology in particular; and\n\n43\n\n•\n\nvarying interpretations of our data by the FDA and similar foreign regulatory agencies.\n\nAdditionally, we intend to identify a partner for luvelta who can provide financial resources and expertise for the multi-indication development and commercialization of luvelta. There can be no assurances that we will be able to identify a partner on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we cannot partner luvelta on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise finance luvelta development, we may significantly reduce or terminate our luvelta development efforts, which would materially alter our business strategy, and could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, including a decline in our stock price.\n\nWe or our collaborators’ inability to complete development of or commercialize our product candidates or significant delays in doing so due to one or more of these factors, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nOur business is dependent on the success of our product candidates, including luvelta, which is generated from our proprietary XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms. Existing and future preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates may not be successful. If we are unable to commercialize our product candidates or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\n\nWe have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in the development of our proprietary XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms and our proprietary product candidates, luvelta and STRO-004. Our ability to generate commercial product revenues, which we do not expect will occur for many years, if ever, will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of our product candidates. We have not previously submitted a new drug application, or NDA, or a biologics license application, or BLA, to the FDA, or similar regulatory approval filings to comparable foreign authorities, for any product candidate, and we cannot be certain that our product candidates will be successful in clinical trials or receive regulatory approval. In addition, while the REFRαME-O1 Phase 2/3 pivotal trial of luvelta is designed to support a regulatory approval for the treatment of women with platinum resistant ovarian cancer by the FDA or equivalent regulatory agencies, we cannot assure you that the FDA will agree with our conclusions or refrain from requiring additional data prior to approval. Further, our product candidates may not receive regulatory approval even if they are successful in clinical trials. If we do not receive regulatory approvals for our product candidates, we may not be able to continue our operations. Even if we successfully obtain regulatory approvals to market our product candidates, our revenues will be dependent, in part, upon the size of the markets in the territories for which we gain regulatory approval and have commercial rights. If the markets for patient subsets that we are targeting are not as significant as we estimate, we may not generate significant revenues from sales of such products, if approved.\n\nWe plan to seek regulatory approval to commercialize our product candidates both in the United States and in selected foreign countries. While the scope of regulatory approvals generally is similar in other countries, in order to obtain separate regulatory approvals in other countries, we must comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of such countries regarding safety and efficacy. Other countries also have their own regulations governing, among other things, clinical trials and commercial sales, as well as pricing and distribution of our product candidates, and we may be required to expend significant resources to obtain regulatory approval and to comply with ongoing regulations in these jurisdictions.\n\nThe success of luvelta, STRO-004 and our other future proprietary product candidates will depend on many factors, including the following:\n\n•\n\nsuccessful enrollment of patients in, and the completion of, our clinical trials;\n\n•\n\nreceiving required regulatory approvals for the development, manufacturing, and commercialization of our product candidates;\n\n•\n\nestablishing our commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers;\n\n•\n\nestablishing successful technology transfers and collaborations to develop our product candidates with licensees, including our licensees with rights to luvelta in Greater China;\n\n•\n\nobtaining and maintaining patent, trademark and trade secret protection and non-patent exclusivity for our product candidates and their components;\n\n44\n\n•\n\nenforcing and defending our intellectual property rights and claims and avoiding or defending against intellectual property rights and claims from third parties;\n\n•\n\nachieving desirable therapeutic properties for our product candidates’ intended indications;\n\n•\n\nlaunching commercial sales of our product candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with third parties;\n\n•\n\nacceptance of our product candidates, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;\n\n•\n\neffectively competing with other therapies, including those that have not yet entered the market;\n\n•\n\nmaintaining an acceptable safety profile of our product candidates through clinical trials and following regulatory approval; and\n\n•\n\nachieving commercially relevant success in the market post approval.\n\nMany of these factors are out of our control and if we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize our product candidates, which would materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nPatient enrollment, a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials, is affected by many factors including the size and nature of the patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the design of the clinical trial, competing clinical trials and clinicians’ and patients’ perceptions as to the potential advantages of the product candidate being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs or therapeutic biologics that may be approved for the indications being investigated by us. Furthermore, we expect to rely on our collaborators, CROs and clinical trial sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials and, while we expect to enter into agreements governing their committed activities, we have limited influence over their actual performance.\n\nWe could encounter delays if prescribing physicians encounter unresolved ethical issues associated with enrolling patients in clinical trials of our product candidates in lieu of prescribing existing treatments that have established safety and efficacy profiles.\n\nAdditionally, we have in the past and may in the future create benchmark molecules for comparative purposes. For example, we have created a benchmark FRα targeting antibody-drug conjugate, or ADC, using conventional technology that results in a heterogeneous ADC mixture. We have compared luvelta to this benchmark molecule in multiple preclinical models. We believe the results of these tests help us understand how the therapeutic index of luvelta compares to competitors’ product candidates. However, we cannot be certain that any benchmark molecule that we create is the same as the molecule we are attempting to recreate, and the results of the tests comparing any such benchmark molecule to any other potential or current product candidate may be different than the actual results of a head-to-head test of any such other potential or current product candidate against a competitor molecule. Additional preclinical and clinical testing will be needed to evaluate the therapeutic index of our potential or current product candidates, and to understand their therapeutic potential relative to other product candidates in development. While we believe our ADCs may be superior to other investigative agents in development, without head-to-head comparative data, we will not be able to make claims of superiority to other products in our promotional materials, if our product candidates are approved.\n\nIf we do not achieve our projected development goals in the time frames we anticipate and project, the commercialization of our products may be delayed and our stock price may decline.\n\nFrom time to time, we estimate the timing of the anticipated accomplishment of various scientific, clinical, regulatory, commercial and other product development goals, which we sometimes refer to as milestones. These milestones may include the commencement or completion of scientific studies and clinical trials and the submission of regulatory filings. From time to time, we may publicly announce the expected timing of some of these milestones. All of these milestones are and will be based on numerous assumptions. The actual timing of these milestones can vary dramatically compared to our estimates, in some cases for reasons beyond our control, such as health epidemics and pandemics, global instability and geopolitical conflicts within regions where our clinical trials are conducted. For example, we have opened a clinical trial site in Israel, which may face enrollment, operational or other difficulties due to conflicts within the region,\n\n45\n\nincluding, for example, difficulties importing clinical study drug through Israeli customs, difficulties with patient enrollment, or difficulties with patients or medical personnel accessing appropriate medical facilities. In addition, we rely on third party vendors, contractors and consultants to provide services in connection with our clinical trials. If these third parties do not perform their services in a timely or workmanlike manner, our clinical studies may be delayed. If we do not meet these milestones as publicly announced, or at all, the commercialization of our products may be delayed or never achieved and, as a result, our stock price may decline.\n\nOur approach to the discovery and development of our therapeutic treatments is based on novel technologies, including unprecedented Immunostimulatory Antibody Drug Conjugate, or iADC, and dual Antibody Drug Conjugates, or ADC2 technology, that are unproven and may not result in marketable products.\n\nWe are developing a pipeline of product candidates using our proprietary XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms. We believe that product candidates identified with our product discovery platform may offer an improved therapeutic approach by taking advantage of precision design and rapid empirical optimization, thereby reducing the dose-limiting toxic effects associated with existing products. However, the scientific research that forms the basis of our efforts to develop product candidates based on our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms is ongoing. Further, the scientific evidence to support the feasibility of developing therapeutic treatments based on our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms is both preliminary and limited.\n\nTo date, our clinical stage product candidates have been tested in a relatively limited number of clinical trial patients. We may ultimately discover that our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms and any product candidates resulting therefrom do not possess certain properties required for therapeutic effectiveness. XpressCF® product candidates may also be unable to remain stable in the human body for the period of time required for the drug to reach the target tissue or they may trigger immune responses that inhibit the ability of the product candidate to reach the target tissue or that cause adverse side effects in humans. We currently have only limited data, and no conclusive evidence, to suggest that we can introduce these necessary properties into these product candidates derived from our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms. We may spend substantial funds attempting to introduce these properties and may never succeed in doing so. In addition, product candidates based on our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms may demonstrate different chemical and pharmacological properties in patients than they do in laboratory studies. Although our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms and certain product candidates have produced successful results in animal studies, they may not demonstrate the same chemical and pharmacological properties in humans and may interact with human biological systems in unforeseen, ineffective or harmful ways. Further, in our oncology clinical trials to date, we have used achievement of stable disease as evidence for disease control (stable disease, partial response or complete response) by our product candidates; however, the FDA does not view stable disease as an objective response for the purposes of FDA approval.\n\nResults of our clinical trials could reveal a high and unacceptable severity and prevalence of side effects or unexpected characteristics. Undesirable side effects could result in the delay, suspension or termination of clinical trials by us or regulatory authorities for a number of reasons. In our clinical trials to date, our product candidates have been generally well tolerated, and the most common treatment-emergent adverse events, or TEAEs, that resulted in a treatment delay or dose reduction was reversible neutropenia and myalgia/arthralgia, which has also been observed as a TEAE. It is possible that, as we test our product candidates in larger, longer and more extensive clinical trials or as the use of our product candidates becomes more widespread following any regulatory approval, illnesses, injuries, discomforts and other adverse events that were observed in earlier trials, as well as conditions that did not occur or went undetected in previous trials, will be reported by patients. If such side effects become known later in development or upon approval, if any, such findings may harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects significantly.\n\nIf product candidates based on our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms are unable to demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy data to obtain marketing approval, we may never succeed in developing a marketable product, we may not become profitable and the value of our common stock will decline. The regulatory approval process for novel product candidates such as ours can be more expensive and take longer than for other, better known or extensively studied product candidates. We are not aware of any company currently developing a therapeutic using our approach to ADC, iADC or ADC2 development and no regulatory authority has granted approval for such a therapeutic. We believe the FDA has limited experience with therapeutics in oncology or other disease areas developed in cell-free-based synthesis systems, which may increase the complexity, uncertainty and length of the regulatory approval process for our product candidates. For example, our XpressCF® ADC product candidates contain cleavable or non-cleavable linker-warhead combinations or novel warheads that may result in unforeseen events when administered in a human. We and our existing or future collaborators may never receive approval to market and commercialize any product candidate. Even if we or an existing or future collaborator obtains regulatory approval, the approval may be for targets, disease indications or\n\n46\n\npatient populations that are not as broad as we intended or desired or may require labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings. We or an existing or future collaborator may be required to perform additional or unanticipated clinical trials to obtain approval or be subject to post-marketing testing requirements to maintain regulatory approval. If the products resulting from our XpressCF® platform prove to be ineffective, unsafe or commercially unviable, our entire platform and pipeline would have little, if any, value, which would have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nResults of preclinical studies and early clinical trials may not be predictive of results of future clinical trials.\n\nThe outcome of preclinical studies and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and preliminary results of clinical trials do not necessarily predict success in future clinical trials. Many companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials after achieving positive results in earlier development, and we could face similar setbacks. The design of a clinical trial can determine whether its results will support approval of a product, and flaws in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well advanced. While certain relevant members of our company have significant clinical experience, we in general have limited experience in designing clinical trials and may be unable to design and execute a clinical trial to support marketing approval. In addition, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses. Many companies that believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval for the product candidates. Even if we, current or future collaborators, believe that the results of clinical trials for our product candidates warrant marketing approval, the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree and may not grant marketing approval of our product candidates.\n\nIn some instances, there can be significant variability in safety or efficacy results between different clinical trials of the same product candidate due to numerous factors, including changes in trial procedures set forth in protocols, differences in the size and type of the patient populations, changes in and adherence to the dosing regimen and other clinical trial protocols and the rate of dropout among clinical trial patients. In addition, results from compassionate use of our product candidates, such as luvelta to treat pediatric CFB/GLIS AML, may not be confirmed in Company-sponsored trials and/or may negatively impact the prospects for marketing approval for our product candidates. If we fail to receive positive results in clinical trials of our product candidates, the development timeline and regulatory approval and commercialization prospects for our most advanced product candidates, and, correspondingly, our business and financial prospects would be negatively impacted.\n\nInterim, top-line, or preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce may change as more patient data become available and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data.\n\nFrom time to time, we have publicly disclosed, and in the future will disclose, interim, top-line, or preliminary data from our preclinical studies and clinical trials, which are based on preliminary analyses of then-available data, and the results and related findings and conclusions are subject to change following a more comprehensive review and/or maturation of the data related to the particular study or trial. We also make assumptions, estimations, calculations, and conclusions as part of our analyses of data, and we may not have received or had the opportunity to fully and carefully evaluate all data. Therefore, final results from the studies may differ from the top-line results initially reported, and the final results may indicate different conclusions once additional data have been evaluated. As such, top-line data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. In addition, the information we choose to publicly disclose regarding a particular study or clinical trial is based on what is typically extensive data, and you or others may not agree with what we determine is material or otherwise appropriate information to include in our disclosure. If the final results differ from the interim, top-line, or preliminary data, or if others, including regulatory authorities, disagree with the conclusions reached, our ability to obtain approval for, and to commercialize, our product candidates may be harmed, which may negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. Further, disclosure of interim data by us or by our competitors could result in volatility in the price of our common stock.\n\nFurther, others, including regulatory agencies, may not accept or agree with our assumptions, estimates, calculations, conclusions, or analyses, or may interpret or weigh the importance of data differently, which could negatively affect the approvability or commercialization of the particular product candidate.\n\n47\n\nThe market may not be receptive to our product candidates based on a novel therapeutic modality, and we may not generate any future revenue from the sale or licensing of product candidates.\n\nEven if regulatory approval is obtained for a product candidate, we may not generate or sustain revenue from sales of the product due to factors such as whether the product can be sold at a competitive cost, competition in the therapeutic area(s) we have received or may receive approval for, and whether it will otherwise be accepted in the market. Historically, there have been concerns regarding the safety and efficacy of ADCs, and an ADC drug was voluntarily withdrawn from the market for an extended period of time. These historical concerns may negatively impact the perception market participants have on ADCs, including our product candidates. Additionally, the product candidates that we are developing are based on our proprietary XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms, which are new technologies. Market participants with significant influence over acceptance of new treatments, such as physicians and third-party payors, may not adopt an ADC product, or a product or treatment based on our novel cell-free production technologies, and we may not be able to convince the medical community and third-party payors to accept and use, or to provide favorable reimbursement for, any product candidates developed by us or our existing or future collaborators. Market acceptance of our product candidates will depend on the following, among other factors:\n\n•\n\nthe timing of our receipt of any marketing and commercialization approvals;\n\n•\n\nthe terms of any approvals and the countries in which approvals are obtained;\n\n•\n\nthe safety and efficacy of our product candidates;\n\n•\n\nthe prevalence and severity of any adverse side effects associated with our product candidates;\n\n•\n\nlimitations or warnings contained in any labeling approved by the FDA or other regulatory authority;\n\n•\n\nrelative convenience and ease of administration of our product candidates;\n\n•\n\nthe willingness of patients to accept any new methods of administration;\n\n•\n\nthe success of our physician education programs;\n\n•\n\nthe availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from government and third-party payors;\n\n•\n\nthe availability of commercially approved companion diagnostic or assay or biomarker to appropriately identify patients that will benefit from treatment;\n\n•\n\nthe pricing of our products, particularly as compared to alternative treatments; and\n\n•\n\nthe availability of alternative effective treatments for the disease indications our product candidates are intended to treat and the relative risks, benefits and costs of those treatments.\n\nBecause our product candidates are based on new technology, we expect that they will require extensive research and development and have substantial manufacturing and processing costs. In addition, our estimates regarding potential market size for any indication may be materially different from what we discover to exist at the time we commence commercialization, if any, for a product, which could result in significant changes in our business plan and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Moreover, if any product candidate we commercialize fails to achieve market acceptance, it could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\niADC and ADC2 are novel technologies, which makes it difficult to predict the time, risks and cost of development and of subsequently obtaining regulatory approval of these potential product candidates.\n\nCertain of our preclinical product candidates are based on our proprietary iADC and ADC2 technology. Some of our future success depends on the successful development of this technology and products based on it. To our knowledge, no regulatory authority has granted approval to any person or entity, including us, to market and commercialize therapeutics using our novel and unprecedented iADC or ADC2 technology. We may never receive approval to market and commercialize any potential iADC or ADC2 product candidate.\n\n48\n\nIf we uncover any previously unknown risks related to our iADC and ADC2 technology, or if we experience unanticipated or unsolvable problems or delays in developing our iADC or ADC2 product candidates, we may be unable to complete our preclinical studies and clinical trials, meet the obligations of our collaboration and license agreements or commercialize our product candidates on a timely or profitable basis. If serious adverse events or unacceptable side effects are observed in preclinical studies or clinical trials of a product candidate based on our iADC or ADC2 technology, or if iADCs or ADC2s were shown to have limited efficacy, our ability to develop other product candidates based on our iADC or ADC2 technology would be adversely affected.\n\nWe have entered, and may in the future seek to enter, into collaborations with third parties for the development and commercialization of our product candidates using our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms. If we fail to enter into such collaborations, or such collaborations are not successful, we may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms and resulting product candidates.\n\nSince 2014, we have entered into several collaborations to develop and commercialize certain cancer and other therapeutics. Our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms have also supported a spin-out company, now known as Vaxcyte Inc., focused on discovery and development of vaccines for the treatment and prophylaxis of infectious disease. In addition, we may in the future seek third-party collaborators for research, development and commercialization of other therapeutic technologies or product candidates. Biopharmaceutical companies are our prior and likely future collaborators for any marketing, distribution, development, licensing or broader collaboration arrangements. With respect to our existing collaboration agreements, and what we expect will be the case with any future collaboration agreements, we have and would expect to have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators dedicate to the development or commercialization of our product candidates. Moreover, our ability to generate revenues from these arrangements will depend on our collaborators’ abilities to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements.\n\nCollaborations involving our product candidates currently pose, and will continue to pose, the following risks to us:\n\n•\n\ncollaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations;\n\n•\n\ncollaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of our product candidates or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on preclinical studies or clinical trial results, changes in the collaborators’ strategic focus or available funding, or external factors such as an acquisition that diverts resources or creates competing priorities;\n\n•\n\ncollaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\n•\n\ncollaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our product candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours;\n\n•\n\ncollaborators with marketing and distribution rights to one or more products may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of such product or products;\n\n•\n\ncollaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to litigation or potential liability;\n\n•\n\ncollaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability;\n\n•\n\ndisputes may arise between the collaborators and us that result in the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our product candidates or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources; and\n\n49\n\n•\n\ncollaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates.\n\nAs a result of the foregoing, our current and any future collaboration agreements may not lead to development or commercialization of our product candidates in the most efficient manner or at all. Moreover, if a collaborator of ours were to be involved in a business combination, the continued pursuit and emphasis on our product development or commercialization program could be delayed, diminished or terminated. Any failure to successfully develop or commercialize our product candidates pursuant to our current or any future collaboration agreements could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nOur existing collaborations with Astellas, Ipsen, Vaxcyte and Tasly are important to our business. If our collaborators cease development efforts under our existing or future collaboration agreements, fail to fulfill their contract obligations, or if any of those agreements are terminated, these collaborations may fail to lead to commercial products and we may never receive milestone payments or future royalties under these agreements.\n\nWe have entered into collaborations with other biotechnology companies to develop or commercialize several of our product candidates, and such collaborations currently represent a significant portion of our product pipeline and discovery and preclinical programs. A substantial portion of our revenue to date has been derived from our collaborations, and a significant portion of our future revenue and cash resources is expected to be derived from some of these agreements, our royalty monetization agreement (the \"Purchase Agreement\"), with an affiliate of Blackstone Life Sciences, or Blackstone, or other similar agreements into which we may enter in the future. Revenue from research and development collaborations depends upon continuation of the collaborations, payments for research and development and other services and product supply, and the achievement of milestones, contingent payments and royalties, if any, derived from future products developed from our research. If we are unable to successfully advance the development of our product candidates, achieve milestones or earn contingent payments under our collaboration agreements or royalty monetization agreement, future revenue and cash resources will be substantially less than expected.\n\nWe are unable to predict the success of our collaborations and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of our strategic collaborations. Our collaborators have discretion in determining and directing the efforts and resources, including the ability to discontinue all efforts and resources, they apply to the development and, if approval is obtained, commercialization and marketing of the product candidates covered by such collaborations. As a result, our collaborators may elect to de-prioritize our programs, change their strategic focus or pursue alternative technologies in a manner that results in reduced, delayed or no revenue to us. For example, each of EMD Serono, BMS and Merck elected not to continue the development of their licensed candidates and Astellas decided not to nominate a third program under our collaboration, each such decision was noted as based on strategic portfolio considerations. Our collaborators may have other marketed products and product candidates under collaboration with other companies, including some of our competitors, and their corporate objectives may not be consistent with our best interests. Our collaborators may also be unsuccessful in developing or commercializing our products. If our collaborations are unsuccessful, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected. Our collaborators may fail to live up to the terms of their agreements with us, which would require us to seek to enforce our agreements in accordance with the dispute resolution procedures set forth therein. These procedures may require us to engage in litigation or arbitration to enforce our rights, which can be expensive, time-consuming and distracting to our management and Board of Directors. Further, the type and timing of resolution of such disputes are difficult to predict; and there is the potential that we could fail to enforce our rights either in part or in whole. Lastly, even if we successfully enforce our rights under our agreements with our collaborators, there is the possibility that we could fail to recover our expectancy following the litigation or arbitration, particularly for collaborators that are not subject to the jurisdiction of U.S. courts.\n\nIn addition, from time to time we may have disputes with our collaborators. Any dispute or litigation proceedings we may have with our collaborators could delay development programs, reduce or eliminate potential milestone or other payments, create uncertainty as to ownership of intellectual property rights, distract management from other business activities and generate substantial expense.\n\nMoreover, to the extent that any of our existing or future collaborators were to terminate a collaboration agreement, we may be forced to independently develop these product candidates, including funding preclinical studies or clinical trials, assuming marketing and distribution costs and defending intellectual property rights, or, in certain instances, abandon product candidates altogether, any of which could result in a change to our business plan and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\n50\n\nWe may not successfully engage in strategic transactions, including any additional collaborations we seek, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize product candidates, impact our cash position, increase our expenses and present significant distractions to our management.\n\nFrom time to time, we may consider strategic transactions, such as additional collaborations, acquisitions of companies, asset purchases or sales and out- or in-licensing of product candidates or technologies that we believe will complement or augment our existing business. In particular, we will evaluate and, if strategically attractive, seek to enter into additional collaborations, including with major biotechnology or biopharmaceutical companies. The competition for collaborators is intense, and the negotiation process is time-consuming and complex. Any new collaboration may be on terms that are not optimal for us, and we may not be able to maintain any new collaboration if, for example, development or approval of a product candidate is delayed, sales of an approved product candidate do not meet expectations, or the collaborator terminates the collaboration. In addition, there have been a significant number of recent business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future strategic partners. Additionally, antitrust or other competition laws, including increased enforcement within the United States in the healthcare space, may also limit our ability to enter into collaborations with certain businesses or to fully realize the benefits of strategic transactions. Our ability to reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the strategic partner’s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed strategic partner’s evaluation of a number of factors. These factors may include the design or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States, the potential market for the subject product candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such product candidate to patients, the potential of competing products, the existence of uncertainty with respect to our ownership of technology, which can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership, without regard to the merits of the challenge, and industry and market conditions generally. Moreover, if we acquire assets with promising markets or technologies, we may not be able to realize the benefit of acquiring such assets due to an inability to successfully integrate them with our existing technologies and may encounter numerous difficulties in developing, manufacturing and marketing any new products resulting from a strategic acquisition that delay or prevent us from realizing their expected benefits or enhancing our business.\n\nWe cannot assure you that following any such collaboration, or other strategic transaction, we will achieve the expected synergies to justify the transaction. For example, such transactions may require us to incur non-recurring or other charges, increase our near- and long-term expenditures and pose significant integration or implementation challenges or disrupt our management or business. These transactions would entail numerous operational and financial risks, including exposure to unknown liabilities, disruption of our business and diversion of our management’s time and attention in order to manage a collaboration or develop acquired products, product candidates or technologies, incurrence of substantial debt or dilutive issuances of equity securities to pay transaction consideration or costs, higher than expected collaboration, acquisition or integration costs, write-downs of assets or goodwill or impairment charges, increased amortization expenses, difficulty and cost in facilitating the collaboration or combining the operations and personnel of any acquired business, impairment of relationships with key suppliers, manufacturers or customers of any acquired business due to changes in management and ownership and the inability to retain key employees of any acquired business.\n\nAccordingly, although there can be no assurance that we will undertake or successfully complete any transactions of the nature described above, any transactions that we do complete may be subject to the foregoing or other risks and would have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Conversely, any failure to enter any additional collaboration or other strategic transaction that would be beneficial to us could delay the development and potential commercialization of our product candidates and have a negative impact on the competitiveness of any product candidate that reaches market.\n\nTo date, no product developed on a cell-free manufacturing platform has received approval from the FDA, so the requirements for the manufacturing of products using our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms are uncertain.\n\nWe have invested in our own current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, compliant manufacturing facility in San Carlos, California. In this facility, we are developing and implementing novel, proprietary cell-free production technologies to supply our planned preclinical and clinical trials. However, before we may initiate a clinical trial or commercialize any of our product candidates, we must demonstrate to the FDA that the chemistry, manufacturing and controls for our product candidates meet applicable requirements, and in the European Union, or EU, a manufacturing authorization must be obtained from the appropriate EU regulatory authorities. The FDA has allowed clinical trial use of our product candidate luvelta and others of our or our partners’ product candidates, portions of which are manufactured in our San Carlos\n\n51\n\nmanufacturing facility; however, because no product manufactured on a cell-free manufacturing platform has yet been approved in the United States, there is no manufacturing facility that has demonstrated the ability to comply with FDA requirements for later stage clinical development or commercialization, and, therefore, the time frame for demonstrating compliance to the FDA’s satisfaction is uncertain. Delays in establishing that our manufacturing process and facility comply with cGMPs or disruptions in our manufacturing processes, implementation of novel in-house technologies or scale-up activities, may delay or disrupt our development efforts.\n\nWe have ongoing technology transfers to enable large scale manufacture of extract and the reagents necessary to manufacture our products using our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms. These large scale technology transfers may fail or be delayed, resulting in impacts to our development timelines and the costs associated with manufacturing our development products.\n\nWe expect to rely on third parties to conduct certain of our preclinical studies or clinical trials. If those third parties do not perform as contractually required, fail to satisfy regulatory or legal requirements or miss expected deadlines, our development program could be delayed with potentially material and adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nWe do not have the ability to independently conduct all aspects of our preclinical testing or clinical trials ourselves. We have accordingly relied in some cases and intend to rely in the future on third-party clinical investigators, clinical research organizations, or CROs, clinical data management organizations and consultants to assist or provide the design, conduct, supervision and monitoring of preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates. Because we intend to rely on these third parties and will not have the ability to conduct all preclinical studies or clinical trials independently, we will have less control over the timing, quality and other aspects of preclinical studies and clinical trials than we would have had we conducted them on our own. These investigators, CROs and consultants will not be our employees and we will have limited control over the amount of time and resources that they dedicate to our programs. These third parties may have contractual relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors, which may draw time and resources from our programs. The third parties with which we may contract might not be diligent, careful or timely in conducting our preclinical studies or clinical trials, resulting in the preclinical studies or clinical trials being delayed or unsuccessful.\n\nIf we cannot contract with acceptable third parties on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or if these third parties do not carry out their contractual duties, satisfy legal and regulatory requirements for the conduct of preclinical studies or clinical trials or meet expected deadlines, our clinical development programs could be delayed and otherwise adversely affected. In all events, we will be responsible for ensuring that each of our preclinical studies and clinical trials are conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial. The FDA requires preclinical studies to be conducted in accordance with good laboratory practices and clinical trials to be conducted in accordance with good clinical practices, including for designing, conducting, recording and reporting the results of preclinical studies and clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of clinical trial participants are protected. Our reliance on third parties that we do not control will not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements. Any adverse development or delay in our preclinical studies or clinical trials as a result of our reliance on third parties could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nOur inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of our product candidates, or the loss of our third-party suppliers, or our or their failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements or to supply sufficient quantities at acceptable quality levels or prices, or at all, would materially and adversely affect our business.\n\nManufacturing is a vital component of our business strategy. To ensure timely and consistent product supply, we currently use a hybrid product supply approach wherein certain elements of our product candidates are manufactured internally at our manufacturing facilities in San Carlos, California, and other elements, including raw and intermediate materials, are manufactured at qualified third-party CMOs. Since our own manufacturing facilities may be limited or unable to manufacture certain of our preclinical and clinical trial product materials and supplies, we rely on third-party contract manufacturers to manufacture such clinical trial product materials and supplies for our or our collaborator’s needs. For example, we have entered into a manufacturing agreement with EMD Millipore Corporation to perform conjugation of the applicable linker-warhead with the antibody component of our luvelta product candidate. Further, we have entered into a manufacturing agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim Biopharmaceuticals GmbH for commercial scale manufacture of the antibody component of luvelta. We have also entered into agreements with Capua Bioservices, S.p.A. and with AGC Biologics GmbH for the manufacture of certain reagents used in the manufacture of our products with our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms. There can be no assurance that our preclinical and clinical development product supplies will not be limited, interrupted, or of satisfactory quality or continue to be available at acceptable prices. Further, while efforts are\n\n52\n\nmade to diversify our sources of raw and intermediate materials, in certain instances we acquire raw and intermediate materials from a sole supplier. In particular, any replacement of our manufacturer could require significant effort and expertise because there may be a limited number of qualified replacements. In addition, replacement of a manufacturer may require a technology transfer to the new manufacturer, which involves technical risk that the transfer may not succeed or may be delayed, and which can incur significant costs.\n\nThe manufacturing process for a product candidate is subject to FDA and foreign regulatory authority review. We, and our suppliers and manufacturers, must meet applicable manufacturing requirements and undergo rigorous facility and process validation tests required by regulatory authorities in order to comply with regulatory standards, such as cGMPs. If we or our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, we may not be able to rely on our or their manufacturing facilities for the manufacture of elements of our product candidates. Moreover, we do not control the manufacturing process at our contract manufacturers and are completely dependent on them for compliance with current regulatory requirements. In the event that any of our manufacturers fails to comply with such requirements or to perform its obligations in relation to quality, timing or otherwise, or if our supply of components or other materials becomes limited or interrupted for other reasons, we may be forced to manufacture the materials ourselves or enter into an agreement with another third party, which we may not be able to do on reasonable terms, if at all. In some cases, the technical skills or technology required to manufacture our product candidates may be unique or proprietary to the original manufacturer and we may have difficulty applying such skills or technology ourselves, or in transferring such to another third party. These factors would increase our reliance on such manufacturer or require us to obtain a license from such manufacturer in order to enable us, or to have another third party, manufacture our product candidates. If we are required to change manufacturers for any reason, we will be required to verify that the new manufacturer maintains facilities and procedures that comply with quality standards and with all applicable regulations and guidelines; and we may be required to repeat some of the development program. The delays associated with the verification of a new manufacturer could negatively affect our ability to develop product candidates in a timely manner or within budget.\n\nWe expect to continue to rely on third-party manufacturers if we receive regulatory approval for any product candidate. To the extent that we have existing, or enter into future, manufacturing arrangements with third parties, we will depend on these third parties to perform their obligations in a timely manner consistent with contractual and regulatory requirements, including those related to quality control and assurance. If we are unable to obtain or maintain third-party manufacturing for product candidates, or to do so on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to develop and commercialize our product candidates successfully. Our or a third party’s failure to execute on our manufacturing requirements and comply with cGMPs could adversely affect our business in a number of ways, including:\n\n•\n\nan inability to initiate or continue clinical trials of product candidates under development;\n\n•\n\ndelay in submitting regulatory applications, or receiving regulatory approvals, for product candidates;\n\n•\n\nloss of an existing or future collaborator;\n\n•\n\nlosses resulting from an inability to utilize reserved manufacturing capacity because of delays or difficulties encountered in the supply chain;\n\n•\n\nsubjecting third-party manufacturing facilities or our manufacturing facilities to additional inspections by regulatory authorities;\n\n•\n\nrequirements to cease distribution or to recall batches of our product candidates; and\n\n•\n\nin the event of approval to market and commercialize a product candidate, an inability to meet commercial demands for our products.\n\nAdditionally, we and our contract manufacturers may experience manufacturing difficulties due to resource constraints or as a result of labor disputes, unstable political environments, or epidemics, pandemics, or contagious diseases or failures or delays in our manufacturing supply chain. For example, restrictions on travel imposed by governments, including China, or restrictions on person-in-plant permissions imposed by our contract manufacturers may limit the ability of our subject matter experts to visit our manufacturers and assist with technology transfers. Further, legislation has been introduced in Congress to limit certain U.S. biotechnology companies from using equipment or services produced or provided by select Chinese biotechnology companies, and others in Congress have advocated for the use of existing\n\n53\n\nexecutive branch authorities to limit those Chinese service providers’ ability to engage in business in the U.S. We cannot predict what actions may ultimately be taken with respect to trade relations between the United States and China or other countries, what products and services may be subject to such actions or what actions may be taken by the other countries in retaliation. If we or our contract manufacturers were to encounter interruptions from any of these events or other unforeseen events, our ability to provide our product candidates to patients in clinical trials, or to provide product for treatment of patients once approved, would be jeopardized.\n\nWe, or third-party manufacturers, may be unable to successfully scale-up manufacturing of our product candidates or materials used to manufacture components of our product candidates in sufficient quality and quantity, which would delay or prevent us from developing our product candidates and commercializing approved products, if any.\n\nIn order to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates, we will need to manufacture them in large quantities. We, or any manufacturing partners, may be unable to successfully increase the manufacturing capacity for any of our product candidates in a timely or cost-effective manner, or at all. In addition, quality issues may arise during scale-up activities. If we, or any manufacturing partners, are unable to successfully scale up the manufacture of our product candidates, or materials used in manufacturing components of our product candidates, in sufficient quality and quantity, the development, testing, and clinical trials of that product candidate may be delayed or infeasible, and regulatory approval or commercial launch of any resulting product may be delayed or not obtained, which could significantly harm our business.\n\nScaling up a biologic manufacturing process is a difficult and uncertain task, and we may not be successful in transferring our production system or our third-party manufacturers may not have the necessary capabilities to complete the implementation and development process. If we are unable to adequately validate or scale-up the manufacturing process at our own manufacturing facilities or those of our current manufacturers, we will need to transfer to another manufacturer and complete the manufacturing validation process, which can be lengthy. If we are able to adequately validate and scale-up the manufacturing process for our product candidates at our manufacturing facility or with a contract manufacturer, we will still need to negotiate with such contract manufacturer an agreement for commercial supply and it is not certain we will be able to come to agreement on terms acceptable to us.\n\nThe manufacture of biologics is complex and we or our third-party manufacturers may encounter difficulties in production. If we or any of our third-party manufacturers encounter such difficulties, our ability to provide supply of our product candidates for clinical trials, our ability to obtain marketing approval, or our ability to provide supply of our products for patients, if approved, could be delayed or stopped.\n\nOur product candidates are considered to be biologics and the process of manufacturing biologics and materials used to manufacture components of our products can be complex, time-consuming, highly regulated and subject to multiple risks. We and our contract manufacturers must comply with cGMPs, regulations and guidelines for the manufacturing of biologics used in clinical trials and, if approved, marketed products. To date, we and our contract manufacturers have limited experience in the manufacturing of cGMP batches of our product candidates and materials used to manufacture components of our product candidates.\n\nManufacturing biologics is highly susceptible to product loss due to contamination, equipment failure, improper installation or operation of equipment, vendor or operator error, inconsistency in yields, variability in product characteristics and difficulties in scaling the production process. Even minor deviations from normal manufacturing processes could result in reduced production yields, product defects and other supply disruptions. If microbial, viral or other contaminations are discovered at our manufacturing facilities or those of our third-party manufacturers, such facilities may need to be closed for an extended period of time to investigate and remedy the contamination, which could delay clinical trials and adversely harm our business. Moreover, if the FDA determines that our manufacturing facilities or those of our third-party manufacturers are not in compliance with FDA laws and regulations, including those governing cGMPs, the FDA may deny BLA approval until the deficiencies are corrected or we replace the manufacturer in our BLA with a manufacturer that is in compliance.\n\nIn addition, there are risks associated with large scale manufacturing for clinical trials or commercial scale including, among others, cost overruns, potential problems with process scale-up, process reproducibility, stability issues, compliance with cGMPs, lot consistency, timely availability of raw materials and other technical challenges. Even if we or our collaborators obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, there is no assurance that manufacturers will be able to manufacture the approved product to specifications acceptable to the FDA or other regulatory authorities, to produce it in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements for the potential launch of the product or to meet potential future demand. If our manufacturers are unable to produce sufficient quantities for clinical trials or for commercialization,\n\n54\n\ncommercialization efforts would be impaired, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nWe cannot assure you that any stability or other issues relating to the manufacture of any of our product candidates or products will not occur in the future. If we or our third-party manufacturers were to encounter any of these difficulties, our ability to provide any product candidates to patients in planned clinical trials and products to patients, once approved, would be jeopardized. Any delay or interruption in the supply of clinical trial supplies could delay the completion of planned clinical trials, increase the costs associated with maintaining clinical trial programs and, depending upon the period of delay, require us to commence new clinical trials at additional expense or terminate clinical trials completely. Any adverse developments affecting clinical or commercial manufacturing of our product candidates or products, such as epidemics, pandemics or contagious diseases, may result in shipment delays, inventory shortages, lot failures, product withdrawals or recalls, or other interruptions in the supply of our product candidates or products. We may also have to take inventory write-offs and incur other charges and expenses for product candidates or products that fail to meet specifications, undertake costly remediation efforts or seek more costly manufacturing alternatives. Accordingly, failures or difficulties faced at any level of our supply chain could adversely affect our business and delay or impede the development and commercialization of any of our product candidates or products, if approved, and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nAs part of our process development efforts, we also may make changes to our manufacturing processes at various points during development, for various reasons, such as controlling costs, achieving scale, decreasing processing time, increasing manufacturing success rate or other reasons. Such changes carry the risk that they will not achieve their intended objectives, and any of these changes could cause our product candidates to perform differently and affect the results of our ongoing clinical trials or future clinical trials. In some circumstances, changes in the manufacturing process may require us to perform ex vivo comparability studies and to collect additional data from patients prior to undertaking more advanced clinical trials. For instance, changes in our process during the course of clinical development may require us to show the comparability of the product used in earlier clinical phases or at earlier portions of a trial to the product used in later clinical phases or later portions of the trial.\n\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to use our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms to expand our pipeline of product candidates and develop marketable products.\n\nThe success of our business depends in large part upon our ability to identify, develop and commercialize products based on our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms. Luvelta is our most advanced clinical stage program, and our preclinical and research programs may fail to identify other potential product candidates for clinical development for a number of reasons. Our research methodology may be unsuccessful in identifying potential product candidates or our potential product candidates may be shown to have harmful side effects or may have other characteristics that may make the products unmarketable or unlikely to receive marketing approval. If any of these events occur, we may be forced to abandon our development efforts for a program or for multiple programs, which would materially harm our business and could potentially cause us to cease operations. Research programs to identify new product candidates require substantial technical, financial and human resources. We may focus our efforts and resources on potential programs or product candidates that ultimately prove to be unsuccessful.\n\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate and fail to capitalize on product candidates that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\n\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus our research and development efforts on certain selected product candidates. As a result, we may forgo or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable product candidates. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate. For example, in June 2023, we announced our Purchase Agreement with Blackstone and in April 2024 we announced our License Agreement with Ipsen.\n\n55\n\nFailure to successfully validate, develop and obtain regulatory approval for companion diagnostics for our product candidates could harm our drug development strategy and operational results.\n\nIf companion diagnostics are developed in conjunction with clinical programs, the FDA may require regulatory approval of a companion diagnostic as a condition to approval of the product candidate. For example, as we are developing luvelta for treatment of patients having ovarian cancer with elevated FRα expression levels, we are likely to be required to obtain FDA approval or clearance of a companion diagnostic, concurrent with approval of luvelta, to test for elevated FRα expression. We do not have experience or capabilities in developing or commercializing diagnostics and plan to rely in large part on third parties to perform these functions. We have entered into an agreement to develop diagnostic assays suitable for use as a companion diagnostic for luvelta. Companion diagnostics are subject to regulation by the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities as medical devices and require separate regulatory approval or clearance prior to commercialization. We may also be required to demonstrate to the FDA the predictive utility of the companion diagnostic—namely, that the diagnostic selects for patients in whom the biologic therapy will be effective or more effective compared to patients not selected for by the diagnostic.\n\nIf we or our collaborators, or any third party, are unable to successfully develop companion diagnostics for our product candidates, or experience delays in doing so:\n\n•\n\nthe development of our product candidates may be adversely affected if we are unable to appropriately select patients for enrollment in our planned clinical trials;\n\n•\n\nour product candidates may not receive marketing approval if their safe and effective use depends on a companion diagnostic; and\n\n•\n\nwe may not realize the full commercial potential of any product candidates that receive marketing approval if, among other reasons, we are unable to appropriately identify patients with the specific genetic alterations targeted by our product candidates.\n\nIn addition, although we believe genetic testing is becoming more prevalent in the diagnosis and treatment of various diseases and conditions, our product candidates may be perceived negatively compared to alternative treatments that do not require the use of companion diagnostics, either due to the additional cost of the companion diagnostic or the need to complete additional procedures to identify genetic markers prior to administering our product candidates. If any of these events were to occur, our business would be harmed, possibly materially.\n\nWe face competition from entities that have developed or may develop product candidates for cancer, including companies developing novel treatments and technology platforms. If these companies develop technologies or product candidates more rapidly than we do or their technologies are more effective, our ability to develop and successfully commercialize product candidates may be adversely affected.\n\nThe development and commercialization of drugs and therapeutic biologics is highly competitive. Our product candidates, if approved, will face significant competition and our failure to effectively compete may prevent us from achieving significant market penetration. Most of our competitors have significantly greater resources, including financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, sales, supply, human resources, or general experience than we do and we may not be able to successfully compete. We compete with a variety of multinational biopharmaceutical companies, specialized biotechnology companies and emerging biotechnology companies, as well as with technologies and product candidates being developed at universities and other research institutions. Our competitors have developed, are developing or will develop product candidates and processes competitive with our product candidates and processes. Competitive therapeutic treatments include those that have already been approved and accepted by the medical community and any new treatments, including those based on novel technology platforms, that enter the market. We believe that a significant number of products are currently under development, and may become commercially available in the future, for the treatment of conditions for which we are trying, or may try, to develop product candidates. There is intense and rapidly evolving competition in the biotechnology, biopharmaceutical and antibody and immunoregulatory therapeutics fields. While we believe that our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms, associated intellectual property and our scientific and technical know-how give us a competitive advantage in this space, competition from many sources exists or may arise in the future. Our competitors include larger and well-funded biopharmaceutical, biotechnological and therapeutics companies, including large and specialty companies focused on cancer immunotherapies and ADCs, as well as numerous small and mid-cap companies. Moreover, we also compete with current and future therapeutics developed at research-stage biotechnology companies, universities and other research institutions.\n\n56\n\nWe are aware of several companies that are developing ADCs, cytokine derivatives, bispecific antibodies and cancer immunotherapies, including companies developing ADCs directed to the same target as luvelta. For example, Immunogen recently received approval for a folate receptor α targeted ADC, mirvetuximab soravtansine (Elahere®) and was subsequently acquired by Abbvie Inc. In addition, large pharmaceutical companies and smaller biotechnology companies are developing other ADCs; and we anticipate more FRα-targeting ADCs and other potential FRα-targeting modalities to be evaluated in the clinic in the coming years. Further, other companies may develop ADCs targeting receptors other than folate receptor α for the treatment of the same indications for which we are developing luvelta. Many of these companies are well-capitalized and, in contrast to us, have significant clinical experience, and may include our existing or future collaborators. In addition, these companies compete with us in recruiting scientific and managerial talent.\n\nOur success will depend partially on our ability to develop and protect therapeutics that are safer and more effective than competing products. Our commercial opportunity and success will be reduced or eliminated if competing products are safer, more effective, or less expensive than the therapeutics we develop.\n\nIf our most advanced product candidates are approved, they will compete with a range of therapeutic treatments that are either in development or currently marketed. Currently marketed oncology therapeutics include a range of biologic modalities with the top selling products by class spanning tumor targeting monoclonal antibodies, to ADCs, to immune checkpoint inhibitors, to T cell-engager immunotherapies, and to CAR-T cell therapies. In addition, numerous compounds are in clinical development for cancer treatment. The clinical development pipeline for cancer includes small molecules, antibodies, vaccines, cell therapies and immunotherapies from a variety of companies and institutions.\n\nFurther, if we successfully obtain approval for any product candidate, we will face competition based on many different factors, including the safety and effectiveness of our products, the ease with which our products can be administered and the extent to which patients accept relatively new routes of administration, the timing and scope of regulatory approvals for these products, the availability and cost of manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities, price, reimbursement, coverage and patent position. Competing products could present superior treatment alternatives, including by being more effective, safer, less expensive, or marketed and sold more effectively than any products we may develop. Competitive products may make any products we develop obsolete or noncompetitive before we recover the expense of developing and commercializing our product candidates.\n\nAny inability to attract and retain qualified key management and technical personnel would impair our ability to implement our business plan.\n\nWe are highly dependent on the research and development, clinical development, manufacturing, and business development expertise of our management team, advisors and other specialized personnel. The loss of one or more members of our management team or other key employees or advisors could delay our research and development programs and have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. The relationships that our key managers have cultivated within our industry make us particularly dependent upon their continued employment with us. We are dependent on the continued service of our technical personnel because of the highly technical nature of our product candidates and XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platform technologies and the specialized nature of the regulatory approval process. Because our management team and key employees are not obligated to provide us with continued service, they could terminate their employment with us at any time without penalty. Our future success will depend in large part on our continued ability to attract and retain other highly qualified scientific, technical and management personnel, as well as personnel with expertise in clinical testing, manufacturing, governmental regulation and commercialization. We face competition for personnel from other companies, universities, public and private research institutions, government entities and other organizations. Should our competitors recruit our key employees, our level of expertise and ability to execute our business plan would be negatively impacted. Further, if we are unable to continue to attract and retain high-quality personnel, the rate and success at which we can discover and develop product candidates will be limited, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nWe will need to grow our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing our growth and expanding our operations.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had 306 full-time employees. As our development and commercialization plans and strategies develop, we expect to expand our employee base for managerial, operational, financial and other resources. In addition, we have limited experience in product development and began our first clinical trial in 2018. As our product candidates enter and advance through preclinical studies and clinical trials, we will need to expand our development, regulatory and manufacturing capabilities or contract with other organizations to provide these capabilities for us. In the\n\n57\n\nfuture, we expect to have to manage additional relationships with collaborators or partners, suppliers and other organizations. Our ability to manage our operations and future growth will require us to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures. We may not be able to implement improvements to our management information and control systems in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls. Our inability to successfully manage our growth and expand our operations could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nIf any of our product candidates are approved for marketing and commercialization and we are unable to develop sales, marketing and distribution capabilities on our own or enter into agreements with third parties to perform these functions on acceptable terms, we will be unable to commercialize successfully any such future products.\n\nWe currently have limited sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or experience. If any of our product candidates are approved, we will need to develop additional sales, marketing and distribution capabilities to commercialize such products, which would be expensive and time consuming, or enter into collaborations with third parties to perform these services. If we decide to market our products directly, we will need to commit significant financial and managerial resources to develop a marketing and sales force with technical expertise and support distribution, administration and compliance capabilities. If we rely on third parties with such capabilities to market our products or decide to co-promote products with collaborators, we will need to establish and maintain marketing and distribution arrangements with third parties, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into such arrangements on acceptable terms or at all. In entering third-party marketing or distribution arrangements, any revenue we receive will depend upon the efforts of the third parties and there can be no assurance that such third parties will establish adequate sales and distribution capabilities or be successful in gaining market acceptance or adoption of any approved product. If we are not successful in commercializing any product approved in the future, either on our own or through third parties, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nOur future growth may depend, in part, on our ability to operate in foreign markets, where we would be subject to additional regulatory burdens and other risks and uncertainties.\n\nOur future growth may depend, in part, on our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates in foreign markets, for which we may rely on collaboration with third parties. We are not permitted to market or promote any of our product candidates before we receive regulatory approval from the applicable regulatory authority in that foreign market and may never receive such regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. To obtain separate regulatory approval in many other countries, we must comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of such countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials and commercial sales, pricing and distribution of our product candidates, and we cannot predict success in these jurisdictions. If we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements in international markets and do not receive applicable marketing approvals, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our product candidates will be harmed and our business will be adversely affected. We may not obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all. Our failure to obtain approval of any of our product candidates by regulatory authorities in another country may significantly diminish the commercial prospects of that product candidate and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. Moreover, even if we obtain approval of our product candidates and ultimately commercialize our product candidates in foreign markets, we would be subject to the risks and uncertainties, including the burden of complying with complex and changing foreign regulatory, tax, accounting and legal requirements and reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some foreign countries.\n\nPrice controls imposed in either the U.S. or foreign markets may adversely affect our future profitability.\n\nRecently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in recent Executive Orders, several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. Current and future presidential budget proposals and future legislation may contain further drug price control measures that could be enacted. Congress and current and future U.S. presidential administrations may continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage\n\n58\n\nimportation from other countries and bulk purchasing. If such pricing controls are enacted and are set at unsatisfactory levels, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nAdditionally, in some countries, particularly member states of the EU, the pricing of prescription drugs is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after receipt of marketing approval for a product. In addition, there can be considerable pressure by governments and other stakeholders on prices and reimbursement levels, including as part of cost containment measures. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various EU member states and parallel distribution, or arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices. In some countries, we or current or future collaborators may be required to conduct a clinical trial or other studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of our therapeutic candidates to other available therapies in order to obtain or maintain reimbursement or pricing approval. Publication of discounts by third-party payors or authorities may lead to further pressure on the prices or reimbursement levels within the country of publication and other countries. If reimbursement of any product candidate approved for marketing is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nOur business entails a significant risk of product liability and our ability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nAs we are conducting clinical trials of our product candidates, we may be exposed to significant product liability risks inherent in the development, testing, manufacturing and marketing of therapeutic treatments. Product liability claims could delay or prevent completion of our development programs. If we succeed in marketing products, such claims could result in an FDA investigation of the safety and effectiveness of our products, our manufacturing processes and facilities or our marketing programs and potentially a recall of our products or more serious enforcement action, limitations on the approved indications for which they may be used or suspension or withdrawal of approvals. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may also result in decreased demand for our products, injury to our reputation, costs to defend the related litigation, a diversion of management’s time and our resources, substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients and a decline in our stock price. While we currently have product liability insurance that we believe is appropriate for our stage of development, we may need to obtain higher levels prior to later stages of clinical development or marketing any of our product candidates. Any insurance we have or may obtain may not provide sufficient coverage against potential liabilities. Furthermore, clinical trial and product liability insurance is becoming increasingly expensive. As a result, we may be unable to obtain sufficient insurance at a reasonable cost to protect us against losses caused by product liability claims that could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nOur employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\n\nAs with all companies, we are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations, provide accurate information to the FDA, comply with manufacturing standards we may establish, comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, inappropriately share confidential and proprietary information externally, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, loss of eligibility to obtain approvals from the FDA, exclusion from participation in government contracting, healthcare reimbursement or other government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, or reputational harm.\n\n59\n\nMoreover, our employees are increasingly utilizing social media tools and our website as a means of communication. Despite our efforts to monitor social media communications, there is risk that the unauthorized use of social media by our employees to communicate about our products or business, or any inadvertent disclosure of material, nonpublic information through these means, may result in violations of applicable laws and regulations, which may give rise to liability and result in harm to our business. In addition, there is also risk of inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information, which could result in significant legal and financial exposure and reputational damages that could potentially have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Our employees could also inappropriately utilize artificial intelligence, or AI, in connection with their social media communications, introducing another potential source of reputational damage or other potential legal or financial exposure.\n\nWe depend on our information technology systems, and any failure of these systems, or those of our CROs, third-party vendors, or other contractors or consultants we may utilize, could harm our business. Security breaches, cyber-attacks, loss of data, and other disruptions could compromise sensitive information related to our business or other personal information or prevent us from accessing critical information and expose us to liability, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\n\nWe collect, use and store information in digital form that is necessary to conduct our business, and we are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure to operate our business. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, use, store and transmit large amounts of confidential information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information health information, and personal information. We have established physical, electronic and organizational measures designed to safeguard and secure our systems to prevent a data security incident (which may include, for example: data breaches, viruses or other malicious code, coordinated attacks, data loss, phishing attacks, ransomware, denial of service attacks, or other security or information technology incidents caused by threat actors, technological vulnerabilities or human error), and rely on commercially available systems, software, tools, and monitoring to provide security for our information technology systems and the processing, transmission and storage of digital information. We have also outsourced elements of our information technology infrastructure, and as a result, a number of third-party vendors may or could have access to our confidential information subject to contractual protections. Our internal information technology systems and infrastructure, and those of our current and any future collaborators, CROs, third-party vendors, contractors and consultants and other third parties on which we rely, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, malware, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication and electrical failures, cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions over the internet, attachments to emails, persons inside our organization, or persons with access to systems inside our organization.\n\nThe risk of a formal security breach or disruption or data loss, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. For example, targeted deep fakes supported by sophisticated AI tools and other forms of impersonation of our executives are becoming increasingly prevalent. In addition, the prevalent use of mobile devices that access confidential information increases the risk of data security breaches, which could lead to the loss of confidential information or other intellectual property. The costs to us or our CROs or other contractors or consultants we may utilize to mitigate a data security incident and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and while we have implemented security measures designed to protect our data security and information technology systems, our efforts to address these problems may not be successful, and these problems could result in unexpected interruptions, delays, cessation of service and other harm to our business and our competitive position. We have incurred successful phishing attempts in the past, although we believe that these attempts were detected and neutralized without any compromise to our data and prior to any significant impact to our business. We have also implemented measures to prevent such attacks, but we may still be subject to similar attacks in the future. We are also aware of publicly disclosed security breaches at certain third parties on which we rely. If such an event were to occur, whether to us or a third party on which we rely, and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our product development programs. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing or planned clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Further, if we are unable to generate or maintain access to essential patient samples or data for our research, development, and manufacturing activities for our programs, our business could be materially adversely affected.\n\nMoreover, if a computer security breach affects our systems or results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information, our reputation could be materially damaged. Such a breach may require formal notification to governmental agencies, the media or individuals pursuant to various federal and state privacy and security laws, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information\n\n60\n\nTechnology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and its implementing rules and regulations, regulations promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission and state breach notification laws. We also may be subject to global privacy laws, such as Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. We would also be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and potential liability under laws, regulations and contracts that protect the privacy and security of personal information that may result in regulatory scrutiny, fines, private right of action settlements, and other consequences. Compliance with these and any other applicable privacy and data security laws and regulations is a rigorous and time-intensive process, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules and possible government oversight. Our failure to comply with such laws or to adequately secure the information we hold could result in significant liability or reputational harm and, in turn, a material adverse effect on our client base, member base and revenue.\n\nOur information technology systems could face serious disruptions that could adversely affect our business.\n\nOur information technology and other internal infrastructure systems, including corporate firewalls, servers, leased lines, and connection to the Internet, face the risk of systemic failure that could disrupt our operations. A significant disruption in the availability of our information technology and other internal infrastructure systems could cause interruptions and delays in our research and development and manufacturing work.\n\nFurther, some of our employees work remotely from time to time, which presents certain risks to our business. For example, remote work presents significant demands on our information technology resources and systems and can be at risk for phishing and other malicious activity, which can result in an increase to the number of points of potential exposure, such as laptops and mobile devices, that need to be secured. Any failure to effectively manage these risks, including to timely identify and appropriately respond to any security incidents, may adversely affect our business.\n\nIn our ongoing efforts to innovate and optimize operational efficiency, we have integrated AI into various aspects of our workplace. For example, we are implementing AI machine learning for email behavioral monitoring. While AI presents opportunities for enhanced productivity and innovation, it also introduces inherent risks, including legal and regulatory, that could adversely impact our business and reputation. Proper use of AI can lead to improved decision-making, cost reduction, and competitive advantage. However, improper use, including algorithmic biases, ethical considerations, data privacy issues, unknown or zero-day software vulnerabilities, and potential regulatory non-compliance, could result in reputational damage, legal liabilities, and financial losses. The rapidly evolving regulatory landscape surrounding AI also poses a risk, as new laws and regulations could impose additional compliance burdens, resulting in increased operational costs. We are committed to implementing robust governance and control mechanisms to mitigate these risks, but there can be no assurance that such measures will adequately prevent or mitigate the adverse effects that the integration and use of AI may have on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nIf we do not comply with laws regulating the protection of the environment and health and human safety, our business could be affected adversely.\n\nOur research, development and manufacturing involve the use of hazardous chemicals and materials, including radioactive materials. We maintain quantities of various flammable and toxic chemicals in our facilities in South San Francisco and San Carlos, California that are required for our research, development and manufacturing activities. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. We and our third-party contractors are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous chemicals and materials. We believe our and our third-party contractors’ procedures for storing, handling and disposing these materials in our South San Francisco and San Carlos facilities comply with the relevant guidelines of the two municipalities, the county of San Mateo, the state of California and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the U.S. Department of Labor. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards mandated by applicable regulations, including employee and contractor training and procedures regarding safe handling and disposal, the risk of accidental or mistaken contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated. If an accident occurs, we could be held liable for resulting damages, which could be substantial and exceed any available insurance. We are also subject to numerous environmental, health and workplace safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures, exposure to blood-borne pathogens and the handling of animals and biohazardous materials. Although we maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of these materials or from other hazards potentially present in our workplaces, such as high voltage electricity, process steam or other hot material, liquid nitrogen or other cold material, materials stored under pressure, laboratory instruments that incorporate powerful lasers or magnets, sonic resonance, heavy machinery, and the like, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against\n\n61\n\npotential liabilities. While we maintain pollution legal liability insurance for our manufacturing facility in San Carlos, California, we do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological or hazardous materials in our other locations. Additional federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting our operations may be adopted in the future and existing laws and regulations could become more stringent. Further, we may incur substantial costs to comply with, and substantial fines or penalties if we violate, any of these laws or regulations.\n\nWe are subject to certain U.S. and foreign anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, export control, sanctions and other trade laws and regulations. We can face serious consequences for violations.\n\nU.S. and foreign anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, export control, sanctions and other trade laws and regulations prohibit, among other things, companies and their employees, agents, CROs, CMOs, legal counsel, accountants, consultants, contractors and other partners from authorizing, promising, offering, providing, soliciting, or making or receiving directly or indirectly, corrupt or improper payments or anything else of value to or from recipients in the public or private sector. Violations of these laws can result in substantial criminal fines and civil penalties, imprisonment, the loss of trade privileges, debarment, tax reassessments, breach of contract and fraud litigation, reputational harm and other consequences. We have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or government-affiliated hospitals, universities and other organizations. We also expect our non-U.S. activities to increase over time. We expect to rely on third parties for research, preclinical studies and clinical trials and/or to obtain necessary permits, licenses, patent registrations and other marketing authorizations. We can be held liable for corrupt or other illegal activities of our personnel, agents, or partners, even if we do not explicitly authorize or have prior knowledge of such activities.\n\nAny violations of the laws and regulations described above may result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties, imprisonment, the loss of export or import privileges, debarment, tax reassessments, breach of contract and fraud litigation, reputational harm and other consequences.\n\nOur current operations are in two cities in the San Francisco Bay Area, and we, or the third parties upon whom we depend, may be adversely affected by earthquakes, other natural disasters, pandemics or other catastrophic events and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster.\n\nOur current operations are located in our facilities in South San Francisco and San Carlos, California. Any unplanned event, such as earthquake, flood, fire, explosion, extreme weather condition, epidemic, pandemic or contagious disease, power shortage, telecommunication failure or other natural or man-made accidents or incidents that result in us being unable to fully utilize our facilities, or the manufacturing facilities of our third-party contract manufacturers, may have a material and adverse effect on our ability to operate our business, particularly on a daily basis, and have significant negative consequences on our financial and operating conditions. Loss of access to these facilities may result in increased costs, delays in the development of our product candidates or interruption of our business operations. Earthquakes, epidemics, pandemics or contagious diseases, or other natural disasters could further disrupt our operations, and have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. If a natural disaster, power outage, epidemics, pandemics or contagious disease, or other events occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our headquarters, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as our research or manufacturing facilities or the manufacturing facilities of our third-party contract manufacturers, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible, for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. The disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place may prove inadequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. As part of our risk management policy, we maintain insurance coverage at levels that we believe are appropriate for our business. However, in the event of an accident or incident at these facilities, we cannot assure you that the amounts of insurance will be sufficient to satisfy any damages and losses. In addition, the long-term effects of climate change on general economic conditions and the pharmaceutical industry in particular are unclear, and may heighten or intensify existing risk of natural disasters. If our facilities, or the manufacturing facilities of our third-party contract manufacturers, are unable to operate because of an accident or incident or for any other reason, even for a short period of time, any or all of our research and development programs may be harmed. Further, many of our employees conduct business outside of our leased or owned facilities and these locations may be subject to additional security risks outside of our control. Any business interruption could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\n62\n\nChanges in tax laws or regulations that are applied adversely to us or our customers may have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.\n\nNew income, sales, use or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition. Further, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be interpreted, changed, modified or applied adversely to us. For example, legislation enacted in 2017, informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"2017 Tax Act\"), enacted many significant changes to the U.S. tax laws. Beginning in 2022, the 2017 Tax Act eliminates the option to currently deduct research and development expenditures and requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize U.S. based and non-U.S. based research and development expenditures over five and fifteen years, respectively, pursuant to IRC Section 174. Although there have been legislative proposals to repeal or defer the capitalization requirement to later years, there can be no assurance that the provision will be repealed or otherwise modified. We also cannot predict whether, when, in what form, or with what effective dates, tax laws, regulations and rulings may be enacted, promulgated or issued, which could result in an increase in our or our stockholders’ tax liability or require changes in the manner in which we operate in order to minimize or mitigate any adverse effects of changes in tax law. Changes in corporate tax rates, the realization of net deferred tax assets relating to our operations, or future reform legislation could have a material impact on the value of our deferred tax assets, could result in significant one-time charges, and could increase our future U.S. tax expense.\n\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset taxable income could be limited.\n\nUnder current law, our net operating loss carryforwards generated in tax years ending on or prior to December 31, 2017, are permitted to be carried forward for 20 years and our federal net operating losses generated in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such federal net operating losses, is limited to 80% of taxable income (without regard to certain deductions).\n\nIn addition, under Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and corresponding provisions of state law, if we experience an “ownership change” which is generally defined as a greater than 50% change, by value, in our equity ownership over a three-year period, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards to offset our post-change income may be limited. Based on Section 382 studies performed for certain prior periods, we experienced an ownership change on November 20, 2019 and December 31, 2022, which imposed limitations on the use of our net operating losses arising before that date. In addition, we may have experienced other ownership changes in the past and may also experience ownership changes in the future as a result of equity offerings or other shifts in our stock ownership, some of which are outside our control. As a result, our use of federal NOL carryforwards could be limited.\n\nState net operating loss carryforwards may be similarly limited. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of net operating losses is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed. Any such limitations may result in greater tax liabilities than we would incur in the absence of such limitations and any increased liabilities could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nOur cash and investments could be adversely affected if the financial institutions in which we hold our cash and investments fail.\n\nWe regularly maintain cash balances at third-party financial institutions in excess of the FDIC insurance limit and similar regulatory insurance limits outside the United States, and governments may not guarantee all depositors if such financial institutions were to fail, in the event of bank closures and continued instability in the global banking system. Any future adverse developments in the global banking system could directly or indirectly negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Further, if we enter into a credit, loan or other similar facility with a financial institution, certain covenants included in such facility may require as security that we keep a significant portion of our cash with the institution providing such facility. If a depository institution where we maintain deposits fails or is subject to adverse conditions in the financial or credit markets, we may not be able to recover all, if any, of our deposits, which could adversely impact our operating liquidity and financial performance.\n\nOur financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\n\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \"FASB\"), the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. For example, in May 2014, the\n\n63\n\nFASB issued accounting standards update No. 2014-09 (Topic 606), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. We adopted this new accounting standard as of January 1, 2019. Any difficulties in implementing this guidance could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, which could result in regulatory discipline and harm investors’ confidence in us. Additionally, the implementation of this guidance or a change in other principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our financial results, and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change.\n\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\n\nIf we are not able to obtain, maintain and enforce sufficient patent and other intellectual property protection for our technologies or product candidates, development and commercialization of our product candidates may be adversely affected.\n\nOur success depends in part on our, our licensor’s and our collaborators’ ability to obtain and maintain patents and other forms of intellectual property rights, including in-licenses of intellectual property rights of others, for our product candidates, methods used to manufacture our product candidates and methods for treating patients using our product candidates, as well as our ability to preserve our trade secrets, to prevent third parties from infringing upon our proprietary rights and to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. We, our licensors and collaborators may not be able to apply for patents on certain aspects of our product candidates in a timely fashion or at all. Further, we, our licensors and collaborators may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications, or maintain, enforce and license any patents that may issue from such patent applications, at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we, our licensors and collaborators will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. It is also possible that we, our licensors, and our collaborators will fail to file patent applications covering inventions made in the course of development and commercialization activities before a competitor or another third party files a patent application covering, or publishes information disclosing, a similar, independently-developed invention. Such competitor’s patent application may pose obstacles to our ability to obtain or limit the scope of patent protection we may obtain. We may not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of all patent applications that we license from third parties, or to maintain the rights to patents licensed to third parties. Therefore, these patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. If our licensors or collaborators fail to establish, maintain or protect such patents and other intellectual property rights, such rights may be reduced or eliminated. If our licensors, licensees or collaborators are not fully cooperative or disagree with us as to the prosecution, maintenance or enforcement of any patent rights, such patent rights could be compromised. Also, although we enter into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to confidential or patentable aspects of our research and development output, such as our employees, collaborators, CROs, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose such output before a patent application is filed, thereby jeopardizing our ability to seek patent protection. In addition, publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we, our licensors or collaborators were the first to make the inventions claimed in our patents or pending patent applications, or were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions, or if such patents rights may otherwise become invalid. Composition of matter patents for biological and pharmaceutical therapeutic candidates often provide a strong form of intellectual property protection for those types of products, as such patents provide protection without regard to any method of use. We cannot be certain that the claims in our pending patent applications directed to composition of matter of our therapeutic candidates will be considered patentable by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (the \"USPTO\") or by patent offices in foreign countries, or that the claims in any of our issued patents will be considered valid and enforceable by courts in the United States or foreign countries. Method of use patents protect the use of a product for the specified method. This type of patent does not prevent a competitor from making and marketing a product that is identical to our therapeutics for an indication that is outside the scope of the patented method. Moreover, even if competitors do not actively promote their product for our targeted indications, clinicians may prescribe these products “off-label.” Although off-label prescriptions may infringe or contribute to the infringement of method of use patents, the practice is common and such infringement is difficult to prevent or prosecute. Our existing issued and granted patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from using our technology or from developing competing products and technology. There is no guarantee that any of our pending patent applications will result in issued or granted patents, that any of our issued or granted patents will not later be found to be invalid or unenforceable or that any issued or granted patents will include claims that are sufficiently broad to cover our product candidates or to provide meaningful protection from our competitors. Moreover, the patent position of biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies can be highly uncertain because it involves complex legal and factual questions. We will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our current and future proprietary\n\n64\n\ntechnology and product candidates are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. If third parties disclose or misappropriate our proprietary rights, it may materially and adversely affect our position in the market.\n\nThe USPTO, and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other provisions during the patent process. There are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, competitors might be able to enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the case. The standards applied by the USPTO and foreign patent offices in granting patents are not always applied uniformly or predictably. For example, there is no uniform worldwide policy regarding patentable subject matter or the scope of claims allowable in biotechnology and biopharmaceutical patents. As such, we do not know the degree of future protection that we will have on our proprietary products and technology. While we will endeavor to try to protect our product candidates with intellectual property rights such as patents, as appropriate, the process of obtaining patents is time consuming, expensive and sometimes unpredictable.\n\nOnce granted, patents may remain open to opposition, interference, re-examination, post-grant review, inter partes review, nullification or derivation action in court or before patent offices or similar proceedings for a given period after allowance or grant, during which time third parties can raise objections against such initial grant. In the course of such proceedings, which may continue for a protracted period of time, the patent owner may be compelled to limit the scope of the allowed or granted claims thus attacked, or may lose the allowed or granted claims altogether. In addition, there can be no assurance that:\n\n•\n\nothers will not or may not be able to make, use or sell compounds that are the same as or similar to our product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or license;\n\n•\n\nwe or our licensors, or our existing or future collaborators are the first to make the inventions covered by each of our issued patents and pending patent applications that we own or license;\n\n•\n\nwe or our licensors, or our existing or future collaborators are the first to file patent applications covering certain aspects of our inventions;\n\n•\n\nothers will not independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights;\n\n•\n\na third party may not challenge our patents and, if challenged, a court would hold that our patents are valid, enforceable and infringed;\n\n•\n\nany issued patents that we own or have licensed will provide us with any competitive advantages, or will not be challenged by third parties;\n\n•\n\nwe may develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;\n\n•\n\nthe patents of others will not have a material or adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects; and\n\n•\n\nour competitors may conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have enforceable patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets.\n\nIf we or our licensors or collaborators fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering our product candidates, our competitors might be able to enter the market, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nIn addition, our in-licensed patents may be subject to a reservation of rights by the licensor, its affiliates and one or more third parties. When new technologies are developed with government funding, the government generally obtains certain rights in any resulting patents, including a non-exclusive license authorizing the government to use the invention for noncommercial purposes. These rights may permit the government to disclose our confidential information to third parties or allow third parties to use our licensed technology. The government can also exercise its march-in rights if it\n\n65\n\ndetermines that action is necessary because we fail to achieve practical application of the government-funded technology, because action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs, to meet requirements of federal regulations, or to give preference to U.S. industry. In addition, our rights in such inventions may be subject to certain requirements to manufacture products embodying such inventions in the United States. Any of the foregoing could harm our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\n\nIn addition to seeking patent protection for certain aspects of our product candidates, we also consider trade secrets, including confidential and unpatented know-how important to the maintenance of our competitive position. We protect trade secrets and confidential and unpatented know-how, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to such knowledge, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, CROs, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants that obligate them to maintain confidentiality and assign their inventions to us. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time- consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nOther companies or organizations may challenge our or our licensors’ patent rights or may assert patent rights that prevent us from developing and commercializing our products.\n\nTherapeutics in oncology or other disease areas developed in cell-free-based synthesis systems are a relatively new scientific field. We have obtained grants and issuances of, and have obtained a license from a third party on an exclusive basis to, patents related to our proprietary XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms. The issued patents and pending patent applications in the United States and in key markets around the world that we own or license claim many different methods, compositions and processes relating to the discovery, development, manufacture and commercialization of antibody-based and other therapeutics.\n\nAs the field of antibody-based therapeutics continues to mature, patent applications are being processed by national patent offices around the world. There is uncertainty about which patents will issue and, if they do, as to when, to whom, and with what claims. In addition, third parties may attempt to invalidate our intellectual property rights. Even if our rights are not directly challenged, disputes could lead to the weakening of our intellectual property rights. Our defense against any attempt by third parties to circumvent or invalidate our intellectual property rights could be costly to us, could require significant time and attention of our management and could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects or our ability to successfully compete.\n\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\n\nObtaining a valid and enforceable issued or granted patent covering our technology in the United States and worldwide can be extremely costly, and our or our licensors’ or collaborators’ intellectual property rights may not exist in some countries outside the United States or may be less extensive in some countries than in the United States. In jurisdictions where we or our licensors or collaborators have not obtained patent protection, competitors may seek to use our or their technology to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we or they have patent protection, but where it is more difficult to enforce a patent as compared to the United States. Competitor products may compete with our future products in jurisdictions where we do not have issued or granted patents or where our or our licensors’ or collaborators’ issued or granted patent claims or other intellectual property rights are not sufficient to prevent competitor activities in these jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, make it difficult to enforce patents and such countries may not recognize other types of intellectual property protection, particularly relating to biopharmaceuticals. This could make it difficult for us or our licensors or collaborators to prevent the infringement of our or their patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our or their proprietary rights generally in certain jurisdictions. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our and our licensors’ or collaborators’ efforts and\n\n66\n\nattention from other aspects of our business, could put our and our licensors’ or collaborators’ patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our and our licensors’ or collaborators’ patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us or our licensors or collaborators. We or our licensors or collaborators may not prevail in any lawsuits that we or our licensors or collaborators initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful.\n\nWe generally file a provisional patent application first (a priority filing) at the USPTO. An international application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (the \"PCT\") is usually filed within twelve months after the priority filing. Based on the PCT filing, national and regional patent applications may be filed in the United States, EU, Japan, Australia and Canada and, depending on the individual case, also in any or all of, inter alia, Brazil, China, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa, South Korea and other jurisdictions. We have so far not filed for patent protection in all national and regional jurisdictions where such protection may be available. In addition, we may decide to abandon national and regional patent applications before grant. Finally, the grant proceeding of each national or regional patent is an independent proceeding which may lead to situations in which applications might in some jurisdictions be refused by the relevant registration authorities, while granted by others. It is also quite common that depending on the country, various scopes of patent protection may be granted on the same product candidate or technology.\n\nGeopolitical actions in the United States and in foreign countries could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution or maintenance of patent applications and the maintenance, enforcement or defense of issued patents. For example, the United States and foreign government actions related to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine may limit or prevent filing, prosecution and maintenance of patent applications in Russia. Government actions may also prevent maintenance of issued patents in Russia. These actions could result in abandonment or lapse of patents or patent applications, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in Russia. If such an event were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, a decree was adopted by the Russian government in March 2022, allowing Russian companies and individuals to exploit inventions owned by patentees that have citizenship or nationality in, are registered in, or have predominately primary place of business or profit-making activities in the United States and other countries that Russia has deemed unfriendly without consent or compensation. Consequently, we would not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in Russia or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into Russia. Accordingly, our competitive position may be impaired, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected.\n\nThe laws of some jurisdictions do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws in the United States, and many companies have encountered significant difficulties in protecting and defending such rights in such jurisdictions. If we or our licensors or collaborators encounter difficulties in protecting, or are otherwise precluded from effectively protecting, the intellectual property rights important for our business in such jurisdictions, the value of these rights may be diminished and we may face additional competition from others in those jurisdictions. Many countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of such patent. If we or any of our licensors or collaborators are forced to grant a license to third parties with respect to any patents relevant to our business, our competitive position in the relevant jurisdiction may be impaired and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected.\n\nEuropean patent applications now have the option, upon grant of a patent, of becoming a Unitary Patent which will be subject to the jurisdiction of the Unitary Patent Court (the \"UPC\"). This will be a significant change in European patent practice. As the UPC is a new court system, there is very limited precedent for the court, increasing the uncertainty of any litigation. Limited information is available to make judgments about advantages and disadvantages of either opting into or remaining out of UPC jurisdiction; either choice may ultimately prove to have significant implications as to cost, enforceability and scope of protection, among other factors, for applicable European patents.\n\nWe, our licensors or collaborators, or any future strategic partners may need to resort to litigation to protect or enforce our patents or other proprietary rights, all of which could be costly, time consuming, delay or prevent the development and commercialization of our product candidates, or put our patents and other proprietary rights at risk.\n\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or other intellectual property. If we were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering one of our products or our technology, the defendant could counterclaim that our patent is invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several\n\n67\n\nstatutory requirements, for example, lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that an individual connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability during patent litigation is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on one or more of our products or certain aspects of our platform technology. Such a loss of patent protection could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Interference or derivation proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by us or declared by the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or if a non-exclusive license is offered and our competitors gain access to the same technology. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions, or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Patents and other intellectual property rights also will not protect our technology if competitors design around our protected technology without legally infringing our patents or other intellectual property rights.\n\nWe may not identify relevant third-party patents or may incorrectly interpret the relevance, scope or expiration of a third-party patent, which might adversely affect our ability to develop and market our therapeutics.\n\nAs the biopharmaceutical industry expands and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our product candidates may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent rights of third parties. There can be no assurance that our operations do not, or will not in the future, infringe existing or future third-party patents. Identification of third-party patent rights that may be relevant to our operations is difficult because patent searching is imperfect due to differences in terminology among patents, incomplete databases and the difficulty in assessing the meaning of patent claims. We cannot guarantee that any of our patent searches or analyses, including the identification of relevant patents, the scope of patent claims or the expiration of relevant patents, are complete or thorough, nor can we be certain that we have identified each and every third-party patent and pending application in the United States and abroad that is relevant to or necessary for the commercialization of our therapeutic candidates in any jurisdiction.\n\nNumerous U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications exist in our market that are owned by third parties. Our competitors in both the United States and abroad, many of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in patent portfolios and competing technologies, may have applied for or obtained or may in the future apply for and obtain, patents that will prevent, limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make, use and sell our therapeutics. We do not always conduct independent reviews of pending patent applications of and patents issued to third parties. Patent applications in the United States and elsewhere are typically published approximately 18 months after the earliest filing for which priority is claimed, with such earliest filing date being commonly referred to as the priority date. Certain U.S. applications that will not be filed outside the U.S. can remain confidential until patents issue. In addition, patent applications in the United States and elsewhere can be pending for many years before issuance, or unintentionally abandoned patents or applications can be revived. Furthermore, pending patent applications that have been published can, subject to certain limitations, be later amended in a manner that could cover our technologies, our therapeutics or the use of our therapeutics. As such, there may be applications of others now pending or recently revived patents of which we are unaware. These patent applications may later result in issued patents, or the revival of previously abandoned patents, that will prevent, limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make, use or sell our therapeutics.\n\nThe scope of a patent claim is determined by an interpretation of the law, the written disclosure in a patent and the patent’s prosecution history. Our interpretation of the relevance or the scope of a patent or a pending application may be incorrect. For example, we may incorrectly determine that our therapeutics are not covered by a third-party patent or may incorrectly predict whether a third-party’s pending application will issue with claims of relevant scope. Our determination of the expiration date of any patent in the United States or abroad that we consider relevant may be incorrect. Our failure to identify and correctly interpret relevant patents may negatively impact our ability to develop and market our product candidates.\n\nWe cannot provide any assurances that third-party patents do not exist which might be enforced against our current technology, including our research programs, product candidates, their respective methods of use, manufacture and formulations thereof, and could result in either an injunction prohibiting our manufacture or future sales, or, with respect to\n\n68\n\nour future sales, an obligation on our part to pay royalties and/or other forms of compensation to third parties, which could be significant.\n\nIntellectual property rights of third parties could adversely affect our ability to commercialize our product candidates, and we, our licensors or collaborators, or any future strategic partners may become subject to third party claims or litigation alleging infringement of patents or other proprietary rights or seeking to invalidate patents or other proprietary rights. We might be required to litigate or obtain licenses from third parties in order to develop or market our product candidates. Such litigation or licenses could be costly or not available on commercially reasonable terms.\n\nWe, our licensors or collaborators, or any future strategic partners may be subject to third-party claims for infringement or misappropriation of patent or other proprietary rights. There is a substantial amount of litigation, both within and outside the United States, involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences, oppositions and inter partes review proceedings before the USPTO, and corresponding foreign patent offices. For example, one of our European patents related to technology auxiliary to our XpressCF® platform is involved in an opposition proceeding at the European Patent Office, or EPO, and was revoked by the EPO in 2021. In April 2022, an appeal was filed; the process for this appeal is ongoing. This may prevent us from asserting this patent against our competitors practicing otherwise infringing methods in relevant European countries where this patent has been granted. There are many issued and pending patents that might claim aspects of our product candidates and modifications that we may need to apply to our product candidates. There are also many issued patents that claim antibodies, portions of antibodies, cytokines, half-life extending polymers, linkers, cytotoxins, or other warheads that may be relevant for the products we wish to develop. Thus, it is possible that one or more organizations will hold patent rights to which we will need a license. If those organizations refuse to grant us a license to such patent rights on reasonable terms, we may be delayed or may not be able to market products or perform research and development or other activities covered by these patents which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We are obligated under certain of our license and collaboration agreements to indemnify and hold harmless our licensors or collaborators for damages arising from intellectual property infringement by use. For example, we are obligated under the Stanford Agreement to indemnify and hold harmless Stanford for damages arising from intellectual property infringement by us resulting from exercise of the license from Stanford. If we, our licensors or collaborators, or any future strategic partners are found to infringe a third-party patent or other intellectual property rights, we could be required to pay damages, potentially including treble damages, if we are found to have infringed willfully. In addition, we, our licensors or collaborators, or any future strategic partners may choose to seek, or be required to seek, a license from a third party, which may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Even if a license can be obtained on acceptable terms, the rights may be non-exclusive, which could give our competitors access to the same technology or intellectual property rights licensed to us. If we fail to obtain a required license, we or our existing or future collaborators may be unable to effectively market product candidates based on our technology, which could limit our ability to generate revenue or achieve profitability and possibly prevent us from generating revenue sufficient to sustain our operations. In addition, we may find it necessary to pursue claims or initiate lawsuits to protect or enforce our patent or other intellectual property rights. The cost to us in defending or initiating any litigation or other proceeding relating to patent or other proprietary rights, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial, and litigation could divert our management’s attention. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could delay our research and development efforts and limit our ability to continue our operations.\n\nBecause the antibody-based therapeutics landscape is still evolving, it is difficult to conclusively assess our freedom to operate without infringing on third-party rights. There are numerous companies that have pending patent applications and issued patents broadly covering antibodies generally, covering antibodies directed against the same targets as, or targets similar to, those we are pursuing, or covering linkers and cytotoxic warheads similar to those that we are using in our product candidates. For example, we are aware of an issued patent, expected to expire in 2031, that relates to strained alkyne reagents that can be used as synthetic precursors for certain of our linker-warheads. We are further aware of an issued patent, expected to expire in 2034, relating to certain conjugates comprising a genus of hemiasterlin derivatives that may be potentially relevant to products incorporating our hemiasterlin-derived linker-warhead. If any of these patents are valid and not yet expired when, and if, we receive marketing approval for luvelta, as applicable, we may need to seek a license to one or more of these patents, each of which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to receive a license to any of these patents, or other potentially relevant patents currently unknown to us, could delay commercialization of any or all of luvelta, STRO-004 or any other product candidate. Our competitive position may suffer if patents issued to third parties or other third-party intellectual property rights cover our products or product candidates or elements thereof, or our manufacture or uses relevant to our development plans. In such cases, we\n\n69\n\nmay not be in a position to develop or commercialize products or product candidates until such patents expire or unless we successfully pursue litigation to nullify or invalidate the third-party intellectual property right concerned, or enter into a license agreement with the intellectual property right holder, if available on commercially reasonable terms. There may be issued patents of which we are not aware, held by third parties that, if found to be valid and enforceable, could be alleged to be infringed by our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms and related technologies and product candidates. There also may be pending patent applications of which we are not aware that may result in issued patents, which could be alleged to be infringed by our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms and related technologies and product candidates. If such an infringement claim should be brought and be successful, we may be required to pay substantial damages, including potentially treble damages and attorneys’ fees for willful infringement, and we may be forced to abandon our product candidates or seek a license from any patent holders. No assurances can be given that a license will be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\n\nIt is also possible that we have failed to identify relevant third-party patents or applications. Patent applications in the United States and elsewhere are published approximately 18 months after the earliest filing for which priority is claimed, with such earliest filing date being commonly referred to as the priority date. Therefore, patent applications covering our products or platform technologies could have been filed by others without our knowledge. Additionally, pending patent applications that have been published can, subject to certain limitations, be later amended in a manner that could cover our platform technologies, our products or the use of our products. Third-party intellectual property right holders may also actively bring infringement claims against us. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully settle or otherwise resolve such infringement claims. If we are unable to successfully settle future claims on terms acceptable to us, we may be required to engage in or continue costly, unpredictable and time-consuming litigation and may be prevented from or experience substantial delays in marketing our products. Parties making claims against us may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation or administrative proceedings, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have material adverse effect on our ability to raise additional funds or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. If we fail in any such dispute, in addition to being forced to pay damages, we may be temporarily or permanently prohibited from commercializing any of our product candidates that are held to be infringing. We might, if possible, also be forced to redesign product candidates so that we no longer infringe the third-party intellectual property rights. Any of these events, even if we were ultimately to prevail, could require us to divert substantial financial and management resources that we would otherwise be able to devote to our business and could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nIntellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.\n\nLitigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims, with or without merit, is unpredictable and generally expensive and time consuming and is likely to divert significant resources from our core business, including distracting our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Moreover, such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities.\n\nWe may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources and more mature and developed intellectual property portfolios. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating or from successfully challenging our intellectual property rights. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace.\n\n70\n\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations under any license, collaboration or other agreements, we may be required to pay damages and could lose intellectual property rights that are necessary for developing and protecting our product candidates or we could lose certain rights to grant sublicenses.\n\nOur current licenses impose, and any future licenses we enter into are likely to impose, various development, commercialization, funding, milestone, royalty, diligence, sublicensing, insurance, patent prosecution and enforcement and/or other obligations on us. If we breach any of these obligations, or use the intellectual property licensed to us in an unauthorized manner, we may be required to pay damages and the licensor may have the right to terminate the license, which could result in us being unable to develop, manufacture and sell any future products that are covered by the licensed technology or enable a competitor to gain access to the licensed technology. Moreover, our licensors may own or control intellectual property that has not been licensed to us and, as a result, we may be subject to claims, regardless of their merit, that we are infringing or otherwise violating the licensor’s rights. In addition, while we cannot determine currently the amount of the royalty obligations we would be required to pay on sales of future products, if any, the amounts may be significant. The amount of our future royalty obligations will depend on the technology and intellectual property we use in products that we successfully develop and commercialize, if any. Therefore, even if we successfully develop and commercialize products, we may be unable to achieve or maintain profitability.\n\nMoreover, disputes may arise regarding intellectual property subject to a licensing agreement, including:\n\n•\n\nthe scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues;\n\n•\n\nthe extent to which our product candidates, technologies and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the licensing agreement;\n\n•\n\nthe sublicensing of patent and other rights under our collaborative development relationships;\n\n•\n\nour diligence obligations under the license agreement and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations;\n\n•\n\nthe inventorship and ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors and us and our partners; and\n\n•\n\nthe priority of invention of patented technology.\n\nIn addition, the agreements under which we currently license intellectual property or technology from third parties are complex, and certain provisions in such agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations. The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what we believe to be the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology, or increase what we believe to be our financial or other obligations under the relevant agreement, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. Moreover, if disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on commercially acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations, and prospects.\n\nWe may be subject to claims that we or our employees or consultants have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of our employees’ or consultants’ former employers or their clients. These claims may be costly to defend and if we do not successfully do so, we may be required to pay monetary damages and may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel.\n\nMany of our employees were previously employed at universities or biotechnology or biopharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although no claims against us are currently pending, we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. A loss of key research personnel or their work product could hamper our ability to commercialize, or prevent us from commercializing, our product candidates, which could severely harm our business. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\n\n71\n\nPatent terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our product candidates for an adequate amount of time.\n\nPatents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, if all maintenance fees are timely paid, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years from its earliest U.S. non-provisional filing date. Various extensions may be available, but the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Even if patents covering our product candidates are obtained, once the patent life has expired, we may be open to competition from competitive products, including generics or biosimilars. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\n\nDepending upon the timing, duration and conditions of any FDA marketing approval of our product candidates, one or more of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, and similar legislation in the European Union. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent term extension of up to five years for a patent covering an approved product as compensation for effective patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, we may not receive an extension if we fail to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process, fail to apply within applicable deadlines, fail to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise fail to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the length of the extension could be less than we request. Only one patent per approved product can be extended, the extension cannot extend the total patent term beyond 14 years from approval and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension or the term of any such extension is less than we request, the period during which we can enforce our patent rights for the applicable product candidate will be shortened and our competitors may obtain approval to market competing products sooner. As a result, our revenue from applicable products could be reduced. Further, if this occurs, our competitors may take advantage of our investment in development and trials by referencing our clinical and preclinical data and launch their product earlier than might otherwise be the case, and our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially harmed.\n\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\n\nPeriodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and/or applications will be due to be paid to the USPTO and various governmental patent agencies outside of the United States in several stages over the lifetime of the patents and/or applications. We have systems in place to remind us to pay these fees, and we employ an outside firm and/or rely on our outside counsel to pay these fees due to non-U.S. patent agencies. The USPTO and various non-U.S. governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. We employ reputable law firms and other professionals to help us comply, and in many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. However, there are situations in which non-compliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, our competitors might be able to enter the market and this circumstance would have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nChanges in U.S. patent and ex-U.S. patent laws could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products.\n\nChanges in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States or in other ex-U.S. jurisdictions could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of patent applications and the enforcement or defense of issued patents. In the United States, numerous recent changes to the patent laws and proposed changes to the rules of the USPTO that may have a significant impact on our ability to protect our technology and enforce our intellectual property rights. For example, the America Invents Act, enacted within the last several years involves significant changes in patent legislation. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, some of which cases either narrow the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weaken the rights of patent owners in certain situations. For example, the decision by the U.S. Supreme Court in Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc. precludes a claim to a nucleic acid having a stated nucleotide sequence that is identical to a sequence found in nature and unmodified. We currently are not aware of an immediate impact of this\n\n72\n\ndecision on our patents or patent applications because we are developing product candidates that contain modifications that we believe are not found in nature. However, this decision has yet to be clearly interpreted by courts and by the USPTO. We cannot assure you that the interpretations of this decision or subsequent rulings will not adversely impact our patents or patent applications. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts and the USPTO, and similar legislative and regulatory bodies in other countries in which we may pursue patent protection, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability toobtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future.We may become subject to claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our patents and other intellectual property.\n\nWe may be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an interest in our patents or other intellectual property as an inventor or co-inventor. The failure to name the proper inventors on a patent application can result in the patents issuing thereon being unenforceable. Inventorship disputes may arise from conflicting views regarding the contributions of different individuals named as inventors, the effects of foreign laws where foreign nationals are involved in the development of the subject matter of the patent, conflicting obligations of third parties involved in developing our product candidates or as a result of questions regarding co-ownership of potential joint inventions. Litigation may be necessary to resolve these and other claims challenging inventorship or ownership. Alternatively, or additionally, we may enter into agreements to clarify the scope of our rights in such intellectual property. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, valuable intellectual property. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.\n\nOur current or future licensors may have relied on third-party consultants or collaborators or on funds from third parties, such as the U.S. government, such that our licensors are not the sole and exclusive owners of the patents we in-licensed. If other third parties have ownership rights or other rights to our in-licensed patents, they may be able to license such patents to our competitors, and our competitors could market competing products and technology. This could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial conditions, results of operations, and prospects.\n\nIn addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the conception or development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who, in fact, conceives or develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. The assignment of intellectual property rights may not be self-executing, or the assignment agreements may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims that they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property. Such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\n\nIf our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be adversely affected.\n\nOur trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented or declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks. We may not be able to protect our rights to these trademarks and trade names or may be forced to stop using these names, which we need for name recognition by potential partners or customers in our markets of interest. If we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, we may not be able to compete effectively, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\n\nWe and/or our collaborators may be unable to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, U.S. or foreign regulatory approval and, as a result, unable to commercialize our product candidates.\n\nOur product candidates are subject to extensive governmental regulations relating to, among other things, research, testing, development, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, approval, recordkeeping, reporting, labeling, storage, packaging, advertising and promotion, pricing, marketing and distribution of drugs and therapeutic biologics. Rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory approval process are required to be completed successfully in the United States and in many foreign jurisdictions before a new drug or therapeutic biologic can be marketed. Satisfaction of these and other regulatory requirements is costly, time consuming, uncertain and subject to unanticipated delays. It is\n\n73\n\npossible that none of the product candidates we may develop, either alone or with our collaborators, will obtain the regulatory approvals necessary for us or our existing or future collaborators to begin selling them.\n\nAlthough some of our employees have experience in conducting and managing clinical trials from prior employment at other companies, we, as a company, have no prior experience in conducting and managing the clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approvals, including approval by the FDA. The time required to obtain FDA and other approvals is unpredictable but typically takes many years following the commencement of the initial clinical trials, depending upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate and the availability of applicable government resources. The standards that the FDA and its foreign counterparts use when regulating us require judgment and can change, which makes it difficult to predict with certainty their application. Any analysis we perform of data from preclinical and clinical activities is subject to confirmation and interpretation by regulatory authorities, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. We or our collaborators may also encounter unexpected delays or increased costs due to new government regulations, for example, from future legislation or administrative action, or from changes in FDA policy during the period of product development, clinical trials and FDA regulatory review. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, or whether FDA or foreign regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or the impact of such changes, if any. For example, the Oncology Center of Excellence within the FDA has advanced Project Optimus, which is an initiative to reform the dose optimization and dose selection paradigm in oncology drug development to emphasize selection of an optimal dose, which is a dose or doses that maximizes not only the efficacy of a drug but the safety and tolerability as well. This shift from the prior approach, which generally determined the maximum tolerated dose, may require sponsors to spend additional time and resources to further explore a product candidate’s dose-response relationship to facilitate optimum dose selection in a target population. Other Oncology Center of Excellence initiatives have included Project FrontRunner, an initiative with a goal of developing a framework for identifying candidate drugs for initial clinical development in the earlier advanced setting rather than for treatment of patients who have received numerous prior lines of therapies or have exhausted available treatment options. We are considering these policy changes as they relate to our programs. We may also be affected by ex-US regulatory requirements, given that our trials may be conducted globally; current and unforeseen new EU-specific clinical trial conduct regulations, such as IVDR and GDPR, may delay, or increase the difficulty and expense of conducting, our clinical studies.\n\nGiven that the product candidates we are developing, either alone or with our collaborators, represent a new approach to the manufacturing and type of therapeutic biologics, the FDA and its foreign counterparts have not yet established any definitive policies, practices or guidelines in relation to these product candidates. Moreover, the FDA may respond to any BLA that we may submit by defining requirements that we do not anticipate. Such responses could delay clinical development of our product candidates. In addition, because there may be approved treatments for some of the diseases for which we may seek approval, in order to receive regulatory approval, we may need to demonstrate through clinical trials that the product candidates we develop to treat these diseases, if any, are not only safe and effective, but safer or more effective than existing products. Furthermore, in recent years, there has been increased public and political pressure on the FDA with respect to the approval process for new drugs and therapeutic biologics, and FDA standards, especially regarding product safety, appear to have become more stringent.\n\nAny delay or failure in obtaining required approvals could have a material and adverse effect on our ability to generate revenues from the particular product candidate for which we are seeking approval. Furthermore, any regulatory approval to market a product may be subject to limitations on the approved uses for which we may market the product or on the labeling or other restrictions. In addition, the FDA has the authority to require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, as part of a BLA or after approval, which may impose further requirements or restrictions on the distribution or use of an approved biologic, such as limiting prescribing to certain physicians or medical centers that have undergone specialized training, limiting treatment to patients who meet certain safe-use criteria and requiring treated patients to enroll in a registry. These limitations and restrictions may limit the size of the market for the product and affect reimbursement by third-party payors.\n\nWe are also subject to numerous foreign regulatory requirements governing, among other things, the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing and marketing authorization, pricing and third-party reimbursement. The foreign regulatory approval process varies among countries and may include all of the risks associated with FDA approval process described above, as well as risks attributable to the satisfaction of local regulations in foreign jurisdictions. Moreover, the time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. FDA approval does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities outside the United States and vice versa. Any delay or failure to obtain U.S. or foreign regulatory approval for a product candidate could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\n74\n\nDelays in obtaining regulatory approval of our manufacturing process may delay or disrupt our commercialization efforts. To date, no product using a cell-free manufacturing process in the United States has received approval from the FDA.\n\nBefore we can begin to commercially manufacture our product candidates in third-party or our own facilities, we must obtain regulatory approval from the FDA for a BLA that describes in detail the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls for the product. A manufacturing authorization must also be obtained from the appropriate EU regulatory authorities. The timeframe required to obtain such approval or authorization is uncertain. In addition, we must pass a pre-approval inspection of our manufacturing facility by the FDA before any of our product candidates can obtain marketing approval, if ever. In order to obtain approval, we will need to ensure that all of our processes, methods and equipment are compliant with cGMP, and perform extensive audits of vendors, contract laboratories and suppliers. If any of our vendors, contract laboratories or suppliers is found to be out of compliance with cGMP, we may experience delays or disruptions in manufacturing while we work with these third parties to remedy the violation or while we work to identify suitable replacement vendors. The cGMP requirements govern quality control of the manufacturing process and documentation policies and procedures. In complying with cGMP, we will be obligated to expend time, money and effort in production, record keeping and quality control to assure that the product meets applicable specifications and other requirements. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we would be subject to possible regulatory action and may not be permitted to sell any products that we may develop.\n\nEven if we receive regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we will be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expenses. Additionally, our product candidates, if approved, could be subject to labeling and other restrictions and market withdrawal. We may also be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or experience unanticipated problems with our products.\n\nAny regulatory approvals that we or our existing or future collaborators obtain for our product candidates may also be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses for which a product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product candidate.\n\nIn addition, if the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority approves any of our product candidates, the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, import, export, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for the product will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. The FDA has significant post-market authority, including the authority to require labeling changes based on new safety information and to require post-market studies or clinical trials to evaluate safety risks related to the use of a product or to require withdrawal of the product from the market. The FDA also has the authority to require a REMS plan after approval, which may impose further requirements or restrictions on the distribution or use of an approved drug or therapeutic biologic. The manufacturing facilities we use to make a future product, if any, will also be subject to periodic review and inspection by the FDA and other regulatory agencies, including for continued compliance with cGMP requirements. The discovery of any new or previously unknown problems with our third-party manufacturers, manufacturing processes or facilities may result in restrictions on the product, manufacturer or facility, including withdrawal of the product from the market. If we rely on third-party manufacturers, we will not have control over compliance with applicable rules and regulations by such manufacturers. Any product promotion and advertising will also be subject to regulatory requirements and continuing regulatory review. If we or our existing or future collaborators, manufacturers or service providers fail to comply with applicable continuing regulatory requirements in the United States or foreign jurisdictions in which we seek to market our products, we or they may be subject to, among other things, fines, warning letters, holds on clinical trials, delay of approval or refusal by the FDA or similar foreign regulatory bodies to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approval, product recalls and seizures, administrative detention of products, refusal to permit the import or export of products, operating restrictions, injunction, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.\n\nSubsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with our third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:\n\n•\n\nrestrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, withdrawal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory product recalls;\n\n•\n\nfines, warning or untitled letters or holds on clinical trials;\n\n75\n\n•\n\nrefusal by the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us or our strategic partners;\n\n•\n\nsuspension or revocation of product license approvals;\n\n•\n\nproduct seizure or detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products; and\n\n•\n\ninjunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\n\nThe FDA policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business.\n\nMoreover, the ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, statutory, regulatory and policy changes, the FDA’s ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and other events that may otherwise affect the FDA’s ability to perform routine functions. In addition, government funding of other government agencies that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. Disruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new drugs to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business.\n\nThe ability of the FDA and other government agencies to properly administer their functions is highly dependent on the levels of government funding and the ability to fill key leadership appointments, among various factors. Delays in filling or replacing key positions could significantly impact the ability of the FDA and other agencies to fulfill their functions, and could greatly impact healthcare and the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nWe also cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action, either in the United States or abroad. Further, three decisions from the U.S. Supreme Court in July 2024 may lead to an increase in litigation against regulatory agencies that could create uncertainty and thus negatively impact our business. The first decision overturned established precedent that required courts to defer to regulatory agencies’ interpretations of ambiguous statutory language. The second decision overturned regulatory agencies’ ability to impose civil penalties in administrative proceedings. The third decision extended the statute of limitations within which entities may challenge agency actions. However, the specific, lasting effects of these decisions, which may vary within different judicial districts and circuits, is unknown. We also cannot predict the extent to which FDA and SEC regulations, policies, and decisions may become subject to increasing legal challenges, delays, and changes. For example, these cases may result in increased litigation by companies against the FDA, and impact the FDA’s authority, lead to uncertainties in the industry, and disrupt the FDA’s normal operations, which could impact the timely review of any regulatory filings or applications we submit to the FDA.\n\nFurther, if a prolonged government shutdown occurs, or if global health concerns prevent the FDA or other regulatory authorities from conducting their regular inspections, reviews, or other regulatory activities, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA or other regulatory authorities to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nWe may face difficulties from healthcare legislative reform measures.\n\nExisting regulatory policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could affect pricing and third-party payments for our product candidates, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition and prospects. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability.\n\nIn the United States, there have been and continue to be a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. For example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Healthcare and\n\n76\n\nEducation Reconciliation Act, or together, the ACA, was enacted, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry.\n\nWhile there have been legislative and judicial efforts to modify, repeal or otherwise invalidate all or certain aspects of the ACA or its implementing regulations, the ACA remains in effect in its current form. It is unclear how any such efforts in the future will impact the ACA or our business.\n\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States federal and state levels to reduce healthcare expenditures, including the Budget Control Act, which, subject to certain temporary suspension periods, imposed 2% reductions in Medicare payments to providers per fiscal year starting April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, that will remain in effect through 2031, unless additional Congressional action is taken, and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which added a requirement for manufacturers of certain single-source drugs (including biologics and biosimilars) separately paid for under Medicare Part B for at least 18 months and marketed in single-dose containers or packages (known as refundable single-dose containers or single-use package drugs) to provide annual refunds for any portions of the dispensed drug that are unused and discarded if those unused or discarded portions exceed an applicable percentage defined by statute or regulation. Further, in November 2020, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. The implementation of this final rule was delayed by the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, until January 1, 2032. In December 2020, CMS issued a final rule implementing significant manufacturer price reporting changes under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including regulations that affect manufacturer-sponsored patient assistance programs subject to pharmacy benefit manager accumulator programs and Best Price reporting related to certain value-based purchasing arrangements. Under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, effective January 1, 2024, the statutory cap on Medicaid Drug Rebate Program rebates that manufacturers pay to state Medicaid programs is eliminated. Elimination of this cap may require pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay more in rebates than they receive on the sale of products.\n\nMoreover, on January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. If federal spending is further reduced, anticipated budgetary shortfalls may also impact the ability of relevant agencies, such as the FDA or the National Institutes of Health to continue to function at current levels. Amounts allocated to federal grants and contracts may be reduced or eliminated. These reductions may also impact the ability of relevant agencies to timely review and approve research and development, manufacturing, and marketing activities, which may delay our ability to develop, market and sell any products we may develop.\n\nMoreover, payment methodologies, including payment for companion diagnostics, may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives. CMS has begun bundling the Medicare payments for certain laboratory tests ordered while a patient received services in a hospital outpatient setting and, beginning in 2018, CMS will pay for clinical laboratory services based on a weighted average of reported prices that private payors, Medicare Advantage plans, and Medicaid Managed Care plans pay for laboratory services. Further, on March 16, 2018, CMS finalized its National Coverage Determination, or NCD, for certain diagnostic laboratory tests using next generation sequencing that are approved by the FDA as a companion in vitro diagnostic and used in a cancer with an FDA-approved companion diagnostic indication. Under the NCD, diagnostic tests that gain FDA approval or clearance as an in vitro companion diagnostic will automatically receive full coverage and be available for patients with recurrent, metastatic relapsed, refractory or stages III and IV cancer. Additionally, the NCD extended coverage to repeat testing when the patient has a new primary diagnosis of cancer.\n\nThere has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several presidential executive orders, Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. The FDA released a final rule in September 2020 providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada, and the FDA authorized the first such plan in January 2024.\n\nRecently, several healthcare reform initiatives culminated in the enactment of the IRA in August 2022, which allows, among other things, HHS to negotiate the selling price of a statutorily specified number of drugs and biologics each year\n\n77\n\nthat CMS reimburses under Medicare Part B and Part D. Only high-expenditure single-source biologics that have been approved for at least 11 years (7 years for single-source small molecule therapeutics) can qualify for negotiations, with the negotiated price taking effect two years after the selection year. CMS selected the Medicare Part D drugs for negotiation in 2023, negotiations began in 2024, and the negotiated maximum fair price for each drug has been announced. The price cap for each of these drugs, which cannot exceed a statutory ceiling price, will come into effect on January 1, 2026. Negotiations for Medicare Part B products begin in 2026, with the negotiated price taking effect in 2028. A drug or biological product that has an orphan drug designation for only one rare disease or condition will be excluded from the IRA’s price negotiations requirements, but loses that exclusion if it has designations for more than one rare disease or condition, or if it is approved for an indication that is not within that single designated rare disease or condition, unless such additional designation or such disqualifying approvals are withdrawn by the time CMS evaluates the drug for selection for negotiation. In August 2023, HHS announced the ten Medicare Part D drugs and biologics that it selected for negotiations, and by October 1, 2023, each manufacturer of the selected drugs signed a manufacturer agreement to participate in the negotiations. The IRA also penalizes drug manufacturers that increase prices of Medicare Part D and Part B drugs at a rate greater than the rate of inflation. In addition, the law eliminates the “donut hole” under Medicare Part D beginning in 2025 by significantly lowering the enrollee maximum out-of-pocket cost and requiring manufacturers to subsidize, through a newly established manufacturer discount program, 10% of Part D enrollees’ prescription costs for brand drugs below the out-of-pocket maximum, and 20% once the out-of-pocket maximum has been reached. The IRA permits the Secretary of HHS to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. Manufacturers that fail to comply with the IRA may be subject to various penalties, some significant, including civil monetary penalties. The IRA also extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in ACA marketplaces through plan year 2025. These provisions are taking effect progressively starting in 2023, although they may be subject to legal challenges. For example, the provisions related to the negotiation of selling prices of high-expenditure single-source drugs and biologics have been challenged in multiple lawsuits. Thus, while it is unclear how the IRA will be implemented, it will likely have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry and our product candidates.\n\nAt the state level, legislatures are increasingly enacting laws and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.\n\nAdditionally, on May 30, 2018, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017 was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA authorization under an FDA expanded access program; however, manufacturers are not obligated to provide investigational new drug products under the current federal right to try law. We may choose to seek an expanded access program for our product candidates, or to utilize comparable rules in other countries that allow the use of a drug, on a named patient basis or under a compassionate use program.\n\nWe expect that the ACA, the IRA and other state or federal healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products.\n\nOur operations and relationships with healthcare providers, healthcare organizations, customers and third-party payors will be subject to applicable anti-bribery, anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, transparency and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to, among other things, enforcement actions, criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens and diminished profits and future earnings.\n\nOur current and future arrangements with healthcare providers, healthcare organizations, third-party payors and customers expose us to broadly applicable anti-bribery, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, market, sell and distribute our product candidates. In addition, we may be subject to patient data privacy and security regulation by the U.S. federal government and the states and the foreign governments in which we conduct our business. Restrictions under applicable federal and state anti-bribery and healthcare laws and regulations, include the following:\n\n•\n\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, individuals and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or \n\n78\n\nreward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal and state healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;\n\n•\n\nthe federal criminal and civil false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the federal False Claims Act, which can be imposed through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions against individuals or entities, prohibits, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent, knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim, or from knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. Moreover, the government may assert that a claim including items and services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act;\n\n•\n\nHIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability, prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services; similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;\n\n•\n\nHIPAA, as amended by HITECH, which impose obligations on certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, known as covered entities, as well as their business associates that perform certain services involving the storage, use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information, and require notification to affected individuals and regulatory authorities of certain breaches of security of individually identifiable health information;\n\n•\n\nthe federal legislation commonly referred to as Physician Payments Sunshine Act, enacted as part of the ACA, and its implementing regulations, which requires certain manufacturers of covered drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies that are reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with certain exceptions, to report annually to CMS information related to certain payments and other transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), physician assistants, certain types of advanced practice nurses, and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members, with the information made publicly available on a searchable website;\n\n•\n\nthe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, which prohibits, among other things, U.S. companies and their employees and agents from authorizing, promising, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, corrupt or improper payments or anything else of value to foreign government officials, employees of public international organizations and foreign government owned or affiliated entities, candidates for foreign political office, and foreign political parties or officials thereof;\n\n•\n\nanalogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, that may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; and\n\n•\n\ncertain state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug and therapeutic biologics manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and pricing information, state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\n\nIf we or our collaborators, manufacturers or service providers fail to comply with applicable federal, state or foreign laws or regulations, we could be subject to enforcement actions, which could affect our ability to develop, market and sell\n\n79\n\nour products successfully and could harm our reputation and lead to reduced acceptance of our products by the market. These enforcement actions include, among others:\n\n•\n\nexclusion from participation in government-funded healthcare programs;\n\n•\n\nexclusion of company products from coverage under federal health care programs; and\n\n•\n\nexclusion from eligibility for the award of government contracts for our products.\n\nEfforts to ensure that our current and future business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations could involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any such requirements, we may be subject to significant penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, loss of eligibility to obtain approvals from the FDA, exclusion from participation in government contracting, healthcare reimbursement or other government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, or reputational harm, any of which could adversely affect our financial results. Although effective compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, these risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for an alleged or suspected violation could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and could divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business, even if our defense is successful. In addition, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable laws and regulations may be costly to us in terms of money, time and resources.\n\nOur failure to comply with privacy and data security laws, regulations and standards may cause our business to be materially adversely affected.\n\nWe maintain a quantity of sensitive information, including confidential business and patient health information in connection with our clinical trials that are subject to US and international laws and regulations governing the privacy and data protection of such information. Each of these laws is subject to varying interpretations and subject to evolving regulations. For example, the EU and United Kingdom (the \"UK\") GDPR, which applies extraterritorially, imposes several strict requirements for controllers and processors of personal information, which include higher standards for obtaining consent from individuals to process their personal information, increased requirements pertaining to the processing of special categories of personal information (such as health information) and pseudonymized (i.e., key-coded) data, and heightened transfer requirements of personal information from the European Economic Area/UK/Switzerland to countries not deemed to have adequate data protections laws. Notably, the U.S. is one such country as of January 1, 2024, although effective July 10, 2023, the new EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (the \"DPF\"), has been recognized as adequate under EU law to allow transfers of personal data from the EU (as well as the U.K. and Switzerland) to certified companies in the U.S. However, the DPF is likely to face legal challenge at the Court of Justice of the European Union which could cause the legal requirements for personal data transfers from the Europe to the U.S. to become uncertain once again. We will monitor these legal developments and continue to use best practices to follow established European legal standards to conduct cross-border transfer of personal data. The GDPR also provides that countries in the European Economic Area may establish their own laws and regulations further restricting the processing of certain personal information, including genetic data, biometric data, and health data. Companies that must comply with the GDPR face increased compliance obligations and risk, including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance of up to €20 million (approximately $22.6 million) or 4 percent of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater.\n\nIn the United States, in addition to HIPAA, various federal (for example, the Federal Trade Commission) and state regulators have adopted, or are considering adopting, laws and regulations concerning personal information and data security that may conflict or be more stringent or broader in scope, or offer greater individual rights, with respect to personal information than existing federal, international, or other state laws. For example, California, which continues to be a critical state with respect to evolving consumer privacy laws after enacting the California Consumer Privacy Act (the \"CCPA\"), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, took effect in January 2023 and may be subject to additional regulations promulgated through a newly created enforcement agency called the California Privacy Protection Agency (the \"CPPA\"). Failure to comply with the CCPA may result in significant civil penalties, injunctive relief, or statutory or actual damages as determined by the CPPA and California Attorney General, the latter still retaining some CCPA enforcement authority. Following California’s lead, several other states have enacted privacy laws in recent years.In\n\n80\n\naddition, a comprehensive federal privacy bill, which includes a private right of action for violations, has been proposed in Congress.\n\nWe cannot provide assurance that (i) current or future legislation will not prevent us from generating or maintaining personal information, or (ii) that patients will consent to the use of their personal information (as necessary). Either of these circumstances may prevent us from undertaking or publishing essential research and development, manufacturing, and commercialization, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\n\nFurther, on July 26, 2023, the SEC adopted cybersecurity disclosure rules for public companies that require disclosure regarding cybersecurity risk management (including our board’s role in overseeing cybersecurity risks, management’s role and expertise in assessing and managing cybersecurity risks and processes for assessing, identifying and managing cybersecurity risks) in annual reports on Form 10-K. These cybersecurity disclosure rules also require the disclosure of material cybersecurity incidents by Form 8-K.\n\nIn addition to government regulation, privacy advocates and industry groups have and may in the future propose self-regulatory standards from time to time. These and other industry standards may legally or contractually apply to us, or we may elect to comply with such standards. It is possible that if our practices are not consistent or viewed as not consistent with legal and regulatory requirements and interpretations, we may become subject to audits, inquiries, whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges, or severe criminal or civil sanctions, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, reputation, and financial condition.\n\nAll of these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs, such as costs related to organizational changes, implementing additional protection technologies, training employees and engaging consultants, which are likely to increase over time. In addition, such requirements may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies, distract management or divert resources from other initiatives and projects, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with any applicable federal, state, or similar foreign laws and regulations relating to data privacy and security could result in damage to our reputation, as well as proceedings or litigation by governmental agencies or other third parties, including class action privacy litigation in certain jurisdictions, which would subject us to significant fines, sanctions, awards, injunctions, penalties, or judgments. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\n\nIf in the future we are unable to establish U.S. or global sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to sell and market our product candidates, we may not be successful in commercializing our product candidates if they are approved and we may not be able to generate any revenue.\n\nWe currently have a limited team for the marketing, sales and distribution of any of our product candidates that are able to obtain regulatory approval. To commercialize any product candidates after approval, we must build, on a territory-by-territory basis, marketing, sales, distribution, managerial and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services, and we may not be successful in doing so. If our product candidates receive regulatory approval, we may decide to establish a sales or marketing team with technical expertise and supporting distribution capabilities to commercialize our product candidates, which will be expensive and time consuming and will require significant attention of our executive officers to manage. For example, some state and local jurisdictions have licensing and continuing education requirements for pharmaceutical sales representatives, which requires time and financial resources. Any failure or delay in the development of our internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities would adversely impact the commercialization of any of our product candidates that we obtain approval to market.\n\nWith respect to the commercialization of all or certain of our product candidates, we may choose to collaborate, either globally or on a territory-by-territory basis, with third parties that have direct sales forces and established distribution systems, either to augment our own sales force and distribution systems or in lieu of our own sales force and distribution systems. If we are unable to enter into such arrangements when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any of our product candidates that receive regulatory approval, or any such commercialization may experience delays or limitations. If we are not successful in commercializing our product candidates, either on our own or through collaborations with one or more third parties, our future product revenue will suffer and we may incur significant additional losses.\n\n81\n\nOur product candidates for which we intend to seek approval as biologic products may face competition sooner than anticipated.\n\nWith the enactment of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, an abbreviated pathway for the licensure of biosimilar biological products (both highly similar and interchangeable biological products) was created. The abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as interchangeable based on its similarity to an existing reference product. The BPCIA provides a period of exclusivity for products granted “reference product exclusivity,” under which an application for a biosimilar product referencing such products cannot be licensed by the FDA until 12 years after the first licensure date of the reference product licensed under a BLA.\n\nDuring this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA licenses a full BLA for the competing product containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product. The law is complex and is still being interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation, and meaning are subject to uncertainty. While it is uncertain when such processes intended to implement BPCIA may be fully adopted by the FDA, any such processes could have an adverse effect on the future commercial prospects for our product candidates.\n\nThere is a risk that any product candidates we may develop that are licensed as a biological product under a BLA would not qualify for the 12-year period of exclusivity or that this exclusivity could be shortened due to congressional action or otherwise, or that the FDA will not consider any product candidates we may develop to be reference products for competing products, potentially creating the opportunity for generic competition sooner than anticipated.\n\nMost states have enacted substitution laws that permit substitution of interchangeable biosimilars. The extent to which a highly similar biosimilar, once licensed, will be substituted for any one of our reference products that may be approved in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing.\n\nIf any of our product candidates receives marketing approval and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by the product candidates, our ability to market and derive revenue from the product candidates could be compromised.\n\nUndesirable side effects caused by our product candidates could cause regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in more restrictive labeling or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. Given the nature of ADCs, it is likely that there may be side effects associated with their use. Results of our clinical trials could reveal a high and unacceptable severity and prevalence of side effects. In such an event, our clinical trials could be suspended or terminated, and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of or deny approval of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications. Such side effects could also affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the clinical trials or result in potential product liability claims. Any of these occurrences may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nFurther, clinical trials by their nature utilize a sample of the potential patient population. With a limited number of patients and limited duration of exposure, rare and severe side effects of our product candidates may only be uncovered with a significantly larger number of patients exposed to the product candidate.\n\nIn the event that any of our product candidates receive regulatory approval and we or others identify undesirable side effects caused by one of our products, any of the following adverse events could occur:\n\n•\n\nregulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product or seize the product;\n\n•\n\nwe may be required to recall the product or change the way the product is administered to patients;\n\n•\n\nadditional restrictions may be imposed on the marketing of the particular product or the manufacturing processes for the product or any component thereof;\n\n•\n\nwe may be subject to fines, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties;\n\n82\n\n•\n\nregulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as a black box warning or a contraindication;\n\n•\n\nwe may be required to create a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients;\n\n•\n\nwe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients;\n\n•\n\nthe product may become less competitive; and\n\n•\n\nour reputation may suffer.\n\nAny of these occurrences could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nWhile we have been granted a Fast Track Designation by the FDA for luvelta, it may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process.\n\nWe have been granted a Fast Track Designation for luvelta for the treatment of patients with platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, who have received one to three prior lines of systemic therapy. As part of our business strategy, we may also seek Fast Track Designation for other of our product candidates. If a drug or biologic is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition and the drug or biologic demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for this condition, the product sponsor may apply for FDA Fast Track Designation. The FDA has broad discretion whether or not to grant this designation, so even if we believe a particular product candidate is eligible for this designation, we cannot assure you that the FDA would decide to grant it. Even if we do receive Fast Track Designation, as we have for luvelta, we may not experience a faster development process, review or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures. The FDA may withdraw Fast Track Designation if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program, which may happen in connection with luvelta or other of our product candidates if granted Fast Track Designation.\n\nWhile we have been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA for luvelta for the treatment of Pediatric (CBF/GLIS) AML, if we decide to seek Orphan Drug Designation for some of our other product candidates, we may be unsuccessful or may be unable to maintain the benefits associated with Orphan Drug Designation, including the potential for orphan drug exclusivity.\n\nWe have been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA for luvelta for the treatment of Pediatric CBF/GLIS AML. As part of our business strategy, we may seek Orphan Drug Designation for our other product candidates, and we may be unsuccessful. Regulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the United States and Europe, may designate drugs and therapeutic biologics for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug or therapeutic biologic as an orphan drug if it is a drug or therapeutic biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 in the United States where there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the drug or therapeutic biologic will be recovered from sales in the United States. In the United States, Orphan Drug Designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as tax advantages and user fee waivers. In addition, if a product that has Orphan Drug Designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same product for the same condition for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or where the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient product quantity.\n\nEven if we obtain Orphan Drug Designation for our product candidates in specific conditions, we may not be the first to obtain marketing approval of these product candidates for the orphan-designated condition due to the uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical products; in such case, no orphan drug exclusivity would be available unless we could demonstrate “clinical superiority.” In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be limited if we seek approval for an indication broader than the orphan-designated condition or may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. Further, even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different drugs or therapeutic biologics with different principal molecular structural features can be approved for the same condition. Even\n\n83\n\nafter an orphan product is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve the same drug or therapeutic biologic with the same principal molecular structural features for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug or therapeutic biologic is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan Drug Designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug or therapeutic biologic nor gives the drug or therapeutic biologic any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process. In addition, while we may seek Orphan Drug Designation for our product candidates, we may never receive such designations.\n\nThe tax reform legislation signed into law on December 22, 2017 reduced the amount of the qualified clinical research costs for a designated orphan product that a sponsor may claim as a credit from 50% to 25%. This may further limit the advantage and may impact our future business strategy of seeking the Orphan Drug Designation.\n\nIf we decide to pursue accelerated approval for any of our product candidates, it may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process and does not increase the likelihood that our product candidates will receive marketing approval.\n\nIn the future, we may decide to pursue accelerated approval for one or more of our product candidates. Under the FDA’s accelerated approval program, the FDA may approve a drug or biologic for a serious or life-threatening disease or condition that provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. For drugs or biologics granted accelerated approval, post-marketing confirmatory trials are required to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. These confirmatory trials must be completed with due diligence, and the FDA may require that the trial be designed, initiated, and/or fully enrolled prior to approval. If we were to pursue accelerated approval for a product candidate for a disease or condition, we would do so on the basis that there is no available therapy for that disease or condition or that our product candidate provides a benefit over available therapy. If standard of care were to evolve or if any of our competitors were to receive full approval on the basis of a confirmatory trial for a drug or biologic for a disease or condition for which we are seeking accelerated approval before we receive accelerated approval, the disease or condition would no longer qualify as one for which there is no available therapy, and accelerated approval of our product candidate would not occur without a showing of benefit over available therapy. Many cancer therapies rely on accelerated approval, and the treatment landscape can change quickly as the FDA converts accelerated approvals to full approvals on the basis of successful confirmatory trials. Whether any trial is sufficient to receive FDA approval under the accelerated approval pathway will depend on the design and safety and efficacy results of such trial and will only be determined by the FDA upon review of the trial design and a submitted BLA.\n\nMoreover, the FDA may withdraw approval of any product candidate approved under the accelerated approval pathway if, for example:\n\n•\n\nthe trial or trials required to verify the predicted clinical benefit of our product candidate fail to verify such benefit or do not demonstrate sufficient clinical benefit to justify the risks associated with such product;\n\n•\n\nother evidence demonstrates that our product candidate is not shown to be safe or effective under the conditions of use;\n\n•\n\nwe fail to conduct any required post-approval trial of our product candidate with due diligence; or\n\n•\n\nwe disseminate false or misleading promotional materials relating to the relevant product candidate.\n\nIn addition, the FDA may terminate the accelerated approval program or change the standards under which accelerated approvals are considered and granted in response to public pressure or other concerns regarding the accelerated approval program. Changes to or termination of the accelerated approval program could prevent or limit our ability to obtain accelerated approval of any of our clinical development programs.\n\nRecently, the accelerated approval pathway has come under scrutiny within the FDA and by Congress. The FDA has put increased focus on ensuring that confirmatory studies are conducted with diligence and, ultimately, that such studies confirm the benefit. For example, the FDA has convened its Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee to review what the FDA has called “dangling” or delinquent accelerated approvals, where confirmatory studies have not been completed or where results did not confirm benefit, but for which marketing approval continues in effect, and some companies have\n\n84\n\nsubsequently voluntarily requested withdrawal of approval of their products. In addition, the Oncology Center of Excellence has announced Project Confirm, which is an initiative to promote the transparency of outcomes related to accelerated approvals for oncology indications and provide a framework to foster discussion, research and innovation in approval and post-marketing processes, with the goal to enhance the balance of access and verification of benefit for therapies available to patients with cancer and hematologic malignancies.\n\nFurther, the enactment of The Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act, or FDORA, included provisions related to the accelerated approval pathway. Pursuant to FDORA, the FDA is authorized to require a post-approval study to be underway prior to approval or within a specified time period following approval. FDORA also requires the FDA to specify conditions of any required post-approval study and requires sponsors to submit progress reports for required post-approval studies and any conditions required by the FDA. FDORA enables the FDA to initiate enforcement action for the failure to conduct with due diligence a required post-approval study, including a failure to meet any required conditions specified by the FDA or to submit timely reports.\n\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\n\nOur quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate significantly or may fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, each of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate or decline.\n\nWe expect our operating results to be subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations. Our net income or loss and other operating results will be affected by numerous factors, including:\n\n•\n\nvariations in the level of expense related to the ongoing development of our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms, our product candidates or future development programs;\n\n•\n\nresults of preclinical and clinical trials, or the addition or termination of clinical trials or funding support by us, or existing or future collaborators or licensing partners;\n\n•\n\nour execution of any additional collaboration, licensing or similar arrangements, and the timing of payments we may make or receive under existing or future arrangements or the termination or modification of any such existing or future arrangements;\n\n•\n\nany intellectual property infringement lawsuit or opposition, interference or cancellation proceeding in which we may become involved;\n\n•\n\nadditions and departures of key personnel;\n\n•\n\nstrategic decisions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestitures, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments or changes in business strategy;\n\n•\n\nif any of our product candidates receives regulatory approval, the terms of such approval and market acceptance and demand for such product candidates;\n\n•\n\nregulatory developments affecting our product candidates or those of our competitors;\n\n•\n\nthe impact of accounting principles and tax laws, including as a result of recent tax law changes;\n\n•\n\nepidemics, pandemics or contagious diseases;\n\n•\n\nchanges in general market and economic conditions; and\n\n•\n\ncybersecurity incidents\n\nIf our quarterly and annual operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Furthermore, any quarterly and annual fluctuations in our operating results may, in turn, cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. We believe that quarterly and annual comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.\n\n85\n\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\n\nOur restated certificate of incorporation and our restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company. These provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to elect directors who are not nominated by current members of our board of directors or take other corporate actions, including effecting changes in our management. These provisions:\n\n•\n\nestablish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board are elected at one time;\n\n•\n\npermit only the board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill vacancies on the board;\n\n•\n\nprovide that directors may only be removed “for cause” and only with the approval of two-thirds of our stockholders;\n\n•\n\nrequire super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws;\n\n•\n\nauthorize the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that our board could use to implement a stockholder rights plan;\n\n•\n\neliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\n•\n\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\n•\n\nprohibit cumulative voting; and\n\n•\n\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings.\n\nIn addition, our restated certificate of incorporation, to the fullest extent permitted by law, provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for: any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”), our restated certificate of incorporation, or our restated bylaws; or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Furthermore, our amended and restated bylaws also provide that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act (the “Federal Forum Provision”). While the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware has held that such provisions are facially valid under Delaware law, there can be no assurance that federal or state courts will follow the holding of the Delaware Supreme Court or determine that the Federal Forum Provision should be enforced in a particular case; application of the Federal Forum Provision means that suits brought by our stockholders to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) must be brought in federal court and cannot be brought in state court.\n\nThese choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, employees and agents even though an action, if successful, might benefit our stockholders. Stockholders who do bring a claim in the specified courts could face additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claim. The specified courts may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder considering an action may be located or would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments or results may be more favorable to us than to our stockholders. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our governance documents inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\n86\n\nIn addition, Section 203 of the DGCL may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. Section 203 imposes certain restrictions on mergers, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15% or more of our common stock.\n\nThe exclusive forum provision in our organizational documents may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers or other employees, or the underwriters of any offering giving rise to such claim, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims.\n\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for: any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the DGCL, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum provision does not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"). It could apply, however, to a suit that falls within one or more of the categories enumerated in the exclusive forum provision.\n\nThis choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, or other employees, or the underwriters of any offering giving rise to such claims, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nSection 22 of the Securities Act, creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all claims brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Our amended and restated bylaws provide that the federal district courts of the United States of America will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act, or a Federal Forum Provision, including for all causes of action asserted against any defendant named in such complaint. For the avoidance of doubt, this provision is intended to benefit and may be enforced by us, our officers and directors, the underwriters to any offering giving rise to such complaint and any other professional entity whose profession gives authority to a statement made by that person or entity and who has prepared or certified any part of the documents underlying the offering. Our decision to adopt a Federal Forum Provision followed a decision by the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware holding that such provisions are facially valid under Delaware law. While federal or state courts may not follow the holding of the Delaware Supreme Court or may determine that the Federal Forum Provision should be enforced in a particular case, application of the Federal Forum Provision means that suits brought by our stockholders to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act must be brought in federal court and cannot be brought in state court, and our stockholders cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\n\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain.\n\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe market price of our stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\n\nThe trading price of our common stock may be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which we cannot control. As a result of this volatility, investors may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the purchase price. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including the other risks described in this section and the following:\n\n•\n\nresults of preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates, or those of our competitors or our existing or future collaborators;\n\n•\n\nregulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries, especially changes in laws or regulations applicable to our product candidates;\n\n87\n\n•\n\nthe success of competitive products or technologies;\n\n•\n\nintroductions and announcements of new products by us, our future commercialization partners, or our competitors, and the timing of these introductions or announcements;\n\n•\n\nactions taken by regulatory agencies with respect to our products, clinical studies, manufacturing process or sales and marketing terms;\n\n•\n\nactual or anticipated variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\n•\n\nthe success of our efforts to acquire or in-license additional technologies, products or product candidates;\n\n•\n\ndevelopments concerning current or future collaborations, including but not limited to those with our sources of manufacturing supply and our commercialization partners;\n\n•\n\nmarket conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors;\n\n•\n\ngeneral economic uncertainty and capital markets disruptions, including changes in interest rates, a change in the U.S. presidential administration, rising inflation, potential instability with respect to the federal debt ceiling and budget and potential government shutdowns related thereto, which have been substantially impacted by regional geopolitical instability due to the impact of geopolitical tensions and the ongoing military conflicts around the world;\n\n•\n\nany adverse impact of health pandemics, including on our clinical trials and clinical trial operations;\n\n•\n\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic collaborations, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\n•\n\ndevelopments or disputes concerning patents or other proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our product candidates and products;\n\n•\n\nour ability or inability to raise additional capital and the terms on which we raise it;\n\n•\n\nthe recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\n•\n\nchanges in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\n•\n\nactual or anticipated changes in earnings estimates or changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding our common stock, other comparable companies or our industry generally;\n\n•\n\nour failure or the failure of our competitors to meet analysts’ projections or guidance that we or our competitors may give to the market;\n\n•\n\nfluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\n•\n\nannouncement and expectation of additional financing efforts;\n\n•\n\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\n•\n\ntrading volume of our common stock;\n\n•\n\nsales of our common stock by us or our stockholders;\n\n•\n\nchanges in accounting principles or tax laws;\n\n•\n\nterrorist acts, acts of war or periods of widespread civil unrest, including the ongoing armed conflicts around the world;\n\n88\n\n•\n\nnatural disasters, epidemics, pandemics or contagious diseases, and other calamities;\n\n•\n\npolitical instability; and\n\n•\n\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions.\n\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the markets for pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have been often unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the issuer. These broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. The realization of any of the above risks or any of a broad range of other risks, including those described in this “Risk Factors” section, could have a dramatic and adverse impact on the market price of our common stock.\n\nThe future sale and issuance of equity or of debt securities that are convertible into equity will dilute our share capital.\n\nWe may choose to raise additional capital in the future, depending on market conditions, strategic considerations and operational requirements. To the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale and issuance of shares or other securities convertible into shares, our stockholders will be diluted. Future issuances of our common stock or other equity securities, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings of shares or equity securities. No prediction can be made as to the effect, if any, that future sales of common stock or the availability of common stock for future sales will have on the trading price of our common stock.\n\nA sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\n\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. If our stockholders sell, or the market perceives that our stockholders intend to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly.\n\nWe cannot predict what effect, if any, sales of our shares in the public market or the availability of shares for sale will have on the market price of our common stock. However, future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, including shares issued upon exercise of outstanding options or warrants, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. For example, we are party to a Sales Agreement with Jefferies, pursuant to which, from time to time, we may offer and sell through Jefferies common stock pursuant to one or more “at the market” offerings. Sales of our common stock under the Sales Agreement could be subject to business, economic or competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which may be beyond our control, and which could cause actual results from the sale of our common stock to differ materially from expectations. Any future sales of common stock through our “at the market” offering program will result in dilution and may have a negative impact on the price of our common stock.\n\nWe also expect that significant additional capital may be needed in the future to continue our planned operations. To raise capital, we may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock.\n\nGeneral Risk Factors\n\nUnfavorable global economic conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\nOur business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy and in the global financial markets. For example, the global financial crisis caused extreme volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets, and the global economy has continued to be impacted by changes in interest rates, rising inflation, potential uncertainty with respect to the federal debt ceiling and budget and potential government shutdowns related thereto. Further, the capital and credit markets may be adversely affected by rising regional geopolitical tensions, and global sanctions imposed in response thereto. Our business and operations may be impacted by the current\n\n89\n\npolitical instability and military hostilities in multiple geographies including Ukraine, the Middle East and the tensions between China and Taiwan. Moreover, a severe or prolonged economic downturn, such as the global financial crisis, could result in a variety of risks to our business, including, weakened demand for our product candidates and our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. A weak or declining economy could also strain our suppliers, possibly resulting in supply disruption, or cause our customers to delay making payments for our services. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and we cannot anticipate all of the ways in which the current economic climate and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business.\n\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\n\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over the analysts or the content and opinions included in their reports. If any of the analysts who cover us issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding us, our business model, financial condition and results of operations, our intellectual property or our stock performance, or if our preclinical studies and clinical trials and operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of such analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause a decline in our stock price or trading volume.\n\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management’s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain additional executive management and qualified board members. The additional requirements we must comply with may strain our resources and divert management’s attention from other business concerns.\n\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \"Sarbanes-Oxley Act\"), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the listing requirements of The Nasdaq Global Select Market, and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming, or costly, and increase demand on our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Additionally, we may be subject to stockholder activism, which can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of management and may lead to additional compliance costs and impact the manner in which we operate our business. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. As a result, management’s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. In order to comply with these requirements, we may need to hire more employees in the future or engage outside consultants, or may have difficulty attracting and retaining sufficient employees, which would increase our costs and expenses.\n\nAs a result of no longer being an emerging growth company, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant additional expenses that we did not previously incur in complying with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and rules implemented by the SEC. The cost of compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act has required us to incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management time on compliance-related issues as we implement additional corporate governance practices and comply with reporting requirements.\n\nWe became a “smaller reporting company” as of December 31, 2022. We will continue to be a smaller reporting company if either (i) the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than $250.0 million or (ii) our annual revenue is less than $100.0 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700.0 million. Specifically, as a smaller reporting company, we may choose to present only the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and are eligible to take advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure obligations regarding compensation disclosures. As a smaller reporting company and a “non-accelerated filer”, we still need to comply with Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which will continue to require substantial management time and expense. Based on our annual revenue for the 2023 fiscal year, and the market value of our non-affiliated common stock, we expect to be an “accelerated filer” and a smaller reporting company as of December 31, 2024. As such, we will be required to comply with Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for our annual report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2024.\n\n90\n\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance, stockholder litigation, and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs, making some activities more time consuming, and increasing the likelihood and expense of litigation. These laws, regulations, and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve or otherwise change over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters, higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices, and increased expenses and management attention due to actual or threatened litigation. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards (or changing interpretations of them), and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with these laws, regulations, and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us, and our business may be adversely affected. Being a public company and complying with the associated rules and regulations, and being subject to heightened likelihood of litigation, makes it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, the costs of which can fluctuate significantly from year-to-year due to general market conditions in obtaining such insurance, but in recent years have risen significantly, consistent with the increase in market rates. As a result, we may be required to accept reduced coverage, incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage or may be unable to obtain coverage on economically reasonable terms, or at all. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executives and qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee, our compensation committee, and our nominating and corporate governance committee.\n\nAs a result of disclosure of information in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition have become more visible, which may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors. If such claims are successful, our business and operating results could be adversely affected, and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our management and adversely affect our business and operating results.\n\nIn addition, as a result of our disclosure obligations as a public company, we could face pressure to focus on short-term results, which may adversely affect our ability to achieve long-term profitability.\n\nWe may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention.\n\nThe market price of our common stock has been volatile and, in the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.\n\nItem 2.

Organization and Principal Activities\nDescription of Business\nSutro Biopharma, Inc. (the “Company”), is a clinical-stage oncology company developing site-specific and novel-format antibody drug conjugates, or\nADCs. The Company was incorporated on April 21, 2003, and is headquartered in South San Francisco, California.\nThe Company operates and manages its business as one operating segment. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer reviews financial information on\nan aggregate basis for the purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance.\nAll the Company’s long-lived assets are maintained in the United States.\nLiquidity\nThe Company has incurred significant losses and has negative cash flows from operations. As of September 30, 2024, there was an accumulated deficit\nof $714.4 million. Management expects to continue to incur additional substantial losses in the foreseeable future as a result of the Company’s research and\ndevelopment and other operational activities.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $388.3 million which are available to fund\nfuture operations. The Company will need to raise additional capital to support the completion of its research and development activities and to support its\noperations.\nThe Company believes that its unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024 will enable the Company to\nmaintain its operations for a period of at least 12 months following the filing date of its condensed financial statements.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation and Use of Estimates\nThe accompanying interim condensed financial statements of the Company are unaudited. These interim condensed financial statements have been\nprepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and\nfootnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. The December 31, 2023 condensed balance sheet was derived from the audited\nfinancial statements as of that date but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\namounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and market-specific or\nother relevant assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the Company’s\ncondensed Balance Sheets and the amounts of expenses and income reported for each of the periods presented are affected by estimates and\nassumptions, which are used for, but are not limited to, determining research and development periods under collaboration arrangements, stock-based\ncompensation expense, impairment of long-lived assets, income taxes, deferred royalty obligation related to the sale of future royalties and related non-cash\ninterest expense, and certain accrued liabilities. Actual results could differ from such estimates or assumptions.\n7\nThe accompanying unaudited interim condensed financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the audited financial statements and,\nin the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature considered necessary to state fairly the Company’s financial position,\nresults of operations, comprehensive loss, and cash flows for the interim periods. The interim results for the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024, or for any other future annual or interim\nperiod.\nThe information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited financial statements\nincluded in the Annual Report on Form 10-K pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, Segment Reporting\n(Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (“ASU 2023-07”), which requires all public entities, including public entities with a single\nreportable segment, to provide in interim and annual periods one or more measures of segment profit or loss used by the chief operating decision maker to\nallocate resources and assess performance. Additionally, the standard requires disclosures of significant segment expenses and other segment items as\nwell as incremental qualitative disclosures. The guidance in this update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods\nafter December 15, 2024. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the effects of this pronouncement on its related disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures(“ASU 2023-09”). This\nnew guidance is designed to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The amendments of this update are related to the\nrate reconciliation and income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The\nCompany is currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting standard will have on its financial statements.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported within the Company's condensed Balance Sheets\nthat sum to the total of the same amounts shown in the Company's condensed Statements of Cash Flows.\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nCash and cash equivalents $ 174,579 $ 81,834\nRestricted cash 857 872\nTotal cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash shown in the\ncondensed Statements of Cash Flows $ 175,436 $ 82,706\nInvestments in Equity Securities\nVaxcyte common stock held by the Company is measured at fair value at each reporting period based on the closing price of Vaxcyte’s common stock\non the last trading day of each reporting period, with any realized or unrealized gains and losses recorded in the Company’s condensed Statements of\nOperations.\n8\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability, or an exit price, in the principal or most\nadvantageous market for that asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date and establishes a fair value\nhierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available, and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring\nfair value. The Company determined the fair value of financial assets and liabilities using the fair value hierarchy that describes three levels of inputs that\nmay be used to measure fair value, as follows:\nLevel 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities;\nLevel 2—Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted\nprices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term\nof the assets or liabilities; and\nLevel 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nThe carrying amounts of accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and accrued compensation and benefits\napproximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these items.\nThe carrying value of the deferred royalty obligation related to the sale of future royalties under the 2015 License Agreement with Vaxcyte\napproximates its fair value as of September 30, 2024, and is based on our current estimates of future royalties expected to be earned over the estimated life\nof the royalty term arrangement. See Note 8. Deferred Royalty Obligation Related to the Sale of Future Royalties for a description of the Level 3 inputs used\nto estimate the fair value of the liability.\nRevenue Recognition\nWhen the Company enters into collaboration agreements, it assesses whether the arrangements fall within the scope of ASC 808, Collaborative\nArrangements (\"ASC 808\") based on whether the arrangements involve joint operating activities and whether both parties have active participation in the\narrangement and are exposed to significant risks and rewards. To the extent that the arrangement falls within the scope of ASC 808, the Company assesses\nwhether the payments between the Company and its collaboration partner fall within the scope of other accounting literature. If it concludes that payments\nfrom the collaboration partner to the Company represent consideration from a customer, such as license fees and contract research and development\nactivities, the Company accounts for those payments within the scope of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09 (Topic 606), Revenue from\nContracts with Customers (“ASC 606”).\nUnder ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the\nconsideration that the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity\ndetermines are within the scope of ASC 606, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the\nperformance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract;\nand (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies a performance obligation. However, if the Company concludes that its collaboration partner is\nnot a customer for certain activities and associated payments, such as for certain collaborative research, development, manufacturing and commercial\nactivities, the Company presents such payments as a reduction of research and development expense or general and administrative expense, based on\nwhere the Company presents the underlying expense.\nThe Company has no products approved for commercial sale and has not generated any revenue from commercial product sales. The total revenue to\ndate has been generated principally from collaboration and license agreements and to a lesser extent, from manufacturing, supply and services, and\nmaterials the Company provides to its collaboration partners.\nCollaboration Revenue: The Company derives revenue from collaboration arrangements, under which the Company may grant licenses to its\ncollaboration partners to further develop and commercialize its proprietary product candidates. The Company may also perform research and development\nactivities under the collaboration agreements. Consideration under these contracts generally includes a nonrefundable upfront payment, development,\nregulatory and commercial milestones and other contingent payments, and royalties based on net sales of approved products. Additionally, the\n9\ncollaborations may provide options for the customer to acquire from the Company materials and reagents, clinical product supply or additional research and\ndevelopment services under separate agreements.\nThe Company assesses which activities in the collaboration agreements are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for\nseparately. The Company develops assumptions that require judgement to determine whether the license to the Company’s intellectual property is distinct\nfrom the research and development services or participation in activities under the collaboration agreements.\nAt the inception of each agreement, the Company determines the arrangement transaction price, which includes variable consideration, based on the\nassessment of the probability of achievement of future milestones and contingent payments and other potential consideration. The Company recognizes\nrevenue over time by measuring its progress towards the complete satisfaction of the relevant performance obligation using an appropriate input or output\nmethod based on the nature of the service promised to the customer.\nFor arrangements that include multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price to the identified performance obligations\nbased on the standalone selling price (\"SSP\"), of each distinct performance obligation. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, the Company\ndevelops assumptions that require judgment to determine the SSP for each performance obligation identified in the contract. These key assumptions may\ninclude full-time equivalent (\"FTE\"), personnel effort, estimated costs, discount rates and probabilities of clinical development and regulatory success.\nUpfront Payments: For collaboration arrangements that include a nonrefundable upfront payment, if the license fee and research and development\nservices cannot be accounted for as separate performance obligations, the transaction price is deferred and recognized as revenue over the expected\nperiod of performance using a cost-based input methodology. The Company uses judgement to assess the pattern of delivery of the performance obligation.\nIn addition, amounts paid in advance of services being rendered may result in an associated financing component to the upfront payment. Accordingly, the\ninterest on such borrowing cost component will be recorded as interest expense and revenue, based on an appropriate borrowing rate applied to the value of\nservices to be performed by the Company over the estimated service performance period.\nLicense Grants: For collaboration arrangements that include a grant of a license to the Company’s intellectual property, the Company considers\nwhether the license grant is distinct from the other performance obligations included in the arrangement. For licenses that are distinct, the Company\nrecognizes revenues from nonrefundable, upfront payments and other consideration allocated to the license when the license term has begun and the\nCompany has provided all necessary information regarding the underlying intellectual property to the customer, which generally occurs at or near the\ninception of the arrangement.\nMilestone and Contingent Payments: At the inception of the arrangement and at each reporting date thereafter, the Company assesses whether it\nshould include any milestone and contingent payments or other forms of variable consideration in the transaction price using the most likely amount method.\nIf it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue would not occur upon resolution of the uncertainty, the associated milestone value is\nincluded in the transaction price. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, the Company re-evaluates the probability of achievement of each\nmilestone and any related constraint and, if necessary, adjusts its estimate of the overall transaction price. Since milestone and contingent payments may\nbecome payable to the Company upon the initiation of a clinical study or filing for or receipt of regulatory approval, the Company reviews the relevant facts\nand circumstances to determine when the Company should update the transaction price, which may occur before the triggering event. When the Company\nupdates the transaction price for milestone and contingent payments, the Company allocates the changes in the total transaction price to each performance\nobligation in the agreement on the same basis as the initial allocation. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period of\nadjustment, which may result in recognizing revenue for previously satisfied performance obligations in such period. The Company’s collaborators generally\npay milestones and contingent payments subsequent to achievement of the triggering event.\nResearch and Development Services: For amounts allocated to the Company’s research and development obligations in a collaboration arrangement,\nthe Company recognizes revenue over time using a cost-based input methodology, representing the transfer of goods or services as activities are performed\nover the term of the agreement.\nMaterials Supply: The Company provides materials and reagents, clinical materials, and services to certain of its collaborators under separate\nagreements. The consideration for such services is generally based on FTE personnel effort used to manufacture those materials, reimbursed at an agreed\nupon rate in addition to agreed-upon pricing for the provided materials. The amounts billed are recognized as revenue as the performance obligations are\nmet by the Company.\n10\nRevenue subject to governmental withholding taxes is recognized on a gross basis with the withholding taxes recorded as a component of income tax\nexpense.\n3. Fair Value Measurements\nThe following table sets forth the fair value of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis by level within the fair value\nhierarchy:\nSeptember 30, 2024\nTotal Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\n(in thousands)\nAssets:\nMoney market funds $ 60,363 $ 60,363 $ - $ -\nCommercial paper 76,720 - 76,720 -\nCorporate debt securities\n53,633 - 53,633 -\nAsset-backed securities 58,161 - 58,161 -\nU.S. government securities 134,237 134,237 - -\nU.S. agency securities 4,977 - 4,977 -\nTotal $ 388,091 $ 194,600 $ 193,491 $ -\nDecember 31, 2023\nTotal Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\n(in thousands)\nAssets:\nMoney market funds $ 56,397 $ 56,397 $ - $ -\nCommercial paper 82,152 - 82,152 -\nCorporate debt securities 61,894 - 61,894 -\nEquity securities 41,937 41,937 - -\nAsset-backed securities 10,505 - 10,505 -\nU.S. government securities 113,652 113,652 - -\nU.S. agency securities 4,961 - 4,961 -\nTotal $ 371,498 $ 211,986 $ 159,512 $ -\nWhere applicable, the Company uses quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets to determine fair value. This pricing methodology\napplies to Level 1 investments, which are comprised of money market funds and U.S. government securities.\nIf quoted prices in active markets for identical assets are not available, then the Company uses quoted prices for similar assets or inputs other than\nquoted prices that are observable, either directly or indirectly. These investments are included in Level 2 and consist of commercial paper, corporate debt\nsecurities, asset-backed securities, and U.S. agency securities. These assets are valued using market prices when available, adjusting for accretion of the\npurchase price to face value at maturity.\nA financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value\nmeasurement. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires management to make\njudgments and consider factors specific to the asset or liability.\nIn certain cases where there is limited activity or less transparency around inputs to valuation, securities are classified as Level 3 within the valuation\nhierarchy. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the deferred royalty obligation related to the sale of future Vaxcyte royalties was classified as\nLevel 3 within the valuation hierarchy. Refer to Note 8 below for information relating to the Purchase Agreement between the Company and Blackstone,\npursuant to which the Company sold to Blackstone its 4% royalty, or revenue interest, in potential future net sales of Vaxcyte’s pneumococcal conjugate\nvaccine, or PCV, products, including VAX-24 and VAX-31.\n11\nInvestment in Equity Securities\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold 667,780 shares of Vaxcyte common stock it held at their fair market\nvalue of approximately $74.0 million, net of transaction costs.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized a gain of $23.7 million and $32.1 million on the Vaxcyte common\nstock sold, respectively, which is recorded under interest and other income (expense), net, in the Statements of Operations. No shares of Vaxcyte common\nstock were sold during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company did not hold any shares of Vaxcyte common stock. As of December 31, 2023, the Company held 667,780\nshares of Vaxcyte common stock with an estimated fair value of $41.9 million.\n4. Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nCash equivalents and marketable securities consisted of the following:\nSeptember 30, 2024\nAmortized Unrealized Unrealized Fair\nCost Basis Gains Losses Value\n(in thousands)\nMoney market funds $ 60,363 $ - $ - $ 60,363\nCommercial paper 76,713 13 (6) 76,720\nCorporate debt securities 53,617 16 - 53,633\nAsset-based securities 58,146 16 (1) 58,161\nU.S. government securities 134,171 66 - 134,237\nU.S. agency securities 4,975 2 - 4,977\nTotal 387,985 113 (7) 388,091\nLess amounts classified as cash equivalents (174,406) (16) 6 (174,416)\nTotal marketable securities $ $ $ $\n)\n213,579 97 (1 213,675\nDecember 31, 2023\nAmortized Unrealized Unrealized Fair\nCost Basis Gains Losses Value\n(in thousands)\nMoney market funds $ 56,397 $ - $ - $ 56,397\nCommercial paper 82,179 1 (28) 82,152\nCorporate debt securities 61,887 12 (5) 61,894\nAsset-based securities 10,505 - – 10,505\nU.S. government securities 113,612 40 – 113,652\nU.S. agency securities 4,960 1 – 4,961\nTotal 329,540 54 (33) 329,561\nLess amounts classified as cash equivalents (65,144) (4) - (65,148)\nTotal marketable securities $ 264,396 $ 50 $ (33) $ 264,413\nNo marketable securities had maturities of more than one year as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nThere were $56.7 million and $110.9 million of investments in an unrealized loss position of $7,000 and $33,000 as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, the Company did not record any other-than-\ntemporary impairment charges on its available-for-sale securities. Based on the Company’s procedures under the expected credit loss model, including an\nassessment of unrealized losses on the portfolio after September 30, 2024, and 2023, the Company concluded that the unrealized losses for its marketable\nsecurities were not attributable to credit and therefore an allowance for credit losses for these securities has not been recorded as of September 30, 2024.\nAlso, based on the scheduled maturities of the investments, the Company was more likely than not to hold these investments for a period of time sufficient for\na recovery of the Company’s cost basis.\nThe Company recognized no material gains or losses on its cash equivalents and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023 and as a result, the Company did not reclassify any amounts out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the period then ended.\n12\n5. Collaboration and License Agreements and Supply Agreements\nThe Company has entered into collaboration and license agreements and supply agreements with various pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.\nSee “Note 5. Collaboration and License Agreements and Supply Agreements” to the Company’s financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, or as further described below, for additional information on each of its collaboration agreements.\nThe Company’s accounts receivable balances may contain billed and unbilled amounts from upfront payments, milestones and other contingent\npayments, as well as reimbursable costs from collaboration and license agreements and supply agreements. The Company performs a regular review of its\ncustomers’ credit risk and payment histories, including payments made after the period end. Historically, the Company has not experienced credit loss from its\naccounts receivable and, therefore, has not recorded a reserve for estimated credit losses as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nIn accordance with the collaboration, license and supply agreements, the Company recognized revenue as follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands) (in thousands)\nAstellas Pharma Inc.

The Company expects to recognize approximately $72.6 million of the deferred revenue over the next twelve months.\nAstellas License and Collaboration Agreement\nIn June 2022, the Company entered into a License and Collaboration Agreement (the “Astellas Agreement”) with Astellas for the development of\nimmunostimulatory antibody-drug conjugates for up to three biological targets, to be identified by Astellas. The Company will conduct research and pre-clinical\ndevelopment of any compound (as designated by Astellas) in each of the three programs in accordance with the terms of a research plan between the\nCompany and Astellas. Astellas will have an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize any such designated compound, subject to the\nCompany’s rights to participate in cost and profit sharing in the United States, as described below.\nPursuant to the Astellas Agreement, the Company received from Astellas a one-time, nonrefundable, non-creditable, upfront payment of $90.0 million\nduring the year ended December 31, 2022. Under ASC 808 and ASC 606, the Company determined that both parties are active participants in the activities\nand are exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the success of the development program, and identified four performance obligations under\nthe Astellas Agreement as: (1) performance of services related to the first target program; (2) performance of services related to the second target program;\n(3) performance of services related to the third target program; and (4) the Company’s estimated future services on the collaboration JSC. The transaction\nprice of $90.0 million was allocated among the performance\n13\nobligations using the Company’s best estimate of the standalone selling price, or SSP, for each of the associated performance obligations. Revenue allocated\nto the three target programs, which totaled $89.1 million, was being recognized on a proportional performance basis, using FTE cost as the basis of\nmeasurement, with such performance expected to occur over an estimated service period of four years for each target program. For the JSC performance\nobligation, revenue allocated to such performance obligation was $0.9 million, and was being recognized on a proportional performance basis using FTE cost\nas the basis of measurement, and such effort is expected to be incurred on a relatively consistent basis throughout the term of the Astellas Agreement.\nAdditionally, under ASC 606, the Company determined a financing component associated with the $90.0 million upfront payment and has calculated\n$25.0 million as of September 30, 2024, on the unearned revenue portion beyond one year from the effective date of the agreement, which amount is being\nrecognized as interest expense and revenue over the estimated service period for the target programs.\nThe Company is also eligible to receive up to $422.5 million in development, regulatory and commercial milestones for each product candidate, and\ntiered royalties ranging from low double-digit to mid-teen percentages on worldwide sales of any commercial products that may result from the collaboration,\nsubject to customary deductions under certain circumstances. The Company can also elect to convert any product candidate into a cost and profit-sharing\narrangement, for the United States only. In the event the Company makes such election, it will share commercialization costs and profits relating to such\nproduct candidate equally with Astellas in the United States, and no royalties will be due from Astellas for net sales of such product candidates in the United\nStates.\nIn June 2024, Astellas notified the Company that it would not be nominating a third target program. This decision was based on Astellas' strategic\nportfolio considerations. Pursuant to ASC 606, Astellas' decision to not elect a third target program is a change in the scope of the original contract and thus\nrepresents a contract modification. At the date of the modification, the Company determined that the remaining research and development activities related to\nthe first target program and the second target program to be undertaken by the Company after the notice of termination were not distinct from the related\nactivities performed on each target prior to the modification. Accordingly, after re-allocation of the updated transaction price, the Company updated the cost-\nbased input measure of progress for the remaining performance obligations and recorded a cumulative catch-up adjustment to revenue of $17.8 million on the\nmodification date relating to the ongoing unsatisfied performance obligations. For the JSC performance obligation, as the remaining services were determined\nto be distinct from those already provided, the Company determined that the contract modification should be treated as a termination of the existing contract\nand the creation of a new contract, to be accounted for prospectively.\nRevenues under the Astellas Agreement were as follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands) (in thousands)\nOngoing performance related to\nunsatisfied performance obligations $ 5,095 $ 5,612 $ 33,915 $ 11,423\nResearch and development services 1,274 1,920 4,278 4,639\nFinancing component on unearned revenue 1,268 2,456 5,186 7,531\nMaterials supply 24 - 419 -\nTotal revenue $ 7,661 $ 9,988 $ 43,798 $ 23,593\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was $35.1 million and $69.0 million of deferred revenue, respectively, related to the upfront\npayment received by the Company under the Astellas Agreement.\nCollaboration with Tasly\nTasly License Agreement\nIn December 2021, the Company entered into a license agreement with Tasly to grant Tasly an exclusive license to develop and commercialize STRO-\n002, or luveltamab tazevibulin, or luvelta, in Greater China (the “Tasly License Agreement”). Tasly will pursue the clinical development, regulatory approval,\nand commercialization of luvelta in multiple indications, including ovarian cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, and other\nindications in\n14\nGreater China. The Company will retain development and commercial rights of luvelta globally outside of Greater China, including the United States.\nThe Company determined that the Tasly License Agreement falls within the scope of ASC 808, as both parties are active participants in the activities and\nare exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the success of the commercialization of indications for luvelta in Greater China. The Company\nconcluded that the Tasly License Agreement contained the following units of account: i) licensed know-how and Sutro patents, license to trademark rights, and\ninitial regulatory data and information necessary to prepare an IND; and ii) collaboration governance and information sharing activities, such as JSC\nparticipation and ongoing regulatory and pharmacovigilance support.\nThe promises related to the licensed know-how and Sutro patents, license to trademark rights, and initial regulatory data and information necessary to\nprepare an IND are considered to be interdependent and not distinct from each other, representing a combined output. The Company determined that these\npromises are capable of being distinct from the collaboration governance and information sharing activities discussed below and further determined that this\nunit of account is a vendor-customer relationship and accounted for it in accordance with ASC 606. All potential future milestones and other payments were\nconsidered constrained at the inception of the Tasly License Agreement since the Company could not conclude it was probable that a significant reversal in\nthe amount of revenue recognized would not occur. Since there is only one performance obligation accounted for under ASC 606, no allocation of the\ntransaction price was necessary.\nThe Company determined that the unit of account consisting of collaboration governance and information sharing activities, such as JSC participation\nand ongoing regulatory and pharmacovigilance support, do not represent a customer-vendor relationship between the Company and Tasly. These promises\nare considered to be interdependent and not distinct from each other, representing a combined output. However, the Company determined that these\npromises are capable of being distinct from the intellectual property and data license promises discussed above. As such, based on the nature of the\nagreement and collaborative activities, the Company determined that the costs associated with these governance and information sharing activities performed\nunder the agreement will be included in research and development expenses in the Statements of Operations, with any reimbursement of costs by Tasly\nreflected as a reduction of such expenses. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, the Company did not recognize any\nmaterial reduction of research and development expenses under the Tasly License Agreement.\nIn April 2022, the Company entered into amendment No. 1 (the “Tasly Amendment”) to the Tasly License Agreement with Tasly. Pursuant to the Tasly\nAmendment, the initial nonrefundable upfront payment due by Tasly was amended to $25.0 million, and a $15.0 million payment will become payable to the\nCompany upon the achievement of certain regulatory milestones. The Tasly Amendment also added an additional regulatory milestone payment to the Tasly\nLicense Agreement, providing additional potential payments totaling up to $350.0 million related to development, regulatory and commercialization milestones,\nbeyond the payments described above, and made certain other ministerial edits.\nDuring 2023, the Company recognized a $5.0 million contingent payment as revenue, net of withholding tax, after Tasly received its first IND clearance\nby National Medical Products Administration, or NMPA, in Greater China. The withholding tax of $0.5 million was recorded as an income tax charge related to\nthe contingent payment.\nDuring 2023, the Company also recorded a $5.0 million contingent payment, received by the Company from Tasly related to the first patient dosed in the\nCompany’s REFRaME-O1 trial for luvelta, as deferred revenue, net of withholding tax of $0.5 million. The REFRaME-O1 study consists of two parts, Part I\nbeing the dose-finding portion and Part II being the portion of the study that will focus on the selected dose from Part I, and is intended to generate data to\nenable the potential registration of luvelta. Although it currently intends to conduct the REFRaME-O1 study to completion, the Company has the sole discretion\nto terminate the REFRaME-O1 study at any time. Given the above, the contingent payment received by the Company was considered constrained for\naccounting purposes during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, since the Company could not conclude it was probable that a significant\nreversal in the amount of revenue recognized would not occur. The withholding tax was recorded by the Company as a tax charge related to the received\ncontingent payment.\n2023 Tasly Supply Agreement\nIn June 2023, the Company entered into a Master Development and Clinical Supply Agreement (the “2023 Tasly Supply Agreement”) with Tasly, wherein\nTasly requested the Company to provide development, manufacturing and supply chain management services, including clinical product supply.\n15\nRevenues under the Tasly agreements were as follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands) (in thousands)\nContingent payment $ - $ 5,000 $ - $ 5,000\nResearch and development services 32 72 70 72\nMaterials supply - - 937 -\nTotal revenue $ 32 $ 5,072 $ 1,007 $ 5,072\nAgreements with Vaxcyte\nVaxcyte Supply Agreement\nIn May 2018, the Company entered into a Supply Agreement (the “Supply Agreement”) with Vaxcyte, wherein Vaxcyte engaged the Company to provide\nresearch and development services and to supply extracts and custom reagents, as requested by Vaxcyte. The pricing is based on an agreed upon cost-plus\narrangement.\nDuring 2020, upon Vaxcyte’s request and their agreement to reimburse the related costs, the Company entered into agreements with third-party contract\nmanufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to conduct process transfers to allow for such CMOs to manufacture and supply extract and custom reagents for\nVaxcyte. As part of the agreement with Vaxcyte, should the Company decide to purchase extract from the extract CMO, the Company would be required to\nreimburse Vaxcyte for a portion of all incurred process transfer costs. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was $9.4 million and $6.9\nmillion, respectively, in such accruals related to the Vaxcyte Supply Agreement.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the agreed-upon reimbursements by Vaxcyte of the costs associated with such\narrangements, principally for pass-through costs from the CMOs, were $2.8 million and $7.0 million, respectively, and were accounted for by the Company as\na reduction to research and development expense based on the Company’s conclusion that Vaxcyte was not a customer for such activities and associated\npayments.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the agreed-upon reimbursements by Vaxcyte of the costs associated with such\narrangements, principally for pass-through costs from the CMOs, were $2.8 million and $5.6 million, respectively.\nVaxcyte Agreement\nIn December 2022, the Company entered into a letter agreement (the “Vaxcyte Agreement”) with Vaxcyte under which the Company granted to Vaxcyte\n(i) authorization to enter into an agreement with an independent alternate CMO to source cell-free extract solely for the products it licensed from the\nCompany, allowing Vaxcyte to have direct oversight over financial and operational aspects of the relationship with the CMO (“CMO Relationship Rights”), and\n(ii) a right, but not an obligation, to obtain certain exclusive rights to internally manufacture and/or source extract from certain CMOs and the right to\nindependently develop and make improvements to extract for use in connection with the exploitation of certain vaccine compositions (the “Option”).\nIn November 2023 (the \"Exercise Date\"), Vaxcyte exercised the Option by submitting written notice thereof to the Company and concurrently paid the\nCompany $50.0 million in cash as the first of two installment payments for the Option exercise price. In May 2024, Vaxcyte paid the Company an additional\n$25.0 million in cash as the second of two installment payments for the Option exercise price under the Vaxcyte Agreement.\nUpon the occurrence of certain regulatory milestones, Vaxcyte would be obligated to pay the Company certain additional payments totaling up to $60.0\nmillion in cash. In the event that Vaxcyte undergoes a change of control, certain rights and payments may be accelerated. These contingent payments were\nconsidered constrained variable consideration or otherwise not eligible for revenue recognition at inception and as of September 30, 2024.\n16\nRevenues under the Vaxcyte agreements were as follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands) (in thousands)\nResearch and development services $ 563 $ 636 $ 1,860 $ 1,707\nMaterials supply 93 956 289 1,263\nTotal revenue $ 656 $ 1,592 $ 2,149 $ 2,970\nRefer to Note 8 below for information relating to the Purchase Agreement between the Company and Blackstone, pursuant to which the Company sold to\nBlackstone its 4% royalty, or revenue interest, in potential future net sales of Vaxcyte products, including VAX-24 and VAX-31.\nIpsen Agreements\nIn March 2024, the Company and Ipsen Pharma SAS (“Ipsen”) entered into an Exclusive License Agreement (the “Ipsen License Agreement”) pursuant\nto which the Company licensed to Ipsen, on an exclusive basis, the right to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize STRO-003.\nIn consideration for the rights and licenses granted by the Company to Ipsen in the Ipsen License Agreement, (i) Ipsen paid the Company an upfront\nlicense fee in the amount of $50.0 million in April 2024 and (ii) Ipsen Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. (USA) (“Ipsen USA”), a fully-owned Affiliate of Ipsen, purchased\n4,827,373 shares of the Company’s common stock for $25.0 million, at a price of approximately $5.18 per share, in accordance with the terms set forth in a\ncertain investment agreement by and between the Company and Ipsen USA dated March 29, 2024 (the “Ipsen Investment Agreement”, and, together with the\nIpsen License Agreement, the “Ipsen Agreements”). The fair market value of the common stock issued to Ipsen USA in April 2024 was $24.6 million, based on\nthe stock price on the date of issuance, resulting in a $0.4 million premium on the Ipsen Investment Agreement.\nFurther, pursuant to the Ipsen License Agreement, upon the occurrence of a specified developmental milestone according to a specified timetable, the\nCompany will receive a payment of up to $7.0 million and Ipsen is obligated to purchase up to an additional $10.0 million in shares of the Company’s common\nstock at a price per share representing a 17% premium to the VWAP of the Company’s common stock for the twenty trading day period prior to such\nmilestone achievement, in accordance with the terms set forth in the Ipsen Investment Agreement. The Company is also eligible to receive up to an additional\n$447.0 million in developmental and regulatory milestones, assuming multiple indications, and up to $360.0 million in sales milestones, as well as tiered royalty\npayments ranging from low double-digit to mid-teen digit percentages of annual net sales of STRO-003, subject to certain adjustments specified in the Ipsen\nLicense Agreement.\nThe royalty payment obligations under the Ipsen License Agreement expire on a country-by-country basis no earlier than ten years following the first\ncommercial sale of STRO-003 in the applicable country. Ipsen may terminate the Ipsen License Agreement for convenience with sixty calendar days prior\nwritten notice or for certain other specified reasons. The Company may terminate the Ipsen License Agreement if Ipsen or any of its Affiliates challenge the\nvalidity of any patents controlled by the Company that are licensed under the agreement. Both Ipsen and the Company may terminate the Ipsen License\nAgreement (i) for material breach by the other party and a failure to cure such breach within the time period specified in the Ipsen License Agreement or (ii)\nthe other party’s bankruptcy event.\nThe Company concluded that the Ipsen License Agreement contains three promised goods and services consisting of the STRO-003 license, technology\ntransfer, and IND-enabling activities. The Company concluded that these promised goods and services are not distinct from each other, and all play an integral\nrole in allowing Ipsen to file an IND and begin its development of STRO-003. As such, the STRO-003 license, technology transfer, and IND-enabling activities\nare accounted for as one single performance obligation.\nThe Ipsen License Agreement and the Ipsen Investment Agreement are being accounted for as one arrangement because they were entered into at or\nnear the same time and negotiated in contemplation of one another. The Company determined that the total transaction price of the Ipsen License Agreement\nwas $50.4 million, comprised of the one-time, nonrefundable, non-creditable upfront payment of $50.0 million paid by Ipsen under the Ipsen License\nAgreement, and a $0.4 million premium from the Ipsen Investment Agreement.\nRevenue for the performance obligation will be recognized at a point in time when the Company has completed all its deliverables, i.e., STRO-003\nlicense, technology transfer, and IND-enabling activities, at which time Ipsen would have what it needs from the Company to file an IND for STRO-003.\n17\nIpsen Transition Services Agreement (\"TSA\") and Material Transfer Agreement (\"MTA\")\nIn July 2024, the Company executed the Transition Services Agreement (“TSA”) with Ipsen. The TSA outlines the terms and conditions for transition\nservices requested by Ipsen as part of the Ipsen License Agreement. Further, as part of the transition activities under the TSA, Ipsen and the Company\nexecuted a Material Transfer Agreement (\"MTA\") to govern the transfer of certain materials from the Company to Ipsen for research and development\npurposes. The pricing for the services and material supply is outlined in the TSA and MTA.\nRevenues under the Ipsen agreements were as follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands) (in thousands)\nResearch and development services $ 93 $ – $ 111 $ –\nMaterials supply 73 – 150 –\nTotal revenue $ 166 $ – $ 261 $ –\nAs of September 30, 2024, there was $50.4 million of deferred revenue related to the Ipsen Agreements.\nCollaboration with Merck\nIn August 2024, Merck informed the Company of its decision to discontinue the clinical trial of MK-1484 in patients. Merck stated that the decision was\nbased on strategic portfolio considerations.\n6. Commitments and Contingencies\nLeases\nThe Company leases certain office, laboratory and manufacturing facilities in South San Francisco, California and San Carlos, California. These leases\nrequire monthly lease payments that may be subject to annual increases throughout the lease term. Certain of these leases also include renewal options at the\nelection of the Company to renew or extend the lease for an additional 5 years. These renewal options have not been considered in the determination of the\nright-of-use assets and lease liabilities associated with these leases as the Company has determined it is not reasonably certain it will exercise such options.\nThe Company recognizes rent expense for these operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease period. The components of lease costs, which\nthe Company includes in operating expenses in the Company's condensed Statements of Operations, were as follows (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nOperating lease cost $ 1,984 $ 1,979 $ 5,952 $ 5,055\nShort-term lease cost 49 59 140 102\nVariable lease cost 680 580 2,127 1,431\nTotal lease costs $ 2,713 $ 2,618 $ 8,219 $ 6,588\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded operating lease expense of $2.0 million and $6.0 million,\nrespectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company paid $6.9 million of operating lease payments related to the lease liabilities, which\nthe Company includes in net cash used in operating activities in the Company's condensed Statements of Cash Flows.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded operating lease expense of $2.0 million and $5.1 million,\nrespectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company paid $5.7 million of operating lease payments related to the lease liabilities, which\nthe Company includes in net cash used in operating activities in the Company's condensed Statements of Cash Flows.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the weighted-average remaining lease term was 3.1 years and 3.8 years, respectively, and the\nweighted-average discount rate used to determine the operating lease liability was 10.8% for both periods.\n18\nAs of September 30, 2024, the maturities of the Company’s operating lease liabilities were as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ending December 31, Amount\n(in thousands)\nRemaining in 2024 $ 2,343\n2025 9,533\n2026 8,994\n2027 8,289\nTotal lease payments 29,159\nLess: imputed interest (4,295)\nOperating lease liabilities 24,864\nLess: current portion (7,203)\nTotal lease liabilities, non-current $ 17,661\nIndemnification & Other\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to vendors, lessors, business partners, board\nmembers, officers, and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of breach of such agreements, services to\nbe provided by the Company, negligence or willful misconduct of the Company, violations of law by the Company, or from intellectual property infringement\nclaims made by third parties. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with directors and certain officers and employees that will\nrequire the Company, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors, officers,\nor employees. No demands have been made upon the Company to provide indemnification under such agreements, and thus, there are no claims that the\nCompany is aware of that could have a material effect on the Company’s condensed Balance Sheets, condensed Statements of Operations, or condensed\nStatements of Cash Flows. The Company currently has directors’ and officers’ liability insurance.\nIn addition, the Company enters into agreements in the normal course of business, including with contract research organizations for clinical trials,\ncontract manufacturing organizations for certain manufacturing services, and vendors for preclinical studies and other services and products for operating\npurposes, which are generally cancelable upon written notice.\n7. Accrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities consist of the following:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nVaxcyte-related accrual under Vaxcyte Supply Agreement $ 9,440 $ 6,933\nCMO-related accrual 10,929 8,195\nClinical trials-related accrual 8,288 4,283\nTax and related expenses 18 15,165\nOther 3,460 3,897\nTotal accrued expenses and other current liabilities $ 32,135 $ 38,473\n8. Deferred Royalty Obligation related to the Sale of Future Royalties\nIn June 2023, the Company entered into the Purchase Agreement with Blackstone, pursuant to which the Company sold to Blackstone its 4% royalty, or\nrevenue interest, in the potential future net sales of Vaxcyte products, including the Purchased Interest under the 2015 License Agreement. As described in\nNote 5. Collaboration and License Agreements and Supply Agreements, Vaxcyte Agreement, following agreement with Vaxcyte on the Form Definitive\nAgreement and upon effectiveness of the amendment No. 3 to the 2015 License Agreement, the revenue interest in the 4% royalty on potential future net\nsales of Vaxcyte products other than Vaxcyte’s PCV products reverted to the Company. The Company retains the right to discover and develop vaccines for\nthe treatment or prophylaxis of any disease that is not caused by an infectious pathogen, including cancer.\nIn June 2023, Blackstone made an upfront payment of $140.0 million to the Company and will also pay up to an additional $250.0 million upon the\nachievement of various return thresholds as set forth in the Purchase Agreement.\n19\nUnder the Purchase Agreement, and in connection with its sale of the Purchased Interest, the Company has agreed to certain covenants with respect to\nthe exercise of its rights under the 2015 License Agreement, including with respect to the Company’s right to amend, assign and terminate the 2015 License\nAgreement. The Purchase Agreement contains other customary terms and conditions, including representations and warranties, covenants, and\nindemnification obligations in favor of each party.\nThe Company recorded the $140.0 million upfront payment from Blackstone as a deferred royalty obligation related to the sale of future royalties on the\nCompany's condensed Balance Sheets. Due to the Company's then ongoing manufacturing obligations under the 2015 License Agreement, the Company\naccounted for the proceeds as imputed debt and, therefore, will recognize future non-cash royalty revenues. Non-cash interest expense will be recognized\nover the estimated life of the royalty term arrangement using the effective interest method based on the imputed interest rate derived from estimated amounts\nand timing of potential future royalty payments to be received from Vaxcyte. As part of the sale, the Company incurred approximately $3.8 million in\ntransaction costs, which are being amortized over the estimated life of the royalty term arrangement using the effective interest method. As future royalties are\nearned from Vaxcyte by Blackstone, the balance of the deferred royalty obligation will be amortized over the estimated life of the royalty term arrangement.\nThere are a number of factors that could materially affect the fair value of the deferred royalty obligation. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the\namount and timing of potential future royalty payments to be earned and received by Blackstone from Vaxcyte under the 2015 License Agreement, changing\nstandards of care, the introduction of competing products, manufacturing or other delays, intellectual property matters, adverse events that result in\ngovernmental health authority imposed restrictions on the use of the vaccine products, and other events or circumstances that could result in reduced royalty\npayments from Vaxcyte to Blackstone, which are not within the Company's control, and all of which would result in a reduction or increase of non-cash royalty\nrevenues and the non-cash interest expense over the estimated life of the royalty term arrangement. The Company periodically assesses the estimated\nroyalty payments to be earned by Blackstone from Vaxcyte and, to the extent that the amount or timing of such payments is materially different than its original\nestimates, the Company prospectively adjusts the imputed interest rate and the related amortization of the deferred royalty obligation. As of September 30,\n2024, the effective interest rate used by the Company to amortize the liability is 18.89%.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized approximately $7.9 million and $22.4 million, respectively, of\nnon-cash interest expense on the deferred royalty obligation, which amount will increase such balance. During the three and nine months ended September\n30, 2023, the Company recognized approximately $5.9 million and $6.4 million, respectively, of non-cash interest expense on the deferred royalty obligation.\nAs of September 30, 2024, Blackstone has not received any royalty payment from Vaxcyte and, therefore, the deferred royalty obligation has not begun to be\namortized.\nThe following table shows the activity of the deferred royalty obligation for the nine months ended September 30, 2024:\nSeptember 30, 2024\n(in thousands)\nLiability related to sale of future Vaxcyte royalties - beginning balance $ 149,114\nNon-cash interest expense associated with the sale of future Vaxcyte royalties 22,380\nAmortization of issuance costs 473\nLiability related to the sale of future Vaxcyte royalties - ending balance $ 171,967\n20\n9. Stockholders’ Equity\nCommon Stock\nHolders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters to be voted upon by the stockholders of the Company.\nThe Company has reserved common stock, on an if-converted basis, for issuance as follows:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nCommon stock options issued and outstanding 8,904,562 7,905,032\nCommon stock awards issued and outstanding 6,022,734 5,244,873\nRemaining shares reserved for issuance under 2018 Equity\nIncentive Plan and 2021 Equity Inducement Plan 1,495,378 1,777,919\nShares reserved for issuance under 2018 Employee\nStock Purchase Plan 1,213,418 914,911\nWarrants to purchase common stock 127,616 127,616\nTotal 17,763,708 15,970,351\nPreferred Stock\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized with a par value of $0.001 per\nshare. No shares of preferred stock were outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n10. Equity Incentive Plans, Equity Inducement Plans, Employee Stock Purchase Plan and Stock-Based Compensation\n2004 Equity Incentive Plan, 2018 Equity Incentive Plan, 2021 Equity Inducement Plan, and Amended and Restated 2021 Equity Inducement Plan\nIn September 2018, the Company adopted the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (“2018 Plan”), which became effective on September 25, 2018. As a result,\nthe Company will not grant any additional awards under the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (“2004 Plan”). The terms of the 2004 Plan and applicable award\nagreements will continue to govern any outstanding awards thereunder. In addition to the shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under the\n2004 Plan that were added to the 2018 Plan upon its effective date, the Company initially reserved 2,300,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the\n2018 Plan. In addition, the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 2018 Plan will automatically increase on the first day of\nJanuary for a period of up to ten years, commencing on January 1, 2019, in an amount equal to 5% of the total number of shares of the Company’s capital\nstock outstanding on the last day of the preceding year (rounded to the nearest whole share), or a lesser number of shares determined by the Company’s\nboard of directors. As a result, common stock reserved for issuance under the 2018 Plan was increased by 3,050,491 shares on January 1, 2024.\nIn August 2021, the Company adopted the 2021 Equity Inducement Plan (“2021 Plan”), which became effective on August 4, 2021. Upon its effective\ndate, the Company initially reserved 750,000 shares of common stock for issuance pursuant to non-qualified stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”)\nunder the 2021 Plan. In accordance with Rule 5635(c)(4) of the Nasdaq listing rules, equity awards under the 2021 Plan may only be made to an employee if\nhe or she is granted such equity awards in connection with his or her commencement of employment with the Company and such grant is an inducement\nmaterial to his or her entering into employment with the Company or such subsidiary. In addition, awards under the 2021 Plan may only be made to employees\nwho have not previously been an employee or member of the Board (or any parent or subsidiary of the Company) or following a bona fide period of non-\nemployment of the employee by the Company (or a parent or subsidiary of the Company). At all times, the Company will reserve and keep available a\nsufficient number of shares as will be required to satisfy the requirements of all outstanding awards granted under the 2021 Plan.\nIn August 2022, the Company amended and restated the 2021 Plan (the “Amended and Restated 2021 Plan”) and reserved an additional 750,000\nshares of common stock available for issuance under the Amended and Restated 2021 Plan to be granted by the Company to certain employees as a material\ninducement to their acceptance of employment with the Company in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c)(4).\n21\nAdditionally, in February 2023, the Company amended and restated the Amended and Restated 2021 Plan and reserved an additional 500,000 shares of\ncommon stock available for issuance under the Amended and Restated 2021 Plan to be granted by the Company to certain employees as a material\ninducement to their acceptance of employment with the Company in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c)(4). The total number of shares reserved for\nissuance pursuant to the Amended and Restated 2021 Plan is 2,000,000 shares.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had a total of 1,495,378 shares available for grant under the 2018 Plan and the 2021 Plan.\nThe following table summarizes option activity under the Company’s 2004 Plan, 2018 Plan and 2021 Plan:\nWeighted-\nAverage\nShares Exercise Price\nStock options outstanding at December 31, 2023 7,905,032 $ 11.24\nGranted 1,545,209 4.18\nExercised (63,748) 4.24\nCanceled and forfeited (481,931) 10.91\nStock options outstanding at September 30, 2024 8,904,562 10.08\nStock options exercisable at September 30, 2024 6,349,762 $ 11.85\nRestricted Stock Units\nThe RSUs vest annually, and generally, will become fully vested over four years.

The Company initially reserved 230,000 shares of common stock for sale\nunder the ESPP. The aggregate number of shares reserved for sale under the ESPP will automatically increase on the first day of January for a period of up\nto ten years, commencing on January 1, 2019, in an amount equal to 1% of the total number of shares of the Company’s capital stock outstanding on the last\nday of the preceding year (rounded to the nearest whole share), or a lesser number of shares determined by the Company’s board of directors. As a result,\ncommon stock reserved for issuance under the ESPP was increased by 114,754 shares on January 1, 2024. The aggregate number of shares issued over\nthe term of the Company’s ESPP, subject to stock-splits, recapitalizations or similar events, may not exceed 2,300,000 shares of the Company’s common\nstock.\nAt the Company’s annual stockholder meeting in June 2024, the Company amended the ESPP (the “Amended ESPP”) to increase the overall limit on\nthe number of shares that may be issued under the Amended ESPP throughout its ten-year term from 2,300,000 shares to 3,050,0000 shares of the\nCompany’s common stock.\nAs of September 30, 2024, 1,836,582 shares had been purchased and 1,213,418 shares were available for future issuance under the ESPP.\n22\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nTotal stock-based compensation expense recognized was as follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands) (in thousands)\nResearch and development expense: $ 3,268 $ 2,877 $ 9,514 $ 8,825\nGeneral and administrative expense: 3,277 3,126 9,258 9,860\nTotal $ 6,545 $ 6,003 $ 18,772 $ 18,685\nAs of September 30, 2024, unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to the unvested stock options and RSUs granted was $9.4 million\nand $28.1 million, respectively.

These statements are inherently uncertain and investors are\ncautioned not to unduly rely upon these statements.\nOverview\nWe are a clinical-stage oncology company developing site-specific and novel-format antibody drug conjugates, or ADCs, enabled by our proprietary\nintegrated cell-free protein synthesis platform, XpressCF®, and our site-specific conjugation platform, XpressCF+®. We aim to design and develop therapeutics\nusing the most relevant and potent modalities, including ADCs, bispecific ADCs, immunostimulatory ADCs, or iADCs, dual conjugate ADCs, or ADC2s, and\ncytokine derivatives. Our molecules are directed primarily against clinically validated targets where the current standard of care is suboptimal. We believe that\nour platform allows us to accelerate the discovery and development of potential first-in-class and/or best-in-class molecules by enabling the rapid and\nsystematic evaluation of protein structure-activity relationships to create optimized homogeneous product candidates. Our mission is to transform the lives of\npatients by creating medicines with improved therapeutic profiles for areas of unmet need.\nOnce identified, production of protein drug candidates can be rapidly and predictably scaled in our current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP,\ncompliant manufacturing facility. We have the ability to manufacture our proprietary cell-free extract that supports our production of proteins on a large scale\nusing a semi-continuous fermentation process. Our most advanced product candidate is STRO-002, or luveltamab tazevibulin, or luvelta, an ADC directed\nagainst folate receptor-alpha, or FRα, for patients with FRα-expressing cancers, including ovarian cancer.\nLuvelta was designed and optimized for an improved therapeutic index by placing a precise number of linker-warheads at four specific locations within the\nantibody using our proprietary XpressCF+® platform. Our first Phase 1 trial for luvelta is an open-label study evaluating luvelta as a monotherapy for patients\nwith ovarian and endometrial cancers. This trial is being conducted in two-parts, dose escalation and dose expansion. The primary objectives of the clinical trial\nare to determine the safety and tolerability profile, to define the recommended Phase 2 dose level and interval and to evaluate preliminary anti-tumor activity.\nOur secondary objectives are to characterize the human pharmacokinetics and additional safety, tolerability, and efficacy measures.\nIn 2019, we began luvelta development by enrolling a cohort of patients in a Phase 1 trial of luvelta that focused on ovarian cancer. The Phase 1 trial\nassessing safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of luvelta to treat platinum resistant ovarian cancer has been completed, and results from this Phase 1 trial\nreported at ASCO 2023 showed that luvelta exhibited a manageable safety profile together with promising preliminary efficacy data in the tested patient\npopulation.\nIn January 2024, we presented an aggregated data set from our Phase I trials of luvelta. This data set included data from all ovarian cancer patients\ntreated with luvelta as a monotherapy in Phase 1 studies, regardless of FRα expression levels, dose level of luvelta, or platinum sensitivity or resistance,\ncorresponding to a total of 99 patients, of which 92 were RECIST-evaluable, with 21% platinum sensitive patients and 78% platinum resistant patients. Patients\nreceived a median\n24\nof three prior lines of therapy. There were 72% of the patients that had experienced prior bevacizumab therapy and 70% had been treated with a PARP\ninhibitor. These patients were not selected for FRα expression levels and were treated at starting dose levels ≤2.9 mg/kg, 4.3 mg/kg, 5.2 mg/kg or ≥5.6 mg/kg.\nThe safety profile of luvelta from these aggregated data was shown to be manageable, with a low rate of discontinuation of treatment resulting from\nneutropenia. The predominant TEAE was neutropenia, encompassing neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and decreased neutrophil count, with 69.7% patients\nreporting any grade neutropenia and 64.6% patients reporting Grade 3 or higher neutropenia. Neuropathy and arthralgia were the other most commonly\nreported significant TEAEs, with 57.6% and 16% of patients reporting any grade and Grade 3 or higher arthralgia, respectively, and 44% and 7% patients\nreporting any grade and Grade 3 or higher neuropathy, respectively. The observed neutropenia was primarily uncomplicated, with less than 5% incidence of\nfebrile neutropenia. Neutropenia and arthralgia each led to discontinuation of treatment in 1.5% of patients. Neuropathy led to discontinuation of treatment in\n2.9% of patients. There were six patients that experienced grade 5 safety events on study, with one such event assessed as probably luvelta related and the\nremainder assessed as unrelated to luvelta.\nWe also presented a subset of the aggregated data from our Phase 1 trials of luvelta, for which 43 patients with platinum resistant ovarian cancer selected\nfor FRα TPS ≥25%, or tumors with ≥25% of the tumor cells expressing FRα at any level of staining intensity, were treated with 4.3 mg/kg or 5.2 mg/kg doses of\nluvelta, corresponding to patients treated across phase 1 studies that would be similar to the target population for the REFRαME-O1 registrational study. The\nObjective Response Rate, or ORR, observed for this subset population was 28%, with a DOR of 5.7 months and an estimated PFS of 5.8 months.\nBased on the data from our Phase 1 program, we selected FRα expression TPS ≥25% as the target eligibility cutoff or threshold for further study in clinical\ndevelopment of luvelta. We estimate that approximately 80% of the platinum resistant ovarian cancer patients would be eligible for luvelta treatment based on\nthis TPS ≥25% threshold for FRα expression.\nIn 2022, we initiated an additional exploratory cohort, or cohort C, of 15 patients to assess the safety of treatment with luvelta at 5.2 mg/kg in combination\nwith prophylactic pegfilgrastim and presented preliminary data from ten patients from this cohort in January 2023. In January 2024 we announced updated data\nfrom this cohort based on 16 patients. In particular:\n•Grade 3+ neutropenia was reduced from 66.7% to 6.3%, resulting in a 90.6% decrease in Grade 3+ neutropenia rates at the first cycle of luvelta\n(p=0.0002); Grade 3 neutropenia was reduced from 71.4% to 18.8%, resulting in a 73.7% decrease in Grade 3+ neutropenia rates at the first and second\ncycle (p=0.0015)\n•Overall Grade 3+ neutropenia was reduced from 76.2% to 37.5%\nFollowing the studies discussed above, we initiated a Phase 2/3 study, the REFRαME-O1 study, of luvelta for the treatment of platinum-resistant ovarian\ncancer in June 2023. This study comprises two parts; in Part 1, we enrolled 57 patients randomized 1:1 to two different doses of luvelta, either 4.3 mg/kg or 5.2\nmg/kg plus prophylactic pegfilgrastim for two cycles, followed by reduction to 4.3 mg/kg. After proceeding to Part 2 of the study and selecting an optimized dose,\nthe non-optimized dose of luvelta will be dropped and approximately 516 patients will be randomized 1:1 to the selected luvelta dose or investigator’s choice of\nchemotherapy. The protocol includes an optional interim analysis for ORR and DOR to support a potential application for accelerated approval and the\nendpoints that will be assessed to support a potential full approval are PFS and OS. The REFRαME-O1 study patient population includes those who have\nplatinum-resistant ovarian cancer, have received 1-3 lines of prior treatment, have received prior bevacizumab treatment unless not available or contraindicated,\nand whose tumors express FRα at TPS≥25%. In April 2024, we announced that we had completed enrollment of Part 1 of this study and had initiated enrollment\nof Part 2 of the study.\nBeyond our development of luvelta as a monotherapy for treatment of platinum resistant ovarian cancer, we are assessing the activity of luvelta as part of a\ncombination treatment for ovarian cancer and in connection with certain other FRα-expressing cancers.\nWe initiated a Phase 1 trial to assess the combination of luvelta and bevacizumab for treatment of ovarian cancer in December 2021 and presented initial\npreliminary results of this study in January 2024 and updated results at the 2024 ESMO Congress in September 2024. Safety signals from this study were\ngenerally consistent with those previously reported, and the combination treatment with luvelta and bevacizumab demonstrated clinical activity in treated\npatients regardless of their FRα expression status and prior bevacizumab exposure. At the recommended Phase 2 dose (4.3 mg/kg), an ORR of 56% (5/9) was\nobserved, while no (0/6) patients had a response at 3.5 mg/kg and 50% (1/2) of patients had a response at 5.2 mg/kg. An ORR of 35% (6/17) was observed in\nthe overall population of RECIST evaluable patients with a median duration of response of 9.3 months. In patients with ≥25% FRα expression, an ORR of 44%\n(4/9) was observed; in patients with <25% FRα expression, an ORR of 29% (2/7) was observed. No new safety signals were observed compared with either\nagent alone; consistent with previous reported luvelta safety results, the most common\n25\nadverse event was neutropenia. In addition, we are enrolling patients in the expansion phase of the bevacizumab combination Phase 1b study and expect to\npresent initial data from this trial in in the first half of 2025.\nWe also began enrolling patients in an expansion cohort for FRα -selected endometrial cancer in the fourth quarter of 2021 and presented initial preliminary\nresults from the study at the 2023 ESMO Congress in October 2023. In this trial, luvelta showed encouraging preliminary anti-tumor activity in FRα-selected\npatients, defined by a TPS of >25% FRα expression, and the safety profile was consistent with prior data in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.\nOur IND for the treatment of FRα-expressing non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, with luvelta was cleared by the FDA in the first half of 2024 and we\ninitiated the Phase 2 study in August 2024. Initial preliminary data is expected in 2025.\nIn addition, we have been offering compassionate use of luvelta to treat pediatric patients with relapsed/refractory CBFA2T3-GLIS2, or CBF/GLIS, acute\nmyeloid leukemia, or AML, commonly known as RAM phenotype AML, via single patient INDs. Updated compassionate use data continued to show anti-\nleukemic activity of luvelta in pediatric patients with relapsed/refractory CBF/GLIS AML and was presented at ASH 2023 in December 2023. The data showed\nthat luvelta was well tolerated as a monotherapy agent and in combination with standard cancer therapies. Luvelta was granted Rare Pediatric Disease and\nOrphan Drug Designations by the FDA in November and December 2022, respectively, in this pediatric patient population. We initiated a registration-directed\ntrial of luvelta for treatment of pediatric RAM phenotype AML in October 2024.\nRecognizing the potential patient benefit and commercial opportunity for luvelta, we engaged a financial advisor to assist in our efforts to identify a partner\nfor luvelta who can provide financial resources and expertise for the multi-indication development and commercialization of luvelta.\nOur most advanced asset in preclinical development is STRO-004. a tissue factor, or TF, targeting ADC, which features a DAR8 exatecan payload and\nsite-specific linker design. We believe STRO-004 has the potential to be a best-in-class ADC targeting TF. Preclinical data suggest that STRO-004 has potent\nantitumor activity and the potential for a differentiated safety profile. We anticipate filing an IND for STRO-004 in the second half of 2025. Our other preclinical\nassets include dual-payload ADCs, or ADC2, and immunostimulatory ADCs, or iADCs. We plan to file three INDs over the next three years, including for STRO-\n004.\nEnabled through our proprietary XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms, we have entered into multi-target, product-focused collaborations with leading\npharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in the field of oncology, with our ongoing relationships that include licensing to Ipsen, on an exclusive basis, the\nright to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize STRO-003; an immunostimulatory ADC collaboration with Astellas; and a licensing agreement for\nluvelta in Greater China with Tasly. In August 2023, Tasly received its first IND clearance by NMPA in Greater China for luvelta.\nOur XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms have also supported Vaxcyte, focused on discovery and development of vaccines for the treatment and\nprophylaxis of infectious disease. The lead programs for Vaxcyte are VAX-31 and VAX-24, its 31-valent and 24-valent, respectively, pneumococcal conjugate\nvaccine candidates. Vaxcyte is responsible for performing all research and development activities, and we provide technical support and supply XtractCF® and\nother materials to Vaxcyte. In June 2023, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Blackstone, in which Blackstone\nacquired the right to receive our 4% revenue interest in Vaxcyte’s pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, or PCV, products such as VAX-24 and VAX-31. Following\nagreement with Vaxcyte on the Form Definitive Agreement and upon effectiveness of an amendment to the licensing agreement, the revenue interest in the 4%\nroyalty on potential future sales of Vaxcyte products other than Vaxcyte’s PCV products reverted to us. Thus, we retain the right to receive a 4% royalty on sales\nof Vaxcyte’s products other than PCV products. In November 2023, Vaxcyte exercised its option to access expanded rights to develop and manufacture cell-free\nextract for use in development and manufacture of its vaccine products, among certain other rights.\nSince the commencement of our operations, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to performing research and development and\nmanufacturing activities in support of our own product development efforts and those of our collaborators, raising capital to support and expand such activities\nand providing general and administrative support for these operations. We have funded our operations to date primarily from upfront, milestone and other\npayments under our collaboration agreements with BMS, Merck, Astellas, Vaxcyte, Ipsen, EMD Serono, BioNova, and Tasly, the issuance and sale of\nredeemable convertible preferred stock, our initial public offering, or IPO, follow-on public and other offerings of common stock, sales of our common stock\nthrough our At-the-Market Facility (“ATM Facility”) pursuant to our Open Market Sales AgreementSM dated April 2, 2021 (the “Sales Agreement”) with Jefferies\nLLC (“Jefferies”), debt financing, sale of our holdings of Vaxcyte common stock, and the royalty monetization agreement with Blackstone.\n26\nWe do not have any products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from commercial product sales. We had a loss from\noperations of $173.2 million and a net loss of $155.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which net loss included the non-operating, realized\ngain of $32.1 million related to the sale of our holdings of Vaxcyte common stock. We had a loss from operations of $132.4 million and a net loss of $137.9\nmillion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which net loss included the non-operating, unrealized gain of $2.0 million related to our holdings of\nVaxcyte common stock. Substantially all of our losses have resulted from expenses incurred in connection with our research and development programs and\nfrom general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We cannot assure you that we will have net income or that we will generate positive cash\nflow from operating activities in the future. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $714.4 million. We do not expect to generate any\nrevenue from commercial product sales unless and until we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval for one or more of our product\ncandidates, which we expect will take a number of years. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant\ncommercialization expenses related to product sales, access, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. Our operating expenses would significantly increase\ndue to continued activities to develop, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates, engage in other research and development activities, expand\nour pipeline of product candidates, continue to develop our manufacturing facility and capabilities, maintain and expand our intellectual property portfolio, seek\nregulatory and marketing approval for any product candidates that we may develop, acquire or in-license other assets or technologies, ultimately establish a\nsales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain marketing approval, and operate as a public company. In\nlight of our current resources and the cost of development, we are continuing our process of evaluating our programs and spending. Our net losses may\nfluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, depending on the timing of our clinical trials, our expenditures on other research and\ndevelopment activities and the timing of achievement and receipt of upfront, milestones and other collaboration agreement payments.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nWe do not have any products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from commercial product sales. Our total revenue to\ndate has been generated principally from our collaboration and license agreements with BMS, Merck, Astellas, Vaxcyte, Tasly, and Ipsen, and to a lesser extent,\nfrom manufacturing, supply and services and materials we provide to the above collaborators.\nWe derive revenue from collaboration arrangements, under which we may grant licenses to our collaboration partners to further develop and commercialize\nour proprietary product candidates. We may also perform research and development activities under the collaboration agreements. Consideration under these\ncontracts generally includes a nonrefundable upfront payment, development, regulatory and commercial milestones and other contingent payments, and\nroyalties based on net sales of approved products. Additionally, the collaborations may provide options for the customer to acquire from us materials and\nreagents, clinical product supply, or additional research and development services under separate agreements. We assess which activities in the collaboration\nagreements are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately. We develop assumptions that require judgement to\ndetermine whether the license to our intellectual property is distinct from the research and development services or participation in activities under the\ncollaboration agreements.\nAt the inception of each agreement, we determine the arrangement transaction price, which includes variable consideration, based on the assessment of\nthe probability of achievement of future milestones and contingent payments and other potential consideration. We recognize revenue over time by measuring\nour progress towards the complete satisfaction of the relevant performance obligation using an appropriate input or output method based on the nature of the\nservice promised to the customer.\nFor arrangements that include multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to the identified performance obligations based on the\nstandalone selling price, or SSP, of each distinct performance obligation. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, we develop assumptions that\nrequire judgment to determine the SSP for each performance obligation identified in the contract. These key assumptions may include full-time equivalent, or\nFTE, personnel effort, estimated costs, discount rates and probabilities of clinical development and regulatory success.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses represent costs incurred in performing research, development and manufacturing activities in support of our own\nproduct development efforts and those of our collaborators, and include salaries, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, laboratory supplies, outsourced\nresearch and development\n27\nexpenses, professional services, and allocated facilities and IT-related costs. We expense both internal and external research and development costs as they\nare incurred. Nonrefundable advance payments for services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are recorded as\nprepaid expenses and recognized as expenses as the related services are performed.\nOur research and development expenses would increase in the future due to continued activities to advance our product candidates into and through\npreclinical studies and clinical trials, pursue regulatory approval of our product candidates, expand our pipeline of product candidates, and continue to develop\nour manufacturing facility and capabilities. The process of conducting the necessary preclinical and clinical research to obtain regulatory approval is costly and\ntime consuming. The actual probability of success for our product candidates may be affected by a variety of factors including: the safety and efficacy of our\nproduct candidates, early clinical data, investment in our clinical programs, the ability of collaborators to successfully develop our licensed product candidates,\ncompetition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. As a\nresult of the uncertainties discussed above, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when\nand to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of our product candidates.\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses incurred during the indicated periods. The internal costs include personnel,\nfacility costs and research and scientific related activities associated with our pipeline. The external program costs reflect external costs attributable to our\nclinical development candidates and preclinical candidates selected for further development. Such expenses include third-party costs for preclinical and clinical\nstudies and research, development and manufacturing services, and other consulting costs.\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands) (in thousands)\nInternal costs:\nResearch and drug discovery $ 10,481 $ 8,391 $ 30,832 $ 25,825\nProcess and product development 5,995 5,047 18,528 15,264\nManufacturing 12,503 10,074 36,645 32,804\nClinical development 4,024 3,083 11,697 9,101\nTotal internal costs 33,003 26,595 97,702 82,994\nExternal Program Costs:\nResearch and drug discovery 949 1,522 2,449 2,366\nProcess and product development 322 759 1,108 2,189\nManufacturing 18,613 11,033 50,643 21,353\nClinical development 9,221 5,760 29,104 17,758\nTotal external program costs 29,105 19,074 83,304 43,666\nTotal research and development expenses $ 62,108 $ 45,669 $ 181,006 $ 126,660\nGeneral and Administrative\nOur general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, expenses for outside professional services, including legal, human\nresources, audit, accounting and tax services and allocated facilities-related costs. Personnel costs include salaries, employee benefits and stock-based\ncompensation. We expect to incur expenses operating as a public company, including expenses related to compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC\nand listing standards applicable to companies listed on the Nasdaq Global Market, additional insurance expenses, investor relations activities and other\nadministrative and professional services. The size of our administrative function and our general and administrative expenses to support the anticipated growth\nof our business would increase as we continue to advance our product candidates into and through the clinic.\nInterest Income\nInterest income consists primarily of interest earned on our invested funds.\nUnrealized Gain (Loss) on Equity Securities\nUnrealized gain (loss) on equity securities consists of the remeasurement of our investment in Vaxcyte common stock.\n28\nNon-cash interest expense related to the sale of future royalties\nNon-cash interest expense related to the sale of future Vaxcyte royalties represents the imputed interest expense on our deferred royalty obligation related\nto the sale of future Vaxcyte royalties pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, using the effective interest method. As further described in the interim condensed\nfinancial statements Note 8. Deferred Royalty Obligation related to the Sale of Future Royalties, in June 2023, we entered into the Purchase Agreement with\nBlackstone, pursuant to which we sold to Blackstone our 4% royalty, or revenue interest, in the potential future net sales of Vaxcyte’s PCV products, such as\nVAX-24 and VAX-31.\nNon-cash interest expense will be recognized over the estimated life of the royalty term arrangement using the effective interest method based on the\nimputed interest rate derived from estimated amounts and timing of potential future royalty payments to be earned and received by Blackstone from Vaxcyte\nunder the 2015 License Agreement.\nInterest and Other Income (Expense), Net\nInterest expense includes interest incurred on our debt and amortization of debt issuance costs, including accretion of the final payment. Additionally, we\nidentified a financing component under the Astellas Agreement and recorded interest expense associated with the upfront payment. Other income (expense),\nnet, also includes the realized gain on the sale of Vaxcyte common stock.\nComparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024, and 2023\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nChange\n2024 2023 Change (%)\n(in thousands)\nRevenue $ 8,520 $ 16,924 $ (8,404) (50)%\nOperating expenses\nResearch and development 62,108 45,669 16,439 36%\nGeneral and administrative 14,331 15,269 (938) (6)%\nTotal operating expenses 76,439 60,938 15,501 25%\nLoss from operations (67,919) (44,014) (23,905) 54%\nInterest income 4,875 4,550 325 7%\nUnrealized gain on equity securities - 694 (694) (100)%\nNon-cash interest expense related to the\nsale of future royalties (7,910) (5,936) (1,974) 33%\nInterest and other income (expense), net 22,167 (2,739) 24,906 (909)%\nLoss before provision for income taxes (48,787) (47,445) (1,342) 3%\nProvision for income taxes - 1,839 (1,839) (100)%\nNet loss $ (48,787) $ (49,284) $ 497 (1)%\nRevenue\nWe have recognized revenue as follows during the indicated periods:\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nChange\n2024 2023 Change (%)\n(in thousands)\nAstellas Pharma Inc.

We are also eligible to receive up to an additional $447.0 million in developmental and regulatory milestones,\nassuming multiple indications, and up to $360.0 million in sales milestones, as well as tiered royalty payments ranging from low double-digit to mid-teen digit\npercentages of annual net sales of STRO-003, subject to certain adjustments specified in the Ipsen License Agreement.\nThe royalty payment obligations under the Ipsen License Agreement expire on a country-by-country basis no earlier than ten years following the first\ncommercial sale of STRO-003 in the applicable country. Ipsen may terminate the Ipsen License Agreement for convenience with sixty calendar days prior\nwritten notice or for certain other specified reasons. We may terminate the Ipsen License Agreement if Ipsen or any of its Affiliates challenge the validity of any\npatents controlled by us that are licensed under the agreement. Both Ipsen and we may terminate the Ipsen License Agreement (i) for material breach by the\nother party and a failure to cure such breach within the time period specified in the Ipsen License Agreement or (ii) the other party’s bankruptcy event.\nLeases\nIn June 2021, we entered into a third amendment, (the \"Third Amendment\") to our manufacturing facility lease, dated May 18, 2011, as amended, by and\nbetween Alemany Plaza LLC, located at San Carlos, California, or San Carlos Lease, as an extension to the term of the San Carlos Lease for a period of five\nyears, (the \"Lease Extension Period\"). Pursuant to the Third Amendment, the San Carlos Lease will expire on July 31, 2026, and it includes an option to renew\nthe San Carlos Lease for an additional five years. The aggregate estimated base rent payments due over the Lease Extension Period is approximately $4.2\nmillion, subject to certain terms contained in the San Carlos Lease.\nIn June 2021, we entered into a first amendment, or First Amendment, to our manufacturing facility lease, dated March 4, 2015, as amended, by and\nbetween 870 Industrial Road LLC, located at San Carlos, California, (the \"Industrial Lease\"), as an extension to the term of the Industrial Lease for a period of\nfive years, (the \"Industrial Lease Extension Period\"). Pursuant to the first Amendment, the Industrial Lease will expire on June 30, 2026, and it includes an\noption to renew the Industrial Lease for an additional five years. The aggregate estimated base rent payments due over the Industrial Lease Extension Period is\napproximately $4.3 million, subject to certain terms contained in the Industrial Lease.\nIn September 2020, we entered into a sublease agreement, (the \"Sublease with Five Prime Therapeutics, Inc.\"), or (the \"Sublessor\"), for approximately\n115,466 square feet, in a building located in South San Francisco, California, or (the \"Premises\"). We use the Premises as our corporate headquarters and to\nconduct (or expand) research and development activities. We commenced making monthly payments for the first 85,755 square feet of the Premises, or Initial\nPremises, in July 2021, with occupancy of such space commencing in August 2021. We were provided early access to the Initial\n33\nPremises in the fourth quarter of 2020 to conduct certain planning and tenant improvement work. The Sublease is subordinate to the lease agreement, effective\nDecember 12, 2016, between the Sublessor and HCP Oyster Point III LLC (the \"Landlord\"). We commenced using the remaining 29,711 square feet of the\nPremises, (the \"Expansion Premises\"), on July 1, 2023 under the sublease agreement. The Sublease for both the Initial Premises and Expansion Premises will\nexpire on December 31, 2027. With a commencement date on the Initial Premises of July 1, 2021, and Expansion Premises of July 1, 2023, the aggregate\nestimated base rent payments due over the term of the Sublease are approximately $39.1 million, including the approximately $5.2 million in potential financial\nbenefit to us of base rent abatement to be provided by the Sublessor, subject to certain terms contained in the Sublease. The Sublease contains customary\nprovisions requiring us to pay our pro rata share of utilities and a portion of the operating expenses and certain taxes, assessments and fees of the Premises\nand provisions allowing the Sublessor to terminate the Sublease upon the termination of the lease with the Landlord or if we fail to remedy a breach of certain of\nour obligations within specified time periods. Additionally, we posted a security deposit of $0.9 million, which is reflected as restricted cash in non-current assets\non our Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nFunding Requirements\nBased upon our current operating plan, we believe that our existing capital resources will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure\nrequirements through at least the next twelve months after the date of this filing. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and\nwe could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. We will continue to require additional financing to advance our current product\ncandidates into and through clinical development, to develop, acquire or in-license other potential product candidates, pay our obligations and to fund\noperations for the foreseeable future.\nWe may seek to raise any necessary additional capital through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic\nalliances, licensing arrangements, marketing and distribution arrangements, royalty monetizations, or other sources of financing. Adequate additional funding\nmay not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Any failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on our financial\ncondition and on our ability to pursue our business plans and strategies, and may cause us to delay, reduce the scope of or suspend one or more of our pre-\nclinical and clinical studies, research and development programs or commercialization efforts, and may necessitate us to delay, reduce or terminate planned\nactivities in order to reduce costs. Due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product\ncandidates and the extent to which we may enter into additional collaborations with third parties to participate in their development and commercialization, we\nare unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical studies.\nTo the extent we raise additional capital through new collaborations, strategic alliances, or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to\nrelinquish valuable rights to our product candidates, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not\nbe favorable to us. If we do raise additional capital through public or private equity or convertible debt offerings, the ownership interest of our existing\nstockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our stockholders’ rights. If we\nraise additional capital through debt financing, we may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring\nadditional debt, making capital expenditures, or declaring dividends.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows during the periods indicated:\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (119,802) $ (125,688)\nNet cash provided by investing activities 131,020 19,589\nNet cash provided by financing activities 94,078 140,679\nNet increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 105,296 $ 34,580\n34\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nCash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $119.8 million. Our net loss of $155.0 million included non-cash\namounts of $32.1 million for the realized gain on the sale of Vaxcyte common stock, $22.4 million for non-cash interest expense on our deferred royalty\nobligation, $18.8 million for stock-based compensation, $8.2 million for the accretion of discount on marketable securities, $5.4 million for depreciation and\namortization, and $3.8 million for non-cash lease expense. Cash used in operating activities also reflected a net change in operating assets and liabilities of\n$24.6 million, due to a decrease of $29.4 million in accounts receivable primarily from receiving $25.0 million from Vaxcyte as the second of two installment\npayments for the Option exercise price under the Vaxcyte Agreement, and an increase of $16.1 million in deferred revenue primarily due to the upfront payment\nfrom Ipsen, partially offset by revenue recognized under the Astellas Agreement, which were partially offset by a decrease of $10.0 million in accounts payable,\naccrued expenses and other liabilities due to timing of payments, a decrease of $4.7 million in our operating lease liability, an increase of $4.6 million in prepaid\nexpenses and other assets, and a decrease of $1.5 million in accrued compensation expense primarily due to bonuses paid in 2024 in connection with certain\ncompany 2023 goal achievements.\nCash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $125.7 million. Our net loss of $137.9 million included non-cash\namounts of $18.7 million for stock-based compensation, $6.4 million for non-cash interest expense on our deferred royalty obligation, $6.0 million for the\naccretion of discount on marketable securities, $5.1 million for depreciation and amortization, $2.4 million for non-cash lease expense, and $2.0 million for the\nunrealized gain on equity securities as a result of the remeasurement of the estimated fair value of our investment in Vaxcyte common stock. Cash used in\noperating activities also reflected a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $12.8 million, due to an increase of $9.5 million in accounts receivable from\nour collaborators, a decrease of $4.5 million in deferred revenue from revenue recognized under our collaboration agreements, a decrease of $3.1 million in our\noperating lease liability, and a decrease of $1.8 million in accrued compensation expense, which were partially offset by an increase of $5.3 million in accounts\npayable, accrued expenses and other liabilities due to timing of payments, and a decrease of $0.8 million in prepaid expenses and other assets.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nCash provided by investing activities of $131.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily related to maturities and sales of\nmarketable securities of $394.5 million, and net proceeds from the sale of Vaxcyte common stock of $74.0 million, partially offset by purchases of marketable\nsecurities of $335.5 million, and purchases of property and equipment of $2.0 million, principally for laboratory equipment.\nCash provided by investing activities of $19.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily related to maturities and sales of\nmarketable securities of $402.2 million, partially offset by purchases of marketable securities of $379.7 million, and purchases of property and equipment of $2.9\nmillion, principally for laboratory equipment.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities of $94.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily related to $71.5 million of net proceeds\nfrom the underwritten offering, $25.0 million of proceeds from Ipsen USA upon the purchase of our common stock under the Ipsen Investment Agreement, $1.8\nmillion of net proceeds received from participants in our employee equity plans, and $0.3 million of proceeds received from the exercise of common stock\noptions, partially offset by debt repayment of $4.1 million and a $0.5 million tax payment related to the net shares settlement of vested restricted stock units.\nCash provided by financing activities of $140.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily related to $136.2 million of net\nproceeds from the sale of future royalties, $12.0 million of net proceeds from our ATM Facility sales of common stock, $2.0 million of net proceeds received from\nparticipants in our employee equity plans, and $0.3 million of proceeds received from the exercise of common stock options, partially offset by a debt repayment\nof $9.4 million and a $0.5 million tax payment related to the net shares settlement of vested restricted stock units.\nContractual Obligations and Other Commitments\nIn addition to the contractual obligations and commitments as noted above and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q with regards to the leases\nand term loans, we enter into agreements in the normal course of business, including with contract research organizations for clinical trials, contract\nmanufacturing organizations for certain manufacturing services, and vendors for preclinical studies and other services and products for operating purposes,\nwhich are generally cancelable upon written notice.\n35\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been\nprepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the\nfinancial statements, as well as the reported revenue generated, and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical\nexperience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments\nabout the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different\nassumptions or conditions.\nThere have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to our financial statements included elsewhere in this report for more information.\n36\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate sensitivities. The primary objective of our\ninvestment activities is to preserve our capital to fund our operations. We also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk.\nTo achieve our objectives, we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities of high credit quality.\nWe had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $388.3 million and $333.7 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively, which consisted primarily of money market funds, commercial paper, corporate debt securities, asset-based securities, U.S. government securities,\nand U.S. agency securities. Such interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk; however, historical fluctuations in interest income have not\nbeen significant.\nWe do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate\nrisk exposure. We have not been exposed nor do we anticipate being exposed to material risks due to changes in interest rates. A hypothetical 10% change in\nmarket interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial statements. We do not believe that our cash, cash equivalents or marketable securities\nhave a significant risk of default or illiquidity.\n37\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of September 30, 2024, management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer\n(our principal financial officer), performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-\n15(e) of the Exchange Act. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or\nsubmit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such\ninformation is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely\ndecisions regarding required disclosures.\nDisclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us\nin the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and\noperated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objective and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the\ncost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that,\nas of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d)\nof the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our\ninternal controls over financial reporting.\n38\nPART II—OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings.\nFrom time to time, we may be involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not presently a party to any legal\nproceedings that, in the opinion of management, would have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse\nimpact on us due to defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, negative publicity and reputational harm, and other factors.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nRISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before making your decision to invest in shares of our common stock, you should carefully\nconsider the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including our interim condensed\nfinancial statements and the related notes and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” The risks and\nuncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not\nmaterial, may also become important factors that affect us. We cannot assure you that any of the events discussed below will not occur. These events could\nhave a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. If that were to happen, the trading price of our\ncommon stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those highlighted in the section titled “Risk Factors” immediately following this\nsummary. Some of these risks include:\n•We have a history of significant losses and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\n•We will need substantial additional funds to advance development of our product candidates and failure to obtain sufficient funding may force us to delay,\nlimit or terminate our product development programs, commercialization efforts or other operations. We may have difficulties accessing the required\nadditional capital on reasonable, or even any, terms to continue our product and platform development or other operations, and may have to make difficult\nprioritization decisions regarding development and potential partnering of our clinical and preclinical product candidates.\n•Our product candidates are in development and may fail, be impacted by competitive products or suffer delays that materially and adversely affect their\ncommercial viability.\n•Our business is dependent on the success of our product candidates, including Iuvelta, which is generated from our proprietary XpressCF® and\nXpressCF+® platforms.\n•If we do not achieve our development goals in the timeframes we anticipate and project, the commercialization of our products may be delayed and, as a\nresult, our stock price may decline.\n•Our approach to the discovery and development of our therapeutic treatments is based on novel technologies that are unproven and may not result in\nmarketable products.\n•We depend on our information technology systems, and any failure of these systems, or those of our CROs, third-party vendors, or other contractors or\nconsultants we may utilize, could harm our business. Security breaches, cyber-attacks, loss of data, and other disruptions could compromise sensitive\ninformation related to our business or other personal information or prevent us from accessing critical information and expose us to liability, which could\nadversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\n•Our information technology systems could face serious disruptions that could adversely affect our business.\n39\n•Our failure to comply with privacy and data protection laws or to adequately secure the personal information we hold could result in significant liability or\nreputational harm and, in turn, a material adverse effect on our client base, member base and revenue.\n•If our collaborations with third parties to develop and commercialize certain product candidates are not successful, we may not be able to capitalize on\nthe market potential of our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms and the product candidates.\n•Our inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of our product candidates or such materials, or the loss of our third-party suppliers, or our or their failure\nto comply with applicable regulatory requirements or to supply sufficient quantities at acceptable quality levels or prices, or at all, would materially and\nadversely affect our business.\n•We face competition from entities that have developed or may develop product candidates for cancer, including companies developing novel treatments\nand technology platforms. If these companies develop technologies or product candidates more rapidly than we do or their technologies are more\neffective, our ability to develop and successfully commercialize product candidates may be adversely affected.\n•If we are not able to obtain and enforce patent protection for our technologies or product candidates, development and commercialization of our product\ncandidates may be adversely affected.\n•Our collaborators may fail to abide by the terms of the agreements with us, which would require us to seek to enforce our agreements in accordance with\nthe dispute resolution procedures set forth therein. These procedures may require us to engage in litigation or arbitration to enforce our rights, which can\nbe expensive, time-consuming, and distracting to our management and Board of Directors and that may ultimately end up being unsuccessful.\n•If we are unable to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates, or experience significant delays in doing so, our\nbusiness will be materially harmed. Changes in regulatory policy may render our strategies for obtaining regulatory approval less effective or completely\nineffective, preventing us from obtaining regulatory approval for our product candidates on time or at all.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company with no products approved for commercial sale. We have a history of significant losses,\nexpect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or maintain profitability, which could result in a\ndecline in the market value of our common stock.\nWe are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company. Biotechnology product development is a highly speculative undertaking and involves a substantial\ndegree of risk.\nTo date, we have no products approved for commercial sale, have not generated any revenue from commercial product sales and, as of September 30,\n2024, had an accumulated deficit of $714.4 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023, our net loss was\n$155.0 million and $106.8 million, respectively. Substantially all of our losses have resulted from expenses incurred in connection with our research and\ndevelopment programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations. In addition, our expenses could increase beyond expectations\nif we are required by the FDA, or foreign regulatory agencies, to perform studies or clinical trials in addition to those studies and clinical trials that we currently\nanticipate conducting for our product candidates, or if there are any delays in our or our partners completing clinical trials or the development of any of our\nproduct candidates. Our technologies and product candidates are in varying stages of development, and we are subject to the risks of failure inherent in the\ndevelopment of product candidates based on novel technologies. In addition, we have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully overcome many of the\nrisks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving fields, particularly in the biotechnology industry. Furthermore, we do\nnot expect to generate any revenue from commercial product sales for the foreseeable future, and we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses for\nthe foreseeable future due to the cost of research and development, preclinical studies and clinical trials and the regulatory approval process for our product\ncandidates and manufacturing clinical and early commercial supply of our product candidates. We expect our net losses to increase substantially as we\nprogress further into clinical development of our lead programs and create additional infrastructure to support operations as a public company. However, the\namount of our future losses is uncertain. We may never generate revenues from the commercial sale of our or our collaborators’ products. Our ability to achieve\nprofitability, if ever, will depend on, among other things,\n40\nour, or our existing or future collaborators’, successful development of product candidates, evaluating the related commercial opportunities, obtaining regulatory\napprovals to market and commercialize product candidates, manufacturing any approved products on commercially reasonable terms, establishing a sales and\nmarketing organization or suitable third-party alternatives for any approved product, and raising sufficient funds to finance business activities. If we, or our\nexisting or future collaborators, are unable to develop our technologies and commercialize one or more of our product candidates or if sales revenue from any\nproduct candidate that receives approval is insufficient, we will not achieve profitability, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations and prospects. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent\nperiods.\nWe will need substantial additional funds to advance development of our product candidates and failure to obtain sufficient funding may force\nus to delay, limit or terminate our product development programs, commercialization efforts or other operations. We may have difficulty accessing\nadditional capital on reasonable, or even any, terms to continue our product and platform development or other operations and may have to make\ndifficult prioritization decisions regarding development and potential partnering of our clinical and preclinical product candidates.\nThe development of biopharmaceutical product candidates is capital-intensive. As our product candidates advance through preclinical studies and clinical\ntrials, we will need substantial additional funds to expand our development, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities. We have used\nsubstantial funds to develop our technology and product candidates and will require significant funds to conduct further research and development and\npreclinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates, to seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates, to manufacture extract and products, if\nany, which may be approved for commercial sale, to establish marketing and sales capabilities to commercialize our product candidates, and to provide support\nto our collaborators in the development of their products. In addition, we expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public\ncompany.\nSince our inception, we have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in research and development activities for our clinical-stage\nproduct candidates and the development of our technology platform, including our in-house manufacturing capabilities. Clinical trials for our product candidates\nhave required substantial funds to date and will continue to require substantial funds to complete. As of September 30, 2024, we had $388.3 million in cash,\ncash equivalents and marketable securities. We expect to incur substantial expenditures in the foreseeable future as we seek to advance multiple product\ncandidates through clinical development, manufacturing, the regulatory approval process and, if approved, commercial launch activities, as well as in\nconnection with the continued development of our technology platform and manufacturing capabilities. Based on our current operating plan, we believe that our\navailable cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operations through at least the next 12 months. However, our future\ncapital requirements and the period for which we expect our existing resources to support our operations may vary significantly from what we expect, and we\nmay need to seek additional funds sooner than planned. Our monthly spending levels vary based on new and ongoing research and development and other\ncorporate activities. Because the length of time and activities associated with successful research and development of our product candidates is highly\nuncertain, we are unable to estimate the actual funds we will require for development and any marketing and commercialization activities for approved products.\nFor example, the timing and amount of our operating expenditures will depend largely on:\n•the timing, progress and results of preclinical and worldwide clinical development activities;\n•the costs associated with the development of our internal manufacturing and research and development facilities and processes;\n•the number and scope of preclinical and clinical programs we decide to pursue;\n•our ability to partner luvelta and the economic terms of any such partnership;\n•the progress of the development efforts of parties with whom we have entered or may in the future enter into collaborations and research and development\nagreements;\n•the timing and amount of milestone and other payments we may receive under our collaboration and/or research and development agreements;\n41\n•our ability to establish and maintain collaborations, strategic partnerships or marketing, distribution, licensing or other strategic arrangements with third\nparties on favorable terms, if at all;\n•our ability to achieve sufficient market acceptance, adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors and adequate market share and revenue\nfor any approved product candidates;\n•the costs involved in prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent and other intellectual property claims;\n•the costs of manufacturing our product candidates and those of our collaborators using our proprietary XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms;\n•the cost and timing of regulatory approvals;\n•the cost of commercialization activities if our product candidates or any future product candidates are approved for sale, including marketing, sales and\ndistribution costs;\n•our efforts to enhance operational systems and hire and retain key personnel, including personnel to support development of our product candidates and\nsatisfy our obligations as a public company; and\n•general economic, industry and market conditions, including market volatility, high levels of inflation, changes in interest rates, uncertainty with respect to\nthe federal debt ceiling and budget and potential government shutdowns related thereto.\nIf we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis or on acceptable terms, we may have to delay, reduce or terminate our research and development\nprograms and preclinical studies or clinical trials, limit strategic opportunities or undergo reductions in our workforce or other corporate restructuring activities.\nWe also could be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies\nor product candidates that we would otherwise pursue on our own. We cannot provide assurance that anticipated collaborator payments will, in fact, be\nreceived. We do not expect to realize revenue from sales of commercial products or royalties from licensed products in the foreseeable future, if at all, and, in no\nevent, before our product candidates are clinically tested, approved for commercialization and successfully marketed. To date, we have primarily financed our\noperations through payments received under our collaboration and other associated agreements, the sale of equity securities, debt financing and a royalty\nmonetization agreement. We will be required to seek additional funding in the future and currently intend to do so through additional collaborations and/or\nlicensing agreements, public or private equity offerings or debt financings, credit or loan facilities, royalty monetization or a combination of one or more of these\nfunding sources. Additional funds may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.\nIf we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders will suffer dilution and the terms of any financing may adversely affect the rights of\nour stockholders. If we raise additional funds through licensing or collaboration arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our\nproduct candidates, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. In addition, as a condition to providing additional funds to us, future investors may\ndemand, and may be granted, rights superior to those of existing stockholders. Any future debt financings, if available, are likely to involve, restrictive covenants\nlimiting our flexibility in conducting future business activities, and, in the event of insolvency, debt holders would be repaid before holders of our equity securities\nreceive any distribution of our corporate assets. Failure to obtain capital when needed on acceptable terms may force us to delay, limit or terminate our product\ndevelopment and commercialization of our current or future product candidates, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur product candidates are in varying development stages and may fail in development or be impacted by competitive products or suffer\ndelays that materially and adversely affect their commercial viability. If we or our collaborators are unable to complete development of or\ncommercialize our product candidates or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\nWe have no products on the market and all of our product candidates for cancer therapy are in clinical development. Our most advanced product\ncandidate, luvelta, is being evaluated in REFRαME-O1, a Phase 2/3 pivotal trial for treatment of women with platinum resistant ovarian cancer, as well as non-\nsmall cell lung cancer and children with pediatric AML. Additionally, we have programs that are being evaluated by partners in clinical trials and by us in earlier\nstages of discovery and preclinical development and may never advance to clinical-stage development. Our ability to achieve and\n42\nsustain profitability depends on obtaining regulatory approvals for and successfully commercializing our product candidates, either alone or with third parties,\nand we cannot guarantee you that we will ever obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. We have limited experience in conducting and\nmanaging the clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approvals, including approval by the FDA. Before obtaining regulatory approval for the commercial\ndistribution of our product candidates, we or an existing or future collaborator must conduct extensive preclinical tests and clinical trials to demonstrate the\nsafety and efficacy in humans of our product candidates.\nWe may not have the financial resources to continue development of, or to modify existing or enter into new collaborations for, a product candidate if we\nexperience any issues that delay or prevent regulatory approval of, or our ability to commercialize, product candidates, including:\n•negative or inconclusive results from our, or our licensees’ clinical trials, or the clinical trials of others for product candidates similar to ours, leading to a\ndecision or requirement to conduct additional preclinical testing or clinical trials or abandon a program;\n•product-related side effects experienced by patients in our clinical trials or by individuals using drugs or therapeutic biologics similar to our product\ncandidates;\n•difficulty achieving successful continued development, or transfer to third-parties, of our internal manufacturing processes, including process development\nand scale-up activities to supply products for preclinical studies, clinical trials and commercial sale;\n•delays in submitting INDs or comparable foreign applications or delays or failures in obtaining the necessary approvals from regulators to commence a\nclinical trial, or a suspension or termination of a clinical trial once commenced;\n•conditions imposed by the FDA or comparable foreign authorities regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials;\n•delays in enrolling patients or high drop-out rates in our clinical trials;\n•inadequate supply or quality of product candidate components or materials or other supplies necessary for the conduct of our clinical trials;\n•inability to obtain alternative sources of supply for which we have a single source for product candidate components or materials;\n•occurrence of epidemics, pandemics or contagious diseases and potential effects on our business, clinical trial sites, highly complex supply chain and\nmanufacturing facilities;\n•greater than anticipated costs of our clinical programs;\n•harmful side effects or inability of our product candidates to meet efficacy endpoints during clinical trials, which can be unpredictable even in light of earlier\nnon-clinical and clinical data;\n•failure to demonstrate in our clinical trials a sufficient response rate or duration of response;\n•failure to demonstrate a benefit-risk profile acceptable to the FDA or other regulatory agencies;\n•unfavorable FDA or other regulatory agency inspection and review of one or more of our clinical trial sites or manufacturing facilities;\n•failure of our third-party contractors or investigators to comply with regulatory requirements or otherwise meet their contractual obligations in a timely\nmanner, or at all;\n•delays and changes in regulatory requirements, policy and guidelines, including the imposition of additional regulatory oversight around clinical testing\ngenerally or with respect to our technology in particular; and\n43\n•varying interpretations of our data by the FDA and similar foreign regulatory agencies.\nAdditionally, we intend to identify a partner for luvelta who can provide financial resources and expertise for the multi-indication development and\ncommercialization of luvelta. There can be no assurances that we will be able to identify a partner on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we cannot\npartner luvelta on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise finance luvelta development, we may significantly reduce or terminate our luvelta development\nefforts, which would materially alter our business strategy, and could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of\noperations and prospects, including a decline in our stock price.\nWe or our collaborators’ inability to complete development of or commercialize our product candidates or significant delays in doing so due to one or more\nof these factors, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur business is dependent on the success of our product candidates, including luvelta, which is generated from our proprietary XpressCF® and\nXpressCF+® platforms. Existing and future preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates may not be successful. If we are unable to\ncommercialize our product candidates or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\nWe have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in the development of our proprietary XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms\nand our proprietary product candidates, luvelta and STRO-004. Our ability to generate commercial product revenues, which we do not expect will occur for\nmany years, if ever, will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of our product candidates. We have not previously\nsubmitted a new drug application, or NDA, or a biologics license application, or BLA, to the FDA, or similar regulatory approval filings to comparable foreign\nauthorities, for any product candidate, and we cannot be certain that our product candidates will be successful in clinical trials or receive regulatory approval. In\naddition, while the REFRαME-O1 Phase 2/3 pivotal trial of luvelta is designed to support a regulatory approval for the treatment of women with platinum\nresistant ovarian cancer by the FDA or equivalent regulatory agencies, we cannot assure you that the FDA will agree with our conclusions or refrain from\nrequiring additional data prior to approval. Further, our product candidates may not receive regulatory approval even if they are successful in clinical trials. If we\ndo not receive regulatory approvals for our product candidates, we may not be able to continue our operations. Even if we successfully obtain regulatory\napprovals to market our product candidates, our revenues will be dependent, in part, upon the size of the markets in the territories for which we gain regulatory\napproval and have commercial rights. If the markets for patient subsets that we are targeting are not as significant as we estimate, we may not generate\nsignificant revenues from sales of such products, if approved.\nWe plan to seek regulatory approval to commercialize our product candidates both in the United States and in selected foreign countries. While the scope\nof regulatory approvals generally is similar in other countries, in order to obtain separate regulatory approvals in other countries, we must comply with numerous\nand varying regulatory requirements of such countries regarding safety and efficacy. Other countries also have their own regulations governing, among other\nthings, clinical trials and commercial sales, as well as pricing and distribution of our product candidates, and we may be required to expend significant resources\nto obtain regulatory approval and to comply with ongoing regulations in these jurisdictions.\nThe success of luvelta, STRO-004 and our other future proprietary product candidates will depend on many factors, including the following:\n•successful enrollment of patients in, and the completion of, our clinical trials;\n•receiving required regulatory approvals for the development, manufacturing, and commercialization of our product candidates;\n•establishing our commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers;\n•establishing successful technology transfers and collaborations to develop our product candidates with licensees, including our licensees with rights to\nluvelta in Greater China;\n•obtaining and maintaining patent, trademark and trade secret protection and non-patent exclusivity for our product candidates and their components;\n44\n•enforcing and defending our intellectual property rights and claims and avoiding or defending against intellectual property rights and claims from third\nparties;\n•achieving desirable therapeutic properties for our product candidates’ intended indications;\n•launching commercial sales of our product candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with third parties;\n•acceptance of our product candidates, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;\n•effectively competing with other therapies, including those that have not yet entered the market;\n•maintaining an acceptable safety profile of our product candidates through clinical trials and following regulatory approval; and\n•achieving commercially relevant success in the market post approval.\nMany of these factors are out of our control and if we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience\nsignificant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize our product candidates, which would materially harm our business, financial condition, results of\noperations and prospects.\nPatient enrollment, a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials, is affected by many factors including the size and nature of the patient population, the\nproximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the design of the clinical trial, competing clinical trials and clinicians’ and patients’\nperceptions as to the potential advantages of the product candidate being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs or therapeutic\nbiologics that may be approved for the indications being investigated by us. Furthermore, we expect to rely on our collaborators, CROs and clinical trial sites to\nensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials and, while we expect to enter into agreements governing their committed activities, we have limited\ninfluence over their actual performance.\nWe could encounter delays if prescribing physicians encounter unresolved ethical issues associated with enrolling patients in clinical trials of our product\ncandidates in lieu of prescribing existing treatments that have established safety and efficacy profiles.\nAdditionally, we have in the past and may in the future create benchmark molecules for comparative purposes. For example, we have created a\nbenchmark FRα targeting antibody-drug conjugate, or ADC, using conventional technology that results in a heterogeneous ADC mixture. We have compared\nluvelta to this benchmark molecule in multiple preclinical models. We believe the results of these tests help us understand how the therapeutic index of luvelta\ncompares to competitors’ product candidates. However, we cannot be certain that any benchmark molecule that we create is the same as the molecule we are\nattempting to recreate, and the results of the tests comparing any such benchmark molecule to any other potential or current product candidate may be different\nthan the actual results of a head-to-head test of any such other potential or current product candidate against a competitor molecule. Additional preclinical and\nclinical testing will be needed to evaluate the therapeutic index of our potential or current product candidates, and to understand their therapeutic potential\nrelative to other product candidates in development. While we believe our ADCs may be superior to other investigative agents in development, without head-to-\nhead comparative data, we will not be able to make claims of superiority to other products in our promotional materials, if our product candidates are approved.\nIf we do not achieve our projected development goals in the time frames we anticipate and project, the commercialization of our products may\nbe delayed and our stock price may decline.\nFrom time to time, we estimate the timing of the anticipated accomplishment of various scientific, clinical, regulatory, commercial and other product\ndevelopment goals, which we sometimes refer to as milestones. These milestones may include the commencement or completion of scientific studies and\nclinical trials and the submission of regulatory filings. From time to time, we may publicly announce the expected timing of some of these milestones. All of these\nmilestones are and will be based on numerous assumptions. The actual timing of these milestones can vary dramatically compared to our estimates, in some\ncases for reasons beyond our control, such as health epidemics and pandemics, global instability and geopolitical conflicts within regions where our clinical trials\nare conducted. For example, we have opened a clinical trial site in Israel, which may face enrollment, operational or other difficulties due to conflicts within the\nregion,\n45\nincluding, for example, difficulties importing clinical study drug through Israeli customs, difficulties with patient enrollment, or difficulties with patients or medical\npersonnel accessing appropriate medical facilities. In addition, we rely on third party vendors, contractors and consultants to provide services in connection with\nour clinical trials. If these third parties do not perform their services in a timely or workmanlike manner, our clinical studies may be delayed. If we do not meet\nthese milestones as publicly announced, or at all, the commercialization of our products may be delayed or never achieved and, as a result, our stock price may\ndecline.\nOur approach to the discovery and development of our therapeutic treatments is based on novel technologies, including unprecedented\nImmunostimulatory Antibody Drug Conjugate, or iADC, and dual Antibody Drug Conjugates, or ADC2 technology, that are unproven and may not\nresult in marketable products.\nWe are developing a pipeline of product candidates using our proprietary XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms. We believe that product candidates\nidentified with our product discovery platform may offer an improved therapeutic approach by taking advantage of precision design and rapid empirical\noptimization, thereby reducing the dose-limiting toxic effects associated with existing products. However, the scientific research that forms the basis of our\nefforts to develop product candidates based on our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms is ongoing. Further, the scientific evidence to support the feasibility of\ndeveloping therapeutic treatments based on our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms is both preliminary and limited.\nTo date, our clinical stage product candidates have been tested in a relatively limited number of clinical trial patients. We may ultimately discover that our\nXpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms and any product candidates resulting therefrom do not possess certain properties required for therapeutic effectiveness.\nXpressCF® product candidates may also be unable to remain stable in the human body for the period of time required for the drug to reach the target tissue or\nthey may trigger immune responses that inhibit the ability of the product candidate to reach the target tissue or that cause adverse side effects in humans. We\ncurrently have only limited data, and no conclusive evidence, to suggest that we can introduce these necessary properties into these product candidates derived\nfrom our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms. We may spend substantial funds attempting to introduce these properties and may never succeed in doing so.\nIn addition, product candidates based on our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms may demonstrate different chemical and pharmacological properties in\npatients than they do in laboratory studies. Although our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms and certain product candidates have produced successful\nresults in animal studies, they may not demonstrate the same chemical and pharmacological properties in humans and may interact with human biological\nsystems in unforeseen, ineffective or harmful ways. Further, in our oncology clinical trials to date, we have used achievement of stable disease as evidence for\ndisease control (stable disease, partial response or complete response) by our product candidates; however, the FDA does not view stable disease as an\nobjective response for the purposes of FDA approval.\nResults of our clinical trials could reveal a high and unacceptable severity and prevalence of side effects or unexpected characteristics. Undesirable side\neffects could result in the delay, suspension or termination of clinical trials by us or regulatory authorities for a number of reasons. In our clinical trials to date, our\nproduct candidates have been generally well tolerated, and the most common treatment-emergent adverse events, or TEAEs, that resulted in a treatment delay\nor dose reduction was reversible neutropenia and myalgia/arthralgia, which has also been observed as a TEAE. It is possible that, as we test our product\ncandidates in larger, longer and more extensive clinical trials or as the use of our product candidates becomes more widespread following any regulatory\napproval, illnesses, injuries, discomforts and other adverse events that were observed in earlier trials, as well as conditions that did not occur or went\nundetected in previous trials, will be reported by patients. If such side effects become known later in development or upon approval, if any, such findings may\nharm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects significantly.\nIf product candidates based on our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms are unable to demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy data to obtain marketing\napproval, we may never succeed in developing a marketable product, we may not become profitable and the value of our common stock will decline. The\nregulatory approval process for novel product candidates such as ours can be more expensive and take longer than for other, better known or extensively\nstudied product candidates. We are not aware of any company currently developing a therapeutic using our approach to ADC, iADC or ADC2 development and\nno regulatory authority has granted approval for such a therapeutic. We believe the FDA has limited experience with therapeutics in oncology or other disease\nareas developed in cell-free-based synthesis systems, which may increase the complexity, uncertainty and length of the regulatory approval process for our\nproduct candidates. For example, our XpressCF® ADC product candidates contain cleavable or non-cleavable linker-warhead combinations or novel warheads\nthat may result in unforeseen events when administered in a human. We and our existing or future collaborators may never receive approval to market and\ncommercialize any product candidate. Even if we or an existing or future collaborator obtains regulatory approval, the approval may be for targets, disease\nindications or\n46\npatient populations that are not as broad as we intended or desired or may require labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety\nwarnings. We or an existing or future collaborator may be required to perform additional or unanticipated clinical trials to obtain approval or be subject to post-\nmarketing testing requirements to maintain regulatory approval. If the products resulting from our XpressCF® platform prove to be ineffective, unsafe or\ncommercially unviable, our entire platform and pipeline would have little, if any, value, which would have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and prospects.\nResults of preclinical studies and early clinical trials may not be predictive of results of future clinical trials.\nThe outcome of preclinical studies and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and preliminary results of clinical trials\ndo not necessarily predict success in future clinical trials. Many companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant\nsetbacks in late-stage clinical trials after achieving positive results in earlier development, and we could face similar setbacks. The design of a clinical trial can\ndetermine whether its results will support approval of a product, and flaws in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well\nadvanced. While certain relevant members of our company have significant clinical experience, we in general have limited experience in designing clinical trials\nand may be unable to design and execute a clinical trial to support marketing approval. In addition, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying\ninterpretations and analyses. Many companies that believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have\nnonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval for the product candidates. Even if we, current or future collaborators, believe that the results of clinical trials for\nour product candidates warrant marketing approval, the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree and may not grant marketing approval\nof our product candidates.\nIn some instances, there can be significant variability in safety or efficacy results between different clinical trials of the same product candidate due to\nnumerous factors, including changes in trial procedures set forth in protocols, differences in the size and type of the patient populations, changes in and\nadherence to the dosing regimen and other clinical trial protocols and the rate of dropout among clinical trial patients. In addition, results from compassionate\nuse of our product candidates, such as luvelta to treat pediatric CFB/GLIS AML, may not be confirmed in Company-sponsored trials and/or may negatively\nimpact the prospects for marketing approval for our product candidates. If we fail to receive positive results in clinical trials of our product candidates, the\ndevelopment timeline and regulatory approval and commercialization prospects for our most advanced product candidates, and, correspondingly, our business\nand financial prospects would be negatively impacted.\nInterim, top-line, or preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce may change as more patient data become available and are\nsubject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data.\nFrom time to time, we have publicly disclosed, and in the future will disclose, interim, top-line, or preliminary data from our preclinical studies and clinical\ntrials, which are based on preliminary analyses of then-available data, and the results and related findings and conclusions are subject to change following a\nmore comprehensive review and/or maturation of the data related to the particular study or trial. We also make assumptions, estimations, calculations, and\nconclusions as part of our analyses of data, and we may not have received or had the opportunity to fully and carefully evaluate all data. Therefore, final results\nfrom the studies may differ from the top-line results initially reported, and the final results may indicate different conclusions once additional data have been\nevaluated. As such, top-line data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. In addition, the information we choose to publicly disclose\nregarding a particular study or clinical trial is based on what is typically extensive data, and you or others may not agree with what we determine is material or\notherwise appropriate information to include in our disclosure. If the final results differ from the interim, top-line, or preliminary data, or if others, including\nregulatory authorities, disagree with the conclusions reached, our ability to obtain approval for, and to commercialize, our product candidates may be harmed,\nwhich may negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. Further, disclosure of interim data by us or by our competitors\ncould result in volatility in the price of our common stock.\nFurther, others, including regulatory agencies, may not accept or agree with our assumptions, estimates, calculations, conclusions, or analyses, or may\ninterpret or weigh the importance of data differently, which could negatively affect the approvability or commercialization of the particular product candidate.\n47\nThe market may not be receptive to our product candidates based on a novel therapeutic modality, and we may not generate any future\nrevenue from the sale or licensing of product candidates.\nEven if regulatory approval is obtained for a product candidate, we may not generate or sustain revenue from sales of the product due to factors such as\nwhether the product can be sold at a competitive cost, competition in the therapeutic area(s) we have received or may receive approval for, and whether it will\notherwise be accepted in the market. Historically, there have been concerns regarding the safety and efficacy of ADCs, and an ADC drug was voluntarily\nwithdrawn from the market for an extended period of time. These historical concerns may negatively impact the perception market participants have on ADCs,\nincluding our product candidates. Additionally, the product candidates that we are developing are based on our proprietary XpressCF® and XpressCF+®\nplatforms, which are new technologies. Market participants with significant influence over acceptance of new treatments, such as physicians and third-party\npayors, may not adopt an ADC product, or a product or treatment based on our novel cell-free production technologies, and we may not be able to convince the\nmedical community and third-party payors to accept and use, or to provide favorable reimbursement for, any product candidates developed by us or our existing\nor future collaborators. Market acceptance of our product candidates will depend on the following, among other factors:\n•the timing of our receipt of any marketing and commercialization approvals;\n•the terms of any approvals and the countries in which approvals are obtained;\n•the safety and efficacy of our product candidates;\n•the prevalence and severity of any adverse side effects associated with our product candidates;\n•limitations or warnings contained in any labeling approved by the FDA or other regulatory authority;\n•relative convenience and ease of administration of our product candidates;\n•the willingness of patients to accept any new methods of administration;\n•the success of our physician education programs;\n•the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from government and third-party payors;\n•the availability of commercially approved companion diagnostic or assay or biomarker to appropriately identify patients that will benefit from treatment;\n•the pricing of our products, particularly as compared to alternative treatments; and\n•the availability of alternative effective treatments for the disease indications our product candidates are intended to treat and the relative risks, benefits and\ncosts of those treatments.\nBecause our product candidates are based on new technology, we expect that they will require extensive research and development and have substantial\nmanufacturing and processing costs. In addition, our estimates regarding potential market size for any indication may be materially different from what we\ndiscover to exist at the time we commence commercialization, if any, for a product, which could result in significant changes in our business plan and have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Moreover, if any product candidate we commercialize fails to\nachieve market acceptance, it could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\niADC and ADC2 are novel technologies, which makes it difficult to predict the time, risks and cost of development and of subsequently\nobtaining regulatory approval of these potential product candidates.\nCertain of our preclinical product candidates are based on our proprietary iADC and ADC2 technology. Some of our future success depends on the\nsuccessful development of this technology and products based on it. To our knowledge, no regulatory authority has granted approval to any person or entity,\nincluding us, to market and commercialize therapeutics using our novel and unprecedented iADC or ADC2 technology. We may never receive approval to market\nand commercialize any potential iADC or ADC2 product candidate.\n48\nIf we uncover any previously unknown risks related to our iADC and ADC2 technology, or if we experience unanticipated or unsolvable problems or delays\nin developing our iADC or ADC2 product candidates, we may be unable to complete our preclinical studies and clinical trials, meet the obligations of our\ncollaboration and license agreements or commercialize our product candidates on a timely or profitable basis. If serious adverse events or unacceptable side\neffects are observed in preclinical studies or clinical trials of a product candidate based on our iADC or ADC2 technology, or if iADCs or ADC2s were shown to\nhave limited efficacy, our ability to develop other product candidates based on our iADC or ADC2 technology would be adversely affected.\nWe have entered, and may in the future seek to enter, into collaborations with third parties for the development and commercialization of our\nproduct candidates using our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms. If we fail to enter into such collaborations, or such collaborations are not\nsuccessful, we may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms and resulting product candidates.\nSince 2014, we have entered into several collaborations to develop and commercialize certain cancer and other therapeutics. Our XpressCF® and\nXpressCF+® platforms have also supported a spin-out company, now known as Vaxcyte Inc., focused on discovery and development of vaccines for the\ntreatment and prophylaxis of infectious disease. In addition, we may in the future seek third-party collaborators for research, development and\ncommercialization of other therapeutic technologies or product candidates. Biopharmaceutical companies are our prior and likely future collaborators for any\nmarketing, distribution, development, licensing or broader collaboration arrangements. With respect to our existing collaboration agreements, and what we\nexpect will be the case with any future collaboration agreements, we have and would expect to have limited control over the amount and timing of resources\nthat our collaborators dedicate to the development or commercialization of our product candidates. Moreover, our ability to generate revenues from these\narrangements will depend on our collaborators’ abilities to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements.\nCollaborations involving our product candidates currently pose, and will continue to pose, the following risks to us:\n•collaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations;\n•collaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of our product candidates or may elect not to continue or renew development or\ncommercialization programs based on preclinical studies or clinical trial results, changes in the collaborators’ strategic focus or available funding, or external\nfactors such as an acquisition that diverts resources or creates competing priorities;\n•collaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or\nconduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n•collaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our product candidates if the\ncollaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more\neconomically attractive than ours;\n•collaborators with marketing and distribution rights to one or more products may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of such\nproduct or products;\n•collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation\nthat could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to litigation or potential liability;\n•collaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability;\n•disputes may arise between the collaborators and us that result in the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our\nproduct candidates or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources; and\n49\n•collaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the\napplicable product candidates.\nAs a result of the foregoing, our current and any future collaboration agreements may not lead to development or commercialization of our product\ncandidates in the most efficient manner or at all. Moreover, if a collaborator of ours were to be involved in a business combination, the continued pursuit and\nemphasis on our product development or commercialization program could be delayed, diminished or terminated. Any failure to successfully develop or\ncommercialize our product candidates pursuant to our current or any future collaboration agreements could have a material and adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur existing collaborations with Astellas, Ipsen, Vaxcyte and Tasly are important to our business. If our collaborators cease development\nefforts under our existing or future collaboration agreements, fail to fulfill their contract obligations, or if any of those agreements are terminated,\nthese collaborations may fail to lead to commercial products and we may never receive milestone payments or future royalties under these\nagreements.\nWe have entered into collaborations with other biotechnology companies to develop or commercialize several of our product candidates, and such\ncollaborations currently represent a significant portion of our product pipeline and discovery and preclinical programs. A substantial portion of our revenue to date\nhas been derived from our collaborations, and a significant portion of our future revenue and cash resources is expected to be derived from some of these\nagreements, our royalty monetization agreement (the \"Purchase Agreement\"), with an affiliate of Blackstone Life Sciences, or Blackstone, or other similar\nagreements into which we may enter in the future. Revenue from research and development collaborations depends upon continuation of the collaborations,\npayments for research and development and other services and product supply, and the achievement of milestones, contingent payments and royalties, if any,\nderived from future products developed from our research. If we are unable to successfully advance the development of our product candidates, achieve\nmilestones or earn contingent payments under our collaboration agreements or royalty monetization agreement, future revenue and cash resources will be\nsubstantially less than expected.\nWe are unable to predict the success of our collaborations and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of our strategic collaborations. Our collaborators\nhave discretion in determining and directing the efforts and resources, including the ability to discontinue all efforts and resources, they apply to the\ndevelopment and, if approval is obtained, commercialization and marketing of the product candidates covered by such collaborations. As a result, our\ncollaborators may elect to de-prioritize our programs, change their strategic focus or pursue alternative technologies in a manner that results in reduced,\ndelayed or no revenue to us. For example, each of EMD Serono, BMS and Merck elected not to continue the development of their licensed candidates and\nAstellas decided not to nominate a third program under our collaboration, each such decision was noted as based on strategic portfolio considerations. Our\ncollaborators may have other marketed products and product candidates under collaboration with other companies, including some of our competitors, and their\ncorporate objectives may not be consistent with our best interests. Our collaborators may also be unsuccessful in developing or commercializing our products. If\nour collaborations are unsuccessful, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected. Our collaborators may fail\nto live up to the terms of their agreements with us, which would require us to seek to enforce our agreements in accordance with the dispute resolution\nprocedures set forth therein. These procedures may require us to engage in litigation or arbitration to enforce our rights, which can be expensive, time-\nconsuming and distracting to our management and Board of Directors. Further, the type and timing of resolution of such disputes are difficult to predict; and there\nis the potential that we could fail to enforce our rights either in part or in whole. Lastly, even if we successfully enforce our rights under our agreements with our\ncollaborators, there is the possibility that we could fail to recover our expectancy following the litigation or arbitration, particularly for collaborators that are not\nsubject to the jurisdiction of U.S. courts.\nIn addition, from time to time we may have disputes with our collaborators. Any dispute or litigation proceedings we may have with our collaborators could\ndelay development programs, reduce or eliminate potential milestone or other payments, create uncertainty as to ownership of intellectual property rights,\ndistract management from other business activities and generate substantial expense.\nMoreover, to the extent that any of our existing or future collaborators were to terminate a collaboration agreement, we may be forced to independently\ndevelop these product candidates, including funding preclinical studies or clinical trials, assuming marketing and distribution costs and defending intellectual\nproperty rights, or, in certain instances, abandon product candidates altogether, any of which could result in a change to our business plan and have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n50\nWe may not successfully engage in strategic transactions, including any additional collaborations we seek, which could adversely affect our\nability to develop and commercialize product candidates, impact our cash position, increase our expenses and present significant distractions to\nour management.\nFrom time to time, we may consider strategic transactions, such as additional collaborations, acquisitions of companies, asset purchases or sales and out-\nor in-licensing of product candidates or technologies that we believe will complement or augment our existing business. In particular, we will evaluate and, if\nstrategically attractive, seek to enter into additional collaborations, including with major biotechnology or biopharmaceutical companies. The competition for\ncollaborators is intense, and the negotiation process is time-consuming and complex. Any new collaboration may be on terms that are not optimal for us, and we\nmay not be able to maintain any new collaboration if, for example, development or approval of a product candidate is delayed, sales of an approved product\ncandidate do not meet expectations, or the collaborator terminates the collaboration. In addition, there have been a significant number of recent business\ncombinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future strategic partners. Additionally, antitrust or\nother competition laws, including increased enforcement within the United States in the healthcare space, may also limit our ability to enter into collaborations\nwith certain businesses or to fully realize the benefits of strategic transactions. Our ability to reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among\nother things, upon our assessment of the strategic partner’s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed\nstrategic partner’s evaluation of a number of factors. These factors may include the design or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the FDA or\nsimilar regulatory authorities outside the United States, the potential market for the subject product candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and\ndelivering such product candidate to patients, the potential of competing products, the existence of uncertainty with respect to our ownership of technology,\nwhich can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership, without regard to the merits of the challenge, and industry and market conditions generally. Moreover,\nif we acquire assets with promising markets or technologies, we may not be able to realize the benefit of acquiring such assets due to an inability to successfully\nintegrate them with our existing technologies and may encounter numerous difficulties in developing, manufacturing and marketing any new products resulting\nfrom a strategic acquisition that delay or prevent us from realizing their expected benefits or enhancing our business.\nWe cannot assure you that following any such collaboration, or other strategic transaction, we will achieve the expected synergies to justify the transaction.\nFor example, such transactions may require us to incur non-recurring or other charges, increase our near- and long-term expenditures and pose significant\nintegration or implementation challenges or disrupt our management or business. These transactions would entail numerous operational and financial risks,\nincluding exposure to unknown liabilities, disruption of our business and diversion of our management’s time and attention in order to manage a collaboration or\ndevelop acquired products, product candidates or technologies, incurrence of substantial debt or dilutive issuances of equity securities to pay transaction\nconsideration or costs, higher than expected collaboration, acquisition or integration costs, write-downs of assets or goodwill or impairment charges, increased\namortization expenses, difficulty and cost in facilitating the collaboration or combining the operations and personnel of any acquired business, impairment of\nrelationships with key suppliers, manufacturers or customers of any acquired business due to changes in management and ownership and the inability to retain\nkey employees of any acquired business.\nAccordingly, although there can be no assurance that we will undertake or successfully complete any transactions of the nature described above, any\ntransactions that we do complete may be subject to the foregoing or other risks and would have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and prospects. Conversely, any failure to enter any additional collaboration or other strategic transaction that would be beneficial\nto us could delay the development and potential commercialization of our product candidates and have a negative impact on the competitiveness of any product\ncandidate that reaches market.\nTo date, no product developed on a cell-free manufacturing platform has received approval from the FDA, so the requirements for the\nmanufacturing of products using our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms are uncertain.\nWe have invested in our own current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, compliant manufacturing facility in San Carlos, California. In this facility, we\nare developing and implementing novel, proprietary cell-free production technologies to supply our planned preclinical and clinical trials. However, before we\nmay initiate a clinical trial or commercialize any of our product candidates, we must demonstrate to the FDA that the chemistry, manufacturing and controls for\nour product candidates meet applicable requirements, and in the European Union, or EU, a manufacturing authorization must be obtained from the appropriate\nEU regulatory authorities. The FDA has allowed clinical trial use of our product candidate luvelta and others of our or our partners’ product candidates, portions\nof which are manufactured in our San Carlos\n51\nmanufacturing facility; however, because no product manufactured on a cell-free manufacturing platform has yet been approved in the United States, there is no\nmanufacturing facility that has demonstrated the ability to comply with FDA requirements for later stage clinical development or commercialization, and,\ntherefore, the time frame for demonstrating compliance to the FDA’s satisfaction is uncertain. Delays in establishing that our manufacturing process and facility\ncomply with cGMPs or disruptions in our manufacturing processes, implementation of novel in-house technologies or scale-up activities, may delay or disrupt\nour development efforts.\nWe have ongoing technology transfers to enable large scale manufacture of extract and the reagents necessary to manufacture our products using our\nXpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms. These large scale technology transfers may fail or be delayed, resulting in impacts to our development timelines and the\ncosts associated with manufacturing our development products.\nWe expect to rely on third parties to conduct certain of our preclinical studies or clinical trials. If those third parties do not perform as\ncontractually required, fail to satisfy regulatory or legal requirements or miss expected deadlines, our development program could be delayed with\npotentially material and adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe do not have the ability to independently conduct all aspects of our preclinical testing or clinical trials ourselves. We have accordingly relied in some\ncases and intend to rely in the future on third-party clinical investigators, clinical research organizations, or CROs, clinical data management organizations and\nconsultants to assist or provide the design, conduct, supervision and monitoring of preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates. Because we\nintend to rely on these third parties and will not have the ability to conduct all preclinical studies or clinical trials independently, we will have less control over the\ntiming, quality and other aspects of preclinical studies and clinical trials than we would have had we conducted them on our own. These investigators, CROs and\nconsultants will not be our employees and we will have limited control over the amount of time and resources that they dedicate to our programs. These third\nparties may have contractual relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors, which may draw time and resources from our programs.\nThe third parties with which we may contract might not be diligent, careful or timely in conducting our preclinical studies or clinical trials, resulting in the\npreclinical studies or clinical trials being delayed or unsuccessful.\nIf we cannot contract with acceptable third parties on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or if these third parties do not carry out their contractual\nduties, satisfy legal and regulatory requirements for the conduct of preclinical studies or clinical trials or meet expected deadlines, our clinical development\nprograms could be delayed and otherwise adversely affected. In all events, we will be responsible for ensuring that each of our preclinical studies and clinical\ntrials are conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial. The FDA requires preclinical studies to be conducted in\naccordance with good laboratory practices and clinical trials to be conducted in accordance with good clinical practices, including for designing, conducting,\nrecording and reporting the results of preclinical studies and clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights,\nintegrity and confidentiality of clinical trial participants are protected. Our reliance on third parties that we do not control will not relieve us of these\nresponsibilities and requirements. Any adverse development or delay in our preclinical studies or clinical trials as a result of our reliance on third parties could\nhave a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of our product candidates, or the loss of our third-party suppliers, or our or their failure to\ncomply with applicable regulatory requirements or to supply sufficient quantities at acceptable quality levels or prices, or at all, would materially and\nadversely affect our business.\nManufacturing is a vital component of our business strategy. To ensure timely and consistent product supply, we currently use a hybrid product supply\napproach wherein certain elements of our product candidates are manufactured internally at our manufacturing facilities in San Carlos, California, and other\nelements, including raw and intermediate materials, are manufactured at qualified third-party CMOs. Since our own manufacturing facilities may be limited or\nunable to manufacture certain of our preclinical and clinical trial product materials and supplies, we rely on third-party contract manufacturers to manufacture\nsuch clinical trial product materials and supplies for our or our collaborator’s needs. For example, we have entered into a manufacturing agreement with EMD\nMillipore Corporation to perform conjugation of the applicable linker-warhead with the antibody component of our luvelta product candidate. Further, we have\nentered into a manufacturing agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim Biopharmaceuticals GmbH for commercial scale manufacture of the antibody component of\nluvelta. We have also entered into agreements with Capua Bioservices, S.p.A. and with AGC Biologics GmbH for the manufacture of certain reagents used in\nthe manufacture of our products with our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms. There can be no assurance that our preclinical and clinical development\nproduct supplies will not be limited, interrupted, or of satisfactory quality or continue to be available at acceptable prices. Further, while efforts are\n52\nmade to diversify our sources of raw and intermediate materials, in certain instances we acquire raw and intermediate materials from a sole supplier. In\nparticular, any replacement of our manufacturer could require significant effort and expertise because there may be a limited number of qualified replacements.\nIn addition, replacement of a manufacturer may require a technology transfer to the new manufacturer, which involves technical risk that the transfer may not\nsucceed or may be delayed, and which can incur significant costs.\nThe manufacturing process for a product candidate is subject to FDA and foreign regulatory authority review. We, and our suppliers and manufacturers,\nmust meet applicable manufacturing requirements and undergo rigorous facility and process validation tests required by regulatory authorities in order to comply\nwith regulatory standards, such as cGMPs. If we or our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and\nthe strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, we may not be able to rely on our or their manufacturing facilities for\nthe manufacture of elements of our product candidates. Moreover, we do not control the manufacturing process at our contract manufacturers and are\ncompletely dependent on them for compliance with current regulatory requirements. In the event that any of our manufacturers fails to comply with such\nrequirements or to perform its obligations in relation to quality, timing or otherwise, or if our supply of components or other materials becomes limited or\ninterrupted for other reasons, we may be forced to manufacture the materials ourselves or enter into an agreement with another third party, which we may not\nbe able to do on reasonable terms, if at all. In some cases, the technical skills or technology required to manufacture our product candidates may be unique or\nproprietary to the original manufacturer and we may have difficulty applying such skills or technology ourselves, or in transferring such to another third party.\nThese factors would increase our reliance on such manufacturer or require us to obtain a license from such manufacturer in order to enable us, or to have\nanother third party, manufacture our product candidates. If we are required to change manufacturers for any reason, we will be required to verify that the new\nmanufacturer maintains facilities and procedures that comply with quality standards and with all applicable regulations and guidelines; and we may be required\nto repeat some of the development program. The delays associated with the verification of a new manufacturer could negatively affect our ability to develop\nproduct candidates in a timely manner or within budget.\nWe expect to continue to rely on third-party manufacturers if we receive regulatory approval for any product candidate. To the extent that we have existing,\nor enter into future, manufacturing arrangements with third parties, we will depend on these third parties to perform their obligations in a timely manner\nconsistent with contractual and regulatory requirements, including those related to quality control and assurance. If we are unable to obtain or maintain third-\nparty manufacturing for product candidates, or to do so on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to develop and commercialize our product\ncandidates successfully. Our or a third party’s failure to execute on our manufacturing requirements and comply with cGMPs could adversely affect our business\nin a number of ways, including:\n•an inability to initiate or continue clinical trials of product candidates under development;\n•delay in submitting regulatory applications, or receiving regulatory approvals, for product candidates;\n•loss of an existing or future collaborator;\n•losses resulting from an inability to utilize reserved manufacturing capacity because of delays or difficulties encountered in the supply chain;\n•subjecting third-party manufacturing facilities or our manufacturing facilities to additional inspections by regulatory authorities;\n•requirements to cease distribution or to recall batches of our product candidates; and\n•in the event of approval to market and commercialize a product candidate, an inability to meet commercial demands for our products.\nAdditionally, we and our contract manufacturers may experience manufacturing difficulties due to resource constraints or as a result of labor disputes,\nunstable political environments, or epidemics, pandemics, or contagious diseases or failures or delays in our manufacturing supply chain. For example,\nrestrictions on travel imposed by governments, including China, or restrictions on person-in-plant permissions imposed by our contract manufacturers may limit\nthe ability of our subject matter experts to visit our manufacturers and assist with technology transfers. Further, legislation has been introduced in Congress to\nlimit certain U.S. biotechnology companies from using equipment or services produced or provided by select Chinese biotechnology companies, and others in\nCongress have advocated for the use of existing\n53\nexecutive branch authorities to limit those Chinese service providers’ ability to engage in business in the U.S. We cannot predict what actions may ultimately be\ntaken with respect to trade relations between the United States and China or other countries, what products and services may be subject to such actions or what\nactions may be taken by the other countries in retaliation. If we or our contract manufacturers were to encounter interruptions from any of these events or other\nunforeseen events, our ability to provide our product candidates to patients in clinical trials, or to provide product for treatment of patients once approved, would\nbe jeopardized.\nWe, or third-party manufacturers, may be unable to successfully scale-up manufacturing of our product candidates or materials used to\nmanufacture components of our product candidates in sufficient quality and quantity, which would delay or prevent us from developing our product\ncandidates and commercializing approved products, if any.\nIn order to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates, we will need to manufacture them in large quantities. We, or any manufacturing partners, may\nbe unable to successfully increase the manufacturing capacity for any of our product candidates in a timely or cost-effective manner, or at all. In addition, quality\nissues may arise during scale-up activities. If we, or any manufacturing partners, are unable to successfully scale up the manufacture of our product candidates,\nor materials used in manufacturing components of our product candidates, in sufficient quality and quantity, the development, testing, and clinical trials of that\nproduct candidate may be delayed or infeasible, and regulatory approval or commercial launch of any resulting product may be delayed or not obtained, which\ncould significantly harm our business.\nScaling up a biologic manufacturing process is a difficult and uncertain task, and we may not be successful in transferring our production system or our\nthird-party manufacturers may not have the necessary capabilities to complete the implementation and development process. If we are unable to adequately\nvalidate or scale-up the manufacturing process at our own manufacturing facilities or those of our current manufacturers, we will need to transfer to another\nmanufacturer and complete the manufacturing validation process, which can be lengthy. If we are able to adequately validate and scale-up the manufacturing\nprocess for our product candidates at our manufacturing facility or with a contract manufacturer, we will still need to negotiate with such contract manufacturer\nan agreement for commercial supply and it is not certain we will be able to come to agreement on terms acceptable to us.\nThe manufacture of biologics is complex and we or our third-party manufacturers may encounter difficulties in production. If we or any of our\nthird-party manufacturers encounter such difficulties, our ability to provide supply of our product candidates for clinical trials, our ability to obtain\nmarketing approval, or our ability to provide supply of our products for patients, if approved, could be delayed or stopped.\nOur product candidates are considered to be biologics and the process of manufacturing biologics and materials used to manufacture components of our\nproducts can be complex, time-consuming, highly regulated and subject to multiple risks. We and our contract manufacturers must comply with cGMPs,\nregulations and guidelines for the manufacturing of biologics used in clinical trials and, if approved, marketed products. To date, we and our contract\nmanufacturers have limited experience in the manufacturing of cGMP batches of our product candidates and materials used to manufacture components of our\nproduct candidates.\nManufacturing biologics is highly susceptible to product loss due to contamination, equipment failure, improper installation or operation of equipment,\nvendor or operator error, inconsistency in yields, variability in product characteristics and difficulties in scaling the production process. Even minor deviations\nfrom normal manufacturing processes could result in reduced production yields, product defects and other supply disruptions. If microbial, viral or other\ncontaminations are discovered at our manufacturing facilities or those of our third-party manufacturers, such facilities may need to be closed for an extended\nperiod of time to investigate and remedy the contamination, which could delay clinical trials and adversely harm our business. Moreover, if the FDA determines\nthat our manufacturing facilities or those of our third-party manufacturers are not in compliance with FDA laws and regulations, including those governing\ncGMPs, the FDA may deny BLA approval until the deficiencies are corrected or we replace the manufacturer in our BLA with a manufacturer that is in\ncompliance.\nIn addition, there are risks associated with large scale manufacturing for clinical trials or commercial scale including, among others, cost overruns, potential\nproblems with process scale-up, process reproducibility, stability issues, compliance with cGMPs, lot consistency, timely availability of raw materials and other\ntechnical challenges. Even if we or our collaborators obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, there is no assurance that manufacturers will\nbe able to manufacture the approved product to specifications acceptable to the FDA or other regulatory authorities, to produce it in sufficient quantities to meet\nthe requirements for the potential launch of the product or to meet potential future demand. If our manufacturers are unable to produce sufficient quantities for\nclinical trials or for commercialization,\n54\ncommercialization efforts would be impaired, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe cannot assure you that any stability or other issues relating to the manufacture of any of our product candidates or products will not occur in the future.\nIf we or our third-party manufacturers were to encounter any of these difficulties, our ability to provide any product candidates to patients in planned clinical trials\nand products to patients, once approved, would be jeopardized. Any delay or interruption in the supply of clinical trial supplies could delay the completion of\nplanned clinical trials, increase the costs associated with maintaining clinical trial programs and, depending upon the period of delay, require us to commence\nnew clinical trials at additional expense or terminate clinical trials completely. Any adverse developments affecting clinical or commercial manufacturing of our\nproduct candidates or products, such as epidemics, pandemics or contagious diseases, may result in shipment delays, inventory shortages, lot failures, product\nwithdrawals or recalls, or other interruptions in the supply of our product candidates or products. We may also have to take inventory write-offs and incur other\ncharges and expenses for product candidates or products that fail to meet specifications, undertake costly remediation efforts or seek more costly manufacturing\nalternatives. Accordingly, failures or difficulties faced at any level of our supply chain could adversely affect our business and delay or impede the development\nand commercialization of any of our product candidates or products, if approved, and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results\nof operations and prospects.\nAs part of our process development efforts, we also may make changes to our manufacturing processes at various points during development, for various\nreasons, such as controlling costs, achieving scale, decreasing processing time, increasing manufacturing success rate or other reasons. Such changes carry\nthe risk that they will not achieve their intended objectives, and any of these changes could cause our product candidates to perform differently and affect the\nresults of our ongoing clinical trials or future clinical trials. In some circumstances, changes in the manufacturing process may require us to perform ex vivo\ncomparability studies and to collect additional data from patients prior to undertaking more advanced clinical trials. For instance, changes in our process during\nthe course of clinical development may require us to show the comparability of the product used in earlier clinical phases or at earlier portions of a trial to the\nproduct used in later clinical phases or later portions of the trial.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to use our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms to expand our pipeline of product candidates and\ndevelop marketable products.\nThe success of our business depends in large part upon our ability to identify, develop and commercialize products based on our XpressCF® and\nXpressCF+® platforms. Luvelta is our most advanced clinical stage program, and our preclinical and research programs may fail to identify other potential\nproduct candidates for clinical development for a number of reasons. Our research methodology may be unsuccessful in identifying potential product candidates\nor our potential product candidates may be shown to have harmful side effects or may have other characteristics that may make the products unmarketable or\nunlikely to receive marketing approval. If any of these events occur, we may be forced to abandon our development efforts for a program or for multiple\nprograms, which would materially harm our business and could potentially cause us to cease operations. Research programs to identify new product candidates\nrequire substantial technical, financial and human resources. We may focus our efforts and resources on potential programs or product candidates that\nultimately prove to be unsuccessful.\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate and fail to capitalize on product candidates that may be more\nprofitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus our research and development efforts on certain selected product candidates. As a\nresult, we may forgo or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation\ndecisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and\ndevelopment programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable product candidates. If we do not accurately\nevaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through\ncollaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and\ncommercialization rights to such product candidate. For example, in June 2023, we announced our Purchase Agreement with Blackstone and in April 2024 we\nannounced our License Agreement with Ipsen.\n55\nFailure to successfully validate, develop and obtain regulatory approval for companion diagnostics for our product candidates could harm our\ndrug development strategy and operational results.\nIf companion diagnostics are developed in conjunction with clinical programs, the FDA may require regulatory approval of a companion diagnostic as a\ncondition to approval of the product candidate. For example, as we are developing luvelta for treatment of patients having ovarian cancer with elevated FRα\nexpression levels, we are likely to be required to obtain FDA approval or clearance of a companion diagnostic, concurrent with approval of luvelta, to test for\nelevated FRα expression. We do not have experience or capabilities in developing or commercializing diagnostics and plan to rely in large part on third parties\nto perform these functions. We have entered into an agreement to develop diagnostic assays suitable for use as a companion diagnostic for luvelta. Companion\ndiagnostics are subject to regulation by the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities as medical devices and require separate regulatory approval or clearance\nprior to commercialization. We may also be required to demonstrate to the FDA the predictive utility of the companion diagnostic—namely, that the diagnostic\nselects for patients in whom the biologic therapy will be effective or more effective compared to patients not selected for by the diagnostic.\nIf we or our collaborators, or any third party, are unable to successfully develop companion diagnostics for our product candidates, or experience delays in\ndoing so:\n•the development of our product candidates may be adversely affected if we are unable to appropriately select patients for enrollment in our planned clinical\ntrials;\n•our product candidates may not receive marketing approval if their safe and effective use depends on a companion diagnostic; and\n•we may not realize the full commercial potential of any product candidates that receive marketing approval if, among other reasons, we are unable to\nappropriately identify patients with the specific genetic alterations targeted by our product candidates.\nIn addition, although we believe genetic testing is becoming more prevalent in the diagnosis and treatment of various diseases and conditions, our product\ncandidates may be perceived negatively compared to alternative treatments that do not require the use of companion diagnostics, either due to the additional\ncost of the companion diagnostic or the need to complete additional procedures to identify genetic markers prior to administering our product candidates. If any\nof these events were to occur, our business would be harmed, possibly materially.\nWe face competition from entities that have developed or may develop product candidates for cancer, including companies developing novel\ntreatments and technology platforms. If these companies develop technologies or product candidates more rapidly than we do or their technologies\nare more effective, our ability to develop and successfully commercialize product candidates may be adversely affected.\nThe development and commercialization of drugs and therapeutic biologics is highly competitive. Our product candidates, if approved, will face significant\ncompetition and our failure to effectively compete may prevent us from achieving significant market penetration. Most of our competitors have significantly\ngreater resources, including financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, sales, supply, human resources, or general experience than we do and we may not\nbe able to successfully compete. We compete with a variety of multinational biopharmaceutical companies, specialized biotechnology companies and emerging\nbiotechnology companies, as well as with technologies and product candidates being developed at universities and other research institutions. Our competitors\nhave developed, are developing or will develop product candidates and processes competitive with our product candidates and processes. Competitive\ntherapeutic treatments include those that have already been approved and accepted by the medical community and any new treatments, including those based\non novel technology platforms, that enter the market. We believe that a significant number of products are currently under development, and may become\ncommercially available in the future, for the treatment of conditions for which we are trying, or may try, to develop product candidates. There is intense and\nrapidly evolving competition in the biotechnology, biopharmaceutical and antibody and immunoregulatory therapeutics fields. While we believe that our\nXpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms, associated intellectual property and our scientific and technical know-how give us a competitive advantage in this space,\ncompetition from many sources exists or may arise in the future. Our competitors include larger and well-funded biopharmaceutical, biotechnological and\ntherapeutics companies, including large and specialty companies focused on cancer immunotherapies and ADCs, as well as numerous small and mid-cap\ncompanies. Moreover, we also compete with current and future therapeutics developed at research-stage biotechnology companies, universities and other\nresearch institutions.\n56\nWe are aware of several companies that are developing ADCs, cytokine derivatives, bispecific antibodies and cancer immunotherapies, including\ncompanies developing ADCs directed to the same target as luvelta. For example, Immunogen recently received approval for a folate receptor α targeted ADC,\nmirvetuximab soravtansine (Elahere®) and was subsequently acquired by Abbvie Inc. In addition, large pharmaceutical companies and smaller biotechnology\ncompanies are developing other ADCs; and we anticipate more FRα-targeting ADCs and other potential FRα-targeting modalities to be evaluated in the clinic in\nthe coming years. Further, other companies may develop ADCs targeting receptors other than folate receptor α for the treatment of the same indications for\nwhich we are developing luvelta. Many of these companies are well-capitalized and, in contrast to us, have significant clinical experience, and may include our\nexisting or future collaborators. In addition, these companies compete with us in recruiting scientific and managerial talent.\nOur success will depend partially on our ability to develop and protect therapeutics that are safer and more effective than competing products. Our\ncommercial opportunity and success will be reduced or eliminated if competing products are safer, more effective, or less expensive than the therapeutics we\ndevelop.\nIf our most advanced product candidates are approved, they will compete with a range of therapeutic treatments that are either in development or currently\nmarketed. Currently marketed oncology therapeutics include a range of biologic modalities with the top selling products by class spanning tumor targeting\nmonoclonal antibodies, to ADCs, to immune checkpoint inhibitors, to T cell-engager immunotherapies, and to CAR-T cell therapies. In addition, numerous\ncompounds are in clinical development for cancer treatment. The clinical development pipeline for cancer includes small molecules, antibodies, vaccines, cell\ntherapies and immunotherapies from a variety of companies and institutions.\nFurther, if we successfully obtain approval for any product candidate, we will face competition based on many different factors, including the safety and\neffectiveness of our products, the ease with which our products can be administered and the extent to which patients accept relatively new routes of\nadministration, the timing and scope of regulatory approvals for these products, the availability and cost of manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities,\nprice, reimbursement, coverage and patent position. Competing products could present superior treatment alternatives, including by being more effective, safer,\nless expensive, or marketed and sold more effectively than any products we may develop. Competitive products may make any products we develop obsolete or\nnoncompetitive before we recover the expense of developing and commercializing our product candidates.\nAny inability to attract and retain qualified key management and technical personnel would impair our ability to implement our business plan.\nWe are highly dependent on the research and development, clinical development, manufacturing, and business development expertise of our management\nteam, advisors and other specialized personnel. The loss of one or more members of our management team or other key employees or advisors could delay our\nresearch and development programs and have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. The\nrelationships that our key managers have cultivated within our industry make us particularly dependent upon their continued employment with us. We are\ndependent on the continued service of our technical personnel because of the highly technical nature of our product candidates and XpressCF® and\nXpressCF+® platform technologies and the specialized nature of the regulatory approval process. Because our management team and key employees are not\nobligated to provide us with continued service, they could terminate their employment with us at any time without penalty. Our future success will depend in\nlarge part on our continued ability to attract and retain other highly qualified scientific, technical and management personnel, as well as personnel with expertise\nin clinical testing, manufacturing, governmental regulation and commercialization. We face competition for personnel from other companies, universities, public\nand private research institutions, government entities and other organizations. Should our competitors recruit our key employees, our level of expertise and\nability to execute our business plan would be negatively impacted. Further, if we are unable to continue to attract and retain high-quality personnel, the rate and\nsuccess at which we can discover and develop product candidates will be limited, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe will need to grow our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing our growth and expanding our operations.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had 306 full-time employees. As our development and commercialization plans and strategies develop, we expect to\nexpand our employee base for managerial, operational, financial and other resources. In addition, we have limited experience in product development and\nbegan our first clinical trial in 2018. As our product candidates enter and advance through preclinical studies and clinical trials, we will need to expand our\ndevelopment, regulatory and manufacturing capabilities or contract with other organizations to provide these capabilities for us. In the\n57\nfuture, we expect to have to manage additional relationships with collaborators or partners, suppliers and other organizations. Our ability to manage our\noperations and future growth will require us to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures. We\nmay not be able to implement improvements to our management information and control systems in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies\nin existing systems and controls. Our inability to successfully manage our growth and expand our operations could have a material and adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIf any of our product candidates are approved for marketing and commercialization and we are unable to develop sales, marketing and\ndistribution capabilities on our own or enter into agreements with third parties to perform these functions on acceptable terms, we will be unable to\ncommercialize successfully any such future products.\nWe currently have limited sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or experience. If any of our product candidates are approved, we will need to\ndevelop additional sales, marketing and distribution capabilities to commercialize such products, which would be expensive and time consuming, or enter into\ncollaborations with third parties to perform these services. If we decide to market our products directly, we will need to commit significant financial and\nmanagerial resources to develop a marketing and sales force with technical expertise and support distribution, administration and compliance capabilities. If we\nrely on third parties with such capabilities to market our products or decide to co-promote products with collaborators, we will need to establish and maintain\nmarketing and distribution arrangements with third parties, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into such arrangements on acceptable\nterms or at all. In entering third-party marketing or distribution arrangements, any revenue we receive will depend upon the efforts of the third parties and there\ncan be no assurance that such third parties will establish adequate sales and distribution capabilities or be successful in gaining market acceptance or adoption\nof any approved product. If we are not successful in commercializing any product approved in the future, either on our own or through third parties, our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur future growth may depend, in part, on our ability to operate in foreign markets, where we would be subject to additional regulatory burdens\nand other risks and uncertainties.\nOur future growth may depend, in part, on our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates in foreign markets, for which we may rely on\ncollaboration with third parties. We are not permitted to market or promote any of our product candidates before we receive regulatory approval from the\napplicable regulatory authority in that foreign market and may never receive such regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. To obtain separate\nregulatory approval in many other countries, we must comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of such countries regarding safety and efficacy\nand governing, among other things, clinical trials and commercial sales, pricing and distribution of our product candidates, and we cannot predict success in\nthese jurisdictions. If we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements in international markets and do not receive applicable marketing approvals, our target\nmarket will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our product candidates will be harmed and our business will be adversely affected.\nWe may not obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all. Our failure to obtain approval of any of our product candidates by regulatory\nauthorities in another country may significantly diminish the commercial prospects of that product candidate and our business, financial condition, results of\noperations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. Moreover, even if we obtain approval of our product candidates and ultimately\ncommercialize our product candidates in foreign markets, we would be subject to the risks and uncertainties, including the burden of complying with complex\nand changing foreign regulatory, tax, accounting and legal requirements and reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some foreign countries.\nPrice controls imposed in either the U.S. or foreign markets may adversely affect our future profitability.\nRecently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has\nresulted in recent Executive Orders, several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things,\nbring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program\nreimbursement methodologies for drug products. Current and future presidential budget proposals and future legislation may contain further drug price control\nmeasures that could be enacted. Congress and current and future U.S. presidential administrations may continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative\nmeasures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control\npharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and\nmarketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage\n58\nimportation from other countries and bulk purchasing. If such pricing controls are enacted and are set at unsatisfactory levels, our business, financial condition,\nresults of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nAdditionally, in some countries, particularly member states of the EU, the pricing of prescription drugs is subject to governmental control. In these countries,\npricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after receipt of marketing approval for a product. In addition, there can be\nconsiderable pressure by governments and other stakeholders on prices and reimbursement levels, including as part of cost containment measures. Political,\neconomic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been\nobtained. Reference pricing used by various EU member states and parallel distribution, or arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can\nfurther reduce prices. In some countries, we or current or future collaborators may be required to conduct a clinical trial or other studies that compare the cost-\neffectiveness of our therapeutic candidates to other available therapies in order to obtain or maintain reimbursement or pricing approval. Publication of discounts\nby third-party payors or authorities may lead to further pressure on the prices or reimbursement levels within the country of publication and other countries. If\nreimbursement of any product candidate approved for marketing is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business entails a significant risk of product liability and our ability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage could have a material and\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nAs we are conducting clinical trials of our product candidates, we may be exposed to significant product liability risks inherent in the development, testing,\nmanufacturing and marketing of therapeutic treatments. Product liability claims could delay or prevent completion of our development programs. If we succeed\nin marketing products, such claims could result in an FDA investigation of the safety and effectiveness of our products, our manufacturing processes and\nfacilities or our marketing programs and potentially a recall of our products or more serious enforcement action, limitations on the approved indications for which\nthey may be used or suspension or withdrawal of approvals. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may also result in decreased demand\nfor our products, injury to our reputation, costs to defend the related litigation, a diversion of management’s time and our resources, substantial monetary awards\nto trial participants or patients and a decline in our stock price. While we currently have product liability insurance that we believe is appropriate for our stage of\ndevelopment, we may need to obtain higher levels prior to later stages of clinical development or marketing any of our product candidates. Any insurance we\nhave or may obtain may not provide sufficient coverage against potential liabilities. Furthermore, clinical trial and product liability insurance is becoming\nincreasingly expensive. As a result, we may be unable to obtain sufficient insurance at a reasonable cost to protect us against losses caused by product liability\nclaims that could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nAs with all companies, we are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to\ncomply with FDA regulations, provide accurate information to the FDA, comply with manufacturing standards we may establish, comply with federal and state\nhealthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, inappropriately share confidential and proprietary information externally, report financial information or data\naccurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive\nlaws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide\nrange of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Employee\nmisconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious\nharm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may\nnot be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming\nfrom a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves\nor asserting our rights, those actions could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, including\nthe imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, the curtailment or restructuring of our\noperations, loss of eligibility to obtain approvals from the FDA, exclusion from participation in government contracting, healthcare reimbursement or other\ngovernment programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, or reputational harm.\n59\nMoreover, our employees are increasingly utilizing social media tools and our website as a means of communication. Despite our efforts to monitor social\nmedia communications, there is risk that the unauthorized use of social media by our employees to communicate about our products or business, or any\ninadvertent disclosure of material, nonpublic information through these means, may result in violations of applicable laws and regulations, which may give rise to\nliability and result in harm to our business. In addition, there is also risk of inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information, which could result in significant legal\nand financial exposure and reputational damages that could potentially have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations\nand prospects. Our employees could also inappropriately utilize artificial intelligence, or AI, in connection with their social media communications, introducing\nanother potential source of reputational damage or other potential legal or financial exposure.\nWe depend on our information technology systems, and any failure of these systems, or those of our CROs, third-party vendors, or other\ncontractors or consultants we may utilize, could harm our business. Security breaches, cyber-attacks, loss of data, and other disruptions could\ncompromise sensitive information related to our business or other personal information or prevent us from accessing critical information and\nexpose us to liability, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe collect, use and store information in digital form that is necessary to conduct our business, and we are increasingly dependent on information\ntechnology systems and infrastructure to operate our business. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, use, store and transmit large amounts of\nconfidential information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information health information, and personal information. We have established\nphysical, electronic and organizational measures designed to safeguard and secure our systems to prevent a data security incident (which may include, for\nexample: data breaches, viruses or other malicious code, coordinated attacks, data loss, phishing attacks, ransomware, denial of service attacks, or other\nsecurity or information technology incidents caused by threat actors, technological vulnerabilities or human error), and rely on commercially available systems,\nsoftware, tools, and monitoring to provide security for our information technology systems and the processing, transmission and storage of digital information.\nWe have also outsourced elements of our information technology infrastructure, and as a result, a number of third-party vendors may or could have access to\nour confidential information subject to contractual protections. Our internal information technology systems and infrastructure, and those of our current and any\nfuture collaborators, CROs, third-party vendors, contractors and consultants and other third parties on which we rely, are vulnerable to damage from computer\nviruses, malware, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication and electrical failures, cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions over the internet, attachments to\nemails, persons inside our organization, or persons with access to systems inside our organization.\nThe risk of a formal security breach or disruption or data loss, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign\ngovernments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world\nhave increased. For example, targeted deep fakes supported by sophisticated AI tools and other forms of impersonation of our executives are becoming\nincreasingly prevalent. In addition, the prevalent use of mobile devices that access confidential information increases the risk of data security breaches, which\ncould lead to the loss of confidential information or other intellectual property. The costs to us or our CROs or other contractors or consultants we may utilize to\nmitigate a data security incident and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and while we have implemented security measures designed to protect our data\nsecurity and information technology systems, our efforts to address these problems may not be successful, and these problems could result in unexpected\ninterruptions, delays, cessation of service and other harm to our business and our competitive position. We have incurred successful phishing attempts in the\npast, although we believe that these attempts were detected and neutralized without any compromise to our data and prior to any significant impact to our\nbusiness. We have also implemented measures to prevent such attacks, but we may still be subject to similar attacks in the future. We are also aware of publicly\ndisclosed security breaches at certain third parties on which we rely. If such an event were to occur, whether to us or a third party on which we rely, and cause\ninterruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our product development programs. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from\ncompleted or ongoing or planned clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or\nreproduce the data. Further, if we are unable to generate or maintain access to essential patient samples or data for our research, development, and\nmanufacturing activities for our programs, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nMoreover, if a computer security breach affects our systems or results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information, our reputation\ncould be materially damaged. Such a breach may require formal notification to governmental agencies, the media or individuals pursuant to various federal and\nstate privacy and security laws, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information\n60\nTechnology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and its implementing rules and regulations, regulations promulgated by the Federal\nTrade Commission and state breach notification laws. We also may be subject to global privacy laws, such as Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation, or\nGDPR. We would also be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and potential liability under laws, regulations and contracts that protect the privacy and security of\npersonal information that may result in regulatory scrutiny, fines, private right of action settlements, and other consequences. Compliance with these and any\nother applicable privacy and data security laws and regulations is a rigorous and time-intensive process, and we may be required to put in place additional\nmechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules and possible government oversight. Our failure to comply with such laws or to adequately\nsecure the information we hold could result in significant liability or reputational harm and, in turn, a material adverse effect on our client base, member base\nand revenue.\nOur information technology systems could face serious disruptions that could adversely affect our business.\nOur information technology and other internal infrastructure systems, including corporate firewalls, servers, leased lines, and connection to the Internet,\nface the risk of systemic failure that could disrupt our operations. A significant disruption in the availability of our information technology and other internal\ninfrastructure systems could cause interruptions and delays in our research and development and manufacturing work.\nFurther, some of our employees work remotely from time to time, which presents certain risks to our business. For example, remote work presents\nsignificant demands on our information technology resources and systems and can be at risk for phishing and other malicious activity, which can result in an\nincrease to the number of points of potential exposure, such as laptops and mobile devices, that need to be secured. Any failure to effectively manage these\nrisks, including to timely identify and appropriately respond to any security incidents, may adversely affect our business.\nIn our ongoing efforts to innovate and optimize operational efficiency, we have integrated AI into various aspects of our workplace. For example, we are\nimplementing AI machine learning for email behavioral monitoring. While AI presents opportunities for enhanced productivity and innovation, it also introduces\ninherent risks, including legal and regulatory, that could adversely impact our business and reputation. Proper use of AI can lead to improved decision-making,\ncost reduction, and competitive advantage. However, improper use, including algorithmic biases, ethical considerations, data privacy issues, unknown or zero-\nday software vulnerabilities, and potential regulatory non-compliance, could result in reputational damage, legal liabilities, and financial losses. The rapidly\nevolving regulatory landscape surrounding AI also poses a risk, as new laws and regulations could impose additional compliance burdens, resulting in increased\noperational costs. We are committed to implementing robust governance and control mechanisms to mitigate these risks, but there can be no assurance that\nsuch measures will adequately prevent or mitigate the adverse effects that the integration and use of AI may have on our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nIf we do not comply with laws regulating the protection of the environment and health and human safety, our business could be affected\nadversely.\nOur research, development and manufacturing involve the use of hazardous chemicals and materials, including radioactive materials. We maintain\nquantities of various flammable and toxic chemicals in our facilities in South San Francisco and San Carlos, California that are required for our research,\ndevelopment and manufacturing activities. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk\nof contamination or injury from these materials. We and our third-party contractors are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use,\nmanufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous chemicals and materials. We believe our and our third-party contractors’ procedures for storing,\nhandling and disposing these materials in our South San Francisco and San Carlos facilities comply with the relevant guidelines of the two municipalities, the\ncounty of San Mateo, the state of California and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the U.S. Department of Labor. Although we believe that\nour safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards mandated by applicable regulations, including employee and\ncontractor training and procedures regarding safe handling and disposal, the risk of accidental or mistaken contamination or injury from these materials cannot\nbe eliminated. If an accident occurs, we could be held liable for resulting damages, which could be substantial and exceed any available insurance. We are also\nsubject to numerous environmental, health and workplace safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures, exposure to blood-\nborne pathogens and the handling of animals and biohazardous materials. Although we maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover us for costs and\nexpenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of these materials or from other hazards potentially present in our workplaces,\nsuch as high voltage electricity, process steam or other hot material, liquid nitrogen or other cold material, materials stored under pressure, laboratory\ninstruments that incorporate powerful lasers or magnets, sonic resonance, heavy machinery, and the like, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage\nagainst\n61\npotential liabilities. While we maintain pollution legal liability insurance for our manufacturing facility in San Carlos, California, we do not maintain insurance for\nenvironmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological or hazardous materials in our\nother locations. Additional federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting our operations may be adopted in the future and existing laws and regulations\ncould become more stringent. Further, we may incur substantial costs to comply with, and substantial fines or penalties if we violate, any of these laws or\nregulations.\nWe are subject to certain U.S. and foreign anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, export control, sanctions and other trade laws and\nregulations. We can face serious consequences for violations.\nU.S. and foreign anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, export control, sanctions and other trade laws and regulations prohibit, among other things,\ncompanies and their employees, agents, CROs, CMOs, legal counsel, accountants, consultants, contractors and other partners from authorizing, promising,\noffering, providing, soliciting, or making or receiving directly or indirectly, corrupt or improper payments or anything else of value to or from recipients in the\npublic or private sector. Violations of these laws can result in substantial criminal fines and civil penalties, imprisonment, the loss of trade privileges, debarment,\ntax reassessments, breach of contract and fraud litigation, reputational harm and other consequences. We have direct or indirect interactions with officials and\nemployees of government agencies or government-affiliated hospitals, universities and other organizations. We also expect our non-U.S. activities to increase\nover time. We expect to rely on third parties for research, preclinical studies and clinical trials and/or to obtain necessary permits, licenses, patent registrations\nand other marketing authorizations. We can be held liable for corrupt or other illegal activities of our personnel, agents, or partners, even if we do not explicitly\nauthorize or have prior knowledge of such activities.\nAny violations of the laws and regulations described above may result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties, imprisonment, the loss of export\nor import privileges, debarment, tax reassessments, breach of contract and fraud litigation, reputational harm and other consequences.\nOur current operations are in two cities in the San Francisco Bay Area, and we, or the third parties upon whom we depend, may be adversely\naffected by earthquakes, other natural disasters, pandemics or other catastrophic events and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans\nmay not adequately protect us from a serious disaster.\nOur current operations are located in our facilities in South San Francisco and San Carlos, California. Any unplanned event, such as earthquake, flood,\nfire, explosion, extreme weather condition, epidemic, pandemic or contagious disease, power shortage, telecommunication failure or other natural or man-made\naccidents or incidents that result in us being unable to fully utilize our facilities, or the manufacturing facilities of our third-party contract manufacturers, may have\na material and adverse effect on our ability to operate our business, particularly on a daily basis, and have significant negative consequences on our financial\nand operating conditions. Loss of access to these facilities may result in increased costs, delays in the development of our product candidates or interruption of\nour business operations. Earthquakes, epidemics, pandemics or contagious diseases, or other natural disasters could further disrupt our operations, and have a\nmaterial and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. If a natural disaster, power outage, epidemics, pandemics\nor contagious disease, or other events occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our headquarters, that damaged critical infrastructure,\nsuch as our research or manufacturing facilities or the manufacturing facilities of our third-party contract manufacturers, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it\nmay be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible, for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. The disaster recovery and business continuity\nplans we have in place may prove inadequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited\nnature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. As part of our risk management\npolicy, we maintain insurance coverage at levels that we believe are appropriate for our business. However, in the event of an accident or incident at these\nfacilities, we cannot assure you that the amounts of insurance will be sufficient to satisfy any damages and losses. In addition, the long-term effects of climate\nchange on general economic conditions and the pharmaceutical industry in particular are unclear, and may heighten or intensify existing risk of natural\ndisasters. If our facilities, or the manufacturing facilities of our third-party contract manufacturers, are unable to operate because of an accident or incident or for\nany other reason, even for a short period of time, any or all of our research and development programs may be harmed. Further, many of our employees\nconduct business outside of our leased or owned facilities and these locations may be subject to additional security risks outside of our control. Any business\ninterruption could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n62\nChanges in tax laws or regulations that are applied adversely to us or our customers may have a material adverse effect on our business, cash\nflows, financial condition or results of operations.\nNew income, sales, use or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time, which could adversely affect our\nbusiness and financial condition. Further, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be interpreted, changed, modified or applied\nadversely to us. For example, legislation enacted in 2017, informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"2017 Tax Act\"), enacted many significant changes to\nthe U.S. tax laws. Beginning in 2022, the 2017 Tax Act eliminates the option to currently deduct research and development expenditures and requires taxpayers\nto capitalize and amortize U.S. based and non-U.S. based research and development expenditures over five and fifteen years, respectively, pursuant to IRC\nSection 174. Although there have been legislative proposals to repeal or defer the capitalization requirement to later years, there can be no assurance that the\nprovision will be repealed or otherwise modified. We also cannot predict whether, when, in what form, or with what effective dates, tax laws, regulations and\nrulings may be enacted, promulgated or issued, which could result in an increase in our or our stockholders’ tax liability or require changes in the manner in\nwhich we operate in order to minimize or mitigate any adverse effects of changes in tax law. Changes in corporate tax rates, the realization of net deferred tax\nassets relating to our operations, or future reform legislation could have a material impact on the value of our deferred tax assets, could result in significant one-\ntime charges, and could increase our future U.S. tax expense.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset taxable income could be limited.\nUnder current law, our net operating loss carryforwards generated in tax years ending on or prior to December 31, 2017, are permitted to be carried\nforward for 20 years and our federal net operating losses generated in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, may be carried forward indefinitely, but the\ndeductibility of such federal net operating losses, is limited to 80% of taxable income (without regard to certain deductions).\nIn addition, under Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and corresponding provisions of state law, if we experience an\n“ownership change” which is generally defined as a greater than 50% change, by value, in our equity ownership over a three-year period, our ability to use our\npre-change net operating loss carryforwards to offset our post-change income may be limited. Based on Section 382 studies performed for certain prior periods,\nwe experienced an ownership change on November 20, 2019 and December 31, 2022, which imposed limitations on the use of our net operating losses arising\nbefore that date. In addition, we may have experienced other ownership changes in the past and may also experience ownership changes in the future as a\nresult of equity offerings or other shifts in our stock ownership, some of which are outside our control. As a result, our use of federal NOL carryforwards could be\nlimited.\nState net operating loss carryforwards may be similarly limited. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of net operating\nlosses is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed. Any such limitations may result in greater tax\nliabilities than we would incur in the absence of such limitations and any increased liabilities could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial\nposition and cash flows.\nOur cash and investments could be adversely affected if the financial institutions in which we hold our cash and investments fail.\nWe regularly maintain cash balances at third-party financial institutions in excess of the FDIC insurance limit and similar regulatory insurance limits outside\nthe United States, and governments may not guarantee all depositors if such financial institutions were to fail, in the event of bank closures and continued\ninstability in the global banking system. Any future adverse developments in the global banking system could directly or indirectly negatively impact our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Further, if we enter into a credit, loan or other similar facility with a financial institution, certain\ncovenants included in such facility may require as security that we keep a significant portion of our cash with the institution providing such facility. If a depository\ninstitution where we maintain deposits fails or is subject to adverse conditions in the financial or credit markets, we may not be able to recover all, if any, of our\ndeposits, which could adversely impact our operating liquidity and financial performance.\nOur financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board\n(the \"FASB\"), the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting\nprinciples. For example, in May 2014, the\n63\nFASB issued accounting standards update No. 2014-09 (Topic 606), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which supersedes nearly all existing revenue\nrecognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. We adopted this new accounting standard as of January 1, 2019. Any difficulties in implementing this guidance could\ncause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, which could result in regulatory discipline and harm investors’ confidence in us. Additionally, the\nimplementation of this guidance or a change in other principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our financial results, and could affect the\nreporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIf we are not able to obtain, maintain and enforce sufficient patent and other intellectual property protection for our technologies or product\ncandidates, development and commercialization of our product candidates may be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in part on our, our licensor’s and our collaborators’ ability to obtain and maintain patents and other forms of intellectual property\nrights, including in-licenses of intellectual property rights of others, for our product candidates, methods used to manufacture our product candidates and\nmethods for treating patients using our product candidates, as well as our ability to preserve our trade secrets, to prevent third parties from infringing upon our\nproprietary rights and to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. We, our licensors and collaborators may not be able to apply for patents\non certain aspects of our product candidates in a timely fashion or at all. Further, we, our licensors and collaborators may not be able to prosecute all necessary\nor desirable patent applications, or maintain, enforce and license any patents that may issue from such patent applications, at a reasonable cost or in a timely\nmanner. It is also possible that we, our licensors and collaborators will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too\nlate to obtain patent protection. It is also possible that we, our licensors, and our collaborators will fail to file patent applications covering inventions made in the\ncourse of development and commercialization activities before a competitor or another third party files a patent application covering, or publishes information\ndisclosing, a similar, independently-developed invention. Such competitor’s patent application may pose obstacles to our ability to obtain or limit the scope of\npatent protection we may obtain. We may not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of all patent applications that we license from third\nparties, or to maintain the rights to patents licensed to third parties. Therefore, these patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner\nconsistent with the best interests of our business. If our licensors or collaborators fail to establish, maintain or protect such patents and other intellectual property\nrights, such rights may be reduced or eliminated. If our licensors, licensees or collaborators are not fully cooperative or disagree with us as to the prosecution,\nmaintenance or enforcement of any patent rights, such patent rights could be compromised. Also, although we enter into non-disclosure and confidentiality\nagreements with parties who have access to confidential or patentable aspects of our research and development output, such as our employees, collaborators,\nCROs, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose such output before a\npatent application is filed, thereby jeopardizing our ability to seek patent protection. In addition, publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag\nbehind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in\nsome cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we, our licensors or collaborators were the first to make the inventions claimed in our patents or\npending patent applications, or were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions, or if such patents rights may otherwise become invalid. Composition\nof matter patents for biological and pharmaceutical therapeutic candidates often provide a strong form of intellectual property protection for those types of\nproducts, as such patents provide protection without regard to any method of use. We cannot be certain that the claims in our pending patent applications\ndirected to composition of matter of our therapeutic candidates will be considered patentable by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (the \"USPTO\")\nor by patent offices in foreign countries, or that the claims in any of our issued patents will be considered valid and enforceable by courts in the United States or\nforeign countries. Method of use patents protect the use of a product for the specified method. This type of patent does not prevent a competitor from making\nand marketing a product that is identical to our therapeutics for an indication that is outside the scope of the patented method. Moreover, even if competitors do\nnot actively promote their product for our targeted indications, clinicians may prescribe these products “off-label.” Although off-label prescriptions may infringe or\ncontribute to the infringement of method of use patents, the practice is common and such infringement is difficult to prevent or prosecute. Our existing issued\nand granted patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from using our technology or from developing competing\nproducts and technology. There is no guarantee that any of our pending patent applications will result in issued or granted patents, that any of our issued or\ngranted patents will not later be found to be invalid or unenforceable or that any issued or granted patents will include claims that are sufficiently broad to cover\nour product candidates or to provide meaningful protection from our competitors. Moreover, the patent position of biotechnology and biopharmaceutical\ncompanies can be highly uncertain because it involves complex legal and factual questions. We will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized\nuse by third parties only to the extent that our current and future proprietary\n64\ntechnology and product candidates are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. If third parties disclose or\nmisappropriate our proprietary rights, it may materially and adversely affect our position in the market.\nThe USPTO, and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other\nprovisions during the patent process. There are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application,\nresulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, competitors might be able to enter the market earlier than would\notherwise have been the case. The standards applied by the USPTO and foreign patent offices in granting patents are not always applied uniformly or\npredictably. For example, there is no uniform worldwide policy regarding patentable subject matter or the scope of claims allowable in biotechnology and\nbiopharmaceutical patents. As such, we do not know the degree of future protection that we will have on our proprietary products and technology. While we will\nendeavor to try to protect our product candidates with intellectual property rights such as patents, as appropriate, the process of obtaining patents is time\nconsuming, expensive and sometimes unpredictable.\nOnce granted, patents may remain open to opposition, interference, re-examination, post-grant review, inter partes review, nullification or derivation action\nin court or before patent offices or similar proceedings for a given period after allowance or grant, during which time third parties can raise objections against\nsuch initial grant. In the course of such proceedings, which may continue for a protracted period of time, the patent owner may be compelled to limit the scope\nof the allowed or granted claims thus attacked, or may lose the allowed or granted claims altogether. In addition, there can be no assurance that:\n•others will not or may not be able to make, use or sell compounds that are the same as or similar to our product candidates but that are not covered by the\nclaims of the patents that we own or license;\n•we or our licensors, or our existing or future collaborators are the first to make the inventions covered by each of our issued patents and pending patent\napplications that we own or license;\n•we or our licensors, or our existing or future collaborators are the first to file patent applications covering certain aspects of our inventions;\n•others will not independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property\nrights;\n•a third party may not challenge our patents and, if challenged, a court would hold that our patents are valid, enforceable and infringed;\n•any issued patents that we own or have licensed will provide us with any competitive advantages, or will not be challenged by third parties;\n•we may develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;\n•the patents of others will not have a material or adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects; and\n•our competitors may conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have enforceable patent rights and then use the information\nlearned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets.\nIf we or our licensors or collaborators fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering our product candidates, our competitors might be able to\nenter the market, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIn addition, our in-licensed patents may be subject to a reservation of rights by the licensor, its affiliates and one or more third parties. When new\ntechnologies are developed with government funding, the government generally obtains certain rights in any resulting patents, including a non-exclusive license\nauthorizing the government to use the invention for noncommercial purposes. These rights may permit the government to disclose our confidential information\nto third parties or allow third parties to use our licensed technology. The government can also exercise its march-in rights if it\n65\ndetermines that action is necessary because we fail to achieve practical application of the government-funded technology, because action is necessary to\nalleviate health or safety needs, to meet requirements of federal regulations, or to give preference to U.S. industry. In addition, our rights in such inventions may\nbe subject to certain requirements to manufacture products embodying such inventions in the United States. Any of the foregoing could harm our competitive\nposition, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patent protection for certain aspects of our product candidates, we also consider trade secrets, including confidential and unpatented\nknow-how important to the maintenance of our competitive position. We protect trade secrets and confidential and unpatented know-how, in part, by entering\ninto non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to such knowledge, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside\nscientific collaborators, CROs, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent\nassignment agreements with our employees and consultants that obligate them to maintain confidentiality and assign their inventions to us. Despite these\nefforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain\nadequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-\nconsuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions are less willing or unwilling to protect\ntrade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them from\nusing that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our\ncompetitive position would be harmed which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOther companies or organizations may challenge our or our licensors’ patent rights or may assert patent rights that prevent us from\ndeveloping and commercializing our products.\nTherapeutics in oncology or other disease areas developed in cell-free-based synthesis systems are a relatively new scientific field. We have obtained\ngrants and issuances of, and have obtained a license from a third party on an exclusive basis to, patents related to our proprietary XpressCF® and XpressCF+®\nplatforms. The issued patents and pending patent applications in the United States and in key markets around the world that we own or license claim many\ndifferent methods, compositions and processes relating to the discovery, development, manufacture and commercialization of antibody-based and other\ntherapeutics.\nAs the field of antibody-based therapeutics continues to mature, patent applications are being processed by national patent offices around the world. There\nis uncertainty about which patents will issue and, if they do, as to when, to whom, and with what claims. In addition, third parties may attempt to invalidate our\nintellectual property rights. Even if our rights are not directly challenged, disputes could lead to the weakening of our intellectual property rights. Our defense\nagainst any attempt by third parties to circumvent or invalidate our intellectual property rights could be costly to us, could require significant time and attention of\nour management and could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects or our ability to\nsuccessfully compete.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nObtaining a valid and enforceable issued or granted patent covering our technology in the United States and worldwide can be extremely costly, and our or\nour licensors’ or collaborators’ intellectual property rights may not exist in some countries outside the United States or may be less extensive in some countries\nthan in the United States. In jurisdictions where we or our licensors or collaborators have not obtained patent protection, competitors may seek to use our or\ntheir technology to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we or they have patent protection, but\nwhere it is more difficult to enforce a patent as compared to the United States. Competitor products may compete with our future products in jurisdictions where\nwe do not have issued or granted patents or where our or our licensors’ or collaborators’ issued or granted patent claims or other intellectual property rights are\nnot sufficient to prevent competitor activities in these jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, make it\ndifficult to enforce patents and such countries may not recognize other types of intellectual property protection, particularly relating to biopharmaceuticals. This\ncould make it difficult for us or our licensors or collaborators to prevent the infringement of our or their patents or marketing of competing products in violation of\nour or their proprietary rights generally in certain jurisdictions. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and\ndivert our and our licensors’ or collaborators’ efforts and\n66\nattention from other aspects of our business, could put our and our licensors’ or collaborators’ patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our\nand our licensors’ or collaborators’ patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us or our licensors or\ncollaborators. We or our licensors or collaborators may not prevail in any lawsuits that we or our licensors or collaborators initiate, and the damages or other\nremedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful.\nWe generally file a provisional patent application first (a priority filing) at the USPTO. An international application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (the\n\"PCT\") is usually filed within twelve months after the priority filing. Based on the PCT filing, national and regional patent applications may be filed in the United\nStates, EU, Japan, Australia and Canada and, depending on the individual case, also in any or all of, inter alia, Brazil, China, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Mexico,\nNew Zealand, South Africa, South Korea and other jurisdictions. We have so far not filed for patent protection in all national and regional jurisdictions where\nsuch protection may be available. In addition, we may decide to abandon national and regional patent applications before grant. Finally, the grant proceeding of\neach national or regional patent is an independent proceeding which may lead to situations in which applications might in some jurisdictions be refused by the\nrelevant registration authorities, while granted by others. It is also quite common that depending on the country, various scopes of patent protection may be\ngranted on the same product candidate or technology.\nGeopolitical actions in the United States and in foreign countries could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution or maintenance of\npatent applications and the maintenance, enforcement or defense of issued patents. For example, the United States and foreign government actions related to\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine may limit or prevent filing, prosecution and maintenance of patent applications in Russia. Government actions may also prevent\nmaintenance of issued patents in Russia. These actions could result in abandonment or lapse of patents or patent applications, resulting in partial or complete\nloss of patent rights in Russia. If such an event were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, a decree was adopted by the\nRussian government in March 2022, allowing Russian companies and individuals to exploit inventions owned by patentees that have citizenship or nationality in,\nare registered in, or have predominately primary place of business or profit-making activities in the United States and other countries that Russia has deemed\nunfriendly without consent or compensation. Consequently, we would not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in Russia or from selling\nor importing products made using our inventions in and into Russia. Accordingly, our competitive position may be impaired, and our business, financial condition,\nresults of operations and prospects may be adversely affected.\nThe laws of some jurisdictions do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws in the United States, and many companies have\nencountered significant difficulties in protecting and defending such rights in such jurisdictions. If we or our licensors or collaborators encounter difficulties in\nprotecting, or are otherwise precluded from effectively protecting, the intellectual property rights important for our business in such jurisdictions, the value of\nthese rights may be diminished and we may face additional competition from others in those jurisdictions. Many countries have compulsory licensing laws under\nwhich a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against government\nagencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of such patent.\nIf we or any of our licensors or collaborators are forced to grant a license to third parties with respect to any patents relevant to our business, our competitive\nposition in the relevant jurisdiction may be impaired and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected.\nEuropean patent applications now have the option, upon grant of a patent, of becoming a Unitary Patent which will be subject to the jurisdiction of the\nUnitary Patent Court (the \"UPC\"). This will be a significant change in European patent practice. As the UPC is a new court system, there is very limited\nprecedent for the court, increasing the uncertainty of any litigation. Limited information is available to make judgments about advantages and disadvantages of\neither opting into or remaining out of UPC jurisdiction; either choice may ultimately prove to have significant implications as to cost, enforceability and scope of\nprotection, among other factors, for applicable European patents.\nWe, our licensors or collaborators, or any future strategic partners may need to resort to litigation to protect or enforce our patents or other\nproprietary rights, all of which could be costly, time consuming, delay or prevent the development and commercialization of our product candidates,\nor put our patents and other proprietary rights at risk.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or other intellectual property. If we were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering\none of our products or our technology, the defendant could counterclaim that our patent is invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States,\ndefendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of\nseveral\n67\nstatutory requirements, for example, lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that an\nindividual connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. The\noutcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability during patent litigation is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example,\nwe cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail\non a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on one or more of our products or\ncertain aspects of our platform technology. Such a loss of patent protection could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results\nof operations and prospects. Interference or derivation proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by us or declared by the USPTO may be necessary to\ndetermine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related\ntechnology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on\ncommercially reasonable terms or at all, or if a non-exclusive license is offered and our competitors gain access to the same technology. Furthermore, because\nof the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be\ncompromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions, or other interim\nproceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our\ncommon stock. Patents and other intellectual property rights also will not protect our technology if competitors design around our protected technology without\nlegally infringing our patents or other intellectual property rights.\nWe may not identify relevant third-party patents or may incorrectly interpret the relevance, scope or expiration of a third-party patent, which\nmight adversely affect our ability to develop and market our therapeutics.\nAs the biopharmaceutical industry expands and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our product candidates may be subject to claims of\ninfringement of the patent rights of third parties. There can be no assurance that our operations do not, or will not in the future, infringe existing or future third-\nparty patents. Identification of third-party patent rights that may be relevant to our operations is difficult because patent searching is imperfect due to differences\nin terminology among patents, incomplete databases and the difficulty in assessing the meaning of patent claims. We cannot guarantee that any of our patent\nsearches or analyses, including the identification of relevant patents, the scope of patent claims or the expiration of relevant patents, are complete or thorough,\nnor can we be certain that we have identified each and every third-party patent and pending application in the United States and abroad that is relevant to or\nnecessary for the commercialization of our therapeutic candidates in any jurisdiction.\nNumerous U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications exist in our market that are owned by third parties. Our competitors in both the United\nStates and abroad, many of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in patent portfolios and competing\ntechnologies, may have applied for or obtained or may in the future apply for and obtain, patents that will prevent, limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to\nmake, use and sell our therapeutics. We do not always conduct independent reviews of pending patent applications of and patents issued to third parties. Patent\napplications in the United States and elsewhere are typically published approximately 18 months after the earliest filing for which priority is claimed, with such\nearliest filing date being commonly referred to as the priority date. Certain U.S. applications that will not be filed outside the U.S. can remain confidential until\npatents issue. In addition, patent applications in the United States and elsewhere can be pending for many years before issuance, or unintentionally abandoned\npatents or applications can be revived. Furthermore, pending patent applications that have been published can, subject to certain limitations, be later amended\nin a manner that could cover our technologies, our therapeutics or the use of our therapeutics. As such, there may be applications of others now pending or\nrecently revived patents of which we are unaware. These patent applications may later result in issued patents, or the revival of previously abandoned patents,\nthat will prevent, limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make, use or sell our therapeutics.\nThe scope of a patent claim is determined by an interpretation of the law, the written disclosure in a patent and the patent’s prosecution history. Our\ninterpretation of the relevance or the scope of a patent or a pending application may be incorrect. For example, we may incorrectly determine that our\ntherapeutics are not covered by a third-party patent or may incorrectly predict whether a third-party’s pending application will issue with claims of relevant\nscope. Our determination of the expiration date of any patent in the United States or abroad that we consider relevant may be incorrect. Our failure to identify\nand correctly interpret relevant patents may negatively impact our ability to develop and market our product candidates.\nWe cannot provide any assurances that third-party patents do not exist which might be enforced against our current technology, including our research\nprograms, product candidates, their respective methods of use, manufacture and formulations thereof, and could result in either an injunction prohibiting our\nmanufacture or future sales, or, with respect to\n68\nour future sales, an obligation on our part to pay royalties and/or other forms of compensation to third parties, which could be significant.\nIntellectual property rights of third parties could adversely affect our ability to commercialize our product candidates, and we, our licensors or\ncollaborators, or any future strategic partners may become subject to third party claims or litigation alleging infringement of patents or other\nproprietary rights or seeking to invalidate patents or other proprietary rights. We might be required to litigate or obtain licenses from third parties in\norder to develop or market our product candidates. Such litigation or licenses could be costly or not available on commercially reasonable terms.\nWe, our licensors or collaborators, or any future strategic partners may be subject to third-party claims for infringement or misappropriation of patent or\nother proprietary rights. There is a substantial amount of litigation, both within and outside the United States, involving patent and other intellectual property\nrights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences, oppositions and inter partes review proceedings\nbefore the USPTO, and corresponding foreign patent offices. For example, one of our European patents related to technology auxiliary to our XpressCF®\nplatform is involved in an opposition proceeding at the European Patent Office, or EPO, and was revoked by the EPO in 2021. In April 2022, an appeal was\nfiled; the process for this appeal is ongoing. This may prevent us from asserting this patent against our competitors practicing otherwise infringing methods in\nrelevant European countries where this patent has been granted. There are many issued and pending patents that might claim aspects of our product\ncandidates and modifications that we may need to apply to our product candidates. There are also many issued patents that claim antibodies, portions of\nantibodies, cytokines, half-life extending polymers, linkers, cytotoxins, or other warheads that may be relevant for the products we wish to develop. Thus, it is\npossible that one or more organizations will hold patent rights to which we will need a license. If those organizations refuse to grant us a license to such patent\nrights on reasonable terms, we may be delayed or may not be able to market products or perform research and development or other activities covered by these\npatents which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We are obligated under certain\nof our license and collaboration agreements to indemnify and hold harmless our licensors or collaborators for damages arising from intellectual property\ninfringement by use. For example, we are obligated under the Stanford Agreement to indemnify and hold harmless Stanford for damages arising from\nintellectual property infringement by us resulting from exercise of the license from Stanford. If we, our licensors or collaborators, or any future strategic partners\nare found to infringe a third-party patent or other intellectual property rights, we could be required to pay damages, potentially including treble damages, if we\nare found to have infringed willfully. In addition, we, our licensors or collaborators, or any future strategic partners may choose to seek, or be required to seek, a\nlicense from a third party, which may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Even if a license can be obtained on acceptable terms, the rights may be\nnon-exclusive, which could give our competitors access to the same technology or intellectual property rights licensed to us. If we fail to obtain a required\nlicense, we or our existing or future collaborators may be unable to effectively market product candidates based on our technology, which could limit our ability\nto generate revenue or achieve profitability and possibly prevent us from generating revenue sufficient to sustain our operations. In addition, we may find it\nnecessary to pursue claims or initiate lawsuits to protect or enforce our patent or other intellectual property rights. The cost to us in defending or initiating any\nlitigation or other proceeding relating to patent or other proprietary rights, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial, and litigation could divert our\nmanagement’s attention. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have\nsubstantially greater resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could delay our research and\ndevelopment efforts and limit our ability to continue our operations.\nBecause the antibody-based therapeutics landscape is still evolving, it is difficult to conclusively assess our freedom to operate without infringing on third-\nparty rights. There are numerous companies that have pending patent applications and issued patents broadly covering antibodies generally, covering\nantibodies directed against the same targets as, or targets similar to, those we are pursuing, or covering linkers and cytotoxic warheads similar to those that we\nare using in our product candidates. For example, we are aware of an issued patent, expected to expire in 2031, that relates to strained alkyne reagents that can\nbe used as synthetic precursors for certain of our linker-warheads. We are further aware of an issued patent, expected to expire in 2034, relating to certain\nconjugates comprising a genus of hemiasterlin derivatives that may be potentially relevant to products incorporating our hemiasterlin-derived linker-warhead. If\nany of these patents are valid and not yet expired when, and if, we receive marketing approval for luvelta, as applicable, we may need to seek a license to one or\nmore of these patents, each of which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to receive a license to any of these patents, or\nother potentially relevant patents currently unknown to us, could delay commercialization of any or all of luvelta, STRO-004 or any other product candidate. Our\ncompetitive position may suffer if patents issued to third parties or other third-party intellectual property rights cover our products or product candidates or\nelements thereof, or our manufacture or uses relevant to our development plans. In such cases, we\n69\nmay not be in a position to develop or commercialize products or product candidates until such patents expire or unless we successfully pursue litigation to\nnullify or invalidate the third-party intellectual property right concerned, or enter into a license agreement with the intellectual property right holder, if available on\ncommercially reasonable terms. There may be issued patents of which we are not aware, held by third parties that, if found to be valid and enforceable, could\nbe alleged to be infringed by our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms and related technologies and product candidates. There also may be pending patent\napplications of which we are not aware that may result in issued patents, which could be alleged to be infringed by our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms\nand related technologies and product candidates. If such an infringement claim should be brought and be successful, we may be required to pay substantial\ndamages, including potentially treble damages and attorneys’ fees for willful infringement, and we may be forced to abandon our product candidates or seek a\nlicense from any patent holders. No assurances can be given that a license will be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nIt is also possible that we have failed to identify relevant third-party patents or applications. Patent applications in the United States and elsewhere are\npublished approximately 18 months after the earliest filing for which priority is claimed, with such earliest filing date being commonly referred to as the priority\ndate. Therefore, patent applications covering our products or platform technologies could have been filed by others without our knowledge. Additionally, pending\npatent applications that have been published can, subject to certain limitations, be later amended in a manner that could cover our platform technologies, our\nproducts or the use of our products. Third-party intellectual property right holders may also actively bring infringement claims against us. We cannot guarantee\nthat we will be able to successfully settle or otherwise resolve such infringement claims. If we are unable to successfully settle future claims on terms acceptable\nto us, we may be required to engage in or continue costly, unpredictable and time-consuming litigation and may be prevented from or experience substantial\ndelays in marketing our products. Parties making claims against us may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can\nbecause they have substantially greater resources. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual\nproperty litigation or administrative proceedings, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure. In addition, any\nuncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have material adverse effect on our ability to raise additional funds or otherwise\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. If we fail in any such dispute, in addition to being forced\nto pay damages, we may be temporarily or permanently prohibited from commercializing any of our product candidates that are held to be infringing. We might,\nif possible, also be forced to redesign product candidates so that we no longer infringe the third-party intellectual property rights. Any of these events, even if we\nwere ultimately to prevail, could require us to divert substantial financial and management resources that we would otherwise be able to devote to our business\nand could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIntellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nLitigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims, with or without merit, is unpredictable and generally expensive and time\nconsuming and is likely to divert significant resources from our core business, including distracting our technical and management personnel from their normal\nresponsibilities. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some\nof our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results\nof hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a\nsubstantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Moreover, such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and\nreduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities.\nWe may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to\nsustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources and more mature and developed\nintellectual property portfolios. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating or from\nsuccessfully challenging our intellectual property rights. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could\nhave a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace.\n70\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations under any license, collaboration or other agreements, we may be required to pay damages and could\nlose intellectual property rights that are necessary for developing and protecting our product candidates or we could lose certain rights to grant\nsublicenses.\nOur current licenses impose, and any future licenses we enter into are likely to impose, various development, commercialization, funding, milestone,\nroyalty, diligence, sublicensing, insurance, patent prosecution and enforcement and/or other obligations on us. If we breach any of these obligations, or use the\nintellectual property licensed to us in an unauthorized manner, we may be required to pay damages and the licensor may have the right to terminate the license,\nwhich could result in us being unable to develop, manufacture and sell any future products that are covered by the licensed technology or enable a competitor to\ngain access to the licensed technology. Moreover, our licensors may own or control intellectual property that has not been licensed to us and, as a result, we\nmay be subject to claims, regardless of their merit, that we are infringing or otherwise violating the licensor’s rights. In addition, while we cannot determine\ncurrently the amount of the royalty obligations we would be required to pay on sales of future products, if any, the amounts may be significant. The amount of\nour future royalty obligations will depend on the technology and intellectual property we use in products that we successfully develop and commercialize, if any.\nTherefore, even if we successfully develop and commercialize products, we may be unable to achieve or maintain profitability.\nMoreover, disputes may arise regarding intellectual property subject to a licensing agreement, including:\n•the scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues;\n•the extent to which our product candidates, technologies and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the licensing\nagreement;\n•the sublicensing of patent and other rights under our collaborative development relationships;\n•our diligence obligations under the license agreement and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations;\n•the inventorship and ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors and us and our\npartners; and\n•the priority of invention of patented technology.\nIn addition, the agreements under which we currently license intellectual property or technology from third parties are complex, and certain provisions in\nsuch agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations. The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what we\nbelieve to be the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology, or increase what we believe to be our financial or other obligations under\nthe relevant agreement, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nMoreover, if disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on\ncommercially acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates, which could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations, and prospects.\nWe may be subject to claims that we or our employees or consultants have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of our\nemployees’ or consultants’ former employers or their clients. These claims may be costly to defend and if we do not successfully do so, we may be\nrequired to pay monetary damages and may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel.\nMany of our employees were previously employed at universities or biotechnology or biopharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential\ncompetitors. Although no claims against us are currently pending, we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have inadvertently or otherwise used\nor disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in\ndefending such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. A loss of key research personnel\nor their work product could hamper our ability to commercialize, or prevent us from commercializing, our product candidates, which could severely harm our\nbusiness. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\n71\nPatent terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our product candidates for an adequate amount of time.\nPatents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, if all maintenance fees are timely paid, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years from its\nearliest U.S. non-provisional filing date. Various extensions may be available, but the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Even if patents\ncovering our product candidates are obtained, once the patent life has expired, we may be open to competition from competitive products, including generics or\nbiosimilars. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates\nmight expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient\nrights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\nDepending upon the timing, duration and conditions of any FDA marketing approval of our product candidates, one or more of our U.S. patents may be\neligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman\nAmendments, and similar legislation in the European Union. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent term extension of up to five years for a patent\ncovering an approved product as compensation for effective patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, we\nmay not receive an extension if we fail to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process, fail to apply within applicable deadlines,\nfail to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise fail to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the length of the extension could be less than\nwe request. Only one patent per approved product can be extended, the extension cannot extend the total patent term beyond 14 years from approval and only\nthose claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. If we are unable to obtain patent term\nextension or the term of any such extension is less than we request, the period during which we can enforce our patent rights for the applicable product\ncandidate will be shortened and our competitors may obtain approval to market competing products sooner. As a result, our revenue from applicable products\ncould be reduced. Further, if this occurs, our competitors may take advantage of our investment in development and trials by referencing our clinical and\npreclinical data and launch their product earlier than might otherwise be the case, and our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of\noperations and prospects could be materially harmed.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and\nother requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with\nthese requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and/or applications will be due to be paid to the\nUSPTO and various governmental patent agencies outside of the United States in several stages over the lifetime of the patents and/or applications. We have\nsystems in place to remind us to pay these fees, and we employ an outside firm and/or rely on our outside counsel to pay these fees due to non-U.S. patent\nagencies. The USPTO and various non-U.S. governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and\nother similar provisions during the patent application process. We employ reputable law firms and other professionals to help us comply, and in many cases, an\ninadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. However, there are situations in which non-\ncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant\njurisdiction. In such an event, our competitors might be able to enter the market and this circumstance would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nChanges in U.S. patent and ex-U.S. patent laws could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our\nproducts.\nChanges in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States or in other ex-U.S. jurisdictions could increase the uncertainties\nand costs surrounding the prosecution of patent applications and the enforcement or defense of issued patents. In the United States, numerous recent changes\nto the patent laws and proposed changes to the rules of the USPTO that may have a significant impact on our ability to protect our technology and enforce our\nintellectual property rights. For example, the America Invents Act, enacted within the last several years involves significant changes in patent legislation. The\nU.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, some of which cases either narrow the scope of patent protection available in certain\ncircumstances or weaken the rights of patent owners in certain situations. For example, the decision by the U.S. Supreme Court in Association for Molecular\nPathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc. precludes a claim to a nucleic acid having a stated nucleotide sequence that is identical to a sequence found in nature and\nunmodified. We currently are not aware of an immediate impact of this\n72\ndecision on our patents or patent applications because we are developing product candidates that contain modifications that we believe are not found in nature.\nHowever, this decision has yet to be clearly interpreted by courts and by the USPTO. We cannot assure you that the interpretations of this decision or\nsubsequent rulings will not adversely impact our patents or patent applications. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in\nthe future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by the U.S.\nCongress, the federal courts and the USPTO, and similar legislative and regulatory bodies in other countries in which we may pursue patent protection, the laws\nand regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and\npatents that we might obtain in the future. We may become subject to claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our patents and other intellectual\nproperty.\nWe may be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an interest in our patents or other intellectual property as an\ninventor or co-inventor. The failure to name the proper inventors on a patent application can result in the patents issuing thereon being unenforceable.\nInventorship disputes may arise from conflicting views regarding the contributions of different individuals named as inventors, the effects of foreign laws where\nforeign nationals are involved in the development of the subject matter of the patent, conflicting obligations of third parties involved in developing our product\ncandidates or as a result of questions regarding co-ownership of potential joint inventions. Litigation may be necessary to resolve these and other claims\nchallenging inventorship or ownership. Alternatively, or additionally, we may enter into agreements to clarify the scope of our rights in such intellectual property.\nIf we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership\nof, or right to use, valuable intellectual property. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we are successful in defending\nagainst such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.\nOur current or future licensors may have relied on third-party consultants or collaborators or on funds from third parties, such as the U.S. government, such\nthat our licensors are not the sole and exclusive owners of the patents we in-licensed. If other third parties have ownership rights or other rights to our in-\nlicensed patents, they may be able to license such patents to our competitors, and our competitors could market competing products and technology. This could\nhave a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial conditions, results of operations, and prospects.\nIn addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the conception or development of intellectual property to\nexecute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who, in fact, conceives\nor develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. The assignment of intellectual property rights may not be self-executing, or the assignment\nagreements may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims that they may bring against us, to determine the\nownership of what we regard as our intellectual property. Such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of\noperations, and prospects.\nIf our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest\nand our business may be adversely affected.\nOur trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented or declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks. We may not\nbe able to protect our rights to these trademarks and trade names or may be forced to stop using these names, which we need for name recognition by potential\npartners or customers in our markets of interest. If we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, we may not be able\nto compete effectively, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nWe and/or our collaborators may be unable to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, U.S. or foreign regulatory approval and, as a result,\nunable to commercialize our product candidates.\nOur product candidates are subject to extensive governmental regulations relating to, among other things, research, testing, development, manufacturing,\nsafety, efficacy, approval, recordkeeping, reporting, labeling, storage, packaging, advertising and promotion, pricing, marketing and distribution of drugs and\ntherapeutic biologics. Rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory approval process are required to be completed successfully in\nthe United States and in many foreign jurisdictions before a new drug or therapeutic biologic can be marketed. Satisfaction of these and other regulatory\nrequirements is costly, time consuming, uncertain and subject to unanticipated delays. It is\n73\npossible that none of the product candidates we may develop, either alone or with our collaborators, will obtain the regulatory approvals necessary for us or our\nexisting or future collaborators to begin selling them.\nAlthough some of our employees have experience in conducting and managing clinical trials from prior employment at other companies, we, as a\ncompany, have no prior experience in conducting and managing the clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approvals, including approval by the FDA. The\ntime required to obtain FDA and other approvals is unpredictable but typically takes many years following the commencement of the initial clinical trials,\ndepending upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate and the availability of applicable government resources. The standards that the FDA\nand its foreign counterparts use when regulating us require judgment and can change, which makes it difficult to predict with certainty their application. Any\nanalysis we perform of data from preclinical and clinical activities is subject to confirmation and interpretation by regulatory authorities, which could delay, limit or\nprevent regulatory approval. We or our collaborators may also encounter unexpected delays or increased costs due to new government regulations, for\nexample, from future legislation or administrative action, or from changes in FDA policy during the period of product development, clinical trials and FDA\nregulatory review. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, or whether FDA or foreign regulations, guidance or interpretations will\nbe changed, or the impact of such changes, if any. For example, the Oncology Center of Excellence within the FDA has advanced Project Optimus, which is an\ninitiative to reform the dose optimization and dose selection paradigm in oncology drug development to emphasize selection of an optimal dose, which is a dose\nor doses that maximizes not only the efficacy of a drug but the safety and tolerability as well. This shift from the prior approach, which generally determined the\nmaximum tolerated dose, may require sponsors to spend additional time and resources to further explore a product candidate’s dose-response relationship to\nfacilitate optimum dose selection in a target population. Other Oncology Center of Excellence initiatives have included Project FrontRunner, an initiative with a\ngoal of developing a framework for identifying candidate drugs for initial clinical development in the earlier advanced setting rather than for treatment of patients\nwho have received numerous prior lines of therapies or have exhausted available treatment options. We are considering these policy changes as they relate to\nour programs. We may also be affected by ex-US regulatory requirements, given that our trials may be conducted globally; current and unforeseen new EU-\nspecific clinical trial conduct regulations, such as IVDR and GDPR, may delay, or increase the difficulty and expense of conducting, our clinical studies.\nGiven that the product candidates we are developing, either alone or with our collaborators, represent a new approach to the manufacturing and type of\ntherapeutic biologics, the FDA and its foreign counterparts have not yet established any definitive policies, practices or guidelines in relation to these product\ncandidates. Moreover, the FDA may respond to any BLA that we may submit by defining requirements that we do not anticipate. Such responses could delay\nclinical development of our product candidates. In addition, because there may be approved treatments for some of the diseases for which we may seek\napproval, in order to receive regulatory approval, we may need to demonstrate through clinical trials that the product candidates we develop to treat these\ndiseases, if any, are not only safe and effective, but safer or more effective than existing products. Furthermore, in recent years, there has been increased\npublic and political pressure on the FDA with respect to the approval process for new drugs and therapeutic biologics, and FDA standards, especially regarding\nproduct safety, appear to have become more stringent.\nAny delay or failure in obtaining required approvals could have a material and adverse effect on our ability to generate revenues from the particular product\ncandidate for which we are seeking approval. Furthermore, any regulatory approval to market a product may be subject to limitations on the approved uses for\nwhich we may market the product or on the labeling or other restrictions. In addition, the FDA has the authority to require a risk evaluation and mitigation\nstrategy, or REMS, as part of a BLA or after approval, which may impose further requirements or restrictions on the distribution or use of an approved biologic,\nsuch as limiting prescribing to certain physicians or medical centers that have undergone specialized training, limiting treatment to patients who meet certain\nsafe-use criteria and requiring treated patients to enroll in a registry. These limitations and restrictions may limit the size of the market for the product and affect\nreimbursement by third-party payors.\nWe are also subject to numerous foreign regulatory requirements governing, among other things, the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing and marketing\nauthorization, pricing and third-party reimbursement. The foreign regulatory approval process varies among countries and may include all of the risks associated\nwith FDA approval process described above, as well as risks attributable to the satisfaction of local regulations in foreign jurisdictions. Moreover, the time\nrequired to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. FDA approval does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities outside the\nUnited States and vice versa. Any delay or failure to obtain U.S. or foreign regulatory approval for a product candidate could have a material and adverse effect\non our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n74\nDelays in obtaining regulatory approval of our manufacturing process may delay or disrupt our commercialization efforts. To date, no product\nusing a cell-free manufacturing process in the United States has received approval from the FDA.\nBefore we can begin to commercially manufacture our product candidates in third-party or our own facilities, we must obtain regulatory approval from the\nFDA for a BLA that describes in detail the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls for the product. A manufacturing authorization must also be obtained from the\nappropriate EU regulatory authorities. The timeframe required to obtain such approval or authorization is uncertain. In addition, we must pass a pre-approval\ninspection of our manufacturing facility by the FDA before any of our product candidates can obtain marketing approval, if ever. In order to obtain approval, we\nwill need to ensure that all of our processes, methods and equipment are compliant with cGMP, and perform extensive audits of vendors, contract laboratories\nand suppliers. If any of our vendors, contract laboratories or suppliers is found to be out of compliance with cGMP, we may experience delays or disruptions in\nmanufacturing while we work with these third parties to remedy the violation or while we work to identify suitable replacement vendors. The cGMP requirements\ngovern quality control of the manufacturing process and documentation policies and procedures. In complying with cGMP, we will be obligated to expend time,\nmoney and effort in production, record keeping and quality control to assure that the product meets applicable specifications and other requirements. If we fail to\ncomply with these requirements, we would be subject to possible regulatory action and may not be permitted to sell any products that we may develop.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we will be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and continued\nregulatory review, which may result in significant additional expenses. Additionally, our product candidates, if approved, could be subject to\nlabeling and other restrictions and market withdrawal. We may also be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or\nexperience unanticipated problems with our products.\nAny regulatory approvals that we or our existing or future collaborators obtain for our product candidates may also be subject to limitations on the approved\nindicated uses for which a product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing,\nincluding Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product candidate.\nIn addition, if the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority approves any of our product candidates, the manufacturing processes, labeling,\npackaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, import, export, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for the product will be subject to extensive\nand ongoing regulatory requirements. The FDA has significant post-market authority, including the authority to require labeling changes based on new safety\ninformation and to require post-market studies or clinical trials to evaluate safety risks related to the use of a product or to require withdrawal of the product from\nthe market. The FDA also has the authority to require a REMS plan after approval, which may impose further requirements or restrictions on the distribution or\nuse of an approved drug or therapeutic biologic. The manufacturing facilities we use to make a future product, if any, will also be subject to periodic review and\ninspection by the FDA and other regulatory agencies, including for continued compliance with cGMP requirements. The discovery of any new or previously\nunknown problems with our third-party manufacturers, manufacturing processes or facilities may result in restrictions on the product, manufacturer or facility,\nincluding withdrawal of the product from the market. If we rely on third-party manufacturers, we will not have control over compliance with applicable rules and\nregulations by such manufacturers. Any product promotion and advertising will also be subject to regulatory requirements and continuing regulatory review. If we\nor our existing or future collaborators, manufacturers or service providers fail to comply with applicable continuing regulatory requirements in the United States\nor foreign jurisdictions in which we seek to market our products, we or they may be subject to, among other things, fines, warning letters, holds on clinical trials,\ndelay of approval or refusal by the FDA or similar foreign regulatory bodies to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications,\nsuspension or withdrawal of regulatory approval, product recalls and seizures, administrative detention of products, refusal to permit the import or export of\nproducts, operating restrictions, injunction, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.\nSubsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with our third-\nparty manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:\n•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, withdrawal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory product recalls;\n•fines, warning or untitled letters or holds on clinical trials;\n75\n•refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us or our strategic partners;\n•suspension or revocation of product license approvals;\n•product seizure or detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products; and\n•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nThe FDA policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product\ncandidates. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to\nmaintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would\nadversely affect our business.\nMoreover, the ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding\nlevels, statutory, regulatory and policy changes, the FDA’s ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and other events that\nmay otherwise affect the FDA’s ability to perform routine functions. In addition, government funding of other government agencies that fund research and\ndevelopment activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. Disruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow\nthe time necessary for new drugs to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business.\nThe ability of the FDA and other government agencies to properly administer their functions is highly dependent on the levels of government funding and\nthe ability to fill key leadership appointments, among various factors. Delays in filling or replacing key positions could significantly impact the ability of the FDA\nand other agencies to fulfill their functions, and could greatly impact healthcare and the pharmaceutical industry.\nWe also cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action,\neither in the United States or abroad. Further, three decisions from the U.S. Supreme Court in July 2024 may lead to an increase in litigation against regulatory\nagencies that could create uncertainty and thus negatively impact our business. The first decision overturned established precedent that required courts to defer\nto regulatory agencies’ interpretations of ambiguous statutory language. The second decision overturned regulatory agencies’ ability to impose civil penalties in\nadministrative proceedings. The third decision extended the statute of limitations within which entities may challenge agency actions. However, the specific,\nlasting effects of these decisions, which may vary within different judicial districts and circuits, is unknown. We also cannot predict the extent to which FDA and\nSEC regulations, policies, and decisions may become subject to increasing legal challenges, delays, and changes. For example, these cases may result in\nincreased litigation by companies against the FDA, and impact the FDA’s authority, lead to uncertainties in the industry, and disrupt the FDA’s normal\noperations, which could impact the timely review of any regulatory filings or applications we submit to the FDA.\nFurther, if a prolonged government shutdown occurs, or if global health concerns prevent the FDA or other regulatory authorities from conducting their\nregular inspections, reviews, or other regulatory activities, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA or other regulatory authorities to timely review and\nprocess our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may face difficulties from healthcare legislative reform measures.\nExisting regulatory policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could affect pricing and third-party payments for our\nproduct candidates, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition and prospects. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of\ngovernment regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are slow or unable to adapt to\nchanges in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any\nmarketing approval that we may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability.\nIn the United States, there have been and continue to be a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. For example, in March 2010, the\nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Healthcare and\n76\nEducation Reconciliation Act, or together, the ACA, was enacted, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private\ninsurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry.\nWhile there have been legislative and judicial efforts to modify, repeal or otherwise invalidate all or certain aspects of the ACA or its implementing\nregulations, the ACA remains in effect in its current form. It is unclear how any such efforts in the future will impact the ACA or our business.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States federal and state levels to reduce healthcare expenditures,\nincluding the Budget Control Act, which, subject to certain temporary suspension periods, imposed 2% reductions in Medicare payments to providers per fiscal\nyear starting April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, that will remain in effect through 2031, unless additional Congressional\naction is taken, and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which added a requirement for manufacturers of certain single-source drugs (including biologics\nand biosimilars) separately paid for under Medicare Part B for at least 18 months and marketed in single-dose containers or packages (known as refundable\nsingle-dose containers or single-use package drugs) to provide annual refunds for any portions of the dispensed drug that are unused and discarded if those\nunused or discarded portions exceed an applicable percentage defined by statute or regulation. Further, in November 2020, the U.S. Department of Health and\nHuman Services, or HHS, finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under\nPart D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price\nreductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers.\nThe implementation of this final rule was delayed by the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, until January 1, 2032. In December 2020, CMS issued a final rule\nimplementing significant manufacturer price reporting changes under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including regulations that affect manufacturer-\nsponsored patient assistance programs subject to pharmacy benefit manager accumulator programs and Best Price reporting related to certain value-based\npurchasing arrangements. Under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, effective January 1, 2024, the statutory cap on Medicaid Drug Rebate Program\nrebates that manufacturers pay to state Medicaid programs is eliminated. Elimination of this cap may require pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay more in\nrebates than they receive on the sale of products.\nMoreover, on January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare\npayments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the\ngovernment to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. If federal spending is further reduced, anticipated budgetary shortfalls may also\nimpact the ability of relevant agencies, such as the FDA or the National Institutes of Health to continue to function at current levels. Amounts allocated to federal\ngrants and contracts may be reduced or eliminated. These reductions may also impact the ability of relevant agencies to timely review and approve research\nand development, manufacturing, and marketing activities, which may delay our ability to develop, market and sell any products we may develop.\nMoreover, payment methodologies, including payment for companion diagnostics, may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory\ninitiatives. CMS has begun bundling the Medicare payments for certain laboratory tests ordered while a patient received services in a hospital outpatient setting\nand, beginning in 2018, CMS will pay for clinical laboratory services based on a weighted average of reported prices that private payors, Medicare Advantage\nplans, and Medicaid Managed Care plans pay for laboratory services. Further, on March 16, 2018, CMS finalized its National Coverage Determination, or NCD,\nfor certain diagnostic laboratory tests using next generation sequencing that are approved by the FDA as a companion in vitro diagnostic and used in a cancer\nwith an FDA-approved companion diagnostic indication. Under the NCD, diagnostic tests that gain FDA approval or clearance as an in vitro companion\ndiagnostic will automatically receive full coverage and be available for patients with recurrent, metastatic relapsed, refractory or stages III and IV cancer.\nAdditionally, the NCD extended coverage to repeat testing when the patient has a new primary diagnosis of cancer.\nThere has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in\nseveral presidential executive orders, Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring\nmore transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program\nreimbursement methodologies for drug products. The FDA released a final rule in September 2020 providing guidance for states to build and submit importation\nplans for drugs from Canada, and the FDA authorized the first such plan in January 2024.\nRecently, several healthcare reform initiatives culminated in the enactment of the IRA in August 2022, which allows, among other things, HHS to negotiate\nthe selling price of a statutorily specified number of drugs and biologics each year\n77\nthat CMS reimburses under Medicare Part B and Part D. Only high-expenditure single-source biologics that have been approved for at least 11 years (7 years\nfor single-source small molecule therapeutics) can qualify for negotiations, with the negotiated price taking effect two years after the selection year. CMS\nselected the Medicare Part D drugs for negotiation in 2023, negotiations began in 2024, and the negotiated maximum fair price for each drug has been\nannounced. The price cap for each of these drugs, which cannot exceed a statutory ceiling price, will come into effect on January 1, 2026. Negotiations for\nMedicare Part B products begin in 2026, with the negotiated price taking effect in 2028. A drug or biological product that has an orphan drug designation for only\none rare disease or condition will be excluded from the IRA’s price negotiations requirements, but loses that exclusion if it has designations for more than one\nrare disease or condition, or if it is approved for an indication that is not within that single designated rare disease or condition, unless such additional\ndesignation or such disqualifying approvals are withdrawn by the time CMS evaluates the drug for selection for negotiation. In August 2023, HHS announced\nthe ten Medicare Part D drugs and biologics that it selected for negotiations, and by October 1, 2023, each manufacturer of the selected drugs signed a\nmanufacturer agreement to participate in the negotiations. The IRA also penalizes drug manufacturers that increase prices of Medicare Part D and Part B drugs\nat a rate greater than the rate of inflation. In addition, the law eliminates the “donut hole” under Medicare Part D beginning in 2025 by significantly lowering the\nenrollee maximum out-of-pocket cost and requiring manufacturers to subsidize, through a newly established manufacturer discount program, 10% of Part D\nenrollees’ prescription costs for brand drugs below the out-of-pocket maximum, and 20% once the out-of-pocket maximum has been reached. The IRA permits\nthe Secretary of HHS to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. Manufacturers that fail to comply\nwith the IRA may be subject to various penalties, some significant, including civil monetary penalties. The IRA also extends enhanced subsidies for individuals\npurchasing health insurance coverage in ACA marketplaces through plan year 2025. These provisions are taking effect progressively starting in 2023, although\nthey may be subject to legal challenges. For example, the provisions related to the negotiation of selling prices of high-expenditure single-source drugs and\nbiologics have been challenged in multiple lawsuits. Thus, while it is unclear how the IRA will be implemented, it will likely have a significant impact on the\npharmaceutical industry and our product candidates.\nAt the state level, legislatures are increasingly enacting laws and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product\npricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency\nmeasures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.\nAdditionally, on May 30, 2018, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017 was signed into law.\nThe law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase\n1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in\nclinical trials and without obtaining FDA authorization under an FDA expanded access program; however, manufacturers are not obligated to provide\ninvestigational new drug products under the current federal right to try law. We may choose to seek an expanded access program for our product candidates, or\nto utilize comparable rules in other countries that allow the use of a drug, on a named patient basis or under a compassionate use program.\nWe expect that the ACA, the IRA and other state or federal healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous\ncoverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. The implementation of cost containment\nmeasures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products.\nOur operations and relationships with healthcare providers, healthcare organizations, customers and third-party payors will be subject to\napplicable anti-bribery, anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, transparency and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to, among\nother things, enforcement actions, criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens and\ndiminished profits and future earnings.\nOur current and future arrangements with healthcare providers, healthcare organizations, third-party payors and customers expose us to broadly\napplicable anti-bribery, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships\nthrough which we research, market, sell and distribute our product candidates. In addition, we may be subject to patient data privacy and security regulation by\nthe U.S. federal government and the states and the foreign governments in which we conduct our business. Restrictions under applicable federal and state anti-\nbribery and healthcare laws and regulations, include the following:\n•the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, individuals and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or\nproviding remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or\n78\nreward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be\nmade under a federal and state healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the\nstatute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;\n•the federal criminal and civil false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the federal False Claims Act, which can be imposed through civil\nwhistleblower or qui tam actions against individuals or entities, prohibits, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal\ngovernment, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent, knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to\na false or fraudulent claim, or from knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government.\nIn addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. Moreover, the government may assert that a claim\nincluding items and services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal\nFalse Claims Act;\n•HIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability, prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute a scheme to\ndefraud any healthcare benefit program, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false\nstatement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services; similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or\nentity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;\n•HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, which impose obligations on certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, known as covered\nentities, as well as their business associates that perform certain services involving the storage, use or disclosure of individually identifiable health\ninformation, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health\ninformation, and require notification to affected individuals and regulatory authorities of certain breaches of security of individually identifiable health\ninformation;\n•the federal legislation commonly referred to as Physician Payments Sunshine Act, enacted as part of the ACA, and its implementing regulations, which\nrequires certain manufacturers of covered drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies that are reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s\nHealth Insurance Program, with certain exceptions, to report annually to CMS information related to certain payments and other transfers of value to\nphysicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), physician assistants, certain types of advanced practice nurses,\nand teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members, with the\ninformation made publicly available on a searchable website;\n•the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, which prohibits, among other things, U.S. companies and their employees and agents from\nauthorizing, promising, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, corrupt or improper payments or anything else of value to foreign government officials,\nemployees of public international organizations and foreign government owned or affiliated entities, candidates for foreign political office, and foreign political\nparties or officials thereof;\n•analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, that may apply to sales or marketing arrangements\nand claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; and\n•certain state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant\ncompliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug and therapeutic biologics manufacturers to report information\nrelated to payments to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and pricing information, state and local laws that require the\nregistration of pharmaceutical sales representatives, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many\nof which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nIf we or our collaborators, manufacturers or service providers fail to comply with applicable federal, state or foreign laws or regulations, we could be subject\nto enforcement actions, which could affect our ability to develop, market and sell\n79\nour products successfully and could harm our reputation and lead to reduced acceptance of our products by the market. These enforcement actions include,\namong others:\n•exclusion from participation in government-funded healthcare programs;\n•exclusion of company products from coverage under federal health care programs; and\n•exclusion from eligibility for the award of government contracts for our products.\nEfforts to ensure that our current and future business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations could involve\nsubstantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations,\nagency guidance or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any\nsuch requirements, we may be subject to significant penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement,\nimprisonment, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, loss of eligibility to obtain approvals from the FDA, exclusion from participation in government\ncontracting, healthcare reimbursement or other government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, or\nreputational harm, any of which could adversely affect our financial results. Although effective compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and\nprosecution for violations of these laws, these risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for an alleged or suspected violation could cause us to\nincur significant legal expenses and could divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business, even if our defense is successful. In addition,\nachieving and sustaining compliance with applicable laws and regulations may be costly to us in terms of money, time and resources.\nOur failure to comply with privacy and data security laws, regulations and standards may cause our business to be materially adversely\naffected.\nWe maintain a quantity of sensitive information, including confidential business and patient health information in connection with our clinical trials that are\nsubject to US and international laws and regulations governing the privacy and data protection of such information. Each of these laws is subject to varying\ninterpretations and subject to evolving regulations. For example, the EU and United Kingdom (the \"UK\") GDPR, which applies extraterritorially, imposes several\nstrict requirements for controllers and processors of personal information, which include higher standards for obtaining consent from individuals to process their\npersonal information, increased requirements pertaining to the processing of special categories of personal information (such as health information) and\npseudonymized (i.e., key-coded) data, and heightened transfer requirements of personal information from the European Economic Area/UK/Switzerland to\ncountries not deemed to have adequate data protections laws. Notably, the U.S. is one such country as of January 1, 2024, although effective July 10, 2023, the\nnew EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (the \"DPF\"), has been recognized as adequate under EU law to allow transfers of personal data from the EU (as well as\nthe U.K. and Switzerland) to certified companies in the U.S. However, the DPF is likely to face legal challenge at the Court of Justice of the European Union\nwhich could cause the legal requirements for personal data transfers from the Europe to the U.S. to become uncertain once again. We will monitor these legal\ndevelopments and continue to use best practices to follow established European legal standards to conduct cross-border transfer of personal data. The GDPR\nalso provides that countries in the European Economic Area may establish their own laws and regulations further restricting the processing of certain personal\ninformation, including genetic data, biometric data, and health data. Companies that must comply with the GDPR face increased compliance obligations and\nrisk, including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance of up to €20 million (approximately\n$22.6 million) or 4 percent of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater.\nIn the United States, in addition to HIPAA, various federal (for example, the Federal Trade Commission) and state regulators have adopted, or are\nconsidering adopting, laws and regulations concerning personal information and data security that may conflict or be more stringent or broader in scope, or offer\ngreater individual rights, with respect to personal information than existing federal, international, or other state laws. For example, California, which continues to\nbe a critical state with respect to evolving consumer privacy laws after enacting the California Consumer Privacy Act (the \"CCPA\"), as amended by the\nCalifornia Privacy Rights Act, took effect in January 2023 and may be subject to additional regulations promulgated through a newly created enforcement\nagency called the California Privacy Protection Agency (the \"CPPA\"). Failure to comply with the CCPA may result in significant civil penalties, injunctive relief, or\nstatutory or actual damages as determined by the CPPA and California Attorney General, the latter still retaining some CCPA enforcement authority. Following\nCalifornia’s lead, several other states have enacted privacy laws in recent years. In\n80\naddition, a comprehensive federal privacy bill, which includes a private right of action for violations, has been proposed in Congress.\nWe cannot provide assurance that (i) current or future legislation will not prevent us from generating or maintaining personal information, or (ii) that patients\nwill consent to the use of their personal information (as necessary). Either of these circumstances may prevent us from undertaking or publishing essential\nresearch and development, manufacturing, and commercialization, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial\ncondition, and prospects.\nFurther, on July 26, 2023, the SEC adopted cybersecurity disclosure rules for public companies that require disclosure regarding cybersecurity risk\nmanagement (including our board’s role in overseeing cybersecurity risks, management’s role and expertise in assessing and managing cybersecurity risks and\nprocesses for assessing, identifying and managing cybersecurity risks) in annual reports on Form 10-K. These cybersecurity disclosure rules also require the\ndisclosure of material cybersecurity incidents by Form 8-K.\nIn addition to government regulation, privacy advocates and industry groups have and may in the future propose self-regulatory standards from time to\ntime. These and other industry standards may legally or contractually apply to us, or we may elect to comply with such standards. It is possible that if our\npractices are not consistent or viewed as not consistent with legal and regulatory requirements and interpretations, we may become subject to audits, inquiries,\nwhistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges, or severe criminal or civil sanctions, all of which may have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, operating results, reputation, and financial condition.\nAll of these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs, such as costs related to organizational changes, implementing\nadditional protection technologies, training employees and engaging consultants, which are likely to increase over time. In addition, such requirements may\nrequire us to modify our data processing practices and policies, distract management or divert resources from other initiatives and projects, all of which could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with any\napplicable federal, state, or similar foreign laws and regulations relating to data privacy and security could result in damage to our reputation, as well as\nproceedings or litigation by governmental agencies or other third parties, including class action privacy litigation in certain jurisdictions, which would subject us\nto significant fines, sanctions, awards, injunctions, penalties, or judgments. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of\noperations, financial condition, and prospects.\nIf in the future we are unable to establish U.S. or global sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to sell and\nmarket our product candidates, we may not be successful in commercializing our product candidates if they are approved and we may not be able\nto generate any revenue.\nWe currently have a limited team for the marketing, sales and distribution of any of our product candidates that are able to obtain regulatory approval. To\ncommercialize any product candidates after approval, we must build, on a territory-by-territory basis, marketing, sales, distribution, managerial and other non-\ntechnical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services, and we may not be successful in doing so. If our product candidates\nreceive regulatory approval, we may decide to establish a sales or marketing team with technical expertise and supporting distribution capabilities to\ncommercialize our product candidates, which will be expensive and time consuming and will require significant attention of our executive officers to manage. For\nexample, some state and local jurisdictions have licensing and continuing education requirements for pharmaceutical sales representatives, which requires time\nand financial resources. Any failure or delay in the development of our internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities would adversely impact the\ncommercialization of any of our product candidates that we obtain approval to market.\nWith respect to the commercialization of all or certain of our product candidates, we may choose to collaborate, either globally or on a territory-by-territory\nbasis, with third parties that have direct sales forces and established distribution systems, either to augment our own sales force and distribution systems or in\nlieu of our own sales force and distribution systems. If we are unable to enter into such arrangements when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, we may not\nbe able to successfully commercialize any of our product candidates that receive regulatory approval, or any such commercialization may experience delays or\nlimitations. If we are not successful in commercializing our product candidates, either on our own or through collaborations with one or more third parties, our\nfuture product revenue will suffer and we may incur significant additional losses.\n81\nOur product candidates for which we intend to seek approval as biologic products may face competition sooner than anticipated.\nWith the enactment of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, an abbreviated pathway for the licensure of biosimilar\nbiological products (both highly similar and interchangeable biological products) was created. The abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for\nthe FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as interchangeable based on its similarity to an existing\nreference product. The BPCIA provides a period of exclusivity for products granted “reference product exclusivity,” under which an application for a biosimilar\nproduct referencing such products cannot be licensed by the FDA until 12 years after the first licensure date of the reference product licensed under a BLA.\nDuring this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA licenses a full BLA for\nthe competing product containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity\nand potency of their product. The law is complex and is still being interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation, and\nmeaning are subject to uncertainty. While it is uncertain when such processes intended to implement BPCIA may be fully adopted by the FDA, any such\nprocesses could have an adverse effect on the future commercial prospects for our product candidates.\nThere is a risk that any product candidates we may develop that are licensed as a biological product under a BLA would not qualify for the 12-year period\nof exclusivity or that this exclusivity could be shortened due to congressional action or otherwise, or that the FDA will not consider any product candidates we\nmay develop to be reference products for competing products, potentially creating the opportunity for generic competition sooner than anticipated.\nMost states have enacted substitution laws that permit substitution of interchangeable biosimilars. The extent to which a highly similar biosimilar, once\nlicensed, will be substituted for any one of our reference products that may be approved in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-\nbiological products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing.\nIf any of our product candidates receives marketing approval and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by the product\ncandidates, our ability to market and derive revenue from the product candidates could be compromised.\nUndesirable side effects caused by our product candidates could cause regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in\nmore restrictive labeling or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. Given the nature of ADCs, it is likely that there\nmay be side effects associated with their use. Results of our clinical trials could reveal a high and unacceptable severity and prevalence of side effects. In such\nan event, our clinical trials could be suspended or terminated, and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order us to cease further\ndevelopment of or deny approval of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications. Such side effects could also affect patient recruitment or the ability\nof enrolled patients to complete the clinical trials or result in potential product liability claims. Any of these occurrences may materially and adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nFurther, clinical trials by their nature utilize a sample of the potential patient population. With a limited number of patients and limited duration of exposure,\nrare and severe side effects of our product candidates may only be uncovered with a significantly larger number of patients exposed to the product candidate.\nIn the event that any of our product candidates receive regulatory approval and we or others identify undesirable side effects caused by one of our\nproducts, any of the following adverse events could occur:\n•regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product or seize the product;\n•we may be required to recall the product or change the way the product is administered to patients;\n•additional restrictions may be imposed on the marketing of the particular product or the manufacturing processes for the product or any component thereof;\n•we may be subject to fines, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties;\n82\n•regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as a black box warning or a contraindication;\n•we may be required to create a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients;\n•we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients;\n•the product may become less competitive; and\n•our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these occurrences could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWhile we have been granted a Fast Track Designation by the FDA for luvelta, it may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or\napproval process.\nWe have been granted a Fast Track Designation for luvelta for the treatment of patients with platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary\nperitoneal cancer, who have received one to three prior lines of systemic therapy. As part of our business strategy, we may also seek Fast Track Designation for\nother of our product candidates. If a drug or biologic is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition and the drug or biologic demonstrates\nthe potential to address unmet medical needs for this condition, the product sponsor may apply for FDA Fast Track Designation. The FDA has broad discretion\nwhether or not to grant this designation, so even if we believe a particular product candidate is eligible for this designation, we cannot assure you that the FDA\nwould decide to grant it. Even if we do receive Fast Track Designation, as we have for luvelta, we may not experience a faster development process, review or\napproval compared to conventional FDA procedures. The FDA may withdraw Fast Track Designation if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by\ndata from our clinical development program, which may happen in connection with luvelta or other of our product candidates if granted Fast Track Designation.\nWhile we have been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA for luvelta for the treatment of Pediatric (CBF/GLIS) AML, if we decide to seek\nOrphan Drug Designation for some of our other product candidates, we may be unsuccessful or may be unable to maintain the benefits associated\nwith Orphan Drug Designation, including the potential for orphan drug exclusivity.\nWe have been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA for luvelta for the treatment of Pediatric CBF/GLIS AML. As part of our business strategy, we\nmay seek Orphan Drug Designation for our other product candidates, and we may be unsuccessful. Regulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the\nUnited States and Europe, may designate drugs and therapeutic biologics for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act,\nthe FDA may designate a drug or therapeutic biologic as an orphan drug if it is a drug or therapeutic biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which\nis generally defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 in the United\nStates where there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the drug or therapeutic biologic will be recovered from sales in the United States. In\nthe United States, Orphan Drug Designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as tax advantages and user fee waivers. In addition, if a product that\nhas Orphan Drug Designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan\ndrug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same product for the same condition for\nseven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or where the manufacturer is\nunable to assure sufficient product quantity.\nEven if we obtain Orphan Drug Designation for our product candidates in specific conditions, we may not be the first to obtain marketing approval of these\nproduct candidates for the orphan-designated condition due to the uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical products; in such case, no orphan\ndrug exclusivity would be available unless we could demonstrate “clinical superiority.” In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be limited\nif we seek approval for an indication broader than the orphan-designated condition or may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation\nwas materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or\ncondition. Further, even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because\ndifferent drugs or therapeutic biologics with different principal molecular structural features can be approved for the same condition. Even\n83\nafter an orphan product is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve the same drug or therapeutic biologic with the same principal molecular structural\nfeatures for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug or therapeutic biologic is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient\ncare. Orphan Drug Designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug or therapeutic biologic nor gives the drug or\ntherapeutic biologic any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process. In addition, while we may seek Orphan Drug Designation for our product\ncandidates, we may never receive such designations.\nThe tax reform legislation signed into law on December 22, 2017 reduced the amount of the qualified clinical research costs for a designated orphan\nproduct that a sponsor may claim as a credit from 50% to 25%. This may further limit the advantage and may impact our future business strategy of seeking the\nOrphan Drug Designation.\nIf we decide to pursue accelerated approval for any of our product candidates, it may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or\napproval process and does not increase the likelihood that our product candidates will receive marketing approval.\nIn the future, we may decide to pursue accelerated approval for one or more of our product candidates. Under the FDA’s accelerated approval program,\nthe FDA may approve a drug or biologic for a serious or life-threatening disease or condition that provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies\nbased upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible\nmorbidity or mortality that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. For drugs or biologics granted\naccelerated approval, post-marketing confirmatory trials are required to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other\nclinical benefit. These confirmatory trials must be completed with due diligence, and the FDA may require that the trial be designed, initiated, and/or fully\nenrolled prior to approval. If we were to pursue accelerated approval for a product candidate for a disease or condition, we would do so on the basis that there is\nno available therapy for that disease or condition or that our product candidate provides a benefit over available therapy. If standard of care were to evolve or if\nany of our competitors were to receive full approval on the basis of a confirmatory trial for a drug or biologic for a disease or condition for which we are seeking\naccelerated approval before we receive accelerated approval, the disease or condition would no longer qualify as one for which there is no available therapy,\nand accelerated approval of our product candidate would not occur without a showing of benefit over available therapy. Many cancer therapies rely on\naccelerated approval, and the treatment landscape can change quickly as the FDA converts accelerated approvals to full approvals on the basis of successful\nconfirmatory trials. Whether any trial is sufficient to receive FDA approval under the accelerated approval pathway will depend on the design and safety and\nefficacy results of such trial and will only be determined by the FDA upon review of the trial design and a submitted BLA.\nMoreover, the FDA may withdraw approval of any product candidate approved under the accelerated approval pathway if, for example:\n•the trial or trials required to verify the predicted clinical benefit of our product candidate fail to verify such benefit or do not demonstrate sufficient clinical\nbenefit to justify the risks associated with such product;\n•other evidence demonstrates that our product candidate is not shown to be safe or effective under the conditions of use;\n•we fail to conduct any required post-approval trial of our product candidate with due diligence; or\n•we disseminate false or misleading promotional materials relating to the relevant product candidate.\nIn addition, the FDA may terminate the accelerated approval program or change the standards under which accelerated approvals are considered and\ngranted in response to public pressure or other concerns regarding the accelerated approval program. Changes to or termination of the accelerated approval\nprogram could prevent or limit our ability to obtain accelerated approval of any of our clinical development programs.\nRecently, the accelerated approval pathway has come under scrutiny within the FDA and by Congress. The FDA has put increased focus on ensuring that\nconfirmatory studies are conducted with diligence and, ultimately, that such studies confirm the benefit. For example, the FDA has convened its Oncologic\nDrugs Advisory Committee to review what the FDA has called “dangling” or delinquent accelerated approvals, where confirmatory studies have not been\ncompleted or where results did not confirm benefit, but for which marketing approval continues in effect, and some companies have\n84\nsubsequently voluntarily requested withdrawal of approval of their products. In addition, the Oncology Center of Excellence has announced Project Confirm,\nwhich is an initiative to promote the transparency of outcomes related to accelerated approvals for oncology indications and provide a framework to foster\ndiscussion, research and innovation in approval and post-marketing processes, with the goal to enhance the balance of access and verification of benefit for\ntherapies available to patients with cancer and hematologic malignancies.\nFurther, the enactment of The Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act, or FDORA, included provisions related to the accelerated approval pathway. Pursuant\nto FDORA, the FDA is authorized to require a post-approval study to be underway prior to approval or within a specified time period following approval. FDORA\nalso requires the FDA to specify conditions of any required post-approval study and requires sponsors to submit progress reports for required post-approval\nstudies and any conditions required by the FDA. FDORA enables the FDA to initiate enforcement action for the failure to conduct with due diligence a required\npost-approval study, including a failure to meet any required conditions specified by the FDA or to submit timely reports.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate significantly or may fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts,\neach of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate or decline.\nWe expect our operating results to be subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations. Our net income or loss and other operating results will be affected by\nnumerous factors, including:\n•variations in the level of expense related to the ongoing development of our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms, our product candidates or future\ndevelopment programs;\n•results of preclinical and clinical trials, or the addition or termination of clinical trials or funding support by us, or existing or future collaborators or licensing\npartners;\n•our execution of any additional collaboration, licensing or similar arrangements, and the timing of payments we may make or receive under existing or future\narrangements or the termination or modification of any such existing or future arrangements;\n•any intellectual property infringement lawsuit or opposition, interference or cancellation proceeding in which we may become involved;\n•additions and departures of key personnel;\n•strategic decisions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestitures, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments or changes in business\nstrategy;\n•if any of our product candidates receives regulatory approval, the terms of such approval and market acceptance and demand for such product candidates;\n•regulatory developments affecting our product candidates or those of our competitors;\n•the impact of accounting principles and tax laws, including as a result of recent tax law changes;\n•epidemics, pandemics or contagious diseases;\n•changes in general market and economic conditions; and\n•cybersecurity incidents\nIf our quarterly and annual operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline\nsubstantially. Furthermore, any quarterly and annual fluctuations in our operating results may, in turn, cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate\nsubstantially. We believe that quarterly and annual comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an\nindication of our future performance.\n85\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our\nstockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation and our restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company. These\nprovisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to elect directors who are not nominated by current members of our board of directors or take other\ncorporate actions, including effecting changes in our management. These provisions:\n•establish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board are elected at one time;\n•permit only the board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill vacancies on the board;\n•provide that directors may only be removed “for cause” and only with the approval of two-thirds of our stockholders;\n•require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws;\n•authorize the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that our board could use to implement a stockholder rights plan;\n•eliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n•prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n•prohibit cumulative voting; and\n•establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual\nstockholder meetings.\nIn addition, our restated certificate of incorporation, to the fullest extent permitted by law, provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is\nthe exclusive forum for: any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; any action asserting a claim\nagainst us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”), our restated certificate of incorporation, or our restated bylaws; or any\naction asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Furthermore, our amended and restated bylaws also provide that unless we\nconsent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any\ncomplaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act (the “Federal Forum Provision”). While the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware has\nheld that such provisions are facially valid under Delaware law, there can be no assurance that federal or state courts will follow the holding of the Delaware\nSupreme Court or determine that the Federal Forum Provision should be enforced in a particular case; application of the Federal Forum Provision means that\nsuits brought by our stockholders to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) must be brought in\nfederal court and cannot be brought in state court.\nThese choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our\ndirectors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, employees and agents even though an action, if\nsuccessful, might benefit our stockholders. Stockholders who do bring a claim in the specified courts could face additional litigation costs in pursuing any such\nclaim. The specified courts may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder considering an action\nmay be located or would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments or results may be more favorable to us than to our stockholders.\nAlternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our governance documents inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified\ntypes of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n86\nIn addition, Section 203 of the DGCL may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. Section 203 imposes certain restrictions on\nmergers, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15% or more of our common stock.\nThe exclusive forum provision in our organizational documents may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds\nfavorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers or other employees, or the underwriters of any offering giving rise to such claim,\nwhich may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware\nis the exclusive forum for: any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; any action asserting a claim\nagainst us arising pursuant to the DGCL, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; or any action asserting a\nclaim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum provision does not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability\ncreated by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"). It could apply, however, to a suit that falls within one or more of the\ncategories enumerated in the exclusive forum provision.\nThis choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our\ndirectors, officers, or other employees, or the underwriters of any offering giving rise to such claims, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims.\nAlternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or\nunenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nSection 22 of the Securities Act, creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all claims brought to enforce any duty or liability created by\nthe Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Our amended and restated bylaws provide that the federal district courts of the United States of\nAmerica will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities\nAct, or a Federal Forum Provision, including for all causes of action asserted against any defendant named in such complaint. For the avoidance of doubt, this\nprovision is intended to benefit and may be enforced by us, our officers and directors, the underwriters to any offering giving rise to such complaint and any\nother professional entity whose profession gives authority to a statement made by that person or entity and who has prepared or certified any part of the\ndocuments underlying the offering. Our decision to adopt a Federal Forum Provision followed a decision by the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware holding\nthat such provisions are facially valid under Delaware law. While federal or state courts may not follow the holding of the Delaware Supreme Court or may\ndetermine that the Federal Forum Provision should be enforced in a particular case, application of the Federal Forum Provision means that suits brought by our\nstockholders to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act must be brought in federal court and cannot be brought in state court, and our\nstockholders cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be your\nsole source of gain.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth\nand development of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nThe market price of our stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe trading price of our common stock may be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which we cannot\ncontrol. As a result of this volatility, investors may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the purchase price. The market price for our common stock\nmay be influenced by many factors, including the other risks described in this section and the following:\n•results of preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates, or those of our competitors or our existing or future collaborators;\n•regulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries, especially changes in laws or regulations applicable to our product candidates;\n87\n•the success of competitive products or technologies;\n•introductions and announcements of new products by us, our future commercialization partners, or our competitors, and the timing of these introductions or\nannouncements;\n•actions taken by regulatory agencies with respect to our products, clinical studies, manufacturing process or sales and marketing terms;\n•actual or anticipated variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n•the success of our efforts to acquire or in-license additional technologies, products or product candidates;\n•developments concerning current or future collaborations, including but not limited to those with our sources of manufacturing supply and our\ncommercialization partners;\n•market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors;\n•general economic uncertainty and capital markets disruptions, including changes in interest rates, a change in the U.S. presidential administration, rising\ninflation, potential instability with respect to the federal debt ceiling and budget and potential government shutdowns related thereto, which have been\nsubstantially impacted by regional geopolitical instability due to the impact of geopolitical tensions and the ongoing military conflicts around the world;\n•any adverse impact of health pandemics, including on our clinical trials and clinical trial operations;\n•announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic collaborations, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n•developments or disputes concerning patents or other proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for\nour product candidates and products;\n•our ability or inability to raise additional capital and the terms on which we raise it;\n•the recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n•changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n•actual or anticipated changes in earnings estimates or changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding our common stock, other comparable\ncompanies or our industry generally;\n•our failure or the failure of our competitors to meet analysts’ projections or guidance that we or our competitors may give to the market;\n•fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n•announcement and expectation of additional financing efforts;\n•speculation in the press or investment community;\n•trading volume of our common stock;\n•sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders;\n•changes in accounting principles or tax laws;\n•terrorist acts, acts of war or periods of widespread civil unrest, including the ongoing armed conflicts around the world;\n88\n•natural disasters, epidemics, pandemics or contagious diseases, and other calamities;\n•political instability; and\n•general economic, industry and market conditions.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the markets for pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks in particular, have experienced\nextreme price and volume fluctuations that have been often unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the issuer. These broad market and\nindustry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. The realization of any of the above\nrisks or any of a broad range of other risks, including those described in this “Risk Factors” section, could have a dramatic and adverse impact on the market\nprice of our common stock.\nThe future sale and issuance of equity or of debt securities that are convertible into equity will dilute our share capital.\nWe may choose to raise additional capital in the future, depending on market conditions, strategic considerations and operational requirements. To the\nextent that additional capital is raised through the sale and issuance of shares or other securities convertible into shares, our stockholders will be diluted. Future\nissuances of our common stock or other equity securities, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the trading price of our common\nstock and impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings of shares or equity securities. No prediction can be made as to the effect, if any, that future\nsales of common stock or the availability of common stock for future sales will have on the trading price of our common stock.\nA sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. If our stockholders sell, or the market perceives\nthat our stockholders intend to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decline\nsignificantly.\nWe cannot predict what effect, if any, sales of our shares in the public market or the availability of shares for sale will have on the market price of our\ncommon stock. However, future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, including shares issued upon exercise of outstanding\noptions or warrants, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. For example, we are party to a\nSales Agreement with Jefferies, pursuant to which, from time to time, we may offer and sell through Jefferies common stock pursuant to one or more “at the\nmarket” offerings. Sales of our common stock under the Sales Agreement could be subject to business, economic or competitive uncertainties and\ncontingencies, many of which may be beyond our control, and which could cause actual results from the sale of our common stock to differ materially from\nexpectations. Any future sales of common stock through our “at the market” offering program will result in dilution and may have a negative impact on the price\nof our common stock.\nWe also expect that significant additional capital may be needed in the future to continue our planned operations. To raise capital, we may sell common\nstock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. These sales, or the\nperception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nUnfavorable global economic conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy and in the global\nfinancial markets. For example, the global financial crisis caused extreme volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets, and the global economy has\ncontinued to be impacted by changes in interest rates, rising inflation, potential uncertainty with respect to the federal debt ceiling and budget and potential\ngovernment shutdowns related thereto. Further, the capital and credit markets may be adversely affected by rising regional geopolitical tensions, and global\nsanctions imposed in response thereto. Our business and operations may be impacted by the current\n89\npolitical instability and military hostilities in multiple geographies including Ukraine, the Middle East and the tensions between China and Taiwan. Moreover, a\nsevere or prolonged economic downturn, such as the global financial crisis, could result in a variety of risks to our business, including, weakened demand for our\nproduct candidates and our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. A weak or declining economy could also strain our\nsuppliers, possibly resulting in supply disruption, or cause our customers to delay making payments for our services. Any of the foregoing could harm our\nbusiness and we cannot anticipate all of the ways in which the current economic climate and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue an adverse or misleading opinion\nregarding our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our\nbusiness. We do not have any control over the analysts or the content and opinions included in their reports. If any of the analysts who cover us issue an\nadverse or misleading opinion regarding us, our business model, financial condition and results of operations, our intellectual property or our stock performance,\nor if our preclinical studies and clinical trials and operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of\nsuch analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause a decline\nin our stock price or trading volume.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management’s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain\nadditional executive management and qualified board members. The additional requirements we must comply with may strain our resources and\ndivert management’s attention from other business concerns.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \"Sarbanes-Oxley Act\"), the\nDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the listing requirements of The Nasdaq Global Select Market, and other applicable\nsecurities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more\ndifficult, time-consuming, or costly, and increase demand on our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual,\nquarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain\neffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Additionally, we may be subject to stockholder activism, which can be\ncostly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of management and may lead to additional compliance costs and impact the\nmanner in which we operate our business. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over\nfinancial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. As a result, management’s attention may be\ndiverted from other business concerns, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. In order to comply with these requirements, we may\nneed to hire more employees in the future or engage outside consultants, or may have difficulty attracting and retaining sufficient employees, which would\nincrease our costs and expenses.\nAs a result of no longer being an emerging growth company, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant additional expenses that we did not\npreviously incur in complying with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and rules implemented by the SEC. The cost of compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct has required us to incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management time on compliance-related issues as we implement additional\ncorporate governance practices and comply with reporting requirements.\nWe became a “smaller reporting company” as of December 31, 2022. We will continue to be a smaller reporting company if either (i) the market value of\nour stock held by non-affiliates is less than $250.0 million or (ii) our annual revenue is less than $100.0 million during the most recently completed fiscal year\nand the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700.0 million. Specifically, as a smaller reporting company, we may choose to present only\nthe two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and are eligible to take advantage of certain of the reduced\ndisclosure obligations regarding compensation disclosures. As a smaller reporting company and a “non-accelerated filer”, we still need to comply with Section\n404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which will continue to require substantial management time and expense. Based on our annual revenue for the 2023 fiscal\nyear, and the market value of our non-affiliated common stock, we expect to be an “accelerated filer” and a smaller reporting company as of December 31,\n2024. As such, we will be required to comply with Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for our annual report on Form 10-K for the period ended December\n31, 2024.\n90\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance, stockholder litigation, and public disclosure are creating\nuncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs, making some activities more time consuming, and increasing the likelihood\nand expense of litigation. These laws, regulations, and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a\nresult, their application in practice may evolve or otherwise change over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result\nin continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters, higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices, and increased\nexpenses and management attention due to actual or threatened litigation. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and\nstandards (or changing interpretations of them), and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of\nmanagement’s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with these laws, regulations, and standards\ndiffer from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us, and our business may be\nadversely affected. Being a public company and complying with the associated rules and regulations, and being subject to heightened likelihood of litigation,\nmakes it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, the costs of which can fluctuate significantly from year-to-year due to general\nmarket conditions in obtaining such insurance, but in recent years have risen significantly, consistent with the increase in market rates. As a result, we may be\nrequired to accept reduced coverage, incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage or may be unable to obtain coverage on economically reasonable\nterms, or at all. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executives and qualified members of our board of directors,\nparticularly to serve on our audit committee, our compensation committee, and our nominating and corporate governance committee.\nAs a result of disclosure of information in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition have become more visible, which may\nresult in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors. If such claims are successful, our business and operating results could be adversely affected,\nand even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the\nresources of our management and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nIn addition, as a result of our disclosure obligations as a public company, we could face pressure to focus on short-term results, which may adversely affect\nour ability to achieve long-term profitability.\nWe may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention.\nThe market price of our common stock has been volatile and, in the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have\nbeen subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in\nsubstantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.\nItem 2.

Some of these risks include:\n\n•\n\nWe have a history of significant losses and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\n\n•\n\nWe will need substantial additional funds to advance development of our product candidates and failure to obtain sufficient funding may force us to delay, limit or terminate our product development programs, commercialization efforts or other operations. We may have difficulties accessing the required additional capital on reasonable, or even any, terms to continue our product and platform development or other operations, and may have to make difficult prioritization decisions regarding development and potential partnering of our clinical and preclinical product candidates.\n\n•\n\nOur product candidates are in development and may fail, be impacted by competitive products or suffer delays that materially and adversely affect their commercial viability.\n\n•\n\nOur business is dependent on the success of our product candidates, including Iuvelta, which is generated from our proprietary XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms. \n\n•\n\nIf we do not achieve our development goals in the timeframes we anticipate and project, the commercialization of our products may be delayed and, as a result, our stock price may decline.\n\n•\n\nOur approach to the discovery and development of our therapeutic treatments is based on novel technologies that are unproven and may not result in marketable products.\n\n•\n\nWe depend on our information technology systems, and any failure of these systems, or those of our CROs, third-party vendors, or other contractors or consultants we may utilize, could harm our business. Security breaches, cyber-attacks, loss of data, and other disruptions could compromise sensitive information related to our business or other personal information or prevent us from accessing critical information and expose us to liability, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\n\n•\n\nOur information technology systems could face serious disruptions that could adversely affect our business.\n\n•\n\nOur failure to comply with privacy and data protection laws or to adequately secure the personal information we hold could result in significant liability or reputational harm and, in turn, a material adverse effect on our client base, member base and revenue.\n\n•\n\nIf our collaborations with third parties to develop and commercialize certain product candidates are not successful, we may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms and the product candidates.\n\n•\n\nOur inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of our product candidates or such materials, or the loss of our third-party suppliers, or our or their failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements or to supply sufficient quantities at acceptable quality levels or prices, or at all, would materially and adversely affect our business.\n\n•\n\nWe face competition from entities that have developed or may develop product candidates for cancer, including companies developing novel treatments and technology platforms. If these companies develop technologies or product candidates more rapidly than we do or their technologies are more effective, our ability to develop and successfully commercialize product candidates may be adversely affected.\n\n•\n\nIf we are not able to obtain and enforce patent protection for our technologies or product candidates, development and commercialization of our product candidates may be adversely affected.\n\n•\n\nOur collaborators may fail to abide by the terms of the agreements with us, which would require us to seek to enforce our agreements in accordance with the dispute resolution procedures set forth therein. These procedures may require us to engage in litigation or arbitration to enforce our rights, which can be expensive, time-consuming, and distracting to our management and Board of Directors and that may ultimately end up being unsuccessful.\n\n4  \n---  \n  \n•\n\nIf we are unable to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed. Changes in regulatory policy may render our strategies for obtaining regulatory approval less effective or completely ineffective, preventing us from obtaining regulatory approval for our product candidates on time or at all.\n\n5  \n---  \n  \nPART I\n\nItem 1.Business\n\nOverview\n\nWe are a clinical-stage oncology company developing site-specific and novel-format antibody drug conjugates, or ADCs, enabled by our proprietary integrated cell-free protein synthesis platform, XpressCF®, and our site-specific conjugation platform, XpressCF+®. We aim to design and develop therapeutics using the most relevant and potent modalities, including ADCs, bispecific ADCs, immunostimulatory ADCs, or iADCs, dual conjugate ADCs, or ADC2s, and cytokine derivatives. Our molecules are directed primarily against clinically validated targets where the current standard of care is suboptimal. We believe that our platform allows us to accelerate the discovery and development of potential first-in-class and/or best-in-class molecules by enabling the rapid and systematic evaluation of protein structure-activity relationships to create optimized homogeneous product candidates. Our mission is to transform the lives of patients by creating medicines with improved therapeutic profiles for areas of unmet need.\n\nOur most advanced product candidate is STRO-002, or luveltamab tazevibulin, or luvelta, an ADC directed against folate receptor-alpha, or FolRα, for patients with FolRα-expressing cancers, including ovarian cancer. In 2019, we began enrolling patients in a Phase 1 trial of luvelta that focused on ovarian and endometrial cancers. The Phase 1 trial assessing safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of luvelta to treat platinum resistant ovarian cancer has been completed. In January 2024, we reported near-final results from this Phase 1 trial, in which luvelta exhibited a manageable safety profile together with promising preliminary efficacy data in the tested patient population, as discussed in detail below. We also presented data from Phase 1b trials assessing safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy for the treatment of ovarian cancer with luvelta in combination with bevacizumab and for treatment of endometrial cancer. In August 2021, luvelta was granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for the treatment of patients with platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who have received one to three prior lines of systemic therapy. We began enrolling patients in a Phase 2/3 trial of luvelta for the treatment of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, the REFRαME-O1 study, in June 2023.\n\nIn addition, we have been offering compassionate use of luvelta to treat pediatric patients with relapsed/refractory CBFA2T3-GLIS2, or CBF/GLIS, acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, commonly known as RAM phenotype AML. Updated compassionate use data continued to show anti-leukemic activity of luvelta in pediatric patients with relapsed/refractory CBF/GLIS AML and was presented at the 65th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and Exposition (ASH 2023) in December 2023. The data showed that luvelta was well tolerated as a monotherapy agent and in combination with standard cancer therapies. Luvelta was granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA in December 2022 in this pediatric patient population. We expect to begin enrollment of a registration-directed trial of luvelta for treatment of pediatric RAM phenotype AML in the second half of 2024.\n\nWe also have two preclinical product candidates, STRO-003 and STRO-004. These product candidates are single homogeneous ADCs directed against an anti-receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1, or ROR1, and tissue factor, or TF, respectively, each of which we intend to develop for the treatment of solid tumors. We anticipate being ready to file an IND for each of STRO-003 and STRO-004 in 2024 and 2025, respectively.\n\nEnabled through our proprietary XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms, we have entered into multi-target, product-focused collaborations with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in the field of oncology, including an immunostimulatory antibody-drug conjugates collaboration with Astellas Pharma Inc., or Astellas, a cytokine derivatives collaboration with Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, or Merck; a B Cell Maturation Antigen, or BCMA, ADC collaboration with Celgene Corporation, or Celgene, a wholly owned subsidiary of Bristol Myers Squibb Company, New York, NY, or BMS; a MUC1-EGFR ADC collaboration with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany (operating in the United States and Canada under the name “EMD Serono”), or EMD Serono. Our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms have also supported Vaxcyte, Inc., or Vaxcyte, focused on discovery and development of vaccines for the treatment and prophylaxis of infectious disease. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Vaxcyte exercised its option to access expanded rights to develop and manufacture cell-free extract for use in development and manufacture of its vaccine products, among certain other rights.\n\nWe believe our XpressCF® platform is the first and only current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, compliant and scalable cell-free protein synthesis technology that has resulted in multiple product candidates in\n\n6  \n---  \n  \nclinical development. We believe key advantages of our cell-free protein synthesis platform over conventional biologic drug discovery and development include:\n\n•\n\nability to rapidly produce a wide variety of protein structures in-house; \n\n•\n\nability to incorporate multiple, different non-natural amino acids in a single protein; \n\n•\n\nfaster cycle time; \n\n•\n\nefficient drug discovery and early pharmacology and safety assessment; and \n\n•\n\nrapid and predictable scalability. \n\nWe plan to leverage these capabilities to accelerate the discovery and development of potential first-in-class and best-in-class molecules.\n\nThe benefits of our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms have resulted in collaborations with leaders in the field of oncology, including Astellas, Merck, BMS and EMD Serono. In 2022, we entered into a License and Collaboration Agreement with Astellas, for the development of immunostimulatory antibody-drug conjugates for up to three biological targets, which remains ongoing. Our collaboration with Merck resulted in MK-1484, a selective IL-2 agonist that Merck is developing as a monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab for the treatment of solid tumors. We announced the dosing of the first patient with MK-1484 in a Phase I study in the third quarter of 2022. Our BMS collaboration yielded CC-99712, a novel ADC therapeutic directed against BCMA. BMS elected to terminate development of CC-99712 in June 2023, whereupon rights to the product candidate reverted to us. Finally, our collaboration with EMD Serono yielded a novel bispecific ADC product candidate targeting EGFR and MUC1, known as M1231, for which an IND submission was filed in 2020. EMD Serono decided to terminate development of M1231 in the first quarter of 2023. Through December 31, 2023, we have received an aggregate of approximately $854million in payments from all of our collaborations, which includes approximately $54 million in investments in our stock. We intend to selectively enter into additional collaborations with partners who are seeking efficient and effective drug discovery, preclinical development and manufacturing capabilities for the creation of novel therapeutics.\n\nWe are developing luvelta for the treatment of ovarian and endometrial cancers. In addition to the development discussed above, an expansion cohort assessing the effects of administration of prophylactic pegfilgrastim in combination with luvelta opened for enrollment in the second quarter of 2022; interim results from this cohort were most recently presented in January 2024.\n\nOther studies for luvelta include a trial assessing the combination of luvelta with bevacizumab for treatment of ovarian cancer and an expansion cohort for FolRα-selected endometrial cancer that opened for enrollment in the fourth quarter of 2021. We intend to continue development of luvelta for the treatment of these indications in the future as resources permit. Additionally, luvelta was provided to pediatric patients with CBF/GLIS AML on a compassionate use basis. Translational work is also ongoing to support an investigational new drug, or IND, application for the initiation of a non-small cell lung cancer study, for which submission is planned in the first half of 2024.\n\nIn December 2021, we entered into the Tasly License Agreement, as amended in April 2022, to develop and commercialize luvelta in the Greater China territory. We believe that our collaboration with Tasly extends the opportunity to realize the potential value of luvelta through clinical development and commercialization in Greater China.\n\nWe previously were developing STRO-001, which is an ADC directed against CD74, an antigen that is highly expressed in many B cell malignancies. We completed enrollment for STRO-001 dose escalation in a Phase 1 trial for multiple myeloma and NHL and the maximum tolerated dose of STRO-001 was identified.\n\nIn October 2021,we entered into the BioNova Option Agreement, under which BioNova was granted the right to develop and commercialize STRO-001 in Greater China. In March 2024, BioNova notified us that it had decided to terminate both the BioNova Option Agreement and clinical development of STRO-001 in Greater China. Following receipt of this notice, we decided to suspend development of STRO-001.\n\n7  \n---  \n  \nOur most advanced assets in preclinical development are STRO-003 and STRO-004. We believe STRO-003 has the potential to be a first-in-class and best-in-class ADC targeting ROR1 and that STRO-004 has the potential to be a best-in-class ADC targeting TF. Preclinical data suggest that both STRO-003 and STRO-004 have potent antitumor activity and potential for a differentiated safety profile.\n\nBeyond these programs and collaborations, we are developing a broader pipeline of next-generation protein therapeutics using our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms. Our protein engineering and chemistry efforts are focused on maximizing therapeutic indices, and our technology allows us to rapidly test our therapeutic hypothesis in significantly more product candidates than conventional protein synthesis allows in order to identify the best molecule to advance to the clinic. We are also actively pursuing the discovery and development of other novel ADCs and next-generation ADC modalities, including iADCs, bispecific ADCs, and ADC2s.\n\nOur Strategy\n\nOur goal is to use our proprietary XpressCF® platform to create product candidates primarily against clinically validated targets. Key elements of our strategy are to:\n\n•\n\nAdvance luvelta through clinical development. We are currently enrolling patients in a Phase 2/3 trial of luvelta for the treatment of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, the REFRαME-O1 study. We also expect to enroll patients in a registration-directed trial of luvelta for the treatment of pediatric RAM phenotype AML in the second half of 2024. Given that FolRα is a clinically validated target for ovarian cancer, along with luvelta’s homogeneous design, we believe it has the potential to be a best-in-class FolRα-targeted ADC and provide benefit to a broader patient population, as well as potentially greater activity, stability and/or safety as compared to other investigational agents in development. \n\n•\n\nOpportunistically maintain worldwide rights or pursue strategic partnerships to maximize the potential value of our pipeline. We have assembled a management team with extensive experience in the biopharmaceutical industry, including drug discovery and development through commercialization, and our plan is to independently pursue the development and commercialization of our product candidates, to the extent possible. As we continue to advance our products, we may opportunistically pursue additional strategic partnerships that maximize the value of our pipeline, including relationships, when possible, to potentially co-develop and co-commercialize one or more of our product candidates. \n\n•\n\nDevelop a diverse pipeline of novel product candidates with optimized therapeutic profiles. We intend to continue to build a broad pipeline of optimally designed, next-generation protein therapeutics, initially for cancer, using our XpressCF® platform. Our cell-free-based protein synthesis system enables the rapid and systematic evaluation of protein structure-activity relationships, which we believe will accelerate the discovery and development of molecules. We aim to take advantage of the most potent modalities, focusing primarily on ADCs, iADCs, bispecific ADCs and ADC2s, to create drugs that are directed primarily against clinically validated targets where the current standard of care is suboptimal. \n\n•\n\nStrategically pursue additional collaborations to broaden the reach of our XpressCF® platform. To maximize the value of our XpressCF® platform technology, we have entered into multi-target, product-focused collaborations with leaders in the field of oncology, including an iADC collaboration with Astellas, a cytokine derivatives collaboration with Merck, a BCMA ADC collaboration with BMS and a MUC1-EGFR ADC collaboration with EMD Serono. We intend to selectively enter into additional collaborations with partners who are seeking efficient and effective drug discovery and manufacturing capabilities for the development of novel therapeutics. We intend to retain, to the extent possible, certain development and commercial rights to maximize the future potential value of product candidates discovered and developed using our XpressCF® platform. \n\nCancers Remains a Major Unmet Medical Need\n\nCancers are the second leading cause of mortality in the United States and the leading cause of death for those under 65 years of age. The American Cancer Society estimated that there would be greater than 2 million new cases of cancer diagnosed and approximately 612,000 people would die of cancer in the United States in 2024.\n\n8  \n---  \n  \nTraditional Cancer Therapeutics\n\nCancer treatment has traditionally included chemotherapy, radiation, surgery, or a combination of these approaches. Chemotherapy agents and other small molecule targeted therapies can be effective in certain types of cancer, but they can also cause toxicities that may lead to life-threatening consequences, lower quality of life or early termination of treatment. Furthermore, these agents offer limited efficacy in many types of cancer.\n\nOver the last twenty years, new paradigms of cancer research and treatment have emerged to address the limitations of existing treatments. Some of the most promising new approaches involve biologic therapies, including Antibody Drug Conjugates, or ADCs. ADCs have shown promise over the last decade with twelve marketed products in the United States and over 200 ADC candidates investigated in the clinic. ADCs use the foundation of monoclonal antibodies and small molecule drugs by targeting the delivery of chemotherapeutics to the tumor. They have shown clinical benefit in hematological and solid tumors, and often have a better safety profile than systemically delivered chemotherapeutics. We believe our XpressCF® platform will provide enhanced therapeutic approaches for treating cancer to address these unmet needs and are exploring next generation biologics, including ADCs, iADCs, and ADC2s. The expectation is that multiple therapeutic modalities will be used in novel combinations to treat patients and provide the most potent anti-cancer effect.\n\nAntibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs)\n\nADCs are a highly potent improvement to monoclonal antibody oncology therapies. The key components of ADCs include an antibody, a stable linker, and a cytotoxic agent (warhead). The antibody is used to target and deliver cytotoxic agents to tumor cells. ADCs can be mono, bispecific, or multi-specific. The intended result of this powerful and targeted approach is greater tumor cell death and less systemic tolerability issues as compared to traditional chemotherapy. The following diagram shows the component parts of an ADC.\n\n![img141552205_0.jpg](img141552205_0.jpg)\n\nCurrently, there are more than 200 ADCs being investigated in clinical development. Kadcyla and Adcetris were the first of the new generation of ADCs to be approved for the treatment of specific subsets of breast cancer and lymphoma, respectively. Several more ADCs are currently on the market in the U.S.: Besponsa, Mylotarg, Polivy, Zynlonta, and Zevalin were approved for the treatment of specific subsets of leukemia and lymphoma; Padcev was approved for the treatment of bladder and urinary tract cancers; Enhertu and Trodelvy were approved for the treatment of breast cancer as well as gastric and urinary tract cancers respectively; Tivdak was approved for the treatment of cervical cancer; and mirvetuximab soravtansine (Elahere®) was approved for the treatment of ovarian cancer. These approved therapies demonstrate that ADCs have an emerging role in the armamentarium of cancer therapeutics.\n\nLimitations to Current ADC Approaches\n\nDespite the approvals of these ADCs, there have been challenges in achieving the full clinical potential of this modality. We believe these challenges are directly related to the following:\n\n9  \n---  \n  \n•\n\nHeterogeneity as a Result of Imprecise and Variable Conjugation. Many ADCs, both those approved and those in development, use imprecise technologies that opportunistically attach the cytotoxic payload to naturally occurring amino acids within the antibody and result in a heterogeneous mixture. In these mixtures, the number and site location of the linker-warhead can vary significantly from antibody to antibody within the single ADC product. These many different forms in the final product are likely to perform differently, with some forms carrying insufficient cytotoxin to kill the tumor, and some forms carrying too high a load resulting in unintended toxicities. The overall performance of the heterogeneous ADC is therefore the average activity of the different species within the ADC mixture, which may limit both efficacy and tolerability. For these reasons, we believe this current class of ADCs, which are heterogeneous mixtures, are suboptimal for effective cancer treatment. The figure below compares homogeneous and heterogeneous ADCs. \n\n![img141552205_1.jpg](img141552205_1.jpg)![img141552205_2.jpg](img141552205_2.jpg)\n\n•\n\nSuboptimal Linker-Warhead Positioning. Conventional ADC technologies use conjugation chemistry to attach linker-warheads to naturally occurring amino acids within an antibody; therefore, the position is dictated by the pre-existing amino acid sequence. Published research studies have demonstrated that linker-warhead positioning along an antibody can have significant effect on the ability of an ADC to kill tumor cells, with some positions resulting in suboptimal killing. This position effect also contributes to the challenge of a heterogeneous ADC mixture. We believe that superior ADCs can be developed using technologies that allow linker-warhead positioning to be fine-tuned to empirically determined sites for maximal therapeutic benefit. \n\n•\n\nLack of Tumor Specificity Due to Linker Design. One of the major challenges in ADC technology has been to develop linking chemistries that ensure that warheads are only released from the antibody within the tumor microenvironment, and not released within the blood or healthy tissue as the ADC is delivered systemically and travels through the body. We believe that safer ADCs can be developed by utilizing non-natural amino acids that enable state-of-the-art chemistries to ensure that the warhead is not prematurely released. In addition, linker chemistries that rely on proteinases preferentially expressed in the tumor such as cathepsin and B-Glucuronidase, can provide more tumor specific release of the active catabolites and a resulting better safety profile.\n\n10  \n---  \n  \n•\n\nMechanism of Action of Cytotoxin Payloads. Beyond potent cytotoxic activity of ADC payloads, there are additional attributes that lead to better efficacy and more durable responses. Payloads that induce bystander activity, which is dependent on the ADC target engagement, but also kills surrounding cells within the tumor, are thought to result in broader activity. Additionally, some payloads can induce immunogenic cell death pathways. These pathways not only cause potent tumor cell killing but also produce an immunological phenotype in the cancer cells, known as immunogenic cell death, or ICD. Different payload types induce variable levels of ICD, which can induce an immune response against endogenous tumor antigens, contributing to tumor elimination and improved outcomes. Importantly, there is an emerging trend in the clinic that ADCs that induce higher levels of ICD combine better with checkpoint inhibitors, including PD-1/L1 antibodies. \n\n•\n\nLimitations of Topo1 inhibitor payloads. When compared to first generation, tubulin inhibitor-based ADCs such as T-DM1, exatecan-delivering ADCs, such as Enhertu or raludotatug deruxtecan, or R-DXd, display significant improvements in safety and efficacy measures observed in preclinical and clinical studies. Despite the progress made, serious adverse events and efficacy challenges remain. For example, upon prolonged treatment with DXd-based ADCs, a small but significant fraction of patients develop ILD. This adverse event is observed independent of the tumor antigen targeted by the ADC. ILD is difficult to treat and can be fatal if not detected in a timely manner. One potential cause of ILD is Fc gamma-mediated uptake of ADCs by alveolar macrophages in the lung, causing internalization followed by payload release, ultimately leading to ILD.\n\n•\n\nLow potency of exatecan-delivering ADCs: Exatecans are, in general, less potent inducers of tumor cell death compared to tubulin inhibitors. Therefore, low copy number tumor antigens and/or antigens with low internalization rates may be poor targets for extecan-based ADCs due to low potency.\n\nDual conjugations to enable iADC and ADC2 modalities to address current limitations of extecan-based ADCs and to optimize the therapeutic index, or TI\n\nXpressCF® enables the incorporation of non-natural amino acids into antibody sequences and results in site specific conjugation of drug payloads. More recently, we have developed technology to enable incorporation of two different non-natural amino acids that allows for the site-specific conjugation of two different payloads, providing the opportunity to combine pharmacology into a single molecule. We believe this is the first use of dual conjugation combining a conventional cytotoxin with an immune stimulatory payload to drive not only direct killing of the tumor cells but an immune response against the tumor. These iADC molecules utilize immune agonists such as TLR 7, TLR 8 and STING to induce activation of innate immune cells within the tumor microenvironment and resulted in more complete responses and protective anti-tumor immune responses in preclinical tumor models. This dual conjugation approach is the basis for our research collaboration with Astellas that is focused on the discovery of iADC molecules for solid tumors. In addition to immune modulators, additional payloads can be incorporated into our dual conjugation approach. These ADC2 payloads are focused on targets that are upregulated tumors that do not respond well to existing therapies. Our goal is to provide more durable responses in hard-to-treat tumors by combining two payloads that may offset resistance mechanisms.\n\nCytokine-Based Immuno-Oncology Therapeutics\n\nCytokines are small biologically active proteins that play an essential role in immune cell function. Cytokines are important for cell-to-cell communication and are responsible for controlling immune cell growth and differentiation. Recombinant human cytokines were among the first biotechnology products engineered for therapeutic use and, in the field of oncology, cytokines that stimulate the immune system to attack cancer cells have been viewed as a potential new approach.\n\nCertain cytokines play a central role in T cell function, contributing to the careful balance between helpful and harmful immune responses. These can be powerful activators of the immune system but can also suppress immune responses through certain specialized T cells that have suppressive functions. A previously approved cytokine therapeutic Proleukin® had shown therapeutic benefit in a small number of cancer patients, but its therapeutic use was limited due to toxicity. Scientists at other companies have focused research on finding ways to modify cytokines so as to reduce toxicity while maintaining therapeutic benefit. The observed efficacy of a modified cytokine, in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, indicates the potential of this new approach. In light of these data and our prior research into cytokines, we commenced a cytokine-based research\n\n11  \n---  \n  \nprogram using our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platform technologies to engineer cytokines aimed at better exposure and tolerability profiles. Our collaboration with Merck focused on developing cytokine derivatives yielded an IL-2 derivative that entered Phase 1 in 2022. We believe that recent advances in immuno-oncology combined with new protein engineering technologies create opportunities to identify novel cytokine-based therapeutics with superior therapeutic indexes.\n\nOur Proprietary XpressCF® Platform\n\nWhile ADCs, iADCs, ADC2s and engineered cytokines hold significant promise, drug developers working with these complex biologics face significant design and development challenges. Optimizing these complex biological structures is a challenging, trial and error process that requires the refinement of several properties in tandem. This iterative process is cumbersome and fraught with significant limitations. As a result, the drug candidate nominated for development is often plagued by inefficient design properties, which then translates to a suboptimal therapeutic index when investigated in the clinic.\n\nOur XpressCF® platform seeks to address these significant shortcomings. We believe our cell-free-based protein synthesis technology allows for efficient and proper design exploration to be conducted prior to nominating a lead drug candidate. In addition, we believe we can optimally design these types of complex biologics in a manner that is ideal for subsequent production at relevant scale and manufacture. We believe we are the only company with products in clinical development that has the capability to produce cell-free-based protein synthesis at scale. We believe we have a significant advantage over other development approaches in this space.\n\nOverview of Our XpressCF® Platform\n\nOur XpressCF® platform is fundamentally different from the conventional cell-based protein synthesis approach in that we separate the production of the cell mass from the production of the protein.\n\nWe first generate a cellular mass from our proprietary cell line from which we harvest the inner cellular machinery for making proteins. The cellular mass is generated from our highly engineered variant of Escherichia coli, or E.coli bacteria, and has been optimized to make an extract that produces complex mammalian proteins. These cells are grown over the course of several days, harvested, broken apart, clarified, and stored as a cell mass for future production of our protein therapeutics. We refer to this proprietary cell mass as extract, or XtractCF®. The extract includes necessary components for energy production, transcription and translation, and can be used to support cell-free protein synthesis. This extract can then be used agnostically to manufacture a wide variety of therapeutic proteins and protein fragments without the need to generate further cell lines.\n\nAs a result, protein synthesis then becomes a predictable and reproducible biochemical reaction, independent of the constraints of a cell. A specific DNA sequence is added to the extract, which results in the coding and expression of the desired protein in less than 24 hours. Using this process, we express hundreds or thousands of DNA sequences simultaneously within the same cell-free extract system and therefore can make and purify hundreds or thousands of unique proteins at the same time. This allows us to perform rapid expression, testing and characterization of many variants early in discovery to elucidate structure-activity relationships. Structure-activity relationship refers to how changes to the structure of a protein can lead to improvements in a molecule’s properties, such as binding, internalization, functional activity and stability, which are properties that are key to the therapeutic protein’s efficacy and tolerability in the patient. We are thereby able to optimize many properties with high specificity, including: binding efficiency to each antigen target, spatial orientation, linker design, target killing efficiency, immunological activity, protein expression, and folding efficiency and stability.\n\nAdvantages of Our XpressCF® Platform\n\nWe believe the advantages of our cell-free-based protein synthesis technology platform include:\n\n•\n\nAbility to Rapidly Produce and Evaluate a Wide Variety of Protein Structures In-house. By decoupling the production of the cell-free extract from the production of the protein, we are able to stockpile large quantities of cell-free extract from which we are able to manufacture a wide variety of proteins without the need to generate individual cell lines, including cytokine-based immuno-oncology therapeutics, ADCs, iADCs and bispecific antibodies. Additionally, our dual conjugation ADC2 technology could enable “mixed \n\n12  \n---  \n  \npayload” ADCs that combine two distinct small molecules with different pharmacologies onto a single antibody.\n\n•\n\nAbility to Incorporate Non-Natural Amino Acids. Our technology allows for efficient incorporation of a non-natural amino acid in any location in an antibody or protein with high precision and fidelity, which we believe allows for the design of optimized protein conjugates. Further, our non-natural amino acid conjugation technology permits complete and rapid stable linkage between our linker components and the non-natural amino acid, resulting in a single species without loss of efficiency as the conjugates become increasingly complex.\n\n•\n\nAbsence of Fc-gamma Receptor Binding. Antibodies produced using the XpressCF® platform have not been shown to bind the Fc-gamma receptor, and therefore are not subject to Fc-gamma mediated uptake by alveolar macrophages, which we believe results in reduced nonspecific payload release in the lung, reducing the potential for ILD.\n\n•\n\nFaster Cycle Time. Our ability to produce thousands of protein variants in parallel overnight allows us to rapidly express, test and characterize many variants early in discovery to elucidate structure-activity relationships and identify opportunities for superior therapeutic profiles, as well as new intellectual property. We are therefore able to efficiently optimize many properties with high specificity in parallel. \n\n•\n\nEfficient Drug Discovery and Early Pharmacology and Safety Assessment. Our cell-free technology creates the opportunity for accelerated pharmacology and safety assessments during the design and discovery phase of product development. This approach allows us to generate optimized proteins early in our discovery process, which can be transitioned seamlessly to clinical scale production using the same cell-free process. \n\n•\n\nRapid and Predictable Scalability. Our cell-free extract does not need to be modified in any manner as we scale from research to preclinical to clinical to commercial production. This enables us to move more rapidly to the clinic by eliminating master cell banking activities and significantly de-risks scale-up to manufacturing. \n\nOur XpressCF® Solution for ADCs, iADCs, Bispecific ADCs, and ADC2 Therapeutics\n\nWe believe our technology enables new approaches to ADCs, iADCs, bispecific ADCs, and ADC2 drug discovery, development and manufacturing. Key attributes are:\n\n•\n\nHomogeneous Design. Our XpressCF+® platform enables precise and specific placement of non-natural amino acids in defined numbers and positions within our engineered proteins. These non-natural amino acids then serve as highly stable attachment sites, also known as conjugation sites, for chemical functional groups. For example, we attach linker-warheads to non-natural amino acids within our antibodies to create single-species, tumor-killing ADCs. Similarly, we can attach polyethylene glycol polymers onto non-natural amino acids within our cytokine-based therapeutics to create single-species immunotherapies designed for extended pharmacokinetics and safety. \n\n•\n\nExperimentally Defined Structure-Activity Relationships. Our cell-free technology enables rational design of protein therapeutics through a rapid, reiterative process that experimentally defines structure-activity relationship for cytokine-based therapeutics, ADCs, iADCs, bispecific ADCs and ADC2s. This approach allows us to explore a wide variety of structural features and formats in parallel as we optimize therapeutic candidates. For example, the precise location of chemical conjugation sites directly affects the activity of both ADCs and cytokine-based therapeutics. Our proprietary technology is key to our ability to define the best number and positions of non-natural amino acids for conjugation based on: conjugation efficiency; functional activity/pharmacological properties; and pharmacokinetics and safety. This design flexibility is also an important aspect of our discovery approach to other protein therapeutics. For example, we are able to make and directly compare a variety of pairings and structural formats for our ADC molecules to ensure that we have optimized sites of conjugation, the number of payloads on each antibody (drug-antibody ratio, or DAR) and linker chemistry. We have examples where changing just one of these parameters can significantly impact the safety, efficacy and stability of the ADC. Further, we have \n\n13  \n---  \n  \ndemonstrated the ability to introduce more than eight non-natural amino acids into a single antibody structure, without impacting the expression levels of engineered antibodies, permitting ADCs with a DAR of greater than eight. Most conventional conjugation methods are limited by a DAR of eight, due to the availability of only eight interchain cysteines, which are used for conjugation with conventional methods. In addition, our XpressCF+® platform enables integration of two different types of non-natural amino acid, which can be used to precisely conjugate two different payloads to the same antibody, and allows us to engineer additional pharmacological properties, including iADCs and ADC2 therapeutics.\n\n•\n\nEfficient Transition from Research Scale to Development Scale Protein Production. Protein therapeutics can encounter obstacles, or even fail, during the transition from research cell lines to cGMP cell lines appropriate for clinical development and commercialization. Our XpressCF® platform can rapidly produce different protein types from a single proprietary extract, which can be scaled for discovery, development and ultimately, we believe, commercialization of cytokine-based immuno-oncology therapeutics, ADCs, iADCs, bispecific ADCs and ADC2s.\n\n•\n\nManufacturable Dual Conjugations. Our XpressCF+® platform allows us to manufacture antibodies that contain two different non-natural amino acids that are substrates for mutually orthogonal site-specific conjugation reactions. This advantage permits dual conjugation, resulting in homogenous iADC or ADC2 dual conjugate molecules with two different precisely placed payloads. \n\nAccordingly, we use our XpressCF® platform to discover and develop cancer therapeutics by empirically determining the optimum structure-activity relationships for cytokine-based immuno-oncology therapeutics, ADCs, iADCs, bispecific ADCs and ADC2s and transitioning those products to cGMP compliant manufacturing.\n\nOur Collaborations Validate Our Technology\n\nOur XpressCF® platform has garnered the attention of leading pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies and resulted in collaborations to discover and develop novel therapeutics. We have leveraged these strategic partnerships to extend our own capabilities and broaden the scope of our XpressCF® platform. Through December 31, 2023, all of our collaborations have provided us with an aggregate of approximately $854 million in payments, which includes approximately $54 million in investments in our stock. Our currently active collaborations include:\n\n•\n\nMerck Program. We have granted Merck the right to develop MK-1484, a selective IL-2 agonist in clinical studies as a monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab for the treatment of solid tumors. \n\n•\n\nAstellas Collaboration. The collaboration and license agreement with Astellas covers the discovery and development of immunostimulatory antibody-drug conjugates for up to three biological targets.\n\n•\n\nVaxcyte Relationship. We have granted Vaxcyte the right to discover and develop vaccines for the prophylaxis and treatment of infectious diseases. Vaxcyte’s most advanced product candidates are VAX-31 and VAX-24, 31-valent and 24-valent, respectively, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine candidates under investigation for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease in adults and adults and infants, respectively. Further, in the fourth quarter of 2023, Vaxcyte exercised an option to obtain development and manufacturing rights for XtractCF® providing Vaxcyte the right to make and source our cell-free extract for research, development, and manufacture of vaccines for the prophylaxis and treatment of infectious disease. \n\n•\n\nTasly Relationship. We have granted Tasly an exclusive license to the right to develop and commercialize STRO-002 in Greater China.\n\n14  \n---  \n  \n•\n\nOur Pipeline of Product Candidates and Discovery/Preclinical Programs\n\nOur current product candidates and Discovery and Preclinical stage programs, all based on our proprietary XpressCF® platform, are summarized in the chart below:\n\n![img141552205_3.jpg](img141552205_3.jpg)\n\n15  \n---  \n  \nOur Product Candidates\n\nLuveltamab tazevibulin (luvelta), an ADC Directed Against the Target Folate Receptor-Alpha (FolRα)\n\nOverview\n\nWe are developing luveltamab tazevibulin, or luvelta, an optimally designed ADC directed against the cancer target FolRα, initially focused on ovarian and endometrial cancers. Luvelta was designed and optimized for an improved therapeutic index by placing a precise number of linker-warheads at four specific locations within the antibody using our proprietary XpressCF+® platform. We initiated a Phase 2/3 trial to assess the efficacy of luvelta for the treatment of platinum resistant ovarian cancer, the REFRAME-O1 study, in June 2023.\n\nPhase 1 trial enrollment, focused on ovarian and endometrial cancers, began in March 2019. We reported a near-final dataset in January 2024. Based on such reported data, luvelta exhibited a manageable safety profile and promising preliminary efficacy data. Both the dose-escalation and the dose-expansion portions of the Phase 1 trial were fully enrolled for assessment of the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of luvelta at dose levels of 4.3 and 5.2 mg/kg. Additionally, a combination cohort in ovarian cancer, assessing the combination of luvelta with bevacizumab, opened for enrollment in December 2021, and an expansion cohort for FolRa-selected endometrial cancer opened and began enrolling patients in the fourth quarter of 2021. Interim results from the endometrial cohort demonstrated encouraging preliminary anti-tumor activity in FolRα-selected patients, defined by a tumor proportion score, or TPS, of >25% FolRα expression, with a safety profile that was consistent with prior data in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, and were presented at the 2023 European Society for Medical Oncology, or ESMO, Congress in October 2023. An expansion cohort assessing the effects of administration of prophylactic pegfilgrastim in combination with luvelta opened for enrollment in the second quarter of 2022; interim results from this cohort were also presented in January 2023. Interim results from the combination study of luvelta with bevacizumab for treatment of ovarian cancer and updated results from the cohort assessing the combination of luvelta with pegfilgrastim were presented in January 2024. In August 2021, we were granted Fast Track designation for luvelta by the FDA for the treatment of patients with platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, who have received one to three prior lines of systemic therapy. In December 2021, we entered into a collaboration and exclusive license agreement with Tasly to develop and commercialize luvelta in Greater China.\n\nLuvelta has been provided through compassionate use to pediatric patients with relapsed/refractory CBF/GLIS AML, which data were presented at ASH 2022 and ASH 2023. The data showed that luvelta was well tolerated as a monotherapy agent and in combination with standard cancer therapies. In December 2022, luvelta was granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA for this pediatric indication.\n\nOvarian Cancer Overview\n\nOvarian cancer is the most common cause of cancer death from gynecologic tumors in the United States, and the fifth most common cause of cancer death in women. In the United States alone, the American Cancer Society estimates that 19,680 new cases of ovarian cancer would be diagnosed in 2024, and approximately 12,740 women would die of this disease. Given that early stages of the disease cause minimal, nonspecific symptoms or are asymptomatic, approximately 75% of patients with ovarian cancer are diagnosed as stage III and IV, for which the prognosis is poor. Standard pre- or post-operative chemotherapy for ovarian cancer is combination therapy with a platinum compound and a taxane, for example, carboplatin and paclitaxel, with or without bevacizumab which achieves a complete or partial response in between 70% to 80% of patients. Increasingly, PARP inhibitors are being used in the maintenance setting. Patients who are refractory or resistant to platinum-based treatments are then treated with a host of additional palliative chemotherapeutic agents, each showing only marginal benefitwith response rates to single agent chemotherapy of 10-12% and progression free survival of 3-4 months. This represents a significant unmet need.\n\n16  \n---  \n  \nEndometrial Cancer Overview\n\nThere is also a significant unmet need in the treatment of recurrent or metastatic endometrial cancer. In the United States alone, the American Cancer Society estimated 67,800 new cases of endometrial cancer, which is cancer of the uterus, in 2024, and that approximately 13,250 women would die of this disease. First-line treatment for stage III/IV disease is commonly paclitaxel/carboplatin. Recently, the combination of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab was approved for the treatment of patients with advanced, metastatic endometrial cancer who have disease progression following prior systemic therapy with a platinum doublet. With the lack of available therapies for patients who progress after standard of care therapies, long-term survival prospects are poor and novel treatments offering even a modest improvement in progression-free survival or overall survival, or OS, may be considered for expedited regulatory approval.\n\nPediatric AML CBFA2T3-GLIS2 (CBF/GLIS) Phenotype Overview\n\nThere remains a significant unmet need in the treatment of CBF/GLIS AML in pediatric patients. The CBF/GLIS subtype of AML is a rare, aggressive form of AML that typically affects pediatric patients with a median age of 1.5 years. The prevalence of CBF/GLIS AML is 1%-3% in childhood AML, and in recent studies the incidence was determined to be 1.3%-1.8% of pediatric AML patients. The prognosis for this disease is grim, with a 5-year OS of 15-30%. The first-line treatment for this disease is chemotherapy with a goal of reducing disease burden to the point that the patient can receive a bone marrow transplant. While a bone marrow transplant is intended to be curative, most patients eventually relapse with poor treatment outcomes. Patients who are refractory to primary chemotherapy or who relapse following bone marrow transplant have no additional treatment options and also have poor treatment outcomes. Given the lack of treatment options for these patients, a novel treatment that offers an opportunity for these patients to become eligible for bone marrow transplantation may be considered for expedited regulatory review.\n\nOur Solution, luveltamab tazevibulin (luvelta)\n\nLuvelta targets FolRα, a surface protein with limited expression on normal tissue and overexpressed in multiple cancers, including ovarian cancer, which makes FolRα a promising ADC approach.\n\nLuvelta employs a cleavable linker that releases a cytotoxic drug inside tumor cells, while being stable and resistant to cleavage in general circulation. The cytotoxic drug used in luvelta is our proprietary hemiasterlin moiety. From a safety perspective, we designed luvelta to have what we believe to be the optimal potency-to-safety ratio. We therefore rationally selected a homogenous ADC with an optimized DAR of four.\n\nBased on preclinical findings, we believe our efficient homogeneous design of luvelta could provide anti-tumor activity, stability, and safety with the potential to minimize off-target damage and improve clinical benefit. We believe an improved therapeutic index could differentiate luvelta from conventional technology for the treatment of ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer. To test this, we have created a benchmark FolRα-targeting surrogate molecule based on conventional technology that has a heterogeneous ADC, with a similar DAR, utilizing a DM4 linker-warhead. We have tested this benchmark molecule against luvelta in multiple preclinical models. However, additional preclinical and clinical testing will be needed to determine the safety and efficacy of luvelta and to obtain regulatory approval, if ever obtained.\n\nClinical Development Plan\n\nOur first Phase 1 trial for luvelta was an open-label study evaluating luvelta as a monotherapy for patients with ovarian and endometrial cancers. This trial was being conducted in two-parts, dose escalation and dose expansion. We began enrolling ovarian cancer patients in March 2019, with updated data for the completed dose escalation cohort reported in December 2020 and May 2021. The primary objectives of the clinical trial are to determine the safety and tolerability profile, to define the recommended Phase 2 dose level and interval, and to evaluate preliminary anti-tumor activity. Our secondary objectives are to characterize human pharmacokinetics and additional safety, tolerability, and efficacy measures.\n\n17  \n---  \n  \nWe initially enrolled adult patients with advanced and/or refractory ovarian cancer, for whom no suitable treatment exists. These patients are considered to have incurable disease and need repeated courses of life-prolonging and palliative treatment. The initial Phase 1 trial enrolled ovarian cancer patients regardless of their FolRα expression levels. These ovarian cancer patients were enrolled in a dose escalation cohort, with luvelta administered on day one of a 21-day cycle. Since anti-tumor activity was observed during the fully enrolled dose escalation portion of the Phase 1 trial, we initiated enrollment of patients in the dose expansion portion of this clinical study in January 2021 and are treating less heavily pre-treated ovarian cancer patients. The dose expansion portion of this Phase 1 study of luvelta has been completed.\n\nIn May 2021, we announced data from the dose-escalation portion of our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of STRO-002 in patients with ovarian cancer. The dose-escalation portion of the trial was fully enrolled with 39 patients in August 2020. Patients were heavily pre-treated and had a median of six prior lines of therapy, including standard of care platinum-based regimens, bevacizumab, PARP inhibitors, and checkpoint inhibitors.\n\nThe dose-escalation portion of the Phase 1 trial included 34 patients treated with clinically active dose levels, 2.9 mg/kg or higher, of which 31 patients had post-baseline scans and were evaluable for RECIST response. At the data cutoff of April 23, 2021, results out of 31 evaluable patients included:\n\n•\n\n10 patients (32%) met RECIST criteria for response, of which, one patient achieved a complete response, or CR, and nine patients achieved a partial response (four confirmed partial responses and five unconfirmed partial responses).\n\n•\n\nFor the five confirmed responders (1 CR and 4 confirmed partial responses), the median duration of response, or DOR, was 5.8 months (95% CI: 2.0, not evaluable).\n\n•\n\nMedian study follow-up was 8.4 months and median progression-free survival (PFS) was 7.2 months (95% CI: 4.5, 10.8).\n\n•\n\n86% of treatment-emergent adverse events, or TEAEs, were Grade 1 or 2. The most common Grade 3 and 4 AEs were neutropenia (64%), arthralgia (13%), fatigue (10%), neuropathy (8%), and abdominal pain (8%), all of which were managed with standard medical treatment, dose reductions, or dose delays.\n\n•\n\nDose limiting toxicities, or DLTs, were observed at higher dose levels in two patients – at 6.0 mg/kg (Grade 2 neuropathy/Grade 3 arthralgia) and at 6.4 mg/kg (Grade 3 bone pain).\n\nBased on the above results, we identified dose levels of 4.3 and 5.2 mg/kg to study in the dose-expansion portion of the Phase 1 trial. For the dose-expansion portion, we dosed the first patient in January 2021 and treated less heavily pre-treated ovarian cancer patients. We reported near-final data in January 2024. We also initiated an exploratory dose expansion cohort of 15 patients to assess the safety of treatment with luvelta at 5.2 mg/kg in combination with prophylactic pegfilgrastim, and interim results from this cohort were also presented in January 2023 and January 2024.\n\nThe dose-expansion cohort for ovarian cancer fully enrolled 44 patients, who had experienced up to three prior lines of therapy and were randomized into dose levels starting at 4.3 mg/kg (N=23) and 5.2 mg/kg (n=21). 81% of the patients were platinum-resistant, and 66% and 82% of the patients had been treated previously with bevacizumab and PARP inhibitors, respectively.\n\nThe patients were also assessed for FolRα expression levels, which were calculated using TPS correlated with higher response rates. We have identified TPS as a potentially appropriate scoring algorithm for luvelta with respect to the biomarker enrichment strategy. Of the 44 patients in this cohort, 9 had a TPS score of less than or equal to 25%, while 35 had a TPS score of greater than 25%. Of these 35 patients, as of the data cutoff date of November 8, 2022, 32 had at least one post-baseline scan, and therefore were evaluable for RECIST v1.1 responses.\n\n18  \n---  \n  \nThe results demonstrated that luvelta provided substantial clinical benefit in FolRα-selected patients, defined by TPS of >25%, with a 37.5% overall response rate (ORR), median DOR of 5.5 months, and median PFS of 6.1 months, regardless of starting dose. Results also demonstrated the higher starting dose of 5.2 mg/kg provided greater patient benefit compared to the lower starting dose of 4.3mg/kg. FolRα-selected patients account for approximately 80% of the patient population in advanced ovarian cancer, as represented in the patient stratification in the Phase 1 study.\n\nIn particular:\n\n•\n\nPatients who were FolRα-selected, defined by TPS >25%, regardless of starting dose, demonstrated an ORR of 37.5% (n=32) with a median DOR of 5.5 months (n=12) and a median PFS of 6.1 months (n=35).\n\n•\n\nEstimated targeted luvelta patient population is approximately 80% of advanced ovarian cancer patients based on pooled Phase 1 biomarker data.\n\n•\n\nLuvelta demonstrated a FolRα-dependent response, with patients who were unselected for FolRα (TPS ≤25%) demonstrating an 11.1% ORR (n=9) with a median DOR of 2.9 months (n=1) and a median PFS of 3.8 months (n=9).\n\n•\n\nFolRα-selected patients given the 4.3 mg/kg dose of luvelta demonstrated an ORR of 31.3% (n=16), a median DOR of 13 months (n=5) and a median PFS of 6.1 months (n=19). \n\n•\n\nLuvelta, when given to FolRα-selected patients at a starting dose of 5.2 mg/kg, provided greater patient benefit than a starting dose of 4.3 mg/kg, with the 5.2 mg/kg dose of luvelta demonstrating an ORR of 43.8% (n=16), a median DOR of 5.4 months (n=7) and a median PFS of 6.6 months (n=16). \n\nSafety signals from the 44 patients at the 5.2 mg/kg and 4.3 mg/kg starting dose levels, were consistent with data from the dose-escalation cohort, including:\n\n•\n\nNo qualitatively new safety signals were observed in the dose-expansion cohort, including the absence of meaningful ocular or lung toxicity signals or complications.\n\n•\n\nNeutropenia was the leading TEAE that resulted in a treatment delay or a dose reduction. The majority of the cases of neutropenia were generally asymptomatic and resolved with a one-week dose delay or, in other cases, with standard medical treatment, including the use of G-CSF.\n\n•\n\nArthralgia was the second most common Grade 3 or higher, or Grade 3+, TEAE and second most common TEAE leading to dose reduction.\n\n•\n\nThere were limited observed cases of febrile neutropenia, including one Grade 5 event at the 5.2 mg/kg starting dose level and one Grade 3 event at the 4.3 mg/kg starting dose level. The trial protocol was subsequently updated to require dose reduction for Grade 4 neutropenia.\n\nIn 2022 we initiated an exploratory cohort, or cohort C, of 15 patients to assess the safety of treatment with luvelta at 5.2 mg/kg in combination with prophylactic pegfilgrastim and presented preliminary data from 10 patients from this cohort in January 2023. In January 2024, we announced updated data from this cohort based on 16 patients. In particular:\n\n•\n\nGrade 3+ neutropenia was reduced from 66.7% to 6.3%, resulting in a 90.6% decrease in Grade 3+ neutropenia rates at the first cycle of luvelta (p=0.0002); Grade 3 neutropenia was reduced from 71.4% to 18.8%, resulting in a 73.7% decrease in Grade 3+ neutropenia rates at the first and second cycle (p=0015)\n\n•\n\nOverall Grade 3+ neutropenia was reduced from 76.2% to 37.5%.\n\n19  \n---  \n  \nIn January 2024, we presented an aggregated data set from of our Phase I trials of luvelta. This data set included data from all ovarian cancer patients treated with luvelta as a monotherapy in Phase 1 studies, regardless of FolRα expression levels, dose level of luvelta, or platinum sensitivity or resistance, corresponding to a total of 99 patients, of which 92 were RECIST-evaluable, with 21% platinum sensitive patients and 78% platinum refractory patients. Patients received a median of three prior lines of therapy. There were 72% of the patients that had experienced prior bevacizumab therapy and 70% had been treated with a PARP inhibitor. These patients were not selected for FolRα expression levels and were treated at starting dose levels ≤2.9 mg/kg, 4.3 mg/kg, 5.2 mg/kg or ≥5.6 mg/kg.\n\nThe safety profile of luvelta from these aggregated data was shown to be manageable, with a low rate of discontinuation of treatment resulting from neutropenia. The predominant TEAE, was neutropenia, encompassing neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and decreased neutrophil count, with 69.7% patients reporting any grade neutropenia and 64.6% patients reporting Grade 3 or higher neutropenia. Neuropathy and arthralgia were the other most commonly reported significant TEAEs, with 57.6% and 16% of patients reporting any grade and Grade 3 or higher arthralgia, respectively, and 44% and 7% patients reporting any grade and Grade 3 or higher neuropathy, respectively. The observed neutropenia was primarily uncomplicated, with less than 5% incidence of febrile neutropenia. Neutropenia and arthralgia each led to discontinuation of treatment in 1.5% of patients. Neuropathy led to discontinuation of treatment in 2.9% of patients. There were six patients that experienced grade 5 safety events on study, with one such event assessed as probably luvelta related and the remainder assessed as unrelated to luvelta.\n\nWe also presented a subset of the aggregated data from our Phase 1 trials of luvelta for which 43 patients with platinum resistant ovarian cancer selected for FolRα TPS ≥25%, or tumors with ≥25% of the tumor cells expressing FolRα at any level of staining intensity, were treated with 4.3 mg/kg or 5.2 mg/kg doses of luvelta, corresponding to all patients treated in phase 1 studies that would be eligible for enrollment in the REFRαME-O1 registrational study. The ORR observed for this subset population was 28%, with a DOR of 5.7 months and PFS of 5.8 months.\n\nBased on the data from our Phase 1 program, we selected FolRα expression TPS ≥25% as the target eligibility cutoff or threshold for further study in clinical development of luvelta. We estimate that approximately 80% of the platinum resistant ovarian cancer patients would be eligible for luvelta treatment based on this TPS ≥25% threshold for FolRα expression.\n\nAdditionally, we opened for enrollment a Phase 1 trial to assess the combination of STRO-002 and bevacizumab for treatment of ovarian cancer in December 2021 and presented initial preliminary results of this study in January 2024. Safety signals from this study were generally consistent with those previously reported and the combination treatment with luvelta and bevacizumab demonstrated clinical activity in treated patients regardless of their FolRα expression status.\n\nWe also began enrolling patients in an expansion cohort for FolRα-selected endometrial cancer in the fourth quarter of 2021 and presented initial preliminary results from the study at the 2023 ESMO Congress in October 2023. In this trial, luvelta showed encouraging preliminary anti-tumor activity in FolRα-selected patients, defined by a TPS of >25% FolRα expression, and the safety profile was consistent with prior data in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. We expect to present updated results from the bevacizumab combination study in 2024. Further, we plan to submit an IND for the treatment of NSCLC with luvelta in the first half of 2024.\n\n20  \n---  \n  \nIn addition to the Phase 1 studies discussed above, we initiated a Phase 2/3 study, the REFRαME-O1 study, of luvelta for the treatment of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer in June 2023. This study comprises two parts; in Part 1, we anticipate enrolling 50 patients randomized 1:1 to two different doses of luvelta, either 4.3 mg/kg or 5.2 mg/kg plus prophylactic pegfilgrastim for two cycles, followed by a reduction to 4.3 mg/kg. After proceeding to Part 2 of the study, the non-optimized dose of luvelta will be dropped and approximately 516 patients will be randomized 1:1 to the selected luvelta dose or investigators’ choice of chemotherapy. The protocol will include an optional interim analysis for ORR and DOR to support a potential application for accelerated approval, and the endpoints that will be assessed for a potential full approval are PFS and OS. The REFRαME-O1 study patient population includes those with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, one to three lines of prior treatment and tumors that express FolRα at TPS ≥25%, and excludes primary platinum refractory patients and those with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status, or ECOG PS, of 0-1. We announced the initiation of Part 1 of the REFRαME-O1 study in June 2023 and the study is ongoing. We anticipate that Part 1 will be fully enrolled in the first half of 2024.\n\nWe are also seeking to develop luvelta for the treatment of CBF/GLIS AML in pediatric patients. Initial access to luvelta in this indication has been provided through compassionate use. Initial data on the anti-leukemic activity of luvelta in 17 pediatric patients with relapsed/refractory CBF/GLIS AML was presented at ASH 2022 and updated at ASH 2023, including data from eight additional patients.\n\nThe ASH 2023 presentation included results from 25 pediatric patients with relapsed/refractory CBF/GLIS subtype AML treated with luvelta at doses up to 4.3 or 5.2mg/kg every two to four weeks for a DOR of 15.9 weeks (3-73.1), with 68% of patients receiving at least five doses. Luvelta was well-tolerated as a monotherapy agent and in combination with standard of care therapies. Of the 25 treated patients, 19 had ≥5% blasts, consideredmorphologic disease, or MD, and 8 had <5% blasts, considered sub-morphologic disease, or SMD. Collective results show that treatment with luvelta produced clinically meaningful and durable responses across a broad range of patients in various settings, including in patients with or without prior stem cell transplant and in monotherapy or in combination with cytotoxic therapy. A complete remission, or CR, or complete remission with partial hematologic recovery, or CRh, was observed in 8 out of 19 (42%) patients with ≥5% blasts treated with luvelta, with 5 out of 8 CR/CRh patients reaching a minimal residual disease, or MRD,-negative CR (63%). Six out of eight patients with <5% blasts experienced an MRD-negative CR (75%).\n\nIn the next phase of luvelta development for the treatment of CBF/GLIS AML in pediatric patients, we expect to initiate enrollment in a registration-enabling trial, REFRαME-P1, in the second half of 2024. In the first part of the study, patients will be randomized between two doses of luvelta, 3.5 mg/kg and 4.3 mg/kg, to identify an optimized dose. Following selection of the optimized dose, we plan to test the optimized dose in approximately 18 patients with relapsed/refractory CBFA2T3::GLIS2 AML having ≥5% bone marrow involvement with leukemic blasts. Key endpoints are planned to be CR rate, MRD-negative response rate, event-free survival, or EFS, release-free survival, or RFS, OS, safety, and pharmacokinetics.\n\nSTRO-003, An ADC Directed Against ROR-1\n\nIn 2022, we nominated STRO-003 for further development. STRO-003 is a ROR1-targeting ADC for the treatment of ROR1-expressing solid tumors, including triple negative breast cancer, or TNBC, NSCLC, and ovarian cancer. STRO-003 is an anti-ROR1 human IgG1 antibody conjugated using our XpressCF+® platform technology to a cleavable DBCO-PEGylated β-glucuronidase-exatecan linker-payload, at a DAR of approximately eight. Currently, there are no therapeutics approved that specifically target ROR1, although there is one ROR1-targeting ADC, zilovertamab vedotin, or ZV, also known as MK-2140, or VLS-101, in Phase 2 testing targeting DLBCL, mantle cell lymphoma, or MCL, NSCLC, and breast cancer. Based on preclinical in vitro and in vivo data, we believe that STRO-003 has the potential for an improved therapeutic index compared to ZV. We believe these features present a unique opportunity for clinical development of STRO-003 to address unmet medical needs in hematological malignancies, ovarian cancer, TNBC and NSCLC.\n\nWe believe STRO-003 has been precisely designed and optimized to provide the potential for a best-in-class ADC targeting ROR-1. Our proprietary non-natural amino acid, which provides the substrate for conjugation to our proprietary β-glucuronidase cleavable exatecan linker warhead, have been placed at what we believe are the optimal sites in the amino acid sequence of our high affinity anti-ROR1 antibody, resulting in enhanced performance and stability in preclinical in vitro and in vivo models. These models also suggest that our β-glucuronidase cleavable linkers may provide greater tumor specificity and enhanced tolerability relative to a\n\n21  \n---  \n  \nprotease-cleavable linker delivering an exatecan payload. In particular, in a non-human primate safety study, we did not observe neutropenia, ocular toxicity signals or lung toxicity signals even in the highest dose cohort for STRO-003. Finally, our preclinical testing has shown that the exatecan payload delivered by STRO-003 elicits potent tumor cell killing, bystander activity and immunogenic cell death, which we believe may provide meaningful clinical benefit to patients.\n\nSTRO-003 Business Opportunity\n\nWe believe ROR1 is a favorable target for an ADC due to its limited normal tissue expression, as well as its prevalence in solid tumors and B cell malignancies, including CLL, DLBCL, MCL, TNBC, NSCLC, and ovarian cancer. Its expression is correlated with poor prognosis in different cancers. Currently, there are no approved therapeutics that specifically target ROR1, but it is a target of increasing interest with several clinical-stage ADCs in development, including ZV (Phase 2), NBE-002 (Phase 1), and CS5001 (Phase 1).\n\nSTRO-004, An ADC Directed Against Tissue Factor\n\nWe have recently nominated STRO-004 for further development. STRO-004 is a TF-targeting ADC for the treatment of TF-expressing solid tumors, potentially including cervical, lung and breast cancer. STRO-004 is an anti-TF human IgG1 antibody conjugated using our XpressCF+® platform technology to a cleavable DBCO-PEGylated β-glucuronidase-exatecan linker-payload, at a DAR of approximately four. There is an approved ADC targeting TF, TIVDAK®, developed by Seattle Genetics and GenMab A/S, which is approved for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer. In preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies benchmarking STRO-004 against a TIVDAK® surrogate molecule, we observed comparable antitumor activity but achieved 5- to 10-fold higher dose levels in nonhuman primate safety studies for STRO-004.Therefore, we believe that STRO-004 has the potential for an improved clinical therapeutic index over existing standard of care. We believe these features present a unique opportunity for clinical development of STRO-004 to address unmet medical needs in cervical, lung and breast cancer patients.\n\nWe believe STRO-004 has been precisely designed and optimized to provide the potential for a best-in-class ADC targeting TF. Our proprietary non-natural amino acid, which provides the substrate for conjugation to our proprietary β-glucuronidase cleavable exatecan linker warhead, have been placed at what we believe are the optimal sites in the amino acid sequence of our high affinity anti-TF antibody, resulting in enhanced performance and stability in preclinical in vitro and in vivo models. These models also suggest that our β-glucuronidase cleavable linkers may provide greater tumor specificity and enhanced tolerability relative to a protease-cleavable linker delivering an exatecan payload. In particular, in a non-human primate safety study, we did not observe neutropenia, ocular toxicity signals or lung toxicity, or ILD, signals, even in the highest dose cohort for STRO-004. Finally, our preclinical testing has shown that the exatecan payload delivered by STRO-004 elicits potent tumor cell killing, bystander activity and immunogenic cell death, which we believe may provide meaningful clinical benefit to patients.\n\nSTRO-004 Business Opportunity\n\nWe believe TF is a favorable target for an ADC due to its limited normal tissue expression, as well as its prevalence in solid tumors, including cervical cancer. Its expression is correlated with poor prognosis in different cancers.\n\n22  \n---  \n  \nAdditional Discovery Efforts\n\nWe are also actively researching to identify new ADCs to add to our pipeline. We have multiple ADC discovery programs ongoing using our XpressCF+® platform. Our protein engineering and chemistry efforts are focused on maximizing therapeutic indices, and our technology allows us to rapidly test our therapeutic hypotheses in significantly more product candidates than conventional protein synthesis allows in order to identify the best molecule to advance to the clinic. We have also expanded our ADC technology platform to include iADCs. Our XpressCF+® platform has enabled a groundbreaking technology to engineer homogeneous, dually conjugated immunostimulant and cytotoxic warheads on a single ADC molecule. Our novel iADC design is intended to deliver two different drugs directly to the tumor, to not only kill tumor cells but also locally prime an immune response to the patient’s particular tumor cells. We believe that our iADC approach creates a new therapeutic opportunity by combining the best features of an ADC with the biology of a personalized vaccine.\n\nIn addition, development of our XpressCF+® platform to enable homogenous, dually-conjugated iADCs also enables us to discover, develop and manufacture ADC2 molecules. In these ADC2 molecules, two different linker-warheads are precisely conjugated at specific positions to deliver two different small molecule payloads to a single cancer cell. We are actively investigating different combinations of payloads to identify synergistic pairings with differentiated toxicity profiles. We believe such ADC2 molecules have the potential to provide the next generation of highly potent cancer therapeutics with acceptable safety and tolerability.\n\nOur bispecific antibody drug discovery programs are focused on bispecific ADCs. We believe such compounds can provide improved specificity for tumors and could potentially spare healthy tissues expressing one, but not both, of the antigens targeted by the bispecific ADC.\n\nOur technology allows us to rapidly incorporate non-natural amino acids in varying numbers and positions, to identify the best cytokine modification for pharmacological activity, pharmacokinetics, and safety. Furthermore, our technology enables rapid preclinical development and transition to cGMP manufacturing, ensuring speed to clinic in a promising field. Our drug discovery teams are exploring novel immuno-oncology therapies, including cytokine-based therapies.\n\nCollaboration and License Agreements\n\nMerck Collaboration\n\nIn July 2018, we entered into an Exclusive Patent License and Research Collaboration Agreement (the “2018 Merck Agreement”) with Merck to jointly develop up to three research programs focusing on cytokine derivatives for cancer and autoimmune disorders.\n\nUnder the 2018 Merck Agreement, we received from Merck a non-refundable, non-creditable, upfront payment of $60.0 million in August 2018 for access to our technology and the identification and preclinical research and development of two target programs, with an option for Merck to engage us to continue these activities for a third program upon the payment of an additional amount. The option to expand activities to a third program expired in January 2021. In December 2021, Merck did not extend the research term for the second research program of the collaboration and that research program reverted to us. The first program of the collaboration is focused on MK-1484, a distinct cytokine derivative molecule for the treatment of cancer. In July 2022, the first patient was dosed with MK-1484 in a Phase 1 study.\n\nWe are eligible to receive aggregate contingent payments of up to approximately $500 million for the target program selected by Merck, assuming the development and sale of the related therapeutic candidate and all possible indications identified under the collaboration. If one or more products from the target program is developed for non-oncology or a single indication, we will be eligible for reduced aggregate milestone payments. In addition, we are eligible to receive tiered royalties ranging from mid-single digit to low teen percentages on the worldwide sales of any commercial products that may result from the collaboration.\n\nMerck may terminate the 2018 Merck Agreement at any time with 60 days’ prior written notice. Either we or Merck has the right to terminate the 2018 Merck Agreement based on the other party’s uncured material breach or bankruptcy.\n\n23  \n---  \n  \nAstellas Agreement\n\nIn June 2022, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Astellas, or the Astellas Agreement, for the development of immunostimulatory antibody-drug conjugates for up to three biological targets, to be identified by Astellas. We will conduct research and pre-clinical development of any compound (as designated by Astellas) in each of the three programs in accordance with the terms of a research plan between us and Astellas. Astellas will have an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize any such designated compound, subject to our rights to participate in cost and profit sharing in the United States, as described below.\n\nPursuant to the Astellas Agreement, we received from Astellas a one-time, nonrefundable, non-creditable, upfront payment of $90.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\nWe are also eligible to receive up to $422.5 million in development, regulatory and commercial milestones for each product candidate, and tiered royalties ranging from low double-digit to mid-teen percentages on worldwide sales of any commercial products that may result from the collaboration, subject to customary deductions under certain circumstances. We can also elect to convert any product candidate into a cost and profit-sharing arrangement, for the United States only. In the event we make such election, we will share commercialization costs and profits relating to such product candidate equally with Astellas in the United States, and no royalties will be due from Astellas for net sales of such product candidates in the United States.\n\nThe Astellas Agreement contains customary provisions for termination, including by Astellas for convenience upon 30 days’ written notice and by either party for cause, including for material breach (subject to cure). We have certain reversion rights as to product candidates in connection with certain termination events.\n\nVaxcyte (formerly known as SutroVax) Relationship\n\nIn 2013, we and Johnson & Johnson Innovation, through the Johnson & Johnson Development Corporation, provided initial co-funding for Vaxcyte, Inc., or Vaxcyte, with which we have a license agreement, a supply agreement, an option agreement and a manufacturing rights agreement related to certain development and manufacturing rights. Under the license agreement, Vaxcyte has the right to use the XpressCF® and XpressCF+®platforms to discover and develop vaccine candidates for the treatment or prophylaxis of infectious diseases. The lead programs for Vaxcyte are VAX-31 and VAX-24, its 31-valent and 24-valent, respectively, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine candidates. Vaxcyte is responsible for performing all research and development activities, and we provide technical support and supply XtractCF® and other materials to Vaxcyte.\n\nIn May 2018, we entered into a Supply Agreement with Vaxcyte, wherein Vaxcyte engaged us to supply extracts and custom reagents, as requested by Vaxcyte. The pricing is based on an agreed upon cost plus arrangement.\n\nIn December 2022, we entered into a letter agreement, or the Vaxcyte Agreement, with Vaxcyte and granted Vaxcyte an option, or the Option, to obtain development and manufacturing rights for XtractCF® that, when exercised, would grant Vaxcyte the right to make and source our cell-free extract for research, development, and manufacture of vaccines for the prophylaxis and treatment of infectious disease.\n\nPursuant to the Vaxcyte Agreement, we received a one-time, nonrefundable, non-creditable, upfront payment of $10.0 million in cash, and 167,780 shares of Vaxcyte common stock with a fair value of $7.5 million in December 2022.\n\nAdditionally, pursuant to the Vaxcyte Agreement, we and Vaxcyte agreed to negotiate the terms and conditions of a form definitive agreement to be entered into in the event Vaxcyte exercises the Option, or the Form Definitive Agreement. In September 2023, we and Vaxcyte mutually agreed upon the Form Definitive Agreement, and in October 2023, we received a $5.0 million payment from Vaxcyte.\n\nEffective immediately upon agreement to the Form Definitive Agreement, we and Vaxcyte entered into Amendment No 3., or Amendment 3, to that certain license agreement between us and Vaxcyte, dated August 1, 2014, and amended and restated on October 12, 2015, and amended again on May 9, 2018 and May 29, 2018, or the License Agreement. Amendment 3 amended certain terms of the License Agreement including with respect to (i) royalty reduction provisions applicable in the event of expiration of relevant patent claims, which would result\n\n24  \n---  \n  \nin lower royalties payable by Vaxcyte under certain circumstances, (ii) the ownership, prosecution, maintenance and enforcement of certain intellectual property rights licensed or arising under the License Agreement, and (iii) the timing and form for financial reporting of royalty payment calculations.\n\nIn November 2023, or the Exercise Date, Vaxcyte exercised the Option by submitting written notice thereof to us and concurrently paid us $50.0 million in cash as the first of two installment payments for the Option exercise price. Under the Vaxcyte Agreement, Vaxcyte is obligated to pay us an additional $25.0 million in cash within six months of the Exercise Date as the second of two installment payments for the Option exercise price. Upon the occurrence of certain regulatory milestones, Vaxcyte would be obligated to pay us certain additional milestone payments totaling up to $60.0 million in cash. In the event that Vaxcyte undergoes a change of control, certain rights and payments may be accelerated.\n\nWe hold 0.7 million shares of common stock of Vaxcyte and are eligible for four percent royalties on worldwide net sales of any vaccine candidates for human health use under the license agreement, except for royalties on sales of vaccines for prophylaxis of invasive pneumococcal disease, such as VAX-24 or VAX-31, which are owned by Blackstone, as discussed below. Also, we retain the right to discover and develop vaccines for the treatment or prophylaxis of any disease that is not caused by an infectious pathogen, including cancer.\n\nVaxcyte has the right to terminate the Vaxcyte license agreement for convenience upon prior written notice. Either party may terminate for the other party’s material uncured breach under certain circumstances.\n\nTasly Relationship\n\nIn December 2021, we entered into the Tasly License Agreement with Tasly to grant an exclusive license to develop and commercialize STRO-002 in Greater China. Tasly will pursue the clinical development, regulatory approval, and commercialization of STRO-002 in multiple indications, including ovarian cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, and other indications in Greater China. We retained development and commercial rights of STRO-002 globally outside of Greater China, including the United States.\n\nUnder the Tasly License Agreement, Tasly was obligated to make an initial payment to us of $40.0 million, with additional potential payments totaling up to $345.0 million related to development, regulatory and commercialization contingent payments and milestones. We will provide STRO-002 to Tasly under appropriate clinical and commercial supply service agreements. Upon commercialization, we will receive tiered royalties, ranging from low- to mid-teen percentages based on annual net sales of STRO-002 in Greater China for at least ten years following the first commercial sale of STRO-002 in Greater China. In February 2022, Tasly indicated that it would like to discuss and renegotiate the terms of the Tasly License Agreement.\n\nIn April 2022, we entered amendment No. 1, or the Tasly Amendment, to the Tasly License Agreement. Pursuant to the Tasly Amendment, the initial nonrefundable upfront payment due by Tasly was amended to $25.0 million, and a $15.0 million payment will become payable to us upon the achievement of certain regulatory milestones. The Tasly Amendment also added an additional regulatory milestone payment to the Tasly License Agreement, providing additional potential payments totaling up to $350.0 million related to development, regulatory and commercialization milestones, beyond the payments described above, and made certain other ministerial edits.\n\nIn June 2023, we entered into a Master Development and Clinical Supply Agreement, or the 2023 Tasly Supply Agreement, with Tasly, wherein Tasly requested us to provide development, manufacturing and supply chain management services, including clinical product supply.\n\nIn September 2023, we received a $5.0 million contingent payment from Tasly, net of withholding tax of $0.5 million, related to the first patient dosed in the REFRaME-O1 trial for luvelta. The REFRaME-O1 study consists of two parts, Part I being the dose-finding portion and Part II being the portion of the study that will focus on the selected dose from Part I, and is intended to generate data to enable the potential registration of luvelta. Although we currently intend to conduct the REFRaME-O1 study to completion, we have the sole discretion to terminate the REFRaME-O1 study at any time. As such, we have agreed with Tasly that, in the event we terminate the REFRaME-O1 study prior to dosing the first patient in Part II, we will refund Tasly the contingent payment received by us within 30 days of such study termination.\n\n25  \n---  \n  \nIn October 2023, we received a $5.0 million contingent payment from Tasly, net of withholding tax of $0.5 million, after Tasly received its first IND clearance by National Medical Products Administration, or NMPA, in Greater China.\n\nTasly has the right to terminate the Tasly License Agreement for convenience or other reasons specified in the Tasly License Agreement, upon prior written notice.\n\nBlackstone Relationship\n\nIn June 2023, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Blackstone, or the Blackstone Agreement, to sell to Blackstone a revenue interest in our 4% royalty on potential future sales of Vaxcyte’s products, including Vaxcyte’s pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, or PCV, products such as VAX-24 and its second-generation PCV product, VAX-31.\n\nUnder the Blackstone Agreement, Blackstone paid us an initial upfront payment of $140.0 million in June 2023, with potential payments totaling up to $250.0 million triggered at various return thresholds to Blackstone under the Blackstone Agreement. In addition, under the Blackstone Agreement, we agreed to certain covenants with respect to the exercise of its rights under the Vaxcyte License Agreement, including with respect to the right to amend, assign and terminate the Vaxcyte License Agreement. The Blackstone Agreement contains other customary terms and conditions, including representations and warranties, covenants and indemnification obligations in favor of each party.\n\nFollowing agreement with Vaxcyte on the Form Definitive Agreement and upon effectiveness of the Amendment, the revenue interest in the 4% royalty on potential future sales of Vaxcyte products other than Vaxcyte’s PCV products reverted to us. As such, we retain the revenue interest in royalties from Vaxcyte on sales of all products other than a PCV product, such as VAX-24 or VAX-31.\n\nBMS Collaboration\n\nIn September 2014, we signed a Collaboration and License Agreement with BMS to discover and develop bispecific antibodies and/or ADCs, focused primarily on the field of immuno-oncology, using our proprietary integrated cell-free protein synthesis platform, XpressCF®. In August 2017, we entered into an amended and restated collaboration and license agreement with BMS to refocus the collaboration on four programs that were advancing through preclinical development, including an ADC program targeting B cell maturation antigen, or the BCMA ADC, CC-99712.\n\nIn May 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration cleared the IND application for the BCMA ADC, which was discovered and manufactured by us and is the first collaboration program IND.\n\nIn June 2023, we received a notice of termination from BMS indicating that it was terminating the BMS Agreement and stopping development of CC-99712 due to a portfolio prioritization decision. The termination of the BMS Agreement was effective as of October 7, 2023, or the Termination Date. Following the Termination Date, we have sole worldwide rights to CC-99712.\n\nEMD Serono Collaboration\n\nWe signed a Collaboration Agreement and a License Agreement with EMD Serono in May 2014 and September 2014, respectively, which were entered into in contemplation of each other. The Collaboration Agreement was subsumed into the License Agreement, or the MDA Agreement, which agreement is to develop ADCs for multiple cancer targets. Our collaboration with EMD Serono has yielded a novel bispecific ADC product candidate targeting EGFR and MUC1, known as M1231, for which an IND submission was filed in the second half of 2020. In March 2023, EMD Serono disclosed its decision to close the Phase 1a trial of M1231 in patients with solid tumors and not initiate a previously planned expansion study. EMD Serono stated that the decision was based on strategic portfolio considerations.\n\n26  \n---  \n  \nBioNova Relationship\n\nIn October 2021, we entered into the BioNova Option Agreement to confer BioNova the right to obtain exclusive rights to develop and commercialize STRO-001 in Greater China and amended the BioNova Option Agreement with BioNova in the first quarter of 2023. In March 2024, BioNova notified us that it had decided to terminate both the BioNova Option Agreement and clinical development of STRO-001 in Greater China. Following receipt of this notice, we decided to suspend development of STRO-001.\n\nStanford License\n\nIn October 2007, we entered into an Amended and Restated Exclusive Agreement, or the Stanford License, with the Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University (Stanford), that grants us an exclusive license, with the right to sublicense, under the patent rights owned by Stanford covering certain technology rights related to our XpressCF® expression system.\n\nWe were required to make milestone payments to Stanford of approximately $930,000 on the accomplishment of certain development and regulatory milestones, which total amount has been paid as of December 31, 2021. No additional milestone payments are due under the Stanford License. Additionally, we owe Stanford annual license maintenance fees of $75,000, which may be creditable against earned royalties in such year and are required to reimburse Stanford for ongoing patent-related costs. We are also required to pay to Stanford low single digit royalties on net sales and to share any sublicensing income received related to the licensed technology. We may terminate the agreement at any time upon 30 days’ written notice.\n\nManufacturing\n\nWe have significant expertise in the production of therapeutic biologics. Our proprietary XpressCF® platform is a cell-free protein synthesis technology that enables rapid and systematic process development, streamlined scale-up and GMP manufacturing.\n\nExtract and Reagents\n\nWe manufacture our cell-free extract and related reagents in our GMP manufacturing facility in San Carlos, California for our clinical trials and supply commitments. We have identified a contract manufacturing organization, or CMO, to serve as our strategic partner for the production of cell-free extract and have initiated technology transfer to this CMO. Similarly, we have identified a CMO to produce custom reagents used in our cell-free production and have initiated this technology transfer as well. The technology transfer for production of custom reagents was substantially completed in 2023 and we expect the technology transfer for production of cell-free extract to be substantially completed in the first half of 2024.\n\nDrug Substance and Drug Product\n\nOur process development and manufacturing strategies are tailored to rapidly advance our product candidates, including the use of a supply chain of established CMOs to ensure successful execution. The production of antibodies will be done by either us or CMOs, depending on our internal cGMP production capacity. We have identified a CMO to produce the antibody component of our products at scale and technology transfer of the manufacturing process is underway. The production of all other necessary elements for the manufacture of our ADC product candidates, and the final manufacture of the ADC drug product, will be handled entirely by CMOs. Our XpressCF+® platform has been successfully used for manufacturing several antibodies containing non-natural amino acids and requires minimal process optimization to support early clinical phase manufacturing. We utilize industry established production steps for the purification of our antibodies. The CMOs we have selected have strong track records in cGMP manufacturing with expertise in clinical or commercial drug manufacturing for cytotoxic agents, large scale manufacture of antibodies, conjugation and fill-finish of therapeutic biologics. All activities from cell-free extract production to formulated drug product are performed to maintain aggressive timelines and minimize delays.\n\n27  \n---  \n  \nCompetition\n\nThe biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries, and the immuno-oncology subsector, are characterized by rapid evolution of technologies, fierce competition, and strong defense of intellectual property. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will have to compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. While we believe that our proprietary XpressCF® platform and scientific expertise in the field of biologics and immuno-oncology provide us with competitive advantages, a wide variety of institutions, including large biopharmaceutical companies, specialty biotechnology companies, academic research departments and public and private research institutions, are actively developing potentially competitive products and technologies. We face substantial competition from biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies developing products in immuno-oncology. Our competitors include larger and better funded biopharmaceutical, biotechnological and therapeutics companies, as well as numerous small companies. Moreover, we also compete with current and future therapeutics developed at universities and other research institutions.\n\nIf our most advanced product candidates are approved, they will compete with a range of therapeutic treatments that are either in development or currently marketed. Currently marketed oncology therapeutics include a range of biologic modalities with the top selling products by class spanning tumor targeting monoclonal antibodies, to ADCs, to immune checkpoint inhibitors, to T cell-engager immunotherapies, to CAR-T cell therapies. In addition, numerous compounds are in clinical development for cancer treatment. The clinical development pipeline for cancer includes small molecules, antibodies, vaccines, cell therapies and immunotherapies from a variety of companies and institutions.\n\nWe also face substantial competition from biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies developing products with FolRα-targeted therapies, including naked antibodies, small molecule drug conjugates, ADCs, and T cell retargeting molecules. The most advanced clinically active agent targeting FolRα to date has been ELAHERE® (mirvetuximab soravtansine IMGN853), an ADC composed of a FolRα-binding antibody linked to the tubulin-disrupting maytansinoid, DM4, via a cleavable linker. Other large pharmaceutical companies are developing a FolRα-targeted ADC for the treatment of cancers, including ovarian cancers.\n\nMany of our competitors, either alone or with strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, sales, supply and human resources or experience than we have. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance, rendering our treatments obsolete or non-competitive. Accelerated merger and acquisition activity in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These companies also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, and acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Our commercial opportunity could be substantially limited in the event that our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, safer, less toxic, more convenient or less expensive than our comparable products. In geographies that are critical to our commercial success, competitors may also obtain regulatory approvals before us, resulting in our competitors building a strong market position in advance of the entry of our products. We believe the factors determining the success of our programs will be the efficacy, safety and convenience of our product candidates.\n\n28  \n---  \n  \nIntellectual Property\n\nWe strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to our business, including seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, pursuing and obtaining patent protection in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, platforms, and product candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business. Our patent portfolio is intended to cover, but is not limited to, our technology platforms, our product candidates, and components thereof, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, our proprietary reagents and assays, and any other inventions that are commercially important to our business. We also rely on trade secret protection of our confidential information and know-how relating to our proprietary technology, platforms, and product candidates, continuing innovation, and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position in our XpressCF® platform, XpressCF+® platform, and product candidates. We expect to rely on data exclusivity, market exclusivity, patent term adjustment and patent term extensions when available. Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our technology, inventions, and improvements; to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; to maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned or controlled by third parties; to defend and enforce our proprietary rights, including our patents; to defend against and challenge the assertion by third parties of their purported intellectual property rights; and to operate without the unauthorized infringement on the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties.\n\nWe believe that we have a strong global intellectual property position and substantial know-how and trade secrets relating to our XpressCF® platform, XpressCF+® platform, and product candidates. Our patent portfolio as of December 31, 2023, contained 29 U.S. issued patents and 263 patents issued in ex-U.S. jurisdictions, including Europe, China, Japan, Australia and Singapore, and 43 U.S. pending applications, as well as 105 patent applications pending in ex-U.S. jurisdictions, including Europe, China, Japan, Australia and Singapore owned solely by us. These patents and patent applications include claims relating to:\n\n•\n\nbacterial strains, and extracts prepared therefrom, comprising an engineered Release Factor 1 protein, which facilitates incorporation of non-natural amino acids into proteins; \n\n•\n\nbacterial strains, and extracts prepared therefrom, comprising combinations of chaperone proteins, which facilitate expression of complex eukaryotic proteins in bacterial extracts; \n\n•\n\nbacterial strains having an oxidative cytoplasm;\n\n•\n\nRelease Factor 1-deficient E. coli cells, and methods of expressing proteins therewith; \n\n•\n\ncells encoding T7 RNA polymerase, and methods of producing thereof;\n\n•\n\nspray-dried extracts for cell-free protein synthesis and methods of producing thereof;\n\n•\n\nlarge scale production of antibody using pre-fabricated light chain;\n\n•\n\nnon-natural amino acid tRNA synthetases;\n\n•\n\nantibodies with engineered CH2 domains;\n\n•\n\nantibodies with site-specific glutamine tags;\n\n•\n\nantibodies and antibody fragments containing one or more non-natural amino acids at defined positions in their amino acid sequences;\n\n•\n\nantibodies targeting receptors of interest, including FolRα, BCMA, ROR1, Tissue Factor, CD3 and EpCAM, and methods of treating therewith;\n\n•\n\nADCs targeting receptors of interest, including FolRα, ROR1, Tissue Factor and BCMA, and methods of treating therewith;\n\n29  \n---  \n  \n•\n\ncombination therapies with anti-Folα ADCs, and methods of treating therewith;\n\n•\n\niADCs, and TLR7, TLR7/8, and STING agonists, and methods of treating therewith;\n\n•\n\nADC2, and methods of treating therewith;\n\n•\n\nan exatecan linker-warhead that is used in our STRO-003 and STRO-004 product candidates;\n\n•\n\nhemiasterlin, both as a cytotoxin and as a linker-warhead, which is used in our STRO-002 product candidate; and \n\n•\n\npara-azidomethylphenylalanine, or pAMF, and proteins comprising pAMF, our workhorse non-natural amino acid which is primarily used when we conjugate molecules to proteins produced with our XpressCF+® platform.\n\nOur issued patents, and any patents that may issue from our pending patent applications, in our solely owned patent portfolio are expected to expire between January 2030 and October 2044, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions.\n\nIn addition, we have exclusively licensed the following patent portfolio from Stanford: 9 U.S. issued patents and 31 patents issued in ex-U.S. jurisdictions, including Europe, China, Canada, India, Australia, South Korea, Eurasia and Singapore. This patent portfolio includes claims relating to methods related to in vitro protein synthesis that we use in our XpressCF® platform and XpressCF+® platform when discovering, developing and manufacturing our product candidates.\n\nRemaining patents in our patent portfolio licensed from Stanford are expected to expire between July 2024 and January 2028, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions.\n\nAs for the XpressCF® platform, XpressCF+® platform, product candidates and processes we develop and commercialize, in the normal course of business, we intend to pursue, where appropriate, patent protection or trade secret protection relating to compositions, methods of manufacture, assay methods, methods of use, treatment of indications, dosing and formulations. We may also pursue patent protection with respect to product development processes and technology.\n\nThe following table describes the potentially material patents and patent applications owned or licensed by us.\n\nPatent Relevance | Ownership |  Type of Patent Protection |  Expiration or Anticipated Expiration (Absent patent term extension or adjustment) |  Pending Jurisdictions |  Issued Jurisdictions  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nXpressCF® platform | Owned by Sutro | Utility | 2033 | None | US, AU, CA, CN, EP, IL, IN, JP, KR, SG  \nXpressCF® platform | Owned by Sutro | Utility | 2034 | US, SG | US, AU, CA, CN, EP, HK, IL, IN, JP, KR  \nXpressCF® platform | Owned by Sutro | Utility | 2034 | None | US, EP  \nXpressCF® platform | Owned by Sutro | Utility | 2035 | None | US, EP  \nXpressCF® platform | Owned by Sutro | Utility | 2041 | US, AU, BR, CA, CN, EP, IL, IN, JP, KR, SG, TW | None  \nXpressCF® platform | Owned by Sutro | Utility | 2043 | US, TW, PCT | None  \nXpressCF® platform | Owned by Sutro | Provisional | 2044 | US | None  \n  \n30  \n---  \n  \nADC platform | Owned by Sutro | Utility | 2033 | US, BR, CA, | US, AU, CN, EP, HK, IL, IN, JP, KR, SG  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nADC platform | Owned by Sutro | Utility | 2033 | US, EP | US, AU, BR, CA, CN, EP, HK, IL, IN, JP, KR, SG  \nSTRO-002 | Owned by Sutro | Utility | 2037 | US, EP | None  \nSTRO-002 | Owned by Sutro | Utility | 2038 | US, AU, BR, CA, CN, EP, HK, IL, IN, JP, KR, MX, NZ, SG, ZA | US  \nSTRO-002 | Owned by Sutro | Utility | 2036 | US, CA, EP, HK, KR | US, AU, BR, CN, EP, IL, IN, JP, SG  \nSTRO-002 | Owned by Sutro | Utility | 2039 | US, EP, HK, JP | None  \nSTRO-002 | Owned by Sutro | Utility | 2042 | US, EP, TW | None  \nSTRO-002 | Owned by Sutro | Utility | 2042 | PCT | None  \nSTRO-002 | Co-owned by Sutro | Utility | 2043 | US | None  \nSTRO-003 | Owned by Sutro | Utility | 2043 | US, TW, PCT | None  \nSTRO-004 | Owned by Sutro | Provisional | 2044 | US | None  \nSTRO-003 and STRO-004 | Owned by Sutro | Utility | 2043 | US, PCT | None  \n  \nWe continually assess and refine our intellectual property strategy as we develop new platform technologies and product candidates. To that end, we are prepared to file additional patent applications if our intellectual property strategy requires such filings, or where we seek to adapt to competition or seize business opportunities. Further, we are prepared to file patent applications, as we consider appropriate under the circumstances relating to the new technologies that we develop. In addition to filing and prosecuting patent applications in the United States, we often file counterpart patent applications in the European Union and in additional countries where we believe such foreign filing is likely to be beneficial, including but not limited to any or all of Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, and Taiwan.\n\nThe term of individual patents depends upon the laws of the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing of a non-provisional patent application. However, the term of United States patents may be extended for delays incurred due to compliance with the FDA requirements or by delays encountered during prosecution that are caused by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO. For example, the Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension for FDA-approved drugs of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our biopharmaceutical product candidates receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those product candidates. We intend to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available; however, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the USPTO and FDA, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions. Our currently issued patents will likely expire on dates ranging from 2033 to 2040, unless we receive patent term extension or patent term adjustment, or both. If patents are issued on our pending patent applications, the resulting patents are projected to expire on dates ranging from 2034 to 2044, unless we receive patent term extension or patent term adjustment, or both. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.\n\nThe patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the scope of claims allowable in patents in the field of immunotherapy has emerged in the United States. The patent situation outside of the United States is even more uncertain.\n\n31  \n---  \n  \nChanges in the patent laws and rules, either by legislation, judicial decisions, or regulatory interpretation in the United States and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our inventions and enforce our intellectual property rights, and more generally could affect the value of our intellectual property. In particular, our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing any of our patented inventions, either directly or indirectly, will depend in part on our success in obtaining, defending, and enforcing patent claims that cover our technology, inventions, and improvements. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our platforms and product candidates and the methods used to manufacture those platforms and product candidates. Moreover, even our issued patents do not guarantee us the right to practice our technology in relation to the commercialization of our platform’s product candidates. However, the area of patent and other intellectual property rights in biotechnology is an evolving one with many risks and uncertainties, and third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our patented XpressCF® platform, XpressCF+® platform, and product candidates and practicing our proprietary technology. Our issued patents and those that may issue in the future may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related platforms or product candidates or limit the length of the term of patent protection that we may have for our XpressCF® platform, XpressCF+® platform, and product candidates. In addition, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies. For these reasons, we may have competition for our XpressCF® platform, XpressCF+® platform, and product candidates. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any particular product candidate can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, platforms, and product candidates, please see the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”\n\nWe intend to file applications for trademark registrations in connection with our product candidates in various jurisdictions, including the United States. We have filed for trademark protection of the Sutro Biopharma marks, the XpressCF® mark and the XpressCF+® mark with the USPTO. Additionally, we filed for trademark protection of the XpressPDF® mark, XpressRNAP® mark, XpressRS® mark, XpresstRNA® mark and XtractCF® mark with the USPTO. We also filed for trademark protection of the clinical trial marks. XpressCF® refers to our cell-free protein synthesis technology as a whole, and XpressCF+® refers specifically to cell-free protein synthesis incorporating one or more non-natural amino acids. The Sutro Biopharma marks were registered by the USPTO in 2014 and 2018, the XpressCF® mark was registered by the USPTO in 2017, and XpressCF+® mark was registered by the USPTO in 2017. The XpressRNAP® mark, the XpressRS® mark, and the XpresstRNA® mark were registered in the USPTO in 2021. The XpressPDF® mark and the XtractCF® mark were registered in the USPTO in 2022.\n\nWe also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. Although we take steps to protect our confidential and proprietary information as trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual, and which are related to our current or planned business or research and development or made during normal working hours, on our premises or using our equipment or proprietary information, are our exclusive property. In many cases our confidentiality and other agreements with consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors require them to assign or grant us licenses to inventions they invent as a result of the work or services they render under such agreements or grant us an option to negotiate a license to use such inventions.\n\n32  \n---  \n  \nInformation Security\n\nWe seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our proprietary technology and processes by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. Our Infosec Governance Committee, comprising senior executives and facilities and information technology employees, and under the supervision of our Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, is responsible for designing, implementing, monitoring and improving the security of our confidential and/or proprietary information. We conduct regular audits of our information security systems, including our on-site and cloud-based information systems and strive to continuously improve the robustness of our security and information recovery systems in the event of, for example, a cyberattack or natural disaster that compromises our data integrity. In addition, we conduct regular training and testing of our employees to identify, and report cyberattacks, including phishing and other forms of social engineering. We also maintain a limited insurance policy against cyberattacks that may provide a measure of compensation in the event that we are harmed by an information security attack. Although we have confidence in these individuals, organizations, and systems, our security measures have been breached in the past and may again be breached in the future, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. To the extent that our employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators, and advisors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.\n\nGovernment Regulation\n\nGovernment authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.\n\nFDA Approval Process\n\nIn the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDC Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Biological products used for the prevention, treatment, or cure of a disease or condition of a human being are subject to regulation under the FDC Act, except the section of the FDC Act which governs the approval of new drug applications, or NDAs. Biological products are approved for marketing under provisions of the Public Health Service Act, or PHS Act, via a Biologics License Application, or BLA. However, the application process and requirements for approval of BLAs are very similar to those for NDAs, and biologics are associated with similar approval risks and costs as drugs. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as clinical hold, FDA refusal to approve pending BLAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.\n\nBiological product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the United States typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the biologic for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease.\n\n33  \n---  \n  \nPreclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational biologic to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practice, or GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.\n\nThe FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The trial protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions.\n\nClinical trials to support BLAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the biologic into healthy human subjects or patients, the product is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. In oncology clinical trials, efficacy endpoints are also often explored in Phase 1. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug or biologic for a particular indication, dosage tolerance, and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug or biologic and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. In some instances, trial phases may be truncated or combined into one or more combined-phase or adaptive design trials. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the biologic. A single Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in certain oncological conditions where the trial is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible.\n\nThe manufacturer of an investigational drug in a Phase 2 or 3 clinical trial for a serious or life-threatening disease is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access.\n\nAfter completion of the required clinical testing, a BLA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the BLA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The BLA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting a BLA is substantial. The submission of most BLAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, currently exceeding $4,048,000 for Fiscal Year 2024. The applicant under an approved BLA is also subject to an annual program fee, currently exceeding $416,000 per prescription drug product for Fiscal Year 2024. These fees are typically increased annually. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of a BLA to determine whether the application will be filed based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is filed, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of BLAs. Most such applications for standard review biologic products are reviewed within 10 months of the date the FDA files the BLA; most applications for priority review biologics are reviewed within six months of the date the FDA files the BLA. Priority review can be applied to a biologic that the FDA determines has the potential to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would be a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to available therapies. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.\n\n34  \n---  \n  \nThe FDA may also refer applications for novel biologic products, or biologic products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee—typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts—for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the biologic product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs, is satisfactory and the BLA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the biologic is safe, pure, potent and effective in the indication studied.\n\nAfter the FDA evaluates the BLA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of BLA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the biologic outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the product’s safety or efficacy.\n\nOnce granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained, or problems are identified following initial marketing. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement before the change can be implemented. A BLA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing BLA supplements as it does in reviewing BLAs.\n\nFast Track Designation and Accelerated Approval\n\nThe FDA is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of biologics that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the fast track program, the sponsor of a new biologic candidate may request that the FDA designate the candidate for a specific indication as a fast track biologic concurrent with, or after, the submission of the IND for the candidate. The FDA must determine if the biologic candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. In addition to other benefits, such as the ability to engage in more frequent interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track product’s BLA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the BLA is submitted. Additionally, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.\n\nUnder the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a biologic for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.\n\nIn clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions, or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A biologic candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval trials, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing trials, will allow the FDA to withdraw the biologic from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for biologic candidates approved under accelerated\n\n35  \n---  \n  \nregulations are subject to prior review by the FDA. The Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act, or FDORA, was recently enacted, which included provisions related to the accelerated approval pathway. Pursuant to FDORA, the FDA is authorized to require a post-approval study to be underway prior to approval or within a specified time period following approval. FDORA also requires the FDA to specify conditions of any required post-approval study, which may include milestones such as a target date of study completion and requires sponsors to submit progress reports for required post-approval studies and any conditions required by the FDA not later than 180 days following approval and not less frequently than every 180 days thereafter until completion or termination of the study. FDORA enables the FDA to initiate enforcement action for the failure to conduct with due diligence a required post-approval study, including a failure to meet any required conditions specified by the FDA or to submit timely reports.\n\nOrphan Drug Designation\n\nUnder the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to biological products intended to treat a rare disease or condition—generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a product available in the United States for such disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product.\n\nOrphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the biological product and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first BLA applicant to receive FDA approval for a product with particular principal molecular structural features to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. A product is clinically superior if it is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. In the case of a biological product, the same drug is a drug that contains the same principal molecular features. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biological product for the same disease or condition, or the same biological product for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA user fee.\n\nDisclosure of Clinical Trial Information\n\nSponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including biological products, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial are then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.\n\nPediatric Information\n\nUnder the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, BLAs or supplements to BLAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the biological product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted, except a product with a new active ingredient that is molecularly targeted cancer product intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and directed at a molecular target determined by FDA to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer.\n\nThe Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or BPCA, provides a six-month extension of any non-patent exclusivity for a biologic if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new biologic in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, FDA making a written request for pediatric studies, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and\n\n36  \n---  \n  \nreporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers.\n\nAdditional Controls for Biologics\n\nTo help reduce the increased risk of the introduction of adventitious agents, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing controls for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The PHS Act also provides authority to the FDA to immediately suspend licenses in situations where there exists a danger to public health, to prepare or procure products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs, and to authorize the creation and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction or spread of communicable diseases in the United States and between states.\n\nAfter a BLA is approved, the product may also be subject to official lot release as a condition of approval. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of products to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA may also perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products. As with drugs, after approval of biologics, manufacturers must address any safety issues that arise, are subject to recalls or a halt in manufacturing, and are subject to periodic inspection after approval.\n\nPost-Approval Requirements\n\nOnce a BLA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of biologics, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Biologics may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling.\n\nAdverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of a BLA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, biological product manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Biologic manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects' entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.\n\nFDA Regulation of Companion Diagnostics\n\nA biologic product may rely upon an in vitro companion diagnostic for use in selecting the patients that will respond to a therapy. If an in vitro diagnostic is essential to the safe and effective use of the therapeutic product, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic at the same time that FDA approves the therapeutic product.\n\nPursuing FDA approval of an in vitro companion diagnostic usually would require a pre-market approval, or PMA, for that diagnostic. Based on a final FDA guidance document, and the FDA’s past treatment of companion diagnostics, the FDA will likely require PMA approval of an in vitro companion diagnostics to identify patient populations suitable for a cancer therapy. The review of these in vitro companion diagnostics involves coordination of review by the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research and by the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. Approval of a companion diagnostic is generally required at the time of new drug approval.\n\n37  \n---  \n  \nThe PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and nonclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. The applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness, including information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee, which exceeds $483,000 for most PMAs for Fiscal Year 2024. In addition, PMAs for devices must generally include the results from extensive preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, the applicant must demonstrate that the diagnostic produces reproducible results between multiple users at multiple laboratories. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which imposes elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements.\n\nPMA approval is not guaranteed, and the FDA may ultimately respond to a PMA submission with a not approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that may be expensive and time consuming to generate and that can substantially delay or prevent approval. If the FDA concludes that the applicable criteria have been met, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the applicant. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution.\n\nAfter a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also register with FDA and list their devices. A medical device manufacturer’s manufacturing processes are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Domestic facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA.\n\nFailure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions: warning or untitled letters, fines, injunctions, civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of current or future products, operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production, denial of submissions for new products, or withdrawal of PMA approvals.\n\nOther Healthcare Laws\n\nIn addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain general business and marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include anti-kickback statutes, false claims statutes and other healthcare laws and regulations.\n\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally financed healthcare programs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively, the ACA, amended the intent element of the federal statute so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to commit a violation. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor.\n\nFederal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibit any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. This includes claims made to programs where the federal government reimburses, such as Medicaid, as well as programs where the federal government is a direct purchaser, such as when it purchases off the Federal Supply Schedule. Several\n\n38  \n---  \n  \npharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. Additionally, the ACA amended the federal Anti-Kickback Statute such that a violation of that statute can serve as a basis for liability under the federal False Claims Act. The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.\n\nOther federal statutes pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse include the civil monetary penalties statute, which prohibits, among other things, the offer or payment of remuneration to a Medicaid or Medicare beneficiary that the offeror or payor knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order a receive a reimbursable item or service from a particular supplier, and the additional federal criminal statutes created by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by or under the control of any healthcare benefit program in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.\n\nIn addition, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, imposes obligations on certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, known as covered entities, as well as their business associates that perform certain services involving the storage, use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information, and require notification to affected individuals and regulatory authorities of certain breaches of security of individually identifiable health information. In addition, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, and often are not preempted by HIPAA. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which went into effect on January 1, 2020, creates new data privacy obligations for covered companies and provides new privacy rights to California residents. On January 1, 2023, the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which substantially amends the CCPA, went into effect. The CCPA and CPRA provide for unlimited civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. Virginia’s Consumer Data Protection Act, which took effect on January 1, 2023, requires businesses subject to the legislation to conduct data protection assessments in certain circumstances and requires opt-in consent from consumers to acquire and process their sensitive personal information, which includes information revealing a consumer’s physical and mental health diagnosis and genetic and biometric information that can identify a consumer. Colorado enacted the Colorado Privacy Act, and Connecticut enacted the Connecticut Data Privacy Act, each of which took effect on July 1, 2023, and Utah enacted the Consumer Privacy Act, which became effective on December 31, 2023, and each of these laws may increase the complexity, variation in requirements, restrictions, and potential legal risks, and could require increased compliance costs and changes in business practices and policies. Other states have also enacted, proposed, or are considering proposing, data privacy laws, which could further complicate compliance efforts, increase our potential liability and adversely affect our business.\n\nFurther, pursuant to the ACA, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, has issued a final rule that requires manufacturers of prescription drugs to collect and report information on certain payments or transfers of value to physicians, physician assistants, certain types of advanced practice nurses and teaching hospitals, as well as investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. The reports must be submitted on an annual basis and the reported data are posted in searchable form on a public website on an annual basis. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties.\n\n39  \n---  \n  \nIn addition, several states now require prescription drug companies to report certain expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of drug products and to report gifts and payments to individual healthcare practitioners in these states. Other states prohibit various marketing-related activities, such as the provision of certain kinds of gifts or meals. Still other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. A growing number of states require the reporting of certain pricing information, including information pertaining to and justifying price increases and introductory prices for new drugs. In addition, certain states require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and/or marketing codes. Additional states and local jurisdictions, such as Nevada, Connecticut, the City of Chicago and the District of Columbia, require pharmaceutical sales representatives to be registered, licensed and/or meet continuing education requirements. Certain states and local jurisdictions also require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. Compliance with these laws is difficult and time consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws face civil penalties.\n\nEfforts to ensure that business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations involve substantial costs. If a drug company’s operations are found to be in violation of any such requirements, it may be subject to significant penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, the curtailment or restructuring of its operations, loss of eligibility to obtain approvals from the FDA, exclusion from participation in government contracting, healthcare reimbursement or other government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations and reputational harm. Although effective compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, these risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action for an alleged or suspected violation can cause a drug company to incur significant legal expenses and divert management’s attention from the operation of the business, even if such action is successfully defended.\n\nCoverage, Pricing and Reimbursement\n\nThe regulations that govern coverage, pricing and reimbursement for new pharmaceutical products vary widely from country to country. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a pharmaceutical product before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, a pharmaceutical company can obtain regulatory approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay commercial launch of that product.\n\nA pharmaceutical company’s ability to commercialize any products successfully will also depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product. Even if one or more products are successfully brought to the market, these products may not be considered cost-effective, and the amount reimbursed for such products may be insufficient to allow them to be sold on a competitive basis. Increasingly, third-party payors who reimburse patients or healthcare providers, such as government and private insurance plans, are requiring that pharmaceutical companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are seeking to reduce the prices charged or the amounts reimbursed for biopharmaceutical products.\n\nMoreover, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved, or that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Further, no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement exists in the United States. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, but also have their own methods and approval processes apart from Medicare determinations. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor.\n\nSignificant delays can occur in obtaining reimbursement for newly approved pharmaceutical products, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which product is approved by the FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities. Interim reimbursement levels, if applicable, may also be insufficient to cover a pharmaceutical company’s costs and may not be made permanent. Moreover, eligibility for reimbursement does not imply that any pharmaceutical product will be reimbursed in all cases or at a rate that covers a pharmaceutical\n\n40  \n---  \n  \ncompany’s costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. In addition, coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time.\n\nHealthcare Reform\n\nHealthcare reforms that have been adopted, and that may be adopted in the future, could result in further reductions in coverage and levels of reimbursement for pharmaceutical products, increases in rebates payable under U.S. government rebate programs and additional downward pressure on pharmaceutical product prices. Several healthcare reform proposals recently culminated in the enactment of Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, which among other things, allows the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, to directly negotiate the selling price of a statutorily specified number of drugs and biologics each year that CMS reimburses under Medicare Part B and Part D. Only high-expenditure single-source biologics that have been approved for at least 11 years (7 years for drugs) can be selected by CMS for negotiation, with the negotiated price taking effect two years after the selection year. Negotiations for Medicare Part D products take place in 2024 with the negotiated price taking effect in 2026, and negotiations for Medicare Part B products will begin in 2026 with the negotiated price taking effect in 2028. In August 2023, HHS announced the ten Medicare Part D drugs and biologics that it selected for negotiations. HHS will announce the negotiated maximum fair prices by September 1, 2024, and this price cap, which cannot exceed a statutory ceiling price, will go into effect on January 1, 2026. A drug or biological product that has an orphan drug designation for only one rare disease or condition will be excluded from the IRA’s price negotiation requirements, but will lose that exclusion if it receives designations for more than one rare disease or condition, or if is approved for an indication that is not within that single designated rare disease or condition, unless such additional designation or such disqualifying approvals are withdrawn by the time CMS evaluates the drug for selection for negotiation. The IRA also impose rebates on Medicare Part D and Part B drugs whose prices have increased at a rate greater than the rate of inflation. The IRA also extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in ACA marketplaces through plan year 2025.. The IRA permits the Secretary of HHS to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. Manufacturers that fail to comply with the IRA may be subject to various penalties, including civil monetary penalties. These provisions have been and may continue to be subject to legal challenges. For example, the provisions related to the negotiation of selling prices of high-expenditure single-source drugs and biologics have been challenged in multiple lawsuits brought by pharmaceutical manufacturers. Thus, while it is unclear how the IRA will be implemented, it will likely have a significant impact on the biopharmaceutical industry and the pricing of prescription drug products. We expect additional statutory, regulatory, and administrative healthcare reform initiatives to be enacted and implemented in the future.\n\nHuman Capital Resources\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had 302 full-time employees and 22 full-time contract employees. Of these employees, 79 have an M.D. or a Ph.D. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good.\n\nWe recognize that attracting, motivating, and retaining talent at all levels is vital to continuing our success. We invest in our employees in many ways, including through high-quality benefits and various health and wellness initiatives and offer competitive compensation packages (base salary and incentive plans), ensuring fairness in internal compensation practices. The principal purposes of our incentive plans (bonus and equity) are to provide retention incentives that align with the long-term interests of our stakeholders and stockholders.\n\nTo further engage and incentivize our workforce, we also offer a range of opportunities to support professional development and growth. We support ongoing education by providing an appropriate level of reimbursement for courses which are related to an individual’s current or future position, we support our scientific team through encouraging their in-person and/or virtual attendance at conferences and symposia which further their development and we have a robust internal transfer practice to engage our current talent in growth opportunities within and outside of their functional areas. We embarked upon a Company-wide leadership development program which offered the opportunity for every employee to continue to build upon their learning. For our talent pipeline assessment and development, we work closely with individual scientific and business functional leaders to identify our high-performing and high-potential employees, by conducting a company-wide talent assessment\n\n41  \n---  \n  \nand calibration. This assessment is completed annually to ensure we tie together our incentives, development, and recognition to retain and attract the people we need to drive our success.\n\nWe provide our team with ongoing resources aimed at both mental and physical health. We work closely with our Employee Assistance Plan which provides important mental health services and resources. We have a health and wellness initiative which encourages healthy behaviors aimed at creating positive life-long habits. We have a culture of collaboration and collaborative principles which we are intentional about fostering. Our initiatives on Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging aim to learn, listen and act in support of these principles. We are actively involved in our community through, among other things, mentoring underserved communities and supporting the philanthropic interests of our employees and patients.\n\nWe also recognize that maintaining continuity of management in the event of the departure of one or more of our senior executives is critical to the continued success of the organization. To this end, we have prepared a formal written succession plan for our senior executives and to provide guidance for the next generation of our leaders to ensure an orderly and smooth transition in the event of an executive departure. While senior management is primarily responsible for developing our succession plan, our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors (with respect to the CEO) and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors (with respect to other executives) oversee and guide our process and thinking.\n\nCorporate Information\n\nWe were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in April 2003 under the name Fundamental Applied Biology, Inc.

Risk Factors\n\nRISK FACTORS\n\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before making your decision to invest in shares of our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this annual report on Form 10-K, including our financial statements and the related notes and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that affect us. We cannot assure you that any of the events discussed below will not occur. These events could have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. If that were to happen, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\n\nRisks Related to Our Business\n\nWe are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company with no products approved for commercial sale. We have a history of significant losses, expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or maintain profitability, which could result in a decline in the market value of our common stock.\n\nWe are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company. Biotechnology product development is a highly speculative undertaking and involves a substantial degree of risk.\n\nTo date, we have no products approved for commercial sale, have not generated any revenue from commercial product sales and, as of December 31, 2023, had an accumulated deficit of $559.4 million. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, our net loss was $106.8 million and $119.2 million, respectively. Substantially all of our losses have resulted from expenses incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations. In addition, our expenses could increase beyond expectations if we are required by the FDA, or foreign regulatory agencies, to perform studies or clinical trials in addition to those studies and clinical trials that we currently anticipate conducting for our product candidates, or if there are any delays in our or our partners completing clinical trials or the development of any of our product candidates. Our technologies and product candidates are in varying stages of development, and we are subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development of product candidates based on novel technologies. In addition, we have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully overcome many of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving fields, particularly in the biotechnology industry. Furthermore, we do not expect to generate any revenue from commercial product sales for the foreseeable future, and we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future due to the cost of research and development, preclinical studies and clinical trials and the regulatory approval process for our product candidates and manufacturing clinical and early commercial supply of our product candidates. We expect our net losses to increase substantially as we progress further into clinical development of our lead programs and create additional infrastructure to support operations as a public company. However, the amount of our future losses is uncertain. We may never generate revenues from the commercial sale of our or our collaborators’ products. Our ability to achieve profitability, if ever, will depend on, among other things, our, or our existing or future collaborators’, successful development of product candidates, evaluating the related commercial opportunities, obtaining regulatory approvals to market and commercialize product candidates, manufacturing any approved products on commercially reasonable terms, establishing a sales and marketing organization or suitable third-party alternatives for any approved product, and raising sufficient funds to finance business activities. If we, or our existing or future collaborators, are unable to develop our technologies and commercialize one or more of our product candidates or if sales revenue from any product candidate that receives approval is insufficient, we will not achieve profitability, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods.\n\n43  \n---  \n  \nWe will need substantial additional funds to advance development of our product candidates and failure to obtain sufficient funding may force us to delay, limit or terminate our product development programs, commercialization efforts or other operations. We may have difficulty accessing additional capital on reasonable, or even any, terms to continue our product and platform development or other operations and may have to make difficult prioritization decisions regarding development and potential partnering of our clinical and preclinical product candidates.\n\nThe development of biopharmaceutical product candidates is capital-intensive. As our product candidates advance through preclinical studies and clinical trials, we will need substantial additional funds to expand our development, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities. We have used substantial funds to develop our technology and product candidates and will require significant funds to conduct further research and development and preclinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates, to seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates, to manufacture extract and products, if any, which may be approved for commercial sale, to establish marketing and sales capabilities to commercialize our product candidates, and to provide support to our collaborators in the development of their products. In addition, we expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.\n\nSince our inception, we have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in research and development activities for our clinical-stage product candidates and the development of our technology platform, including our in-house manufacturing capabilities. Clinical trials for our product candidates have required substantial funds to date and will continue to require substantial funds to complete. As of December 31, 2023, we had $333.7 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. We expect to incur substantial expenditures in the foreseeable future as we seek to advance multiple product candidates through clinical development, manufacturing, the regulatory approval process and, if approved, commercial launch activities, as well as in connection with the continued development of our technology platform and manufacturing capabilities. Based on our current operating plan, we believe that our available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operations through at least the next 12 months. However, our future capital requirements and the period for which we expect our existing resources to support our operations may vary significantly from what we expect, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned. Our monthly spending levels vary based on new and ongoing research and development and other corporate activities. Because the length of time and activities associated with successful research and development of our product candidates is highly uncertain, we are unable to estimate the actual funds we will require for development and any marketing and commercialization activities for approved products. For example, the timing and amount of our operating expenditures will depend largely on:\n\n•\n\nthe timing, progress and results of preclinical and worldwide clinical development activities;\n\n•\n\nthe costs associated with the development of our internal manufacturing and research and development facilities and processes;\n\n•\n\nthe number and scope of preclinical and clinical programs we decide to pursue;\n\n•\n\nthe progress of the development efforts of parties with whom we have entered or may in the future enter into collaborations and research and development agreements;\n\n•\n\nthe timing and amount of milestone and other payments we may receive under our collaboration and/or research and development agreements;\n\n•\n\nour ability to establish and maintain collaborations, strategic partnerships or marketing, distribution, licensing or other strategic arrangements with third parties on favorable terms, if at all; \n\n•\n\nour ability to achieve sufficient market acceptance, adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors and adequate market share and revenue for any approved product candidates;\n\n•\n\nthe costs involved in prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent and other intellectual property claims;\n\n44  \n---  \n  \n•\n\nthe costs of manufacturing our product candidates and those of our collaborators using our proprietary XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms;\n\n•\n\nthe cost and timing of regulatory approvals;\n\n•\n\nthe cost of commercialization activities if our product candidates or any future product candidates are approved for sale, including marketing, sales and distribution costs;\n\n•\n\nour efforts to enhance operational systems and hire and retain key personnel, including personnel to support development of our product candidates and satisfy our obligations as a public company; and\n\n•\n\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions, including market volatility, high levels of inflation, changes in interest rates, uncertainty with respect to the federal debt ceiling and budget and potential government shutdowns related thereto.\n\nIf we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis or on acceptable terms, we may have to delay, reduce or terminate our research and development programs and preclinical studies or clinical trials, limit strategic opportunities or undergo reductions in our workforce or other corporate restructuring activities. We also could be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise pursue on our own. We cannot provide assurance that anticipated collaborator payments will, in fact, be received. We do not expect to realize revenue from sales of commercial products or royalties from licensed products in the foreseeable future, if at all, and, in no event, before our product candidates are clinically tested, approved for commercialization and successfully marketed. To date, we have primarily financed our operations through payments received under our collaboration and other associated agreements, the sale of equity securities, debt financing and a royalty monetization agreement. We will be required to seek additional funding in the future and currently intend to do so through additional collaborations and/or licensing agreements, public or private equity offerings or debt financings, credit or loan facilities, royalty monetization or a combination of one or more of these funding sources. Additional funds may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.\n\nIf we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders will suffer dilution and the terms of any financing may adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. If we raise additional funds through licensing or collaboration arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. In addition, as a condition to providing additional funds to us, future investors may demand, and may be granted, rights superior to those of existing stockholders. Any future debt financings, if available, are likely to involve, restrictive covenants limiting our flexibility in conducting future business activities, and, in the event of insolvency, debt holders would be repaid before holders of our equity securities receive any distribution of our corporate assets. Failure to obtain capital when needed on acceptable terms may force us to delay, limit or terminate our product development and commercialization of our current or future product candidates, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nOur product candidates are in varying development stages and may fail in development or be impacted by competitive products or suffer delays that materially and adversely affect their commercial viability. If we or our collaborators are unable to complete development of or commercialize our product candidates or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\n\nWe have no products on the market and all of our product candidates for cancer therapy are in clinical development. Our most advanced product candidate, luvelta, is being evaluated in REFRαME-O1, a Phase 2/3 pivotal trial for treatment of women with platinum resistant ovarian cancer, as well as in additional clinical studies underway, including for treatment of women with endometrial cancer and children with pediatric AML. Additionally, we have programs that are being evaluated by partners in clinical trials and by us in earlier stages of discovery and preclinical development and may never advance to clinical-stage development. Our ability to achieve and sustain profitability depends on obtaining regulatory approvals for and successfully commercializing our product candidates, either alone or with third parties, and we cannot guarantee you that we will ever obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. We have limited experience in conducting and managing the clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approvals, including approval by the FDA. Before obtaining regulatory approval for the commercial distribution of our product candidates, we or an existing or future collaborator must\n\n45  \n---  \n  \nconduct extensive preclinical tests and clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy in humans of our product candidates.\n\nWe may not have the financial resources to continue development of, or to modify existing or enter into new collaborations for, a product candidate if we experience any issues that delay or prevent regulatory approval of, or our ability to commercialize, product candidates, including:\n\n•\n\nnegative or inconclusive results from our clinical trials or the clinical trials of others for product candidates similar to ours, leading to a decision or requirement to conduct additional preclinical testing or clinical trials or abandon a program;\n\n•\n\nproduct-related side effects experienced by patients in our clinical trials or by individuals using drugs or therapeutic biologics similar to our product candidates;\n\n•\n\ndifficulty achieving successful continued development, or transfer to third-parties, of our internal manufacturing processes, including process development and scale-up activities to supply products for preclinical studies, clinical trials and commercial sale;\n\n•\n\ndelays in submitting INDs or comparable foreign applications or delays or failures in obtaining the necessary approvals from regulators to commence a clinical trial, or a suspension or termination of a clinical trial once commenced;\n\n•\n\nconditions imposed by the FDA or comparable foreign authorities regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials;\n\n•\n\ndelays in enrolling patients or high drop-out rates in our clinical trials;\n\n•\n\ninadequate supply or quality of product candidate components or materials or other supplies necessary for the conduct of our clinical trials;\n\n•\n\ninability to obtain alternative sources of supply for which we have a single source for product candidate components or materials;\n\n•\n\noccurrence of epidemics, pandemics or contagious diseases and potential effects on our business, clinical trial sites, highly complex supply chain and manufacturing facilities;\n\n•\n\ngreater than anticipated costs of our clinical programs;\n\n•\n\nharmful side effects or inability of our product candidates to meet efficacy endpoints during clinical trials, which can be unpredictable even in light of earlier non-clinical and clinical data;\n\n•\n\nfailure to demonstrate in our clinical trials a sufficient response rate or duration of response;\n\n•\n\nfailure to demonstrate a benefit-risk profile acceptable to the FDA or other regulatory agencies;\n\n•\n\nunfavorable FDA or other regulatory agency inspection and review of one or more of our clinical trial sites or manufacturing facilities;\n\n•\n\nfailure of our third-party contractors or investigators to comply with regulatory requirements or otherwise meet their contractual obligations in a timely manner, or at all;\n\n•\n\ndelays and changes in regulatory requirements, policy and guidelines, including the imposition of additional regulatory oversight around clinical testing generally or with respect to our technology in particular; and\n\n•\n\nvarying interpretations of our data by the FDA and similar foreign regulatory agencies.\n\n46  \n---  \n  \nWe or our collaborators’ inability to complete development of or commercialize our product candidates or significant delays in doing so due to one or more of these factors, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nOur business is dependent on the success of our product candidates, including luvelta, which is generated from our proprietary XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms. Existing and future preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates may not be successful. If we are unable to commercialize our product candidates or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\n\nWe have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in the development of our proprietary XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms and our proprietary product candidates, luvelta, STRO-003 and STRO-004. Our ability to generate commercial product revenues, which we do not expect will occur for many years, if ever, will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of our product candidates. We have not previously submitted a new drug application, or NDA, or a biologics license application, or BLA, to the FDA, or similar regulatory approval filings to comparable foreign authorities, for any product candidate, and we cannot be certain that our product candidates will be successful in clinical trials or receive regulatory approval. In addition, although we believe that our REFRαME-O1 Phase 2/3 pivotal trial of luvelta for the treatment of women with platinum resistant ovarian cancer will provide a sufficient dataset to support submission of a BLA to the FDA or equivalent to regulatory agencies, we cannot assure you that the FDA will agree with our conclusions or require data prior to approval. Further, our product candidates may not receive regulatory approval even if they are successful in clinical trials. If we do not receive regulatory approvals for our product candidates, we may not be able to continue our operations. Even if we successfully obtain regulatory approvals to market our product candidates, our revenues will be dependent, in part, upon the size of the markets in the territories for which we gain regulatory approval and have commercial rights. If the markets for patient subsets that we are targeting are not as significant as we estimate, we may not generate significant revenues from sales of such products, if approved.\n\nWe plan to seek regulatory approval to commercialize our product candidates both in the United States and in selected foreign countries. While the scope of regulatory approvals generally is similar in other countries, in order to obtain separate regulatory approvals in other countries, we must comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of such countries regarding safety and efficacy. Other countries also have their own regulations governing, among other things, clinical trials and commercial sales, as well as pricing and distribution of our product candidates, and we may be required to expend significant resources to obtain regulatory approval and to comply with ongoing regulations in these jurisdictions.\n\nThe success of luvelta, STRO-003 and STRO-004 and our other future product candidates will depend on many factors, including the following:\n\n•\n\nsuccessful enrollment of patients in, and the completion of, our clinical trials;\n\n•\n\nreceiving required regulatory approvals for the development and commercialization of our product candidates;\n\n•\n\nestablishing our commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers;\n\n•\n\nestablishing successful technology transfers and collaborations to develop our product candidates with licensees, including our licensees with rights to luvelta in Greater China;\n\n•\n\nobtaining and maintaining patent, trademark and trade secret protection and non-patent exclusivity for our product candidates and their components;\n\n•\n\nenforcing and defending our intellectual property rights and claims and avoiding or defending against intellectual property rights and claims from third parties;\n\n•\n\nachieving desirable therapeutic properties for our product candidates’ intended indications;\n\n47  \n---  \n  \n•\n\nlaunching commercial sales of our product candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with third parties;\n\n•\n\nacceptance of our product candidates, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;\n\n•\n\neffectively competing with other therapies, including those that have not yet entered the market;\n\n•\n\nmaintaining an acceptable safety profile of our product candidates through clinical trials and following regulatory approval; and\n\n•\n\nachieving commercially relevant success in the market post approval.\n\nMany of these factors are out of our control and if we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize our product candidates, which would materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nPatient enrollment, a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials, is affected by many factors including the size and nature of the patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the design of the clinical trial, competing clinical trials and clinicians’ and patients’ perceptions as to the potential advantages of the product candidate being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs or therapeutic biologics that may be approved for the indications being investigated by us. Furthermore, we expect to rely on our collaborators, CROs and clinical trial sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials and, while we expect to enter into agreements governing their committed activities, we have limited influence over their actual performance.\n\nWe could encounter delays if prescribing physicians encounter unresolved ethical issues associated with enrolling patients in clinical trials of our product candidates in lieu of prescribing existing treatments that have established safety and efficacy profiles.\n\nAdditionally, we have in the past and may in the future create benchmark molecules for comparative purposes. For example, we have created a benchmark FolRα targeting antibody-drug conjugate, or ADC, using conventional technology that results in a heterogeneous ADC mixture. We have compared luvelta to this benchmark molecule in multiple preclinical models. We believe the results of these tests help us understand how the therapeutic index of luvelta compares to competitors’ product candidates. However, we cannot be certain that any benchmark molecule that we create is the same as the molecule we are attempting to recreate, and the results of the tests comparing any such benchmark molecule to any other potential or current product candidate may be different than the actual results of a head-to-head test of any such other potential or current product candidate against a competitor molecule. Additional preclinical and clinical testing will be needed to evaluate the therapeutic index of our potential or current product candidates, and to understand their therapeutic potential relative to other product candidates in development. While we believe our ADCs may be superior to other investigative agents in development, without head-to-head comparative data, we will not be able to make claims of superiority to other products in our promotional materials, if our product candidates are approved.\n\nIf we do not achieve our projected development goals in the time frames we anticipate and project, the commercialization of our products may be delayed and our stock price may decline.\n\nFrom time to time, we estimate the timing of the anticipated accomplishment of various scientific, clinical, regulatory, commercial and other product development goals, which we sometimes refer to as milestones. These milestones may include the commencement or completion of scientific studies and clinical trials and the submission of regulatory filings. From time to time, we may publicly announce the expected timing of some of these milestones. All of these milestones are and will be based on numerous assumptions. The actual timing of these milestones can vary dramatically compared to our estimates, in some cases for reasons beyond our control, such as health epidemics and pandemics, global instability and geopolitical conflicts within regions where our clinical trials are conducted. For example, we intend to open a clinical trial site in Israel, which may face enrollment, operational or other difficulties due to conflicts within the region, including, for example, difficulties importing clinical study drug through Israeli customs, difficulties with patient enrollment, or difficulties with patients\n\n48  \n---  \n  \nor medical personnel accessing appropriate medical facilities. In addition, we rely on third party vendors, contractors and consultants to provide services in connection with our clinical trials. If these third parties do not perform their services in a timely or workmanlike manner, our clinical studies may be delayed. If we do not meet these milestones as publicly announced, or at all, the commercialization of our products may be delayed or never achieved and, as a result, our stock price may decline.\n\nOur approach to the discovery and development of our therapeutic treatments is based on novel technologies, including unprecedented Immunostimulatory Antibody Drug Conjugate, or iADC, and dual Antibody Drug Conjugates, or ADC2 technology, that are unproven and may not result in marketable products.\n\nWe are developing a pipeline of product candidates using our proprietary XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms. We believe that product candidates identified with our product discovery platform may offer an improved therapeutic approach by taking advantage of precision design and rapid empirical optimization, thereby reducing the dose-limiting toxic effects associated with existing products. However, the scientific research that forms the basis of our efforts to develop product candidates based on our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms is ongoing. Further, the scientific evidence to support the feasibility of developing therapeutic treatments based on our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms is both preliminary and limited.\n\nTo date, our clinical stage product candidates have been tested in a limited number of clinical trial patients. We may ultimately discover that our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms and any product candidates resulting therefrom do not possess certain properties required for therapeutic effectiveness. XpressCF® product candidates may also be unable to remain stable in the human body for the period of time required for the drug to reach the target tissue or they may trigger immune responses that inhibit the ability of the product candidate to reach the target tissue or that cause adverse side effects in humans. We currently have only limited data, and no conclusive evidence, to suggest that we can introduce these necessary properties into these product candidates derived from our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms. We may spend substantial funds attempting to introduce these properties and may never succeed in doing so. In addition, product candidates based on our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms may demonstrate different chemical and pharmacological properties in patients than they do in laboratory studies. Although our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms and certain product candidates have produced successful results in animal studies, they may not demonstrate the same chemical and pharmacological properties in humans and may interact with human biological systems in unforeseen, ineffective or harmful ways. Further, in our oncology clinical trials to date, we have used achievement of stable disease as evidence for disease control (stable disease, partial response or complete response) by our product candidates; however, the FDA does not view stable disease as an objective response for the purposes of FDA approval.\n\nResults of our clinical trials could reveal a high and unacceptable severity and prevalence of side effects or unexpected characteristics. Undesirable side effects could result in the delay, suspension or termination of clinical trials by us or regulatory authorities for a number of reasons. In our clinical trials to date, our product candidates have been generally well tolerated, and the most common treatment-emergent adverse events, or TEAEs, that resulted in a treatment delay or dose reduction was reversible neutropenia. We have also observed arthralgia as a TEAE. It is possible that, as we test our product candidates in larger, longer and more extensive clinical trials or as the use of our product candidates becomes more widespread following any regulatory approval, illnesses, injuries, discomforts and other adverse events that were observed in earlier trials, as well as conditions that did not occur or went undetected in previous trials, will be reported by patients. If such side effects become known later in development or upon approval, if any, such findings may harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects significantly.\n\nIf product candidates based on our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms are unable to demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy data to obtain marketing approval, we may never succeed in developing a marketable product, we may not become profitable and the value of our common stock will decline. The regulatory approval process for novel product candidates such as ours can be more expensive and take longer than for other, better known or extensively studied product candidates. We are not aware of any company currently developing a therapeutic using our approach to ADC, iADC or ADC2 development and no regulatory authority has granted approval for such a therapeutic. We believe the FDA has limited experience with therapeutics in oncology or other disease areas developed in cell-free-based synthesis systems, which may increase the complexity, uncertainty and length of the regulatory approval process for our product candidates. For example, our XpressCF® ADC product candidates contain cleavable or non-cleavable linker-warhead\n\n49  \n---  \n  \ncombinations or novel warheads that may result in unforeseen events when administered in a human. We and our existing or future collaborators may never receive approval to market and commercialize any product candidate. Even if we or an existing or future collaborator obtains regulatory approval, the approval may be for targets, disease indications or patient populations that are not as broad as we intended or desired or may require labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings. We or an existing or future collaborator may be required to perform additional or unanticipated clinical trials to obtain approval or be subject to post-marketing testing requirements to maintain regulatory approval. If the products resulting from our XpressCF® platform prove to be ineffective, unsafe or commercially unviable, our entire platform and pipeline would have little, if any, value, which would have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nResults of preclinical studies and early clinical trials may not be predictive of results of future clinical trials.\n\nThe outcome of preclinical studies and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and preliminary results of clinical trials do not necessarily predict success in future clinical trials. Many companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials after achieving positive results in earlier development, and we could face similar setbacks. The design of a clinical trial can determine whether its results will support approval of a product, and flaws in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well advanced. While certain relevant members of our company have significant clinical experience, we in general have limited experience in designing clinical trials and may be unable to design and execute a clinical trial to support marketing approval. In addition, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses. Many companies that believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval for the product candidates. Even if we, current or future collaborators, believe that the results of clinical trials for our product candidates warrant marketing approval, the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree and may not grant marketing approval of our product candidates.\n\nIn some instances, there can be significant variability in safety or efficacy results between different clinical trials of the same product candidate due to numerous factors, including changes in trial procedures set forth in protocols, differences in the size and type of the patient populations, changes in and adherence to the dosing regimen and other clinical trial protocols and the rate of dropout among clinical trial patients. In addition, results from compassionate use of our product candidates, such as luvelta to treat pediatric CFB/GLIS AML, may not be confirmed in Company-sponsored trials and/or may negatively impact the prospects for marketing approval for our product candidates. If we fail to receive positive results in clinical trials of our product candidates, the development timeline and regulatory approval and commercialization prospects for our most advanced product candidates, and, correspondingly, our business and financial prospects would be negatively impacted.\n\nInterim, top-line, or preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce may change as more patient data become available and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data.\n\nFrom time to time, we have publicly disclosed, and in the future will disclose, preliminary or top-line data from our preclinical studies and clinical trials, which are based on preliminary analyses of then-available data, and the results and related findings and conclusions are subject to change following a more comprehensive review of the data related to the particular study or trial. We also make assumptions, estimations, calculations, and conclusions as part of our analyses of data, and we may not have received or had the opportunity to fully and carefully evaluate all data. Therefore, final results from the studies may differ from the top-line results initially reported, and the final results may indicate different conclusions once additional data have been evaluated. As such, top-line data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. In addition, the information we choose to publicly disclose regarding a particular study or clinical trial is based on what is typically extensive data, and you or others may not agree with what we determine is material or otherwise appropriate information to include in our disclosure. If the final results differ from the interim, top-line, or preliminary data, or if others, including regulatory authorities, disagree with the conclusions reached, our ability to obtain approval for, and to commercialize, our product candidates may be harmed, which may negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\n\n50  \n---  \n  \nMoreover, from time to time, we have publicly disclosed, and in the future may disclose, interim data from our preclinical studies and clinical trials. Interim data from clinical trials that we may complete are subject to the risk that one or more of the outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more data become available. Adverse differences between top-line, preliminary, or interim data, on the one hand, and final data, on the other, could significantly harm our business prospects. Further, disclosure of interim data by us or by our competitors could result in volatility in the price of our common stock.\n\nFurther, others, including regulatory agencies, may not accept or agree with our assumptions, estimates, calculations, conclusions, or analyses, or may interpret or weigh the importance of data differently, which could negatively affect the approvability or commercialization of the particular product candidate.\n\nThe market may not be receptive to our product candidates based on a novel therapeutic modality, and we may not generate any future revenue from the sale or licensing of product candidates.\n\nEven if regulatory approval is obtained for a product candidate, we may not generate or sustain revenue from sales of the product due to factors such as whether the product can be sold at a competitive cost, competition in the therapeutic area(s) we have received or may receive approval for, and whether it will otherwise be accepted in the market. Historically, there have been concerns regarding the safety and efficacy of ADCs, and an ADC drug was voluntarily withdrawn from the market for an extended period of time. These historical concerns may negatively impact the perception market participants have on ADCs, including our product candidates. Additionally, the product candidates that we are developing are based on our proprietary XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms, which are new technologies. Market participants with significant influence over acceptance of new treatments, such as physicians and third-party payors, may not adopt an ADC product, or a product or treatment based on our novel cell-free production technologies, and we may not be able to convince the medical community and third-party payors to accept and use, or to provide favorable reimbursement for, any product candidates developed by us or our existing or future collaborators. Market acceptance of our product candidates will depend on the following, among other factors:\n\n•\n\nthe timing of our receipt of any marketing and commercialization approvals;\n\n•\n\nthe terms of any approvals and the countries in which approvals are obtained;\n\n•\n\nthe safety and efficacy of our product candidates;\n\n•\n\nthe prevalence and severity of any adverse side effects associated with our product candidates;\n\n•\n\nlimitations or warnings contained in any labeling approved by the FDA or other regulatory authority;\n\n•\n\nrelative convenience and ease of administration of our product candidates;\n\n•\n\nthe willingness of patients to accept any new methods of administration;\n\n•\n\nthe success of our physician education programs;\n\n•\n\nthe availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from government and third-party payors;\n\n•\n\nthe pricing of our products, particularly as compared to alternative treatments; and\n\n•\n\nthe availability of alternative effective treatments for the disease indications our product candidates are intended to treat and the relative risks, benefits and costs of those treatments.\n\nBecause our product candidates are based on new technology, we expect that they will require extensive research and development and have substantial manufacturing and processing costs. In addition, our estimates regarding potential market size for any indication may be materially different from what we discover to exist at the time we commence commercialization, if any, for a product, which could result in significant changes in our business plan and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and\n\n51  \n---  \n  \nprospects. Moreover, if any product candidate we commercialize fails to achieve market acceptance, it could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\niADC and ADC2 are novel technologies, which makes it difficult to predict the time, risks and cost of development and of subsequently obtaining regulatory approval of these potential product candidates.\n\nCertain of our preclinical product candidates are based on our proprietary iADC and ADC2 technology. Some of our future success depends on the successful development of this technology and products based on it. To our knowledge, no regulatory authority has granted approval to any person or entity, including us, to market and commercialize therapeutics using our novel and unprecedented iADC or ADC2 technology. We may never receive approval to market and commercialize any potential iADC or ADC2 product candidate.\n\nIf we uncover any previously unknown risks related to our iADC and ADC2 technology, or if we experience unanticipated or unsolvable problems or delays in developing our iADC or ADC2 product candidates, we may be unable to complete our preclinical studies and clinical trials, meet the obligations of our collaboration and license agreements or commercialize our product candidates on a timely or profitable basis. If serious adverse events or unacceptable side effects are observed in preclinical studies or clinical trials of a product candidate based on our iADC or ADC2 technology, or if iADCs or ADC2s were shown to have limited efficacy, our ability to develop other product candidates based on our iADC or ADC2 technology would be adversely affected.\n\nWe have entered, and may in the future seek to enter, into collaborations with third parties for the development and commercialization of our product candidates using our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms. If we fail to enter into such collaborations, or such collaborations are not successful, we may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms and resulting product candidates.\n\nSince 2014, we have entered into several collaborations to develop and commercialize certain cancer and other therapeutics. Our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms have also supported a spin-out company, Vaxcyte Inc., focused on discovery and development of vaccines for the treatment and prophylaxis of infectious disease. In addition, we may in the future seek third-party collaborators for research, development and commercialization of other therapeutic technologies or product candidates. Biopharmaceutical companies are our prior and likely future collaborators for any marketing, distribution, development, licensing or broader collaboration arrangements. With respect to our existing collaboration agreements, and what we expect will be the case with any future collaboration agreements, we have and would expect to have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators dedicate to the development or commercialization of our product candidates. Moreover, our ability to generate revenues from these arrangements will depend on our collaborators’ abilities to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements.\n\nCollaborations involving our product candidates currently pose, and will continue to pose, the following risks to us:\n\n•\n\ncollaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations;\n\n•\n\ncollaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of our product candidates or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on preclinical studies or clinical trial results, changes in the collaborators’ strategic focus or available funding, or external factors such as an acquisition that diverts resources or creates competing priorities;\n\n•\n\ncollaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\n•\n\ncollaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our product candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours;\n\n52  \n---  \n  \n•\n\ncollaborators with marketing and distribution rights to one or more products may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of such product or products;\n\n•\n\ncollaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to litigation or potential liability;\n\n•\n\ncollaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability;\n\n•\n\ndisputes may arise between the collaborators and us that result in the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our product candidates or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources; and\n\n•\n\ncollaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates.\n\nAs a result of the foregoing, our current and any future collaboration agreements may not lead to development or commercialization of our product candidates in the most efficient manner or at all. Moreover, if a collaborator of ours were to be involved in a business combination, the continued pursuit and emphasis on our product development or commercialization program could be delayed, diminished or terminated. Any failure to successfully develop or commercialize our product candidates pursuant to our current or any future collaboration agreements could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nOur existing collaborations with Astellas, Merck, Vaxcyte and Tasly are important to our business. If our collaborators cease development efforts under our existing or future collaboration agreements, fail to fulfill their contract obligations, or if any of those agreements are terminated, these collaborations may fail to lead to commercial products and we may never receive milestone payments or future royalties under these agreements.\n\nWe have entered into collaborations with other biotechnology companies to develop or commercialize several of our product candidates, and such collaborations currently represent a significant portion of our product pipeline and discovery and preclinical programs. A substantial portion of our revenue to date has been derived from our collaborations, and a significant portion of our future revenue and cash resources is expected to be derived from some of these agreements, our royalty monetization agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, with an affiliate of Blackstone Life Sciences, or Blackstone, or other similar agreements into which we may enter in the future. Revenue from research and development collaborations depends upon continuation of the collaborations, payments for research and development and other services and product supply, and the achievement of milestones, contingent payments and royalties, if any, derived from future products developed from our research. If we are unable to successfully advance the development of our product candidates, achieve milestones or earn contingent payments under our collaboration agreements or royalty monetization agreement, future revenue and cash resources will be substantially less than expected.\n\nWe are unable to predict the success of our collaborations and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of our strategic collaborations. Our collaborators have discretion in determining and directing the efforts and resources, including the ability to discontinue all efforts and resources, they apply to the development and, if approval is obtained, commercialization and marketing of the product candidates covered by such collaborations. As a result, our collaborators may elect to de-prioritize our programs, change their strategic focus or pursue alternative technologies in a manner that results in reduced, delayed or no revenue to us. For example, each of EMD Serono and BMS elected not to continue the development of their licensed candidates based on strategic portfolio considerations. Our collaborators may have other marketed products and product candidates under collaboration with other companies, including some of our competitors, and their corporate objectives may not be consistent with our best interests. Our collaborators may also be unsuccessful in developing or commercializing our products. If our collaborations are unsuccessful, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected. Our collaborators may fail to live up to the terms of their agreements with us, which would require us to seek to enforce our agreements in accordance with the dispute resolution procedures set forth therein. These procedures may require us to engage in litigation or arbitration to enforce our\n\n53  \n---  \n  \nrights, which can be expensive, time-consuming and distracting to our management and Board of Directors. Further, the type and timing of resolution of such disputes are difficult to predict; and there is the potential that we could fail to enforce our rights either in part or in whole. Lastly, even if we successfully enforce our rights under our agreements with our collaborators, there is the possibility that we could fail to recover our expectancy following the litigation or arbitration, particularly for collaborators that are not subject to the jurisdiction of U.S. courts.\n\nIn addition, from time to time we may have disputes with our collaborators. Any dispute or litigation proceedings we may have with our collaborators could delay development programs, reduce or eliminate potential milestone or other payments, create uncertainty as to ownership of intellectual property rights, distract management from other business activities and generate substantial expense.\n\nMoreover, to the extent that any of our existing or future collaborators were to terminate a collaboration agreement, we may be forced to independently develop these product candidates, including funding preclinical studies or clinical trials, assuming marketing and distribution costs and defending intellectual property rights, or, in certain instances, abandon product candidates altogether, any of which could result in a change to our business plan and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nWe may not successfully engage in strategic transactions, including any additional collaborations we seek, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize product candidates, impact our cash position, increase our expenses and present significant distractions to our management.\n\nFrom time to time, we may consider strategic transactions, such as additional collaborations, acquisitions of companies, asset purchases or sales and out- or in-licensing of product candidates or technologies that we believe will complement or augment our existing business. In particular, we will evaluate and, if strategically attractive, seek to enter into additional collaborations, including with major biotechnology or biopharmaceutical companies. The competition for collaborators is intense, and the negotiation process is time-consuming and complex. Any new collaboration may be on terms that are not optimal for us, and we may not be able to maintain any new collaboration if, for example, development or approval of a product candidate is delayed, sales of an approved product candidate do not meet expectations, or the collaborator terminates the collaboration. In addition, there have been a significant number of recent business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future strategic partners. Additionally, antitrust or other competition laws, including increased enforcement within the United States in the healthcare space, may also limit our ability to enter into collaborations with certain businesses or to fully realize the benefits of strategic transactions. Our ability to reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the strategic partner’s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed strategic partner’s evaluation of a number of factors. These factors may include the design or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States, the potential market for the subject product candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such product candidate to patients, the potential of competing products, the existence of uncertainty with respect to our ownership of technology, which can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership, without regard to the merits of the challenge, and industry and market conditions generally. Moreover, if we acquire assets with promising markets or technologies, we may not be able to realize the benefit of acquiring such assets due to an inability to successfully integrate them with our existing technologies and may encounter numerous difficulties in developing, manufacturing and marketing any new products resulting from a strategic acquisition that delay or prevent us from realizing their expected benefits or enhancing our business.\n\nWe cannot assure you that following any such collaboration, or other strategic transaction, we will achieve the expected synergies to justify the transaction. For example, such transactions may require us to incur non-recurring or other charges, increase our near- and long-term expenditures and pose significant integration or implementation challenges or disrupt our management or business. These transactions would entail numerous operational and financial risks, including exposure to unknown liabilities, disruption of our business and diversion of our management’s time and attention in order to manage a collaboration or develop acquired products, product candidates or technologies, incurrence of substantial debt or dilutive issuances of equity securities to pay transaction consideration or costs, higher than expected collaboration, acquisition or integration costs, write-downs of assets or goodwill or impairment charges, increased amortization expenses, difficulty and cost in facilitating the collaboration or combining the operations and personnel of any acquired business, impairment of\n\n54  \n---  \n  \nrelationships with key suppliers, manufacturers or customers of any acquired business due to changes in management and ownership and the inability to retain key employees of any acquired business.\n\nAccordingly, although there can be no assurance that we will undertake or successfully complete any transactions of the nature described above, any transactions that we do complete may be subject to the foregoing or other risks and would have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Conversely, any failure to enter any additional collaboration or other strategic transaction that would be beneficial to us could delay the development and potential commercialization of our product candidates and have a negative impact on the competitiveness of any product candidate that reaches market.\n\nTo date, no product developed on a cell-free manufacturing platform has received approval from the FDA, so the requirements for the manufacturing of products using our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms are uncertain.\n\nWe have invested in our own current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, compliant manufacturing facility in San Carlos, California. In this facility, we are developing and implementing novel, proprietary cell-free production technologies to supply our planned preclinical and clinical trials. However, before we may initiate a clinical trial or commercialize any of our product candidates, we must demonstrate to the FDA that the chemistry, manufacturing and controls for our product candidates meet applicable requirements, and in the European Union, or EU, a manufacturing authorization must be obtained from the appropriate EU regulatory authorities. The FDA has allowed clinical trial use of our product candidate luvelta, and our partner Merck’s MK-1484 product candidate, portions of which are manufactured in our San Carlos manufacturing facility; however, because no product manufactured on a cell-free manufacturing platform has yet been approved in the United States, there is no manufacturing facility that has demonstrated the ability to comply with FDA requirements for later stage clinical development or commercialization, and, therefore, the time frame for demonstrating compliance to the FDA’s satisfaction is uncertain. Delays in establishing that our manufacturing process and facility comply with cGMPs or disruptions in our manufacturing processes, implementation of novel in-house technologies or scale-up activities, may delay or disrupt our development efforts.\n\nWe have ongoing technology transfers to enable large scale manufacture of extract and the reagents necessary to manufacture our products using our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms. These large scale technology transfers may fail or be delayed, resulting in impacts to our development timelines and the costs associated with manufacturing our development products.\n\nWe expect to rely on third parties to conduct certain of our preclinical studies or clinical trials. If those third parties do not perform as contractually required, fail to satisfy regulatory or legal requirements or miss expected deadlines, our development program could be delayed with potentially material and adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nWe do not have the ability to independently conduct all aspects of our preclinical testing or clinical trials ourselves. We have accordingly relied in some cases and intend to rely in the future on third-party clinical investigators, clinical research organizations, or CROs, clinical data management organizations and consultants to assist or provide the design, conduct, supervision and monitoring of preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates. Because we intend to rely on these third parties and will not have the ability to conduct all preclinical studies or clinical trials independently, we will have less control over the timing, quality and other aspects of preclinical studies and clinical trials than we would have had we conducted them on our own. These investigators, CROs and consultants will not be our employees and we will have limited control over the amount of time and resources that they dedicate to our programs. These third parties may have contractual relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors, which may draw time and resources from our programs. The third parties with which we may contract might not be diligent, careful or timely in conducting our preclinical studies or clinical trials, resulting in the preclinical studies or clinical trials being delayed or unsuccessful.\n\nIf we cannot contract with acceptable third parties on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or if these third parties do not carry out their contractual duties, satisfy legal and regulatory requirements for the conduct of preclinical studies or clinical trials or meet expected deadlines, our clinical development programs could be delayed and otherwise adversely affected. In all events, we will be responsible for ensuring that each of our\n\n55  \n---  \n  \npreclinical studies and clinical trials are conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial. The FDA requires preclinical studies to be conducted in accordance with good laboratory practices and clinical trials to be conducted in accordance with good clinical practices, including for designing, conducting, recording and reporting the results of preclinical studies and clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of clinical trial participants are protected. Our reliance on third parties that we do not control will not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements. Any adverse development or delay in our preclinical studies or clinical trials as a result of our reliance on third parties could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nOur inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of our product candidates, or the loss of our third-party suppliers, or our or their failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements or to supply sufficient quantities at acceptable quality levels or prices, or at all, would materially and adversely affect our business.\n\nManufacturing is a vital component of our business strategy. To ensure timely and consistent product supply, we currently use a hybrid product supply approach wherein certain elements of our product candidates are manufactured internally at our manufacturing facilities in San Carlos, California, and other elements, including raw and intermediate materials, are manufactured at qualified third-party CMOs. Since our own manufacturing facilities may be limited or unable to manufacture certain of our preclinical and clinical trial product materials and supplies, we rely on third-party contract manufacturers to manufacture such clinical trial product materials and supplies for our or our collaborator’s needs. For example, we have entered into a manufacturing agreement with EMD Millipore Corporation to perform conjugation of the applicable linker-warhead with the antibody component of our luvelta and STRO-003 product candidates. We have also entered into agreements with Capua Bioservices, S.p.A. and with AGC Biologics GmbH for the manufacture of certain reagents used in the manufacture of our products with our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms. There can be no assurance that our preclinical and clinical development product supplies will not be limited, interrupted, or of satisfactory quality or continue to be available at acceptable prices. Further, while efforts are made to diversify our sources of raw and intermediate materials, in certain instances we acquire raw and intermediate materials from a sole supplier. In particular, any replacement of our manufacturer could require significant effort and expertise because there may be a limited number of qualified replacements. In addition, replacement of a manufacturer may require a technology transfer to the new manufacturer, which involves technical risk that the transfer may not succeed or may be delayed, and which can incur significant costs.\n\nThe manufacturing process for a product candidate is subject to FDA and foreign regulatory authority review. We, and our suppliers and manufacturers, must meet applicable manufacturing requirements and undergo rigorous facility and process validation tests required by regulatory authorities in order to comply with regulatory standards, such as cGMPs. If we or our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, we may not be able to rely on our or their manufacturing facilities for the manufacture of elements of our product candidates. Moreover, we do not control the manufacturing process at our contract manufacturers and are completely dependent on them for compliance with current regulatory requirements. In the event that any of our manufacturers fails to comply with such requirements or to perform its obligations in relation to quality, timing or otherwise, or if our supply of components or other materials becomes limited or interrupted for other reasons, we may be forced to manufacture the materials ourselves or enter into an agreement with another third party, which we may not be able to do on reasonable terms, if at all. In some cases, the technical skills or technology required to manufacture our product candidates may be unique or proprietary to the original manufacturer and we may have difficulty applying such skills or technology ourselves, or in transferring such to another third party. These factors would increase our reliance on such manufacturer or require us to obtain a license from such manufacturer in order to enable us, or to have another third party, manufacture our product candidates. If we are required to change manufacturers for any reason, we will be required to verify that the new manufacturer maintains facilities and procedures that comply with quality standards and with all applicable regulations and guidelines; and we may be required to repeat some of the development program. The delays associated with the verification of a new manufacturer could negatively affect our ability to develop product candidates in a timely manner or within budget.\n\nWe expect to continue to rely on third-party manufacturers if we receive regulatory approval for any product candidate. To the extent that we have existing, or enter into future, manufacturing arrangements with third parties,\n\n56  \n---  \n  \nwe will depend on these third parties to perform their obligations in a timely manner consistent with contractual and regulatory requirements, including those related to quality control and assurance. If we are unable to obtain or maintain third-party manufacturing for product candidates, or to do so on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to develop and commercialize our product candidates successfully. Our or a third party’s failure to execute on our manufacturing requirements and comply with cGMPs could adversely affect our business in a number of ways, including:\n\n•\n\nan inability to initiate or continue clinical trials of product candidates under development;\n\n•\n\ndelay in submitting regulatory applications, or receiving regulatory approvals, for product candidates;\n\n•\n\nloss of an existing or future collaborator;\n\n•\n\nlosses resulting from an inability to utilize reserved manufacturing capacity because of delays or difficulties encountered in the supply chain;\n\n•\n\nsubjecting third-party manufacturing facilities or our manufacturing facilities to additional inspections by regulatory authorities;\n\n•\n\nrequirements to cease distribution or to recall batches of our product candidates; and\n\n•\n\nin the event of approval to market and commercialize a product candidate, an inability to meet commercial demands for our products.\n\nAdditionally, we and our contract manufacturers may experience manufacturing difficulties due to resource constraints or as a result of labor disputes, unstable political environments, or epidemics, pandemics, or contagious diseases or failures or delays in our manufacturing supply chain. For example, restrictions on travel imposed by governments, including China, or restrictions on person-in-plant permissions imposed by our contract manufacturers may limit the ability of our subject matter experts to visit our manufacturers and assist with technology transfers. If we or our contract manufacturers were to encounter interruptions from any of these events or other unforeseen events, our ability to provide our product candidates to patients in clinical trials, or to provide product for treatment of patients once approved, would be jeopardized.\n\nWe, or third-party manufacturers, may be unable to successfully scale-up manufacturing of our product candidates or materials used to manufacture components of our product candidates in sufficient quality and quantity, which would delay or prevent us from developing our product candidates and commercializing approved products, if any.\n\nIn order to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates, we will need to manufacture them in large quantities. We, or any manufacturing partners, may be unable to successfully increase the manufacturing capacity for any of our product candidates in a timely or cost-effective manner, or at all. In addition, quality issues may arise during scale-up activities. If we, or any manufacturing partners, are unable to successfully scale up the manufacture of our product candidates, or materials used in manufacturing components of our product candidates, in sufficient quality and quantity, the development, testing, and clinical trials of that product candidate may be delayed or infeasible, and regulatory approval or commercial launch of any resulting product may be delayed or not obtained, which could significantly harm our business.\n\nScaling up a biologic manufacturing process is a difficult and uncertain task, and we may not be successful in transferring our production system or our third-party manufacturers may not have the necessary capabilities to complete the implementation and development process. If we are unable to adequately validate or scale-up the manufacturing process at our own manufacturing facilities or those of our current manufacturers, we will need to transfer to another manufacturer and complete the manufacturing validation process, which can be lengthy. If we are able to adequately validate and scale-up the manufacturing process for our product candidates at our manufacturing facility or with a contract manufacturer, we will still need to negotiate with such contract manufacturer an agreement for commercial supply and it is not certain we will be able to come to agreement on terms acceptable to us.\n\n57  \n---  \n  \nThe manufacture of biologics is complex and we or our third-party manufacturers may encounter difficulties in production. If we or any of our third-party manufacturers encounter such difficulties, our ability to provide supply of our product candidates for clinical trials, our ability to obtain marketing approval, or our ability to provide supply of our products for patients, if approved, could be delayed or stopped.\n\nOur product candidates are considered to be biologics and the process of manufacturing biologics and materials used to manufacture components of our products can be complex, time-consuming, highly regulated and subject to multiple risks. We and our contract manufacturers must comply with cGMPs, regulations and guidelines for the manufacturing of biologics used in clinical trials and, if approved, marketed products. To date, we and our contract manufacturers have limited experience in the manufacturing of cGMP batches of our product candidates and materials used to manufacture components of our product candidates.\n\nManufacturing biologics is highly susceptible to product loss due to contamination, equipment failure, improper installation or operation of equipment, vendor or operator error, inconsistency in yields, variability in product characteristics and difficulties in scaling the production process. Even minor deviations from normal manufacturing processes could result in reduced production yields, product defects and other supply disruptions. If microbial, viral or other contaminations are discovered at our manufacturing facilities or those of our third-party manufacturers, such facilities may need to be closed for an extended period of time to investigate and remedy the contamination, which could delay clinical trials and adversely harm our business. Moreover, if the FDA determines that our manufacturing facilities or those of our third-party manufacturers are not in compliance with FDA laws and regulations, including those governing cGMPs, the FDA may deny BLA approval until the deficiencies are corrected or we replace the manufacturer in our BLA with a manufacturer that is in compliance.\n\nIn addition, there are risks associated with large scale manufacturing for clinical trials or commercial scale including, among others, cost overruns, potential problems with process scale-up, process reproducibility, stability issues, compliance with cGMPs, lot consistency, timely availability of raw materials and other technical challenges. Even if we or our collaborators obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, there is no assurance that manufacturers will be able to manufacture the approved product to specifications acceptable to the FDA or other regulatory authorities, to produce it in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements for the potential launch of the product or to meet potential future demand. If our manufacturers are unable to produce sufficient quantities for clinical trials or for commercialization, commercialization efforts would be impaired, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nWe cannot assure you that any stability or other issues relating to the manufacture of any of our product candidates or products will not occur in the future. If we or our third-party manufacturers were to encounter any of these difficulties, our ability to provide any product candidates to patients in planned clinical trials and products to patients, once approved, would be jeopardized. Any delay or interruption in the supply of clinical trial supplies could delay the completion of planned clinical trials, increase the costs associated with maintaining clinical trial programs and, depending upon the period of delay, require us to commence new clinical trials at additional expense or terminate clinical trials completely. Any adverse developments affecting clinical or commercial manufacturing of our product candidates or products, such as epidemics, pandemics or contagious diseases, may result in shipment delays, inventory shortages, lot failures, product withdrawals or recalls, or other interruptions in the supply of our product candidates or products. We may also have to take inventory write-offs and incur other charges and expenses for product candidates or products that fail to meet specifications, undertake costly remediation efforts or seek more costly manufacturing alternatives. Accordingly, failures or difficulties faced at any level of our supply chain could adversely affect our business and delay or impede the development and commercialization of any of our product candidates or products, if approved, and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nAs part of our process development efforts, we also may make changes to our manufacturing processes at various points during development, for various reasons, such as controlling costs, achieving scale, decreasing processing time, increasing manufacturing success rate or other reasons. Such changes carry the risk that they will not achieve their intended objectives, and any of these changes could cause our product candidates to perform differently and affect the results of our ongoing clinical trials or future clinical trials. In some circumstances, changes in the manufacturing process may require us to perform ex vivo comparability studies and to collect additional data from patients prior to undertaking more advanced clinical trials. For instance, changes in our process during the course of clinical development may require us to show the comparability of the\n\n58  \n---  \n  \nproduct used in earlier clinical phases or at earlier portions of a trial to the product used in later clinical phases or later portions of the trial.\n\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to use our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms to expand our pipeline of product candidates and develop marketable products.\n\nThe success of our business depends in large part upon our ability to identify, develop and commercialize products based on our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms. Luvelta is our most advanced clinical stage program, and our preclinical and research programs may fail to identify other potential product candidates for clinical development for a number of reasons. Our research methodology may be unsuccessful in identifying potential product candidates or our potential product candidates may be shown to have harmful side effects or may have other characteristics that may make the products unmarketable or unlikely to receive marketing approval. If any of these events occur, we may be forced to abandon our development efforts for a program or for multiple programs, which would materially harm our business and could potentially cause us to cease operations. Research programs to identify new product candidates require substantial technical, financial and human resources. We may focus our efforts and resources on potential programs or product candidates that ultimately prove to be unsuccessful.\n\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate and fail to capitalize on product candidates that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\n\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus our research and development efforts on certain selected product candidates. As a result, we may forgo or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable product candidates. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate. For example, in June 2023, we announced our Purchase Agreement with Blackstone.\n\nFailure to successfully validate, develop and obtain regulatory approval for companion diagnostics for our product candidates could harm our drug development strategy and operational results.\n\nIf companion diagnostics are developed in conjunction with clinical programs, the FDA may require regulatory approval of a companion diagnostic as a condition to approval of the product candidate. For example, as we are developing luvelta for treatment of patients having ovarian cancer with elevated FolRα expression levels, we are likely to be required to obtain FDA approval or clearance of a companion diagnostic, concurrent with approval of luvelta, to test for elevated FolRα expression. We do not have experience or capabilities in developing or commercializing diagnostics and plan to rely in large part on third parties to perform these functions. We have entered into an agreement to develop diagnostic assays suitable for use as a companion diagnostic for luvelta. Companion diagnostics are subject to regulation by the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities as medical devices and require separate regulatory approval or clearance prior to commercialization. We may also be required to demonstrate to the FDA the predictive utility of the companion diagnostic—namely, that the diagnostic selects for patients in whom the biologic therapy will be effective or more effective compared to patients not selected for by the diagnostic.\n\nIf we or our collaborators, or any third party, are unable to successfully develop companion diagnostics for our product candidates, or experience delays in doing so:\n\n•\n\nthe development of our product candidates may be adversely affected if we are unable to appropriately select patients for enrollment in our planned clinical trials;\n\n•\n\nour product candidates may not receive marketing approval if their safe and effective use depends on a companion diagnostic; and\n\n59  \n---  \n  \n•\n\nwe may not realize the full commercial potential of any product candidates that receive marketing approval if, among other reasons, we are unable to appropriately identify patients with the specific genetic alterations targeted by our product candidates.\n\nIn addition, although we believe genetic testing is becoming more prevalent in the diagnosis and treatment of various diseases and conditions, our product candidates may be perceived negatively compared to alternative treatments that do not require the use of companion diagnostics, either due to the additional cost of the companion diagnostic or the need to complete additional procedures to identify genetic markers prior to administering our product candidates. If any of these events were to occur, our business would be harmed, possibly materially.\n\nWe face competition from entities that have developed or may develop product candidates for cancer, including companies developing novel treatments and technology platforms. If these companies develop technologies or product candidates more rapidly than we do or their technologies are more effective, our ability to develop and successfully commercialize product candidates may be adversely affected.\n\nThe development and commercialization of drugs and therapeutic biologics is highly competitive. Our product candidates, if approved, will face significant competition and our failure to effectively compete may prevent us from achieving significant market penetration. Most of our competitors have significantly greater resources, including financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, sales, supply, human resources, or general experience than we do and we may not be able to successfully compete. We compete with a variety of multinational biopharmaceutical companies, specialized biotechnology companies and emerging biotechnology companies, as well as with technologies and product candidates being developed at universities and other research institutions. Our competitors have developed, are developing or will develop product candidates and processes competitive with our product candidates and processes. Competitive therapeutic treatments include those that have already been approved and accepted by the medical community and any new treatments, including those based on novel technology platforms, that enter the market. We believe that a significant number of products are currently under development, and may become commercially available in the future, for the treatment of conditions for which we are trying, or may try, to develop product candidates. There is intense and rapidly evolving competition in the biotechnology, biopharmaceutical and antibody and immunoregulatory therapeutics fields. While we believe that our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms, associated intellectual property and our scientific and technical know-how give us a competitive advantage in this space, competition from many sources exists or may arise in the future. Our competitors include larger and well-funded biopharmaceutical, biotechnological and therapeutics companies, including large and specialty companies focused on cancer immunotherapies and ADCs, as well as numerous small and mid-cap companies. Moreover, we also compete with current and future therapeutics developed at research-stage biotechnology companies, universities and other research institutions.\n\nWe are aware of several companies that are developing ADCs, cytokine derivatives, bispecific antibodies and cancer immunotherapies, including companies developing ADCs directed to the same target as luvelta. For example, Immunogen recently received approval for a folate receptor α targeted ADC, mirvetuximab soravtansine (Elahere®). In addition, large pharmaceutical companies and smaller biotechnology companies are developing other ADCs; and we anticipate more FolRα-targeting ADCs and other potential FolRα-targeting modalities to be evaluated in the clinic in the coming years. Further, other companies may develop ADCs targeting receptors other than folate receptor α for the treatment of the same indications for which we are developing luvelta. Many of these companies are well-capitalized and, in contrast to us, have significant clinical experience, and may include our existing or future collaborators. In addition, these companies compete with us in recruiting scientific and managerial talent.\n\nOur success will depend partially on our ability to develop and protect therapeutics that are safer and more effective than competing products. Our commercial opportunity and success will be reduced or eliminated if competing products are safer, more effective, or less expensive than the therapeutics we develop.\n\nIf our most advanced product candidates are approved, they will compete with a range of therapeutic treatments that are either in development or currently marketed. Currently marketed oncology therapeutics include a range of biologic modalities with the top selling products by class spanning tumor targeting monoclonal antibodies, to ADCs, to immune checkpoint inhibitors, to T cell-engager immunotherapies, and to CAR-T cell therapies. In addition, numerous compounds are in clinical development for cancer treatment. The clinical\n\n60  \n---  \n  \ndevelopment pipeline for cancer includes small molecules, antibodies, vaccines, cell therapies and immunotherapies from a variety of companies and institutions.\n\nFurther, if we successfully obtain approval for any product candidate, we will face competition based on many different factors, including the safety and effectiveness of our products, the ease with which our products can be administered and the extent to which patients accept relatively new routes of administration, the timing and scope of regulatory approvals for these products, the availability and cost of manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities, price, reimbursement, coverage and patent position. Competing products could present superior treatment alternatives, including by being more effective, safer, less expensive, or marketed and sold more effectively than any products we may develop. Competitive products may make any products we develop obsolete or noncompetitive before we recover the expense of developing and commercializing our product candidates.\n\nAny inability to attract and retain qualified key management and technical personnel would impair our ability to implement our business plan.\n\nWe are highly dependent on the research and development, clinical development, manufacturing, and business development expertise of our management team, advisors and other specialized personnel. The loss of one or more members of our management team or other key employees or advisors could delay our research and development programs and have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. The relationships that our key managers have cultivated within our industry make us particularly dependent upon their continued employment with us. We are dependent on the continued service of our technical personnel because of the highly technical nature of our product candidates and XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platform technologies and the specialized nature of the regulatory approval process. Because our management team and key employees are not obligated to provide us with continued service, they could terminate their employment with us at any time without penalty. Our future success will depend in large part on our continued ability to attract and retain other highly qualified scientific, technical and management personnel, as well as personnel with expertise in clinical testing, manufacturing, governmental regulation and commercialization. We face competition for personnel from other companies, universities, public and private research institutions, government entities and other organizations. Should our competitors recruit our key employees, our level of expertise and ability to execute our business plan would be negatively impacted. Further, if we are unable to continue to attract and retain high-quality personnel, the rate and success at which we can discover and develop product candidates will be limited, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nWe will need to grow our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing our growth and expanding our operations.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had 302 full-time employees. As our development and commercialization plans and strategies develop, we expect to expand our employee base for managerial, operational, financial and other resources. In addition, we have limited experience in product development and began our first clinical trial in 2018. As our product candidates enter and advance through preclinical studies and clinical trials, we will need to expand our development, regulatory and manufacturing capabilities or contract with other organizations to provide these capabilities for us. In the future, we expect to have to manage additional relationships with collaborators or partners, suppliers and other organizations. Our ability to manage our operations and future growth will require us to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures. We may not be able to implement improvements to our management information and control systems in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls. Our inability to successfully manage our growth and expand our operations could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nIf any of our product candidates are approved for marketing and commercialization and we are unable to develop sales, marketing and distribution capabilities on our own or enter into agreements with third parties to perform these functions on acceptable terms, we will be unable to commercialize successfully any such future products.\n\nWe currently have limited sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or experience. If any of our product candidates are approved, we will need to develop additional internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities\n\n61  \n---  \n  \nto commercialize such products, which would be expensive and time consuming, or enter into collaborations with third parties to perform these services. If we decide to market our products directly, we will need to commit significant financial and managerial resources to develop a marketing and sales force with technical expertise and supporting distribution, administration and compliance capabilities. If we rely on third parties with such capabilities to market our products or decide to co-promote products with collaborators, we will need to establish and maintain marketing and distribution arrangements with third parties, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into such arrangements on acceptable terms or at all. In entering into third-party marketing or distribution arrangements, any revenue we receive will depend upon the efforts of the third parties and there can be no assurance that such third parties will establish adequate sales and distribution capabilities or be successful in gaining market acceptance of any approved product. If we are not successful in commercializing any product approved in the future, either on our own or through third parties, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nOur future growth may depend, in part, on our ability to operate in foreign markets, where we would be subject to additional regulatory burdens and other risks and uncertainties.\n\nOur future growth may depend, in part, on our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates in foreign markets, for which we may rely on collaboration with third parties. We are not permitted to market or promote any of our product candidates before we receive regulatory approval from the applicable regulatory authority in that foreign market and may never receive such regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. To obtain separate regulatory approval in many other countries, we must comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of such countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials and commercial sales, pricing and distribution of our product candidates, and we cannot predict success in these jurisdictions. If we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements in international markets and do not receive applicable marketing approvals, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our product candidates will be harmed and our business will be adversely affected. We may not obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all. Our failure to obtain approval of any of our product candidates by regulatory authorities in another country may significantly diminish the commercial prospects of that product candidate and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. Moreover, even if we obtain approval of our product candidates and ultimately commercialize our product candidates in foreign markets, we would be subject to the risks and uncertainties, including the burden of complying with complex and changing foreign regulatory, tax, accounting and legal requirements and reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some foreign countries.\n\nPrice controls imposed in either the U.S. or foreign markets may adversely affect our future profitability.\n\nRecently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in recent Executive Orders, several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. Current and future presidential budget proposals and future legislation may contain further drug price control measures that could be enacted. Congress and current and future U.S. presidential administrations may continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. If such pricing controls are enacted and are set at unsatisfactory levels, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nAdditionally, in some countries, particularly member states of the EU, the pricing of prescription drugs is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after receipt of marketing approval for a product. In addition, there can be considerable pressure by governments and other stakeholders on prices and reimbursement levels, including as part of cost containment measures. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various EU member states and parallel distribution, or arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced\n\n62  \n---  \n  \nmember states, can further reduce prices. In some countries, we or current or future collaborators may be required to conduct a clinical trial or other studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of our therapeutic candidates to other available therapies in order to obtain or maintain reimbursement or pricing approval. Publication of discounts by third-party payors or authorities may lead to further pressure on the prices or reimbursement levels within the country of publication and other countries. If reimbursement of any product candidate approved for marketing is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nOur business entails a significant risk of product liability and our ability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nAs we are conducting clinical trials of our product candidates, we may be exposed to significant product liability risks inherent in the development, testing, manufacturing and marketing of therapeutic treatments. Product liability claims could delay or prevent completion of our development programs. If we succeed in marketing products, such claims could result in an FDA investigation of the safety and effectiveness of our products, our manufacturing processes and facilities or our marketing programs and potentially a recall of our products or more serious enforcement action, limitations on the approved indications for which they may be used or suspension or withdrawal of approvals. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may also result in decreased demand for our products, injury to our reputation, costs to defend the related litigation, a diversion of management’s time and our resources, substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients and a decline in our stock price. While we currently have product liability insurance that we believe is appropriate for our stage of development, we may need to obtain higher levels prior to later stages of clinical development or marketing any of our product candidates. Any insurance we have or may obtain may not provide sufficient coverage against potential liabilities. Furthermore, clinical trial and product liability insurance is becoming increasingly expensive. As a result, we may be unable to obtain sufficient insurance at a reasonable cost to protect us against losses caused by product liability claims that could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nOur employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\n\nAs with all companies, we are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations, provide accurate information to the FDA, comply with manufacturing standards we may establish, comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, inappropriately share confidential and proprietary information externally, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, loss of eligibility to obtain approvals from the FDA, exclusion from participation in government contracting, healthcare reimbursement or other government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, or reputational harm.\n\nMoreover, our employees are increasingly utilizing social media tools and our website as a means of communication. Despite our efforts to monitor social media communications, there is risk that the unauthorized use of social media by our employees to communicate about our products or business, or any inadvertent disclosure of material, nonpublic information through these means, may result in violations of applicable laws and\n\n63  \n---  \n  \nregulations, which may give rise to liability and result in harm to our business. In addition, there is also risk of inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information, which could result in significant legal and financial exposure and reputational damages that could potentially have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nWe depend on our information technology systems, and any failure of these systems, or those of our CROs, third-party vendors, or other contractors or consultants we may utilize, could harm our business. Security breaches, cyber-attacks, loss of data, and other disruptions could compromise sensitive information related to our business or other personal information or prevent us from accessing critical information and expose us to liability, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\n\nWe collect, use and store information in digital form that is necessary to conduct our business, and we are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure to operate our business. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, use, store and transmit large amounts of confidential information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information health information, and personal information. We have established physical, electronic and organizational measures designed to safeguard and secure our systems to prevent a data security incident (which may include, for example: data breaches, viruses or other malicious code, coordinated attacks, data loss, phishing attacks, ransomware, denial of service attacks, or other security or information technology incidents caused by threat actors, technological vulnerabilities or human error), and rely on commercially available systems, software, tools, and monitoring to provide security for our information technology systems and the processing, transmission and storage of digital information. We have also outsourced elements of our information technology infrastructure, and as a result, a number of third-party vendors may or could have access to our confidential information subject to contractual protections. Our internal information technology systems and infrastructure, and those of our current and any future collaborators, CROs, third-party vendors, contractors and consultants and other third parties on which we rely, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, malware, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication and electrical failures, cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions over the internet, attachments to emails, persons inside our organization, or persons with access to systems inside our organization.\n\nThe risk of a formal security breach or disruption or data loss, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. For example, targeted deep fakes supported by sophisticated AI tools and other forms of impersonation of our executives are becoming increasingly prevalent. In addition, the prevalent use of mobile devices that access confidential information increases the risk of data security breaches, which could lead to the loss of confidential information or other intellectual property. The costs to us or our CROs or other contractors or consultants we may utilize to mitigate a data security incident and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and while we have implemented security measures designed to protect our data security and information technology systems, our efforts to address these problems may not be successful, and these problems could result in unexpected interruptions, delays, cessation of service and other harm to our business and our competitive position. We have incurred successful phishing attempts in the past, although we believe that these attempts were detected and neutralized without any compromise to our data and prior to any significant impact to our business. We have also implemented measures to prevent such attacks, but we may still be subject to similar attacks in the future. We are also aware of publicly disclosed security breaches at certain third parties on which we rely. If such an event were to occur, whether to us or a third party on which we rely, and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our product development programs. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing or planned clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Further, if we are unable to generate or maintain access to essential patient samples or data for our research, development, and manufacturing activities for our programs, our business could be materially adversely affected.\n\nMoreover, if a computer security breach affects our systems or results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information, our reputation could be materially damaged. Such a breach may require formal notification to governmental agencies, the media or individuals pursuant to various federal and state privacy and security laws, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and its implementing rules and regulations, regulations promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission and state breach\n\n64  \n---  \n  \nnotification laws. We also may be subject to global privacy laws, such as Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. We would also be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and potential liability under laws, regulations and contracts that protect the privacy and security of personal information that may result in regulatory scrutiny, fines, private right of action settlements, and other consequences. Compliance with these and any other applicable privacy and data security laws and regulations is a rigorous and time-intensive process, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules and possible government oversight. Our failure to comply with such laws or to adequately secure the information we hold could result in significant liability or reputational harm and, in turn, a material adverse effect on our client base, member base and revenue.\n\nOur information technology systems could face serious disruptions that could adversely affect our business.\n\nOur information technology and other internal infrastructure systems, including corporate firewalls, servers, leased lines, and connection to the Internet, face the risk of systemic failure that could disrupt our operations. A significant disruption in the availability of our information technology and other internal infrastructure systems could cause interruptions and delays in our research and development and manufacturing work.\n\nIn addition, some of our employees work remotely from time to time, which presents certain risks to our business. For example, remote work presents significant demands on our information technology resources and systems and can be at risk for phishing and other malicious activity, which can result in an increase to the number of points of potential exposure, such as laptops and mobile devices, that need to be secured. Any failure to effectively manage these risks, including to timely identify and appropriately respond to any security incidents, may adversely affect our business.\n\nIn our ongoing efforts to innovate and optimize operational efficiency, we have integrated artificial intelligence, or AI, into various aspects of our workplace. For example, we are implementing AI machine learning for email behavioral monitoring. While AI presents opportunities for enhanced productivity and innovation, it also introduces inherent risks, including legal and regulatory, that could adversely impact our business and reputation. Proper use of AI can lead to improved decision-making, cost reduction, and competitive advantage. However, improper use, including algorithmic biases, ethical considerations, data privacy issues, unknown or zero-day software vulnerabilities, and potential regulatory non-compliance, could result in reputational damage, legal liabilities, and financial losses. The rapidly evolving regulatory landscape surrounding AI also poses a risk, as new laws and regulations could impose additional compliance burdens, resulting in increased operational costs. We are committed to implementing robust governance and control mechanisms to mitigate these risks, but there can be no assurance that such measures will adequately prevent or mitigate the adverse effects that the integration and use of AI may have on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nIf we do not comply with laws regulating the protection of the environment and health and human safety, our business could be affected adversely.\n\nOur research, development and manufacturing involve the use of hazardous chemicals and materials, including radioactive materials. We maintain quantities of various flammable and toxic chemicals in our facilities in South San Francisco and San Carlos, California that are required for our research, development and manufacturing activities. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. We and our third-party contractors are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous chemicals and materials. We believe our and our third-party contractors’ procedures for storing, handling and disposing these materials in our South San Francisco and San Carlos facilities comply with the relevant guidelines of the two municipalities, the county of San Mateo, the state of California and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the U.S. Department of Labor. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards mandated by applicable regulations, including employee and contractor training and procedures regarding safe handling and disposal, the risk of accidental or mistaken contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated. If an accident occurs, we could be held liable for resulting damages, which could be substantial and exceed any available insurance. We are also subject to numerous environmental, health and workplace safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures, exposure to blood-borne pathogens and the handling of animals and biohazardous materials. Although we maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover\n\n65  \n---  \n  \nus for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of these materials or from other hazards potentially present in our workplaces, such as high voltage electricity, process steam or other hot material, liquid nitrogen or other cold material, materials stored under pressure, laboratory instruments that incorporate powerful lasers or magnets, sonic resonance, heavy machinery, and the like, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. While we maintain pollution legal liability insurance for our manufacturing facility in San Carlos, California, we do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological or hazardous materials in our other locations. Additional federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting our operations may be adopted in the future and existing laws and regulations could become more stringent. Further, we may incur substantial costs to comply with, and substantial fines or penalties if we violate, any of these laws or regulations.\n\nWe are subject to certain U.S. and foreign anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, export control, sanctions and other trade laws and regulations. We can face serious consequences for violations.\n\nU.S. and foreign anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, export control, sanctions and other trade laws and regulations prohibit, among other things, companies and their employees, agents, CROs, CMOs, legal counsel, accountants, consultants, contractors and other partners from authorizing, promising, offering, providing, soliciting, or making or receiving directly or indirectly, corrupt or improper payments or anything else of value to or from recipients in the public or private sector. Violations of these laws can result in substantial criminal fines and civil penalties, imprisonment, the loss of trade privileges, debarment, tax reassessments, breach of contract and fraud litigation, reputational harm and other consequences. We have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or government-affiliated hospitals, universities and other organizations. We also expect our non-U.S. activities to increase over time. We expect to rely on third parties for research, preclinical studies and clinical trials and/or to obtain necessary permits, licenses, patent registrations and other marketing authorizations. We can be held liable for corrupt or other illegal activities of our personnel, agents, or partners, even if we do not explicitly authorize or have prior knowledge of such activities.\n\nAny violations of the laws and regulations described above may result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties, imprisonment, the loss of export or import privileges, debarment, tax reassessments, breach of contract and fraud litigation, reputational harm and other consequences.\n\nOur current operations are in two cities in the San Francisco Bay Area, and we, or the third parties upon whom we depend, may be adversely affected by earthquakes, other natural disasters, pandemics or other catastrophic events and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster.\n\nOur current operations are located in our facilities in South San Francisco and San Carlos, California. Any unplanned event, such as earthquake, flood, fire, explosion, extreme weather condition, epidemic, pandemic or contagious disease, power shortage, telecommunication failure or other natural or man-made accidents or incidents that result in us being unable to fully utilize our facilities, or the manufacturing facilities of our third-party contract manufacturers, may have a material and adverse effect on our ability to operate our business, particularly on a daily basis, and have significant negative consequences on our financial and operating conditions. Loss of access to these facilities may result in increased costs, delays in the development of our product candidates or interruption of our business operations. Earthquakes, epidemics, pandemics or contagious diseases, or other natural disasters could further disrupt our operations, and have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. If a natural disaster, power outage, epidemics, pandemics or contagious disease, or other events occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our headquarters, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as our research or manufacturing facilities or the manufacturing facilities of our third-party contract manufacturers, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible, for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. The disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place may prove inadequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. As part of our risk management policy, we maintain insurance coverage at levels that we believe are appropriate for our business. However, in the event of an accident or incident at these facilities, we cannot assure you that the amounts of insurance will be sufficient to satisfy any damages and losses. In addition, the long-term effects of climate change on general economic conditions and the pharmaceutical industry in particular are unclear, and\n\n66  \n---  \n  \nmay heighten or intensify existing risk of natural disasters. If our facilities, or the manufacturing facilities of our third-party contract manufacturers, are unable to operate because of an accident or incident or for any other reason, even for a short period of time, any or all of our research and development programs may be harmed. Further, many of our employees conduct business outside of our leased or owned facilities and these locations may be subject to additional security risks outside of our control. Any business interruption could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nChanges in tax laws or regulations that are applied adversely to us or our customers may have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.\n\nNew income, sales, use or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition. Further, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be interpreted, changed, modified or applied adversely to us. For example, legislation enacted in 2017, informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the 2017 Tax Act, enacted many significant changes to the U.S. tax laws. Beginning in 2022, the 2017 Tax Act eliminates the option to currently deduct research and development expenditures and requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize U.S. based and non-U.S. based research and development expenditures over five and fifteen years, respectively, pursuant to IRC Section 174. Although there have been legislative proposals to repeal or defer the capitalization requirement to later years, there can be no assurance that the provision will be repealed or otherwise modified. We also cannot predict whether, when, in what form, or with what effective dates, tax laws, regulations and rulings may be enacted, promulgated or issued, which could result in an increase in our or our stockholders’ tax liability or require changes in the manner in which we operate in order to minimize or mitigate any adverse effects of changes in tax law. Changes in corporate tax rates, the realization of net deferred tax assets relating to our operations, or future reform legislation could have a material impact on the value of our deferred tax assets, could result in significant one-time charges, and could increase our future U.S. tax expense.\n\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset taxable income could be limited.\n\nUnder current law, our net operating loss carryforwards generated in tax years ending on or prior to December 31, 2017, are permitted to be carried forward for 20 years and our federal net operating losses generated in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such federal net operating losses, is limited to 80% of taxable income (without regard to certain deductions).\n\nIn addition, under Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and corresponding provisions of state law, if we experience an “ownership change” which is generally defined as a greater than 50% change, by value, in its equity ownership over a three-year period, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards to offset our post-change income may be limited. Based on Section 382 studies performed for certain prior periods, we experienced an ownership change on November 20, 2019 and December 31, 2022, which imposed limitations on the use of our net operating losses arising before that date. In addition, we may have experienced other ownership changes in the past and may also experience ownership changes in the future as a result of equity offerings or other shifts in our stock ownership, some of which are outside our control. As a result, our use of federal NOL carryforwards could be limited. State net operating loss carryforwards may be similarly limited. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of net operating losses is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed. Any such limitations may result in greater tax liabilities than we would incur in the absence of such limitations and any increased liabilities could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nOur investment in Vaxcyte is subject to risk\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we held Vaxcyte common stock with a fair value of $41.9 million. Vaxcyte common stock is publicly traded and therefore subject to the various risk factors associated with any publicly traded company, including risks associated with Vaxcyte’s business, its business outlook, cash flow requirements and financial performance, the state of the market and the general economic climate, including the impact of health pandemics, regional geopolitical conflicts, changes in interest rates, inflation, potential uncertainty with respect to the debt ceiling and potential government shutdowns related thereto. Vaxcyte common stock has been subject to substantial volatility, and the change in fair value of our interests in Vaxcyte will materially impact our reported net income or net loss in our financial statements.\n\n67  \n---  \n  \nOur cash and investments could be adversely affected if the financial institutions in which we hold our cash and investments fail.\n\nWe regularly maintain cash balances at third-party financial institutions in excess of the FDIC insurance limit and similar regulatory insurance limits outside the United States and governments may not guarantee all depositors if such financial institutions were to fail, as the U.S. government did in 2023 with Silicon Valley Bank depositors, in the event of further bank closures and continued instability in the global banking system. Any future adverse developments in the global banking system could directly or indirectly negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Further, if we enter into a credit, loan or other similar facility with a financial institution, certain covenants included in such facility may require as security that we keep a significant portion of our cash with the institution providing such facility. If a depository institution where we maintain deposits fails or is subject to adverse conditions in the financial or credit markets, we may not be able to recover all, if any, of our deposits, which could adversely impact our operating liquidity and financial performance.\n\nOur financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\n\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or the FASB, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. For example, in May 2014, the FASB issued accounting standards update No. 2014-09 (Topic 606), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. We adopted this new accounting standard as of January 1, 2019. Any difficulties in implementing this guidance could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, which could result in regulatory discipline and harm investors’ confidence in us. Additionally, the implementation of this guidance or a change in other principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our financial results, and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change. Furthermore, we have adopted Topic 606 through the modified retrospective method. This will impact the comparability of our financial results, which might lead investors to draw incorrect conclusions that could harm investor interest in holding or purchasing our equity.\n\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\n\nIf we are not able to obtain, maintain and enforce sufficient patent and other intellectual property protection for our technologies or product candidates, development and commercialization of our product candidates may be adversely affected.\n\nOur success depends in part on our, our licensor’s and our collaborators’ ability to obtain and maintain patents and other forms of intellectual property rights, including in-licenses of intellectual property rights of others, for our product candidates, methods used to manufacture our product candidates and methods for treating patients using our product candidates, as well as our ability to preserve our trade secrets, to prevent third parties from infringing upon our proprietary rights and to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. We, our licensors and collaborators may not be able to apply for patents on certain aspects of our product candidates in a timely fashion or at all. Further, we, our licensors and collaborators may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications, or maintain, enforce and license any patents that may issue from such patent applications, at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we, our licensors and collaborators will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. It is also possible that we, our licensors, and our collaborators will fail to file patent applications covering inventions made in the course of development and commercialization activities before a competitor or another third party files a patent application covering, or publishes information disclosing, a similar, independently-developed invention. Such competitor’s patent application may pose obstacles to our ability to obtain or limit the scope of patent protection we may obtain. We may not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of all patent applications that we license from third parties, or to maintain the rights to patents licensed to third parties. Therefore, these patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. If our licensors or collaborators fail to establish, maintain or protect such patents and other intellectual property rights, such rights may be reduced or eliminated. If our licensors, licensees or collaborators are not fully cooperative or disagree with us as to the prosecution, maintenance or enforcement of any patent rights, such patent rights could be compromised. Also, although we enter into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to confidential or\n\n68  \n---  \n  \npatentable aspects of our research and development output, such as our employees, collaborators, CROs, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose such output before a patent application is filed, thereby jeopardizing our ability to seek patent protection. In addition, publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we, our licensors or collaborators were the first to make the inventions claimed in our patents or pending patent applications, or were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions, or if such patents rights may otherwise become invalid. Composition of matter patents for biological and pharmaceutical therapeutic candidates often provide a strong form of intellectual property protection for those types of products, as such patents provide protection without regard to any method of use. We cannot be certain that the claims in our pending patent applications directed to composition of matter of our therapeutic candidates will be considered patentable by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) or by patent offices in foreign countries, or that the claims in any of our issued patents will be considered valid and enforceable by courts in the United States or foreign countries. Method of use patents protect the use of a product for the specified method. This type of patent does not prevent a competitor from making and marketing a product that is identical to our therapeutics for an indication that is outside the scope of the patented method. Moreover, even if competitors do not actively promote their product for our targeted indications, clinicians may prescribe these products “off-label.” Although off-label prescriptions may infringe or contribute to the infringement of method of use patents, the practice is common and such infringement is difficult to prevent or prosecute. Our existing issued and granted patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from using our technology or from developing competing products and technology. There is no guarantee that any of our pending patent applications will result in issued or granted patents, that any of our issued or granted patents will not later be found to be invalid or unenforceable or that any issued or granted patents will include claims that are sufficiently broad to cover our product candidates or to provide meaningful protection from our competitors. Moreover, the patent position of biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies can be highly uncertain because it involves complex legal and factual questions. We will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our current and future proprietary technology and product candidates are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. If third parties disclose or misappropriate our proprietary rights, it may materially and adversely affect our position in the market.\n\nThe U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other provisions during the patent process. There are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, competitors might be able to enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the case. The standards applied by the USPTO and foreign patent offices in granting patents are not always applied uniformly or predictably. For example, there is no uniform worldwide policy regarding patentable subject matter or the scope of claims allowable in biotechnology and biopharmaceutical patents. As such, we do not know the degree of future protection that we will have on our proprietary products and technology. While we will endeavor to try to protect our product candidates with intellectual property rights such as patents, as appropriate, the process of obtaining patents is time consuming, expensive and sometimes unpredictable.\n\nOnce granted, patents may remain open to opposition, interference, re-examination, post-grant review, inter partes review, nullification or derivation action in court or before patent offices or similar proceedings for a given period after allowance or grant, during which time third parties can raise objections against such initial grant. In the course of such proceedings, which may continue for a protracted period of time, the patent owner may be compelled to limit the scope of the allowed or granted claims thus attacked, or may lose the allowed or granted claims altogether. In addition, there can be no assurance that:\n\n•\n\nothers will not or may not be able to make, use or sell compounds that are the same as or similar to our product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or license;\n\n•\n\nwe or our licensors, or our existing or future collaborators are the first to make the inventions covered by each of our issued patents and pending patent applications that we own or license;\n\n•\n\nwe or our licensors, or our existing or future collaborators are the first to file patent applications covering certain aspects of our inventions;\n\n69  \n---  \n  \n•\n\nothers will not independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights;\n\n•\n\na third party may not challenge our patents and, if challenged, a court would hold that our patents are valid, enforceable and infringed;\n\n•\n\nany issued patents that we own or have licensed will provide us with any competitive advantages, or will not be challenged by third parties;\n\n•\n\nwe may develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;\n\n•\n\nthe patents of others will not have a material or adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects; and\n\n•\n\nour competitors may conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have enforceable patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets.\n\nIf we or our licensors or collaborators fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering our product candidates, our competitors might be able to enter the market, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nIn addition, our in-licensed patents may be subject to a reservation of rights by the licensor, its affiliates and one or more third parties. When new technologies are developed with government funding, the government generally obtains certain rights in any resulting patents, including a non-exclusive license authorizing the government to use the invention for noncommercial purposes. These rights may permit the government to disclose our confidential information to third parties or allow third parties to use our licensed technology. The government can also exercise its march-in rights if it determines that action is necessary because we fail to achieve practical application of the government-funded technology, because action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs, to meet requirements of federal regulations, or to give preference to U.S. industry. In addition, our rights in such inventions may be subject to certain requirements to manufacture products embodying such inventions in the United States. Any of the foregoing could harm our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\n\nIn addition to seeking patent protection for certain aspects of our product candidates, we also consider trade secrets, including confidential and unpatented know-how important to the maintenance of our competitive position. We protect trade secrets and confidential and unpatented know-how, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to such knowledge, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, CROs, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants that obligate them to maintain confidentiality and assign their inventions to us. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time- consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\n70  \n---  \n  \nOther companies or organizations may challenge our or our licensors’ patent rights or may assert patent rights that prevent us from developing and commercializing our products.\n\nTherapeutics in oncology or other disease areas developed in cell-free-based synthesis systems are a relatively new scientific field. We have obtained grants and issuances of, and have obtained a license from a third party on an exclusive basis to, patents related to our proprietary XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms. The issued patents and pending patent applications in the United States and in key markets around the world that we own or license claim many different methods, compositions and processes relating to the discovery, development, manufacture and commercialization of antibody-based and other therapeutics.\n\nAs the field of antibody-based therapeutics continues to mature, patent applications are being processed by national patent offices around the world. There is uncertainty about which patents will issue and, if they do, as to when, to whom, and with what claims. In addition, third parties may attempt to invalidate our intellectual property rights. Even if our rights are not directly challenged, disputes could lead to the weakening of our intellectual property rights. Our defense against any attempt by third parties to circumvent or invalidate our intellectual property rights could be costly to us, could require significant time and attention of our management and could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects or our ability to successfully compete.\n\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\n\nObtaining a valid and enforceable issued or granted patent covering our technology in the United States and worldwide can be extremely costly, and our or our licensors’ or collaborators’ intellectual property rights may not exist in some countries outside the United States or may be less extensive in some countries than in the United States. In jurisdictions where we or our licensors or collaborators have not obtained patent protection, competitors may seek to use our or their technology to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we or they have patent protection, but where it is more difficult to enforce a patent as compared to the United States. Competitor products may compete with our future products in jurisdictions where we do not have issued or granted patents or where our or our licensors’ or collaborators’ issued or granted patent claims or other intellectual property rights are not sufficient to prevent competitor activities in these jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, make it difficult to enforce patents and such countries may not recognize other types of intellectual property protection, particularly relating to biopharmaceuticals. This could make it difficult for us or our licensors or collaborators to prevent the infringement of our or their patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our or their proprietary rights generally in certain jurisdictions. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our and our licensors’ or collaborators’ efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our and our licensors’ or collaborators’ patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our and our licensors’ or collaborators’ patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us or our licensors or collaborators. We or our licensors or collaborators may not prevail in any lawsuits that we or our licensors or collaborators initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful.\n\nWe generally file a provisional patent application first (a priority filing) at the USPTO. An international application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, PCT, is usually filed within twelve months after the priority filing. Based on the PCT filing, national and regional patent applications may be filed in the United States, EU, Japan, Australia and Canada and, depending on the individual case, also in any or all of, inter alia, Brazil, China, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa, South Korea and other jurisdictions. We have so far not filed for patent protection in all national and regional jurisdictions where such protection may be available. In addition, we may decide to abandon national and regional patent applications before grant. Finally, the grant proceeding of each national or regional patent is an independent proceeding which may lead to situations in which applications might in some jurisdictions be refused by the relevant registration authorities, while granted by others. It is also quite common that depending on the country, various scopes of patent protection may be granted on the same product candidate or technology.\n\nGeopolitical actions in the United States and in foreign countries could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution or maintenance of patent applications and the maintenance, enforcement or defense of issued patents. For example, the United States and foreign government actions related to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine may limit or prevent filing, prosecution and maintenance of patent applications in Russia. Government\n\n71  \n---  \n  \nactions may also prevent maintenance of issued patents in Russia. These actions could result in abandonment or lapse of patents or patent applications, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in Russia. If such an event were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, a decree was adopted by the Russian government in March 2022, allowing Russian companies and individuals to exploit inventions owned by patentees that have citizenship or nationality in, are registered in, or have predominately primary place of business or profit-making activities in the United States and other countries that Russia has deemed unfriendly without consent or compensation. Consequently, we would not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in Russia or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into Russia. Accordingly, our competitive position may be impaired, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected.\n\nThe laws of some jurisdictions do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws in the United States, and many companies have encountered significant difficulties in protecting and defending such rights in such jurisdictions. If we or our licensors or collaborators encounter difficulties in protecting, or are otherwise precluded from effectively protecting, the intellectual property rights important for our business in such jurisdictions, the value of these rights may be diminished and we may face additional competition from others in those jurisdictions. Many countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of such patent. If we or any of our licensors or collaborators are forced to grant a license to third parties with respect to any patents relevant to our business, our competitive position in the relevant jurisdiction may be impaired and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected.\n\nEuropean patent applications now have the option, upon grant of a patent, of becoming a Unitary Patent which will be subject to the jurisdiction of the Unitary Patent Court, or UPC. This will be a significant change in European patent practice. As the UPC is a new court system, there is very limited precedent for the court, increasing the uncertainty of any litigation. Limited information is available to make judgments about advantages and disadvantages of either opting into or remaining out of UPC jurisdiction; either choice may ultimately prove to have significant implications as to cost, enforceability and scope of protection, among other factors, for applicable European patents.\n\nWe, our licensors or collaborators, or any future strategic partners may need to resort to litigation to protect or enforce our patents or other proprietary rights, all of which could be costly, time consuming, delay or prevent the development and commercialization of our product candidates, or put our patents and other proprietary rights at risk.\n\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or other intellectual property. If we were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering one of our products or our technology, the defendant could counterclaim that our patent is invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, for example, lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that an individual connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability during patent litigation is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on one or more of our products or certain aspects of our platform technology. Such a loss of patent protection could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Interference or derivation proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by us or declared by the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or if a non-exclusive license is offered and our competitors gain access to the same technology. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results\n\n72  \n---  \n  \nof hearings, motions, or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Patents and other intellectual property rights also will not protect our technology if competitors design around our protected technology without legally infringing our patents or other intellectual property rights.\n\nWe may not identify relevant third-party patents or may incorrectly interpret the relevance, scope or expiration of a third-party patent, which might adversely affect our ability to develop and market our therapeutics.\n\nAs the biopharmaceutical industry expands and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our product candidates may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent rights of third parties. There can be no assurance that our operations do not, or will not in the future, infringe existing or future third-party patents. Identification of third-party patent rights that may be relevant to our operations is difficult because patent searching is imperfect due to differences in terminology among patents, incomplete databases and the difficulty in assessing the meaning of patent claims. We cannot guarantee that any of our patent searches or analyses, including the identification of relevant patents, the scope of patent claims or the expiration of relevant patents, are complete or thorough, nor can we be certain that we have identified each and every third-party patent and pending application in the United States and abroad that is relevant to or necessary for the commercialization of our therapeutic candidates in any jurisdiction.\n\nNumerous U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications exist in our market that are owned by third parties. Our competitors in both the United States and abroad, many of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in patent portfolios and competing technologies, may have applied for or obtained or may in the future apply for and obtain, patents that will prevent, limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make, use and sell our therapeutics. We do not always conduct independent reviews of pending patent applications of and patents issued to third parties. Patent applications in the United States and elsewhere are typically published approximately 18 months after the earliest filing for which priority is claimed, with such earliest filing date being commonly referred to as the priority date. Certain U.S. applications that will not be filed outside the U.S. can remain confidential until patents issue. In addition, patent applications in the United States and elsewhere can be pending for many years before issuance, or unintentionally abandoned patents or applications can be revived. Furthermore, pending patent applications that have been published can, subject to certain limitations, be later amended in a manner that could cover our technologies, our therapeutics or the use of our therapeutics. As such, there may be applications of others now pending or recently revived patents of which we are unaware. These patent applications may later result in issued patents, or the revival of previously abandoned patents, that will prevent, limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make, use or sell our therapeutics.\n\nThe scope of a patent claim is determined by an interpretation of the law, the written disclosure in a patent and the patent’s prosecution history. Our interpretation of the relevance or the scope of a patent or a pending application may be incorrect. For example, we may incorrectly determine that our therapeutics are not covered by a third-party patent or may incorrectly predict whether a third-party’s pending application will issue with claims of relevant scope. Our determination of the expiration date of any patent in the United States or abroad that we consider relevant may be incorrect. Our failure to identify and correctly interpret relevant patents may negatively impact our ability to develop and market our product candidates.\n\nWe cannot provide any assurances that third-party patents do not exist which might be enforced against our current technology, including our research programs, product candidates, their respective methods of use, manufacture and formulations thereof, and could result in either an injunction prohibiting our manufacture or future sales, or, with respect to our future sales, an obligation on our part to pay royalties and/or other forms of compensation to third parties, which could be significant.\n\nIntellectual property rights of third parties could adversely affect our ability to commercialize our product candidates, and we, our licensors or collaborators, or any future strategic partners may become subject to third party claims or litigation alleging infringement of patents or other proprietary rights or seeking to invalidate patents or other proprietary rights. We might be required to litigate or obtain\n\n73  \n---  \n  \nlicenses from third parties in order to develop or market our product candidates. Such litigation or licenses could be costly or not available on commercially reasonable terms.\n\nWe, our licensors or collaborators, or any future strategic partners may be subject to third-party claims for infringement or misappropriation of patent or other proprietary rights. There is a substantial amount of litigation, both within and outside the United States, involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences, oppositions and inter partes review proceedings before the USPTO, and corresponding foreign patent offices. For example, one of our European patents related to technology auxiliary to our XpressCF® platform is involved in an opposition proceeding at the European Patent Office, or EPO, and was revoked by the EPO in 2021. In April 2022, an appeal was filed; the process for this appeal is ongoing. This may prevent us from asserting this patent against our competitors practicing otherwise infringing methods in relevant European countries where this patent has been granted. There are many issued and pending patents that might claim aspects of our product candidates and modifications that we may need to apply to our product candidates. There are also many issued patents that claim antibodies, portions of antibodies, cytokines, half-life extending polymers, linkers, cytotoxins, or other warheads that may be relevant for the products we wish to develop. Thus, it is possible that one or more organizations will hold patent rights to which we will need a license. If those organizations refuse to grant us a license to such patent rights on reasonable terms, we may be delayed or may not be able to market products or perform research and development or other activities covered by these patents which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We are obligated under certain of our license and collaboration agreements to indemnify and hold harmless our licensors or collaborators for damages arising from intellectual property infringement by use. For example, we are obligated under the Stanford Agreement to indemnify and hold harmless Stanford for damages arising from intellectual property infringement by us resulting from exercise of the license from Stanford. If we, our licensors or collaborators, or any future strategic partners are found to infringe a third-party patent or other intellectual property rights, we could be required to pay damages, potentially including treble damages, if we are found to have infringed willfully. In addition, we, our licensors or collaborators, or any future strategic partners may choose to seek, or be required to seek, a license from a third party, which may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Even if a license can be obtained on acceptable terms, the rights may be non-exclusive, which could give our competitors access to the same technology or intellectual property rights licensed to us. If we fail to obtain a required license, we or our existing or future collaborators may be unable to effectively market product candidates based on our technology, which could limit our ability to generate revenue or achieve profitability and possibly prevent us from generating revenue sufficient to sustain our operations. In addition, we may find it necessary to pursue claims or initiate lawsuits to protect or enforce our patent or other intellectual property rights. The cost to us in defending or initiating any litigation or other proceeding relating to patent or other proprietary rights, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial, and litigation could divert our management’s attention. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could delay our research and development efforts and limit our ability to continue our operations.\n\nBecause the antibody-based therapeutics landscape is still evolving, it is difficult to conclusively assess our freedom to operate without infringing on third-party rights. There are numerous companies that have pending patent applications and issued patents broadly covering antibodies generally, covering antibodies directed against the same targets as, or targets similar to, those we are pursuing, or covering linkers and cytotoxic warheads similar to those that we are using in our product candidates. For example, we are aware of an issued patent, expected to expire in 2031, that relates to strained alkyne reagents that can be used as synthetic precursors for certain of our linker-warheads. We are further aware of an issued patent, expected to expire in 2034, relating to certain conjugates comprising a genus of hemiasterlin derivatives that may be potentially relevant to products incorporating our hemiasterlin-derived linker-warhead. If any of these patents are valid and not yet expired when, and if, we receive marketing approval for luvelta, as applicable, we may need to seek a license to one or more of these patents, each of which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to receive a license to any of these patents, or other potentially relevant patents currently unknown to us, could delay commercialization of any or all of luvelta, STRO-003 or STRO-004. Our competitive position may suffer if patents issued to third parties or other third-party intellectual property rights cover our products or product candidates or elements thereof, or our manufacture or uses relevant to our development plans. In such cases, we may not be in a position to develop or commercialize products or product candidates until such patents expire or unless we successfully pursue litigation to nullify or invalidate the third-party intellectual property right concerned, or enter\n\n74  \n---  \n  \ninto a license agreement with the intellectual property right holder, if available on commercially reasonable terms. There may be issued patents of which we are not aware, held by third parties that, if found to be valid and enforceable, could be alleged to be infringed by our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms and related technologies and product candidates. There also may be pending patent applications of which we are not aware that may result in issued patents, which could be alleged to be infringed by our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms and related technologies and product candidates. If such an infringement claim should be brought and be successful, we may be required to pay substantial damages, including potentially treble damages and attorneys’ fees for willful infringement, and we may be forced to abandon our product candidates or seek a license from any patent holders. No assurances can be given that a license will be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\n\nIt is also possible that we have failed to identify relevant third-party patents or applications. For example, U.S. applications filed before November 29, 2000, and certain U.S. applications filed after that date that will not be filed outside the United States remain confidential until patents issue. Patent applications in the United States and elsewhere are published approximately 18 months after the earliest filing for which priority is claimed, with such earliest filing date being commonly referred to as the priority date. Therefore, patent applications covering our products or platform technologies could have been filed by others without our knowledge. Additionally, pending patent applications that have been published can, subject to certain limitations, be later amended in a manner that could cover our platform technologies, our products or the use of our products. Third-party intellectual property right holders may also actively bring infringement claims against us. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully settle or otherwise resolve such infringement claims. If we are unable to successfully settle future claims on terms acceptable to us, we may be required to engage in or continue costly, unpredictable and time-consuming litigation and may be prevented from or experience substantial delays in marketing our products. Parties making claims against us may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation or administrative proceedings, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have material adverse effect on our ability to raise additional funds or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. If we fail in any such dispute, in addition to being forced to pay damages, we may be temporarily or permanently prohibited from commercializing any of our product candidates that are held to be infringing. We might, if possible, also be forced to redesign product candidates so that we no longer infringe the third-party intellectual property rights. Any of these events, even if we were ultimately to prevail, could require us to divert substantial financial and management resources that we would otherwise be able to devote to our business and could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nIntellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.\n\nLitigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims, with or without merit, is unpredictable and generally expensive and time consuming and is likely to divert significant resources from our core business, including distracting our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Moreover, such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities.\n\nWe may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources and more mature and developed intellectual property portfolios. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating or from successfully challenging our intellectual property rights. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace.\n\n75  \n---  \n  \nIf we fail to comply with our obligations under any license, collaboration or other agreements, we may be required to pay damages and could lose intellectual property rights that are necessary for developing and protecting our product candidates or we could lose certain rights to grant sublicenses.\n\nOur current licenses impose, and any future licenses we enter into are likely to impose, various development, commercialization, funding, milestone, royalty, diligence, sublicensing, insurance, patent prosecution and enforcement and/or other obligations on us. If we breach any of these obligations, or use the intellectual property licensed to us in an unauthorized manner, we may be required to pay damages and the licensor may have the right to terminate the license, which could result in us being unable to develop, manufacture and sell any future products that are covered by the licensed technology or enable a competitor to gain access to the licensed technology. Moreover, our licensors may own or control intellectual property that has not been licensed to us and, as a result, we may be subject to claims, regardless of their merit, that we are infringing or otherwise violating the licensor’s rights. In addition, while we cannot determine currently the amount of the royalty obligations we would be required to pay on sales of future products, if any, the amounts may be significant. The amount of our future royalty obligations will depend on the technology and intellectual property we use in products that we successfully develop and commercialize, if any. Therefore, even if we successfully develop and commercialize products, we may be unable to achieve or maintain profitability.\n\nMoreover, disputes may arise regarding intellectual property subject to a licensing agreement, including:\n\n•\n\nthe scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues;\n\n•\n\nthe extent to which our product candidates, technologies and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the licensing agreement;\n\n•\n\nthe sublicensing of patent and other rights under our collaborative development relationships;\n\n•\n\nour diligence obligations under the license agreement and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations;\n\n•\n\nthe inventorship and ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors and us and our partners; and\n\n•\n\nthe priority of invention of patented technology.\n\nIn addition, the agreements under which we currently license intellectual property or technology from third parties are complex, and certain provisions in such agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations. The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what we believe to be the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology, or increase what we believe to be our financial or other obligations under the relevant agreement, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. Moreover, if disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on commercially acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations, and prospects.\n\nWe may be subject to claims that we or our employees or consultants have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of our employees’ or consultants’ former employers or their clients. These claims may be costly to defend and if we do not successfully do so, we may be required to pay monetary damages and may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel.\n\nMany of our employees were previously employed at universities or biotechnology or biopharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although no claims against us are currently pending, we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. A loss of key research personnel or their work product\n\n76  \n---  \n  \ncould hamper our ability to commercialize, or prevent us from commercializing, our product candidates, which could severely harm our business. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\n\nPatent terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our product candidates for an adequate amount of time.\n\nPatents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, if all maintenance fees are timely paid, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years from its earliest U.S. non-provisional filing date. Various extensions may be available, but the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Even if patents covering our product candidates are obtained, once the patent life has expired, we may be open to competition from competitive products, including generics or biosimilars. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\n\nDepending upon the timing, duration and conditions of any FDA marketing approval of our product candidates, one or more of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, and similar legislation in the European Union. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent term extension of up to five years for a patent covering an approved product as compensation for effective patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, we may not receive an extension if we fail to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process, fail to apply within applicable deadlines, fail to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise fail to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the length of the extension could be less than we request. Only one patent per approved product can be extended, the extension cannot extend the total patent term beyond 14 years from approval and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension or the term of any such extension is less than we request, the period during which we can enforce our patent rights for the applicable product candidate will be shortened and our competitors may obtain approval to market competing products sooner. As a result, our revenue from applicable products could be reduced. Further, if this occurs, our competitors may take advantage of our investment in development and trials by referencing our clinical and preclinical data and launch their product earlier than might otherwise be the case, and our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially harmed.\n\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\n\nPeriodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and/or applications will be due to be paid to the USPTO and various governmental patent agencies outside of the United States in several stages over the lifetime of the patents and/or applications. We have systems in place to remind us to pay these fees, and we employ an outside firm and/or rely on our outside counsel to pay these fees due to non-U.S. patent agencies. The USPTO and various non-U.S. governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. We employ reputable law firms and other professionals to help us comply, and in many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. However, there are situations in which non-compliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, our competitors might be able to enter the market and this circumstance would have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nChanges in U.S. patent and ex-U.S. patent laws could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products.\n\nChanges in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States or in other ex-U.S. jurisdictions could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of patent applications and the enforcement or defense of issued patents. In the United States, numerous recent changes to the patent laws and\n\n77  \n---  \n  \nproposed changes to the rules of the USPTO that may have a significant impact on our ability to protect our technology and enforce our intellectual property rights. For example, the America Invents Act, enacted within the last several years involves significant changes in patent legislation. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, some of which cases either narrow the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weaken the rights of patent owners in certain situations. For example, the decision by the U.S. Supreme Court in Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc. precludes a claim to a nucleic acid having a stated nucleotide sequence that is identical to a sequence found in nature and unmodified. We currently are not aware of an immediate impact of this decision on our patents or patent applications because we are developing product candidates that contain modifications that we believe are not found in nature. However, this decision has yet to be clearly interpreted by courts and by the USPTO. We cannot assure you that the interpretations of this decision or subsequent rulings will not adversely impact our patents or patent applications. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts and the USPTO, and similar legislative and regulatory bodies in other countries in which we may pursue patent protection, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability toobtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future.We may become subject to claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our patents and other intellectual property.\n\nWe may be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an interest in our patents or other intellectual property as an inventor or co-inventor. The failure to name the proper inventors on a patent application can result in the patents issuing thereon being unenforceable. Inventorship disputes may arise from conflicting views regarding the contributions of different individuals named as inventors, the effects of foreign laws where foreign nationals are involved in the development of the subject matter of the patent, conflicting obligations of third parties involved in developing our product candidates or as a result of questions regarding co-ownership of potential joint inventions. Litigation may be necessary to resolve these and other claims challenging inventorship or ownership. Alternatively, or additionally, we may enter into agreements to clarify the scope of our rights in such intellectual property. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, valuable intellectual property. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.\n\nOur current or future licensors may have relied on third-party consultants or collaborators or on funds from third parties, such as the U.S. government, such that our licensors are not the sole and exclusive owners of the patents we in-licensed. If other third parties have ownership rights or other rights to our in-licensed patents, they may be able to license such patents to our competitors, and our competitors could market competing products and technology. This could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial conditions, results of operations, and prospects.\n\nIn addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the conception or development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who, in fact, conceives or develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. The assignment of intellectual property rights may not be self-executing, or the assignment agreements may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims that they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property. Such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\n\nIf our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be adversely affected.\n\nOur trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented or declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks. We may not be able to protect our rights to these trademarks and trade names or may be forced to stop using these names, which we need for name recognition by potential partners or customers in our markets of interest. If we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, we may not be able to compete effectively, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\n78  \n---  \n  \nRisks Related to Government Regulation\n\nWe and/or our collaborators may be unable to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, U.S. or foreign regulatory approval and, as a result, unable to commercialize our product candidates.\n\nOur product candidates are subject to extensive governmental regulations relating to, among other things, research, testing, development, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, approval, recordkeeping, reporting, labeling, storage, packaging, advertising and promotion, pricing, marketing and distribution of drugs and therapeutic biologics. Rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory approval process are required to be completed successfully in the United States and in many foreign jurisdictions before a new drug or therapeutic biologic can be marketed. Satisfaction of these and other regulatory requirements is costly, time consuming, uncertain and subject to unanticipated delays. It is possible that none of the product candidates we may develop, either alone or with our collaborators, will obtain the regulatory approvals necessary for us or our existing or future collaborators to begin selling them.\n\nAlthough some of our employees have experience in conducting and managing clinical trials from prior employment at other companies, we, as a company, have no prior experience in conducting and managing the clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approvals, including approval by the FDA. The time required to obtain FDA and other approvals is unpredictable but typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials, depending upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate, and may be further delayed due to one or more temporary federal government shutdowns. The standards that the FDA and its foreign counterparts use when regulating us require judgment and can change, which makes it difficult to predict with certainty their application. Any analysis we perform of data from preclinical and clinical activities is subject to confirmation and interpretation by regulatory authorities, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. We or our collaborators may also encounter unexpected delays or increased costs due to new government regulations, for example, from future legislation or administrative action, or from changes in FDA policy during the period of product development, clinical trials and FDA regulatory review. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, or whether FDA or foreign regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or the impact of such changes, if any. For example, the Oncology Center of Excellence within the FDA has recently advanced Project Optimus, which is an initiative to reform the dose optimization and dose selection paradigm in oncology drug development to emphasize selection of an optimal dose, which is a dose or doses that maximizes not only the efficacy of a drug but the safety and tolerability as well. This shift from the prior approach, which generally determined the maximum tolerated dose, may require sponsors to spend additional time and resources to further explore a product candidate’s dose-response relationship to facilitate optimum dose selection in a target population. Other recent Oncology Center of Excellence initiatives have included Project FrontRunner, a new initiative with a goal of developing a framework for identifying candidate drugs for initial clinical development in the earlier advanced setting rather than for treatment of patients who have received numerous prior lines of therapies or have exhausted available treatment options. We are considering these policy changes as they relate to our programs. We may also be affected by ex-US regulatory requirements, given that our trials may be conducted globally; current and unforeseen new EU-specific clinical trial conduct regulations, such as IVDR and GDPR, may delay, or increase the difficulty and expense of conducting, our clinical studies.\n\nGiven that the product candidates we are developing, either alone or with our collaborators, represent a new approach to the manufacturing and type of therapeutic biologics, the FDA and its foreign counterparts have not yet established any definitive policies, practices or guidelines in relation to these product candidates. Moreover, the FDA may respond to any BLA that we may submit by defining requirements that we do not anticipate. Such responses could delay clinical development of our product candidates. In addition, because there may be approved treatments for some of the diseases for which we may seek approval, in order to receive regulatory approval, we may need to demonstrate through clinical trials that the product candidates we develop to treat these diseases, if any, are not only safe and effective, but safer or more effective than existing products. Furthermore, in recent years, there has been increased public and political pressure on the FDA with respect to the approval process for new drugs and therapeutic biologics, and FDA standards, especially regarding product safety, appear to have become more stringent.\n\nAny delay or failure in obtaining required approvals could have a material and adverse effect on our ability to generate revenues from the particular product candidate for which we are seeking approval. Furthermore, any regulatory approval to market a product may be subject to limitations on the approved uses for which we may market the product or on the labeling or other restrictions. In addition, the FDA has the authority to require a risk\n\n79  \n---  \n  \nevaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, as part of a BLA or after approval, which may impose further requirements or restrictions on the distribution or use of an approved biologic, such as limiting prescribing to certain physicians or medical centers that have undergone specialized training, limiting treatment to patients who meet certain safe-use criteria and requiring treated patients to enroll in a registry. These limitations and restrictions may limit the size of the market for the product and affect reimbursement by third-party payors.\n\nWe are also subject to numerous foreign regulatory requirements governing, among other things, the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing and marketing authorization, pricing and third-party reimbursement. The foreign regulatory approval process varies among countries and may include all of the risks associated with FDA approval process described above, as well as risks attributable to the satisfaction of local regulations in foreign jurisdictions. Moreover, the time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. FDA approval does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities outside the United States and vice versa. Any delay or failure to obtain U.S. or foreign regulatory approval for a product candidate could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nDelays in obtaining regulatory approval of our manufacturing process may delay or disrupt our commercialization efforts. To date, no product using a cell-free manufacturing process in the United States has received approval from the FDA.\n\nBefore we can begin to commercially manufacture our product candidates in third-party or our own facilities, we must obtain regulatory approval from the FDA for a BLA that describes in detail the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls for the product. A manufacturing authorization must also be obtained from the appropriate EU regulatory authorities. The timeframe required to obtain such approval or authorization is uncertain. In addition, we must pass a pre-approval inspection of our manufacturing facility by the FDA before any of our product candidates can obtain marketing approval, if ever. In order to obtain approval, we will need to ensure that all of our processes, methods and equipment are compliant with cGMP, and perform extensive audits of vendors, contract laboratories and suppliers. If any of our vendors, contract laboratories or suppliers is found to be out of compliance with cGMP, we may experience delays or disruptions in manufacturing while we work with these third parties to remedy the violation or while we work to identify suitable replacement vendors. The cGMP requirements govern quality control of the manufacturing process and documentation policies and procedures. In complying with cGMP, we will be obligated to expend time, money and effort in production, record keeping and quality control to assure that the product meets applicable specifications and other requirements. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we would be subject to possible regulatory action and may not be permitted to sell any products that we may develop.\n\nEven if we receive regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we will be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expenses. Additionally, our product candidates, if approved, could be subject to labeling and other restrictions and market withdrawal. We may also be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or experience unanticipated problems with our products.\n\nAny regulatory approvals that we or our existing or future collaborators obtain for our product candidates may also be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses for which a product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product candidate.\n\nIn addition, if the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority approves any of our product candidates, the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, import, export, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for the product will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. The FDA has significant post-market authority, including the authority to require labeling changes based on new safety information and to require post-market studies or clinical trials to evaluate safety risks related to the use of a product or to require withdrawal of the product from the market. The FDA also has the authority to require a REMS plan after approval, which may impose further requirements or restrictions on the distribution or use of an approved drug or therapeutic biologic. The manufacturing facilities we use to make a future product, if any, will also be subject to periodic review and inspection by the FDA and other regulatory agencies, including for continued compliance with cGMP requirements. The discovery of any new or previously unknown problems with our third-party manufacturers, manufacturing processes or facilities may result in restrictions on the product, manufacturer or facility, including withdrawal of the product from the market. If we rely\n\n80  \n---  \n  \non third-party manufacturers, we will not have control over compliance with applicable rules and regulations by such manufacturers. Any product promotion and advertising will also be subject to regulatory requirements and continuing regulatory review. If we or our existing or future collaborators, manufacturers or service providers fail to comply with applicable continuing regulatory requirements in the United States or foreign jurisdictions in which we seek to market our products, we or they may be subject to, among other things, fines, warning letters, holds on clinical trials, delay of approval or refusal by the FDA or similar foreign regulatory bodies to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approval, product recalls and seizures, administrative detention of products, refusal to permit the import or export of products, operating restrictions, injunction, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.\n\nSubsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with our third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:\n\n•\n\nrestrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, withdrawal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory product recalls;\n\n•\n\nfines, warning or untitled letters or holds on clinical trials;\n\n•\n\nrefusal by the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us or our strategic partners;\n\n•\n\nsuspension or revocation of product license approvals;\n\n•\n\nproduct seizure or detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products; and\n\n•\n\ninjunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\n\nThe FDA policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business.\n\nWe also cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action, either in the United States or abroad.\n\nThe ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, statutory, regulatory and policy changes, the FDA’s ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and other events that may otherwise affect the FDA’s ability to perform routine functions. In addition, government funding of other government agencies that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. Disruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new drugs to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business.\n\nThe ability of the FDA and other government agencies to properly administer their functions is highly dependent on the levels of government funding and the ability to fill key leadership appointments, among various factors. Delays in filling or replacing key positions could significantly impact the ability of the FDA and other agencies to fulfill their functions, and could greatly impact healthcare and the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nIf a prolonged government shutdown occurs, or if global health concerns prevent the FDA or other regulatory authorities from conducting their regular inspections, reviews, or other regulatory activities, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA or other regulatory authorities to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n81  \n---  \n  \nWe may face difficulties from healthcare legislative reform measures.\n\nExisting regulatory policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could affect pricing and third-party payments for our product candidates, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition and prospects. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability.\n\nIn the United States, there have been and continue to be a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. For example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act, or together, the ACA, was enacted, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry.\n\nWhile there have been legislative and judicial efforts to modify, repeal or otherwise invalidate all or certain aspects of the ACA or its implementing regulations, the ACA remains in effect in its current form. It is unclear how any such efforts in the future will impact the ACA or our business.\n\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States federal and state levels to reduce healthcare expenditures, including the Budget Control Act, which, subject to certain temporary suspension periods, imposed 2% reductions in Medicare payments to providers per fiscal year starting April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, that will remain in effect through 2031, unless additional Congressional action is taken, and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which added a requirement for manufacturers of certain single-source drugs (including biologics and biosimilars) separately paid for under Medicare Part B for at least 18 months and marketed in single-dose containers or packages (known as refundable single-dose containers or single-use package drugs) to provide annual refunds for any portions of the dispensed drug that are unused and discarded if those unused or discarded portions exceed an applicable percentage defined by statute or regulation. Further, in November 2020, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. The implementation of this final rule was delayed by the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, until January 1, 2032. In December 2020, CMS issued a final rule implementing significant manufacturer price reporting changes under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including regulations that affect manufacturer-sponsored patient assistance programs subject to pharmacy benefit manager accumulator programs and Best Price reporting related to certain value-based purchasing arrangements. Under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, effective January 1, 2024, the statutory cap on Medicaid Drug Rebate Program rebates that manufacturers pay to state Medicaid programs is eliminated. Elimination of this cap may require pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay more in rebates than they receive on the sale of products.\n\nMoreover, on January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. If federal spending is further reduced, anticipated budgetary shortfalls may also impact the ability of relevant agencies, such as the FDA or the National Institutes of Health to continue to function at current levels. Amounts allocated to federal grants and contracts may be reduced or eliminated. These reductions may also impact the ability of relevant agencies to timely review and approve research and development, manufacturing, and marketing activities, which may delay our ability to develop, market and sell any products we may develop.\n\nMoreover, payment methodologies, including payment for companion diagnostics, may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives. CMS has begun bundling the Medicare payments for certain laboratory tests ordered while a patient received services in a hospital outpatient setting and, beginning in 2018, CMS will pay for clinical laboratory services based on a weighted average of reported prices that private payors, Medicare Advantage plans, and Medicaid Managed Care plans pay for laboratory services. Further, on March 16,\n\n82  \n---  \n  \n2018, CMS finalized its National Coverage Determination, or NCD, for certain diagnostic laboratory tests using next generation sequencing that are approved by the FDA as a companion in vitro diagnostic and used in a cancer with an FDA-approved companion diagnostic indication. Under the NCD, diagnostic tests that gain FDA approval or clearance as an in vitro companion diagnostic will automatically receive full coverage and be available for patients with recurrent, metastatic relapsed, refractory or stages III and IV cancer. Additionally, the NCD extended coverage to repeat testing when the patient has a new primary diagnosis of cancer.\n\nThere has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several presidential executive orders, Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. The FDA released a final rule in September 2020 providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada, and the FDA authorized the first such plan in January 2024.\n\nRecently, several healthcare reform initiatives culminated in the enactment of the IRA in August 2022, which allows, among other things, HHS to negotiate the selling price of a statutorily specified number of drugs and biologics each year that CMS reimburses under Medicare Part B and Part D. Only high-expenditure single-source biologics that have been approved for at least 11 years (7 years for single-source drugs) can qualify for negotiations, with the negotiated price taking effect two years after the selection year. Negotiations for Medicare Part D products begin in 2024 with the negotiated price taking effect in 2026, and negotiations for Medicare Part B products begin in 2026 with the negotiated price taking effect in 2028. HHS will announce the negotiated maximum fair price by September 1, 2024, and this price cap, which cannot exceed a statutory ceiling price, will come into effect on January 1, 2026. A drug or biological product that has an orphan drug designation for only one rare disease or condition will be excluded from the IRA’s price negotiations requirements, but loses that exclusion if it has designations for more than one rare disease or condition, or if it is approved for an indication that is not within that single designated rare disease or condition, unless such additional designation or such disqualifying approvals are withdrawn by the time CMS evaluates the drug for selection for negotiation. In August 2023, HHS announced the ten Medicare Part D drugs and biologics that it selected for negotiations, and by October 1, 2023, each manufacturer of the selected drugs signed a manufacturer agreement to participate in the negotiations. The IRA also penalizes drug manufacturers that increase prices of Medicare Part D and Part B drugs at a rate greater than the rate of inflation. In addition, the law eliminates the “donut hole” under Medicare Part D beginning in 2025 by significantly lowering the enrollee maximum out-of-pocket cost and requiring manufacturers to subsidize, through a newly established manufacturer discount program, 10% of Part D enrollees’ prescription costs for brand drugs below the out-of-pocket maximum, and 20% once the out-of-pocket maximum has been reached. The IRA permits the Secretary of HHS to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. Manufacturers that fail to comply with the IRA may be subject to various penalties, some significant, including civil monetary penalties. The IRA also extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in ACA marketplaces through plan year 2025. These provisions are taking effect progressively starting in 2023, although they may be subject to legal challenges. For example, the provisions related to the negotiation of selling prices of high-expenditure single-source drugs and biologics have been challenged in multiple lawsuits. Thus, while it is unclear how the IRA will be implemented, it will likely have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry and our product candidates.\n\nAt the state level, legislatures are increasingly enacting laws and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.\n\nAdditionally, on May 30, 2018, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017 was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA authorization under an FDA expanded access program; however, manufacturers are not obligated to provide investigational new drug products under the current federal right to try law. We may choose to seek an expanded access program for our product candidates, or to utilize comparable rules in other countries that allow the use of a drug, on a named patient basis or under a compassionate use program.\n\n83  \n---  \n  \nWe expect that the ACA, the IRA and other state or federal healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products.\n\nOur operations and relationships with healthcare providers, healthcare organizations, customers and third-party payors will be subject to applicable anti-bribery, anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, transparency and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to, among other things, enforcement actions, criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens and diminished profits and future earnings.\n\nOur current and future arrangements with healthcare providers, healthcare organizations, third-party payors and customers expose us to broadly applicable anti-bribery, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, market, sell and distribute our product candidates. In addition, we may be subject to patient data privacy and security regulation by the U.S. federal government and the states and the foreign governments in which we conduct our business. Restrictions under applicable federal and state anti-bribery and healthcare laws and regulations, include the following:\n\n•\n\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, individuals and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal and state healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;\n\n•\n\nthe federal criminal and civil false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the federal False Claims Act, which can be imposed through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions against individuals or entities, prohibits, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent, knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim, or from knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. Moreover, the government may assert that a claim including items and services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act;\n\n•\n\nHIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability, prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services; similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;\n\n•\n\nHIPAA, as amended by HITECH, which impose obligations on certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, known as covered entities, as well as their business associates that perform certain services involving the storage, use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information, and require notification to affected individuals and regulatory authorities of certain breaches of security of individually identifiable health information;\n\n•\n\nthe federal legislation commonly referred to as Physician Payments Sunshine Act, enacted as part of the ACA, and its implementing regulations, which requires certain manufacturers of covered drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies that are reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with certain exceptions, to report annually to CMS information related to certain payments and other transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), physician assistants, certain types of advanced practice nurses, and \n\n84  \n---  \n  \nteaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members, with the information made publicly available on a searchable website;\n\n•\n\nthe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, which prohibits, among other things, U.S. companies and their employees and agents from authorizing, promising, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, corrupt or improper payments or anything else of value to foreign government officials, employees of public international organizations and foreign government owned or affiliated entities, candidates for foreign political office, and foreign political parties or officials thereof;\n\n•\n\nanalogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, that may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; and\n\n•\n\ncertain state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug and therapeutic biologics manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and pricing information, state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\n\nIf we or our collaborators, manufacturers or service providers fail to comply with applicable federal, state or foreign laws or regulations, we could be subject to enforcement actions, which could affect our ability to develop, market and sell our products successfully and could harm our reputation and lead to reduced acceptance of our products by the market. These enforcement actions include, among others:\n\n•\n\nexclusion from participation in government-funded healthcare programs;\n\n•\n\nexclusion of company products from coverage under federal health care programs; and\n\n•\n\nexclusion from eligibility for the award of government contracts for our products.\n\nEfforts to ensure that our current and future business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations could involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any such requirements, we may be subject to significant penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, loss of eligibility to obtain approvals from the FDA, exclusion from participation in government contracting, healthcare reimbursement or other government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, or reputational harm, any of which could adversely affect our financial results. Although effective compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, these risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for an alleged or suspected violation could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and could divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business, even if our defense is successful. In addition, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable laws and regulations may be costly to us in terms of money, time and resources.\n\nOur failure to comply with privacy and data security laws, regulations and standards may cause our business to be materially adversely affected.\n\nWe maintain a quantity of sensitive information, including confidential business and patient health information in connection with our clinical trials that are subject to US and international laws and regulations governing the privacy and data protection of such information. Each of these laws is subject to varying interpretations and subject to evolving regulations. For example, the EU and United Kingdom (“UK”) GDPR, which applies\n\n85  \n---  \n  \nextraterritorially, imposes several strict requirements for controllers and processors of personal information, which include higher standards for obtaining consent from individuals to process their personal information, increased requirements pertaining to the processing of special categories of personal information (such as health information) and pseudonymized (i.e., key-coded) data, and heightened transfer requirements of personal information from the European Economic Area/UK/Switzerland to countries not deemed to have adequate data protections laws. Notably, the U.S. is one such country as of January 1, 2024, although effective July 10, 2023, the new EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“DPF”) has been recognized as adequate under EU law to allow transfers of personal data from the EU (as well as the U.K. and Switzerland) to certified companies in the U.S. However, the DPF is likely to face legal challenge at the Court of Justice of the European Union which could cause the legal requirements for personal data transfers from the Europe to the U.S. to become uncertain once again. We will monitor these legal developments and continue to use best practices to follow established European legal standards to conduct cross-border transfer of personal data. The GDPR also provides that countries in the European Economic Area may establish their own laws and regulations further restricting the processing of certain personal information, including genetic data, biometric data, and health data. Companies that must comply with the GDPR face increased compliance obligations and risk, including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance of up to €20 million (approximately $22.6 million) or 4 percent of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater.\n\nIn the United States, in addition to HIPAA, various federal (for example, the Federal Trade Commission) and state regulators have adopted, or are considering adopting, laws and regulations concerning personal information and data security that may conflict or be more stringent or broader in scope, or offer greater individual rights, with respect to personal information than existing federal, international, or other state laws. For example, California, which continues to be a critical state with respect to evolving consumer privacy laws after enacting the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, took effect in January 2023 and may be subject to additional regulations promulgated through a newly created enforcement agency called the California Privacy Protection Agency (“CPPA”). Failure to comply with the CCPA may result in significant civil penalties, injunctive relief, or statutory or actual damages as determined by the CPPA and California Attorney General, the latter still retaining some CCPA enforcement authority. Following California’s lead, several other state enacted privacy laws that took effect in 2023: the Colorado Privacy Act, the Connecticut Personal Data Privacy and Online Monitoring Act, the Utah Consumer Privacy Act, and the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act. Additional state privacy laws are to take effect in 2024: the Florida Digital Bill of Rights (July 1, 2024), Montana’s Consumer Data Privacy Act (October 1, 2024), Oregon’s protections for the personal data of consumers enacted through SB 619 (July 1, 2024), and the Texas Data Privacy and Security Act (July 1, 2024).\n\nWe cannot provide assurance that (i) current or future legislation will not prevent us from generating or maintaining personal information, or (ii) that patients will consent to the use of their personal information (as necessary). Either of these circumstances may prevent us from undertaking or publishing essential research and development, manufacturing, and commercialization, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\n\nFurther, on July 26, 2023, the SEC adopted new cybersecurity disclosure rules for public companies that require disclosure regarding cybersecurity risk management (including our board’s role in overseeing cybersecurity risks, management’s role and expertise in assessing and managing cybersecurity risks and processes for assessing, identifying and managing cybersecurity risks) in annual reports on Form 10-K. These new cybersecurity disclosure rules also require the disclosure of material cybersecurity incidents by Form 8-K.\n\nIn addition to government regulation, privacy advocates and industry groups have and may in the future propose self-regulatory standards from time to time. These and other industry standards may legally or contractually apply to us, or we may elect to comply with such standards. It is possible that if our practices are not consistent or viewed as not consistent with legal and regulatory requirements and interpretations, we may become subject to audits, inquiries, whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges, or severe criminal or civil sanctions, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, reputation, and financial condition.\n\nAll of these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs, such as costs related to organizational changes, implementing additional protection technologies, training employees and engaging consultants, which are likely to increase over time. In addition, such requirements may require us to modify our\n\n86  \n---  \n  \ndata processing practices and policies, distract management or divert resources from other initiatives and projects, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with any applicable federal, state, or similar foreign laws and regulations relating to data privacy and security could result in damage to our reputation, as well as proceedings or litigation by governmental agencies or other third parties, including class action privacy litigation in certain jurisdictions, which would subject us to significant fines, sanctions, awards, injunctions, penalties, or judgments. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\n\nIf in the future we are unable to establish U.S. or global sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to sell and market our product candidates, we may not be successful in commercializing our product candidates if they are approved and we may not be able to generate any revenue.\n\nWe currently have a limited team for the marketing, sales and distribution of any of our product candidates that are able to obtain regulatory approval. To commercialize any product candidates after approval, we must build, on a territory-by-territory basis, marketing, sales, distribution, managerial and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services, and we may not be successful in doing so. If our product candidates receive regulatory approval, we may decide to establish an internal sales or marketing team with technical expertise and supporting distribution capabilities to commercialize our product candidates, which will be expensive and time consuming and will require significant attention of our executive officers to manage. For example, some state and local jurisdictions have licensing and continuing education requirements for pharmaceutical sales representatives, which requires time and financial resources. Any failure or delay in the development of our internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities would adversely impact the commercialization of any of our product candidates that we obtain approval to market.\n\nWith respect to the commercialization of all or certain of our product candidates, we may choose to collaborate, either globally or on a territory-by-territory basis, with third parties that have direct sales forces and established distribution systems, either to augment our own sales force and distribution systems or in lieu of our own sales force and distribution systems. If we are unable to enter into such arrangements when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any of our product candidates that receive regulatory approval or any such commercialization may experience delays or limitations. If we are not successful in commercializing our product candidates, either on our own or through collaborations with one or more third parties, our future product revenue will suffer and we may incur significant additional losses.\n\nOur product candidates for which we intend to seek approval as biologic products may face competition sooner than anticipated.\n\nWith the enactment of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, an abbreviated pathway for the licensure of biosimilar biological products (both highly similar and interchangeable biological products) was created. The abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as interchangeable based on its similarity to an existing reference product. The BPCIA provides a period of exclusivity for products granted “reference product exclusivity,” under which an application for a biosimilar product referencing such products cannot be licensed by the FDA until 12 years after the first licensure date of the reference product licensed under a BLA.\n\nDuring this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA licenses a full BLA for the competing product containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product. The law is complex and is still being interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation, and meaning are subject to uncertainty. While it is uncertain when such processes intended to implement BPCIA may be fully adopted by the FDA, any such processes could have an adverse effect on the future commercial prospects for our product candidates.\n\nThere is a risk that any product candidates we may develop that are licensed as a biological product under a BLA would not qualify for the 12-year period of exclusivity or that this exclusivity could be shortened due to congressional action or otherwise, or that the FDA will not consider any product candidates we may develop to be\n\n87  \n---  \n  \nreference products for competing products, potentially creating the opportunity for generic competition sooner than anticipated.\n\nMost states have enacted substitution laws that permit substitution of interchangeable biosimilars. The extent to which a highly similar biosimilar, once licensed, will be substituted for any one of our reference products that may be approved in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing.\n\nIf any of our product candidates receives marketing approval and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by the product candidates, our ability to market and derive revenue from the product candidates could be compromised.\n\nUndesirable side effects caused by our product candidates could cause regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in more restrictive labeling or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. Given the nature of ADCs, it is likely that there may be side effects associated with their use. Results of our clinical trials could reveal a high and unacceptable severity and prevalence of side effects. In such an event, our clinical trials could be suspended or terminated and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of or deny approval of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications. Such side effects could also affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the clinical trials or result in potential product liability claims. Any of these occurrences may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nFurther, clinical trials by their nature utilize a sample of the potential patient population. With a limited number of patients and limited duration of exposure, rare and severe side effects of our product candidates may only be uncovered with a significantly larger number of patients exposed to the product candidate.\n\nIn the event that any of our product candidates receive regulatory approval and we or others identify undesirable side effects caused by one of our products, any of the following adverse events could occur:\n\n•\n\nregulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product or seize the product;\n\n•\n\nwe may be required to recall the product or change the way the product is administered to patients;\n\n•\n\nadditional restrictions may be imposed on the marketing of the particular product or the manufacturing processes for the product or any component thereof;\n\n•\n\nwe may be subject to fines, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties;\n\n•\n\nregulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as a black box warning or a contraindication;\n\n•\n\nwe may be required to create a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients;\n\n•\n\nwe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients;\n\n•\n\nthe product may become less competitive; and\n\n•\n\nour reputation may suffer.\n\nAny of these occurrences could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\n88  \n---  \n  \nWhile we have been granted a Fast Track Designation by the FDA for luvelta, it may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process.\n\nWe have been granted a Fast Track Designation for luvelta for the treatment of patients with platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who have received one to three prior lines of systemic therapy. As part of our business strategy, we may also seek Fast Track Designation for other of our product candidates. If a drug or biologic is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition and the drug or biologic demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for this condition, the product sponsor may apply for FDA Fast Track Designation. The FDA has broad discretion whether or not to grant this designation, so even if we believe a particular product candidate is eligible for this designation, we cannot assure you that the FDA would decide to grant it. Even if we do receive Fast Track Designation, as we have for luvelta, we may not experience a faster development process, review or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures. The FDA may withdraw Fast Track Designation if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program, which may happen in connection with luvelta or other of our product candidates if granted Fast Track Designation.\n\nWhile we have been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA for luvelta for the treatment of Pediatric (CBF/GLIS) AML, if we decide to seek Orphan Drug Designation for some of our other product candidates, we may be unsuccessful or may be unable to maintain the benefits associated with Orphan Drug Designation, including the potential for orphan drug exclusivity.\n\nWe have been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA for luvelta for the treatment of Pediatric CBF/GLIS AML. As part of our business strategy, we may seek Orphan Drug Designation for our other product candidates, and we may be unsuccessful. Regulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the United States and Europe, may designate drugs and therapeutic biologics for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug or therapeutic biologic as an orphan drug if it is a drug or therapeutic biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 in the United States where there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the drug or therapeutic biologic will be recovered from sales in the United States. In the United States, Orphan Drug Designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as tax advantages and user fee waivers. In addition, if a product that has Orphan Drug Designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same product for the same condition for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or where the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient product quantity.\n\nEven if we obtain Orphan Drug Designation for our product candidates in specific conditions, we may not be the first to obtain marketing approval of these product candidates for the orphan-designated condition due to the uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical products; in such case, no orphan drug exclusivity would be available unless we could demonstrate “clinical superiority.” In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be limited if we seek approval for an indication broader than the orphan-designated condition or may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. Further, even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different drugs or therapeutic biologics with different principal molecular structural features can be approved for the same condition. Even after an orphan product is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve the same drug or therapeutic biologic with the same principal molecular structural features for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug or therapeutic biologic is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan Drug Designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug or therapeutic biologic nor gives the drug or therapeutic biologic any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process. In addition, while we may seek Orphan Drug Designation for our product candidates, we may never receive such designations.\n\nThe tax reform legislation signed into law on December 22, 2017 reduced the amount of the qualified clinical research costs for a designated orphan product that a sponsor may claim as a credit from 50% to 25%. This may further limit the advantage and may impact our future business strategy of seeking the Orphan Drug Designation.\n\n89  \n---  \n  \nIf we decide to pursue accelerated approval for any of our product candidates, it may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process and does not increase the likelihood that our product candidates will receive marketing approval.\n\nIn the future, we may decide to pursue accelerated approval for one or more of our product candidates. Under the FDA’s accelerated approval program, the FDA may approve a drug or biologic for a serious or life-threatening disease or condition that provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. For drugs or biologics granted accelerated approval, post-marketing confirmatory trials are required to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. These confirmatory trials must be completed with due diligence, and the FDA may require that the trial be designed, initiated, and/or fully enrolled prior to approval. If we were to pursue accelerated approval for a product candidate for a disease or condition, we would do so on the basis that there is no available therapy for that disease or condition or that our product candidate provides a benefit over available therapy. If standard of care were to evolve or if any of our competitors were to receive full approval on the basis of a confirmatory trial for a drug or biologic for a disease or condition for which we are seeking accelerated approval before we receive accelerated approval, the disease or condition would no longer qualify as one for which there is no available therapy, and accelerated approval of our product candidate would not occur without a showing of benefit over available therapy. Many cancer therapies rely on accelerated approval, and the treatment landscape can change quickly as the FDA converts accelerated approvals to full approvals on the basis of successful confirmatory trials. Whether any trial is sufficient to receive FDA approval under the accelerated approval pathway will depend on the design and safety and efficacy results of such trial and will only be determined by the FDA upon review of the trial design and a submitted BLA.\n\nMoreover, the FDA may withdraw approval of any product candidate approved under the accelerated approval pathway if, for example:\n\n•\n\nthe trial or trials required to verify the predicted clinical benefit of our product candidate fail to verify such benefit or do not demonstrate sufficient clinical benefit to justify the risks associated with such product;\n\n•\n\nother evidence demonstrates that our product candidate is not shown to be safe or effective under the conditions of use;\n\n•\n\nwe fail to conduct any required post-approval trial of our product candidate with due diligence; or\n\n•\n\nwe disseminate false or misleading promotional materials relating to the relevant product candidate.\n\nIn addition, the FDA may terminate the accelerated approval program or change the standards under which accelerated approvals are considered and granted in response to public pressure or other concerns regarding the accelerated approval program. Changes to or termination of the accelerated approval program could prevent or limit our ability to obtain accelerated approval of any of our clinical development programs.\n\nRecently, the accelerated approval pathway has come under scrutiny within the FDA and by Congress. The FDA has put increased focus on ensuring that confirmatory studies are conducted with diligence and, ultimately, that such studies confirm the benefit. For example, the FDA has convened its Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee to review what the FDA has called “dangling” or delinquent accelerated approvals, where confirmatory studies have not been completed or where results did not confirm benefit, but for which marketing approval continues in effect, and some companies have subsequently voluntarily requested withdrawal of approval of their products. In addition, the Oncology Center of Excellence has announced Project Confirm, which is an initiative to promote the transparency of outcomes related to accelerated approvals for oncology indications and provide a framework to foster discussion, research and innovation in approval and post-marketing processes, with the goal to enhance the balance of access and verification of benefit for therapies available to patients with cancer and hematologic malignancies.\n\nFurther, the enactment of The Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act, or FDORA, included provisions related to the accelerated approval pathway. Pursuant to FDORA, the FDA is authorized to require a post-approval study to be underway prior to approval or within a specified time period following approval. FDORA also requires the FDA\n\n90  \n---  \n  \nto specify conditions of any required post-approval study and requires sponsors to submit progress reports for required post-approval studies and any conditions required by the FDA. FDORA enables the FDA to initiate enforcement action for the failure to conduct with due diligence a required post-approval study, including a failure to meet any required conditions specified by the FDA or to submit timely reports.\n\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\n\nOur quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate significantly or may fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, each of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate or decline.\n\nWe expect our operating results to be subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations. Our net income or loss and other operating results will be affected by numerous factors, including:\n\n•\n\nvariations in the level of expense related to the ongoing development of our XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms, our product candidates or future development programs;\n\n•\n\nthe fair value of our holding of common stock of Vaxcyte;\n\n•\n\nresults of preclinical and clinical trials, or the addition or termination of clinical trials or funding support by us, or existing or future collaborators or licensing partners;\n\n•\n\nour execution of any additional collaboration, licensing or similar arrangements, and the timing of payments we may make or receive under existing or future arrangements or the termination or modification of any such existing or future arrangements;\n\n•\n\nany intellectual property infringement lawsuit or opposition, interference or cancellation proceeding in which we may become involved;\n\n•\n\nadditions and departures of key personnel;\n\n•\n\nstrategic decisions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestitures, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments or changes in business strategy;\n\n•\n\nif any of our product candidates receives regulatory approval, the terms of such approval and market acceptance and demand for such product candidates;\n\n•\n\nregulatory developments affecting our product candidates or those of our competitors;\n\n•\n\nthe impact of accounting principles and tax laws, including as a result of recent tax law changes;\n\n•\n\nepidemics, pandemics or contagious diseases;\n\n•\n\nchanges in general market and economic conditions; and\n\n•\n\ncybersecurity incidents\n\nIf our quarterly and annual operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Furthermore, any quarterly and annual fluctuations in our operating results may, in turn, cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. We believe that quarterly and annual comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.\n\n91  \n---  \n  \nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\n\nOur restated certificate of incorporation and our restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company. These provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to elect directors who are not nominated by current members of our board of directors or take other corporate actions, including effecting changes in our management. These provisions:\n\n•\n\nestablish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board are elected at one time;\n\n•\n\npermit only the board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill vacancies on the board;\n\n•\n\nprovide that directors may only be removed “for cause” and only with the approval of two-thirds of our stockholders;\n\n•\n\nrequire super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws;\n\n•\n\nauthorize the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that our board could use to implement a stockholder rights plan;\n\n•\n\neliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\n•\n\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\n•\n\nprohibit cumulative voting; and\n\n•\n\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings.\n\nIn addition, our restated certificate of incorporation, to the fullest extent permitted by law, provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for: any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, or the DGCL, our restated certificate of incorporation, or our restated bylaws; or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Furthermore, our amended and restated bylaws also provide that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act (a Federal Forum Provision). While the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware has held that such provisions are facially valid under Delaware law, there can be no assurance that federal or state courts will follow the holding of the Delaware Supreme Court or determine that the Federal Forum Provision should be enforced in a particular case; application of the Federal Forum Provision means that suits brought by our stockholders to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act must be brought in federal court and cannot be brought in state court.\n\nThese choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, employees and agents even though an action, if successful, might benefit our stockholders. Stockholders who do bring a claim in the specified courts could face additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claim. The specified courts may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder considering an action may be located or would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments or results may be more favorable to us than to our stockholders. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our governance documents inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\n92  \n---  \n  \nIn addition, Section 203 of the DGCL may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. Section 203 imposes certain restrictions on mergers, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15% or more of our common stock.\n\nThe exclusive forum provision in our organizational documents may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers or other employees, or the underwriters of any offering giving rise to such claim, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims.\n\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for: any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the DGCL, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum provision does not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. It could apply, however, to a suit that falls within one or more of the categories enumerated in the exclusive forum provision.\n\nThis choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, or other employees, or the underwriters of any offering giving rise to such claims, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nSection 22 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all claims brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Our amended and restated bylaws provide that the federal district courts of the United States of America will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act, or a Federal Forum Provision, including for all causes of action asserted against any defendant named in such complaint. For the avoidance of doubt, this provision is intended to benefit and may be enforced by us, our officers and directors, the underwriters to any offering giving rise to such complaint and any other professional entity whose profession gives authority to a statement made by that person or entity and who has prepared or certified any part of the documents underlying the offering. Our decision to adopt a Federal Forum Provision followed a decision by the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware holding that such provisions are facially valid under Delaware law. While federal or state courts may not follow the holding of the Delaware Supreme Court or may determine that the Federal Forum Provision should be enforced in a particular case, application of the Federal Forum Provision means that suits brought by our stockholders to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act must be brought in federal court and cannot be brought in state court, and our stockholders cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\n\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain.\n\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe market price of our stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\n\nThe trading price of our common stock may be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which we cannot control. As a result of this volatility, investors may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the purchase price. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including the other risks described in this section and the following:\n\n93  \n---  \n  \n•\n\nresults of preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates, or those of our competitors or our existing or future collaborators;\n\n•\n\nregulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries, especially changes in laws or regulations applicable to our product candidates;\n\n•\n\nthe success of competitive products or technologies;\n\n•\n\nintroductions and announcements of new products by us, our future commercialization partners, or our competitors, and the timing of these introductions or announcements;\n\n•\n\nactions taken by regulatory agencies with respect to our products, clinical studies, manufacturing process or sales and marketing terms;\n\n•\n\nactual or anticipated variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\n•\n\nthe success of our efforts to acquire or in-license additional technologies, products or product candidates;\n\n•\n\ndevelopments concerning current or future collaborations, including but not limited to those with our sources of manufacturing supply and our commercialization partners;\n\n•\n\nmarket conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors;\n\n•\n\ngeneral economic uncertainty and capital markets disruptions, including changes in interest rates, rising inflation, potential instability with respect to the federal debt ceiling and budget and potential government shutdowns related thereto, which have been substantially impacted by regional geopolitical instability due to the impact of geopolitical tensions and the ongoing military conflicts around the world;\n\n•\n\nany adverse impact of health pandemics, including on our clinical trials and clinical trial operations;\n\n•\n\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic collaborations, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\n•\n\ndevelopments or disputes concerning patents or other proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our product candidates and products;\n\n•\n\nour ability or inability to raise additional capital and the terms on which we raise it;\n\n•\n\nthe recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\n•\n\nchanges in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\n•\n\nactual or anticipated changes in earnings estimates or changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding our common stock, other comparable companies or our industry generally;\n\n•\n\nour failure or the failure of our competitors to meet analysts’ projections or guidance that we or our competitors may give to the market;\n\n•\n\nfluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\n•\n\nannouncement and expectation of additional financing efforts;\n\n•\n\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\n•\n\ntrading volume of our common stock;\n\n94  \n---  \n  \n•\n\nsales of our common stock by us or our stockholders;\n\n•\n\nchanges in accounting principles or tax laws;\n\n•\n\nterrorist acts, acts of war or periods of widespread civil unrest, including the ongoing armed conflicts around the world;\n\n•\n\nnatural disasters, epidemics, pandemics or contagious diseases, and other calamities;\n\n•\n\npolitical instability; and\n\n•\n\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions.\n\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the markets for pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have been often unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the issuer. These broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. The realization of any of the above risks or any of a broad range of other risks, including those described in this “Risk Factors” section, could have a dramatic and adverse impact on the market price of our common stock.\n\nThe future sale and issuance of equity or of debt securities that are convertible into equity will dilute our share capital.\n\nWe may choose to raise additional capital in the future, depending on market conditions, strategic considerations and operational requirements. To the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale and issuance of shares or other securities convertible into shares, our stockholders will be diluted. Future issuances of our common stock or other equity securities, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings of shares or equity securities. No prediction can be made as to the effect, if any, that future sales of common stock or the availability of common stock for future sales will have on the trading price of our common stock.\n\nA sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\n\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. If our stockholders sell, or the market perceives that our stockholders intend to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly.\n\nWe cannot predict what effect, if any, sales of our shares in the public market or the availability of shares for sale will have on the market price of our common stock. However, future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, including shares issued upon exercise of outstanding options or warrants, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. For example, we are party to a Sales Agreement with Jefferies, pursuant to which, from time to time, we may offer and sell through Jefferies common stock pursuant to one or more “at the market” offerings. Sales of our common stock under the Sales Agreement with Jefferies could be subject to business, economic or competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which may be beyond our control, and which could cause actual results from the sale of our common stock to differ materially from expectations. Any future sales of common stock through our “at the market” offering program will result in dilution and may have a negative impact on the price of our common stock.\n\nWe also expect that significant additional capital may be needed in the future to continue our planned operations. To raise capital, we may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock.\n\n95  \n---  \n  \nGeneral Risk Factors\n\nUnfavorable global economic conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\nOur business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy and in the global financial markets. For example, the global financial crisis caused extreme volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets, and the global economy has continued to be impacted by changes in interest rates, rising inflation, potential uncertainty with respect to the federal debt ceiling and budget and potential government shutdowns related thereto. Likewise, the capital and credit markets may be adversely affected by rising regional geopolitical tensions, and global sanctions imposed in response thereto. A severe or prolonged economic downturn, such as the global financial crisis, could result in a variety of risks to our business, including, weakened demand for our product candidates and our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. A weak or declining economy could also strain our suppliers, possibly resulting in supply disruption, or cause our customers to delay making payments for our services. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and we cannot anticipate all of the ways in which the current economic climate and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business.\n\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\n\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over the analysts or the content and opinions included in their reports. If any of the analysts who cover us issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding us, our business model, financial condition and results of operations, our intellectual property or our stock performance, or if our preclinical studies and clinical trials and operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of such analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause a decline in our stock price or trading volume.\n\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management’s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain additional executive management and qualified board members. The additional requirements we must comply with may strain our resources and divert management’s attention from other business concerns.\n\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the listing requirements of The Nasdaq Global Select Market, and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming, or costly, and increase demand on our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Additionally, we may be subject to stockholder activism, which can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of management and may lead to additional compliance costs and impact the manner in which we operate our business. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. As a result, management’s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. In order to comply with these requirements, we may need to hire more employees in the future or engage outside consultants, or may have difficulty attracting and retaining sufficient employees, which would increase our costs and expenses.\n\nAs a result of no longer being an emerging growth company, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant additional expenses that we did not previously incur in complying with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and rules implemented by the SEC. The cost of compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act has required us to incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management time on compliance-related issues as we implement additional corporate governance practices and comply with reporting requirements.\n\n96  \n---  \n  \nWe became a “smaller reporting company” as of December 31, 2022. We will continue to be a smaller reporting company if either (i) the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than $250.0 million or (ii) our annual revenue is less than $100.0 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700.0 million. Specifically, as a smaller reporting company we may choose to present only the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and are eligible to take advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure obligations regarding compensation disclosures in 2023. As a smaller reporting company and a “non-accelerated filer”, we still need to comply with Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which will continue to require substantial management time and expense.\n\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance, stockholder litigation, and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs, making some activities more time consuming, and increasing the likelihood and expense of litigation. These laws, regulations, and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve or otherwise change over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters, higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices, and increased expenses and management attention due to actual or threatened litigation. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards (or changing interpretations of them), and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with these laws, regulations, and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us, and our business may be adversely affected. Being a public company and complying with the associated rules and regulations, and being subject to heightened likelihood of litigation, makes it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, the costs of which can fluctuate significantly from year-to-year due to general market conditions in obtaining such insurance, but in recent years have risen significantly, consistent with the increase in market rates. As a result, we may be required to accept reduced coverage, incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage or may be unable to obtain coverage on economically reasonable terms, or at all. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executives and qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee, our compensation committee, and our nominating and corporate governance committee.\n\nAs a result of disclosure of information in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition has become more visible, which may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors. If such claims are successful, our business and operating results could be adversely affected, and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our management and adversely affect our business and operating results.\n\nIn addition, as a result of our disclosure obligations as a public company, we could face pressure to focus on short-term results, which may adversely affect our ability to achieve long-term profitability.\n\nWe may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention.\n\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile and, in the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.\n\n97  \n---  \n  \nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\n\nNone\n\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\n\nOur board recognizes the critical importance of maintaining the trust and confidence of our patients, business partners and employees. Our board is actively involved in oversight of our risk management program, and cybersecurity represents an important component of our overall approach to enterprise risk management (“ERM”). Through our ERM program, risks are identified, assessed and managed at the organization level, mission and business process level, and information system level. Our cybersecurity program, policies and procedures are fully integrated into our ERM program and are maintained in accordance with industry good standards. We also have an Information Security program that more specifically addresses cybersecurity risks and is focused on preserving the confidentiality, security and availability of the information that we collect and store by identifying, preventing and mitigating cybersecurity threats and effectively responding to cybersecurity incidents when they occur.\n\nRisk Management and Strategy\n\nAs one of the critical elements of our overall ERM approach, our cybersecurity program is focused on the following key areas:\n\n1.\n\nGovernance: Our board’s oversight of cybersecurity risk management is supported by our Audit Committee of our board (the “Audit Committee”), which regularly interacts with our executive leadership, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and our General Counsel and other key officers. \n\n2.\n\nCollaborative Approach: We have implemented a comprehensive, cross-functional approach to identifying, preventing and mitigating cybersecurity threats and incidents, while also implementing controls and procedures that provide for the prompt escalation of certain cybersecurity incidents so that decisions regarding the public disclosure and reporting of such incidents can be made by management in a timely manner. We also engage security vendors with credentialed security professionals to bolster our cybersecurity risk management, security event monitoring and detection, and incident and crisis response capability.\n\n3.\n\nTechnical Safeguards: We deploy technical safeguards that are designed to protect our information systems from cybersecurity threats, including mail flow algorithms, firewalls, intrusion prevention and detection systems, malware and antivirus protection, network security protection, cloud console security and single sign-on multi-factor authentication. We also regularly conduct security and patch vulnerability scanning to help safeguard our security infrastructure.\n\n4.\n\nIncident Response and Recovery Planning: We have established and maintain comprehensive incident response and recovery plans that fully address our response to a cybersecurity incident, and such plans are periodically evaluated. We utilize an established internal framework designed to assess promptly the severity and materiality of cybersecurity events and incidents based on various predefined quantitative and qualitative criteria, including the impact to potential personally identifiable information and/or patient health information, and to determine the appropriate level of response. Incidents are escalated based on their severity and materiality for prompt response and mitigation. This systematic approach involves preliminary investigations and detailed assessments to determine the severity and materiality of each incident, and there are established communication channels and engagement processes with those involved in this incident response process.\n\n5.\n\nThird-Party Risk Management: We maintain a comprehensive, risk-based approach to identifying and overseeing cybersecurity risks presented by third parties, including vendors, service providers and other external users of our systems, as well as the systems of third parties that could adversely impact our business in the event of a cybersecurity incident affecting those third-party systems. We have implemented communication channels with our key third-party vendors to communicate regarding \n\n98  \n---  \n  \npotential cybersecurity risks and incidents, and generally seek to include appropriate security clauses in our contracts with our vendors, including notification requirements.\n\n6.\n\nEducation and Awareness: We provide regular, mandatory security awareness training for personnel regarding cybersecurity threats as a means to equip our personnel with effective tools to address cybersecurity threats, and to communicate our evolving information security policies, standards, processes and practices. \n\nWe engage in a periodic assessment of our policies, standards, processes and practices that are designed to address cybersecurity threats and incidents at least annually. We evaluate our cybersecurity program’s capabilities and processes, and we aim to continuously enhance our program according to our internal and external risk assessments. These efforts include a wide range of activities, including audits, assessments, vulnerability testing and other exercises focused on evaluating the effectiveness of our cybersecurity measures and planning.\n\nWe have previously engaged, and may engage in the future, with third parties to perform assessments on our cybersecurity measures, including information security maturity assessments, vulnerability assessments, audits and independent reviews of our information security control environment and operating effectiveness. The results of such assessments, audits and reviews are reported to the Audit Committee and the board, and we adjust our cybersecurity policies, standards, processes and practices as necessary based on the information provided by these assessments, audits and reviews.\n\nAlthough we are subject to ongoing and evolving cybersecurity threats, we are not aware of any cybersecurity threats, that have materially affected or are likely to affect us, including our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. If we were to experience a material cybersecurity incident in the future, such incident may have a material effect, including on our business strategy, operating results, or financial condition. For more information regarding cybersecurity risks that we face and potential impacts on our business related thereto, see the \"Risk Factors\" disclosures in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nGovernance\n\nOur board, in coordination with the Audit Committee, oversees our ERM process, including the management of risks arising from cybersecurity threats. Our Audit Committee receives regular presentations and reports on cybersecurity risks, which address a wide range of topics including our information security strategy, ongoing cybersecurity preparedness projects and programs, recent cybersecurity-related developments, changing regulations, evolving standards, vulnerability assessments, third-party and independent reviews, the threat environment, technological trends and information security considerations arising with respect to our peers and third parties. Further, our Information Security Team, consisting of Company IT staff, meets biannually with our Information Security Governance Committee to review our policies, incidents, responses and preventative measures. In addition, our Information Security Team presents a summary of information security key performance indicators quarterly to our Audit Committee.\n\nOur Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel and other key officers and our Information Security team work collaboratively across the Company to implement and monitor our Information Security Program, which is designed to protect our information systems from cybersecurity threats and to promptly respond to any cybersecurity incidents in accordance with our incident response and recovery plans. Our Information Security team is deployed to address cybersecurity threats and to respond to cybersecurity incidents, including those stemming from any violation of our cybersecurity policies. Further, our Information Security Team monitors the prevention, detection, mitigation and remediation of cybersecurity threats and incidents in real time and reports such threats and incidents to the Audit Committee when appropriate.\n\nOur Information Security team collectively has a combined experience of over 70 years managing and supporting information technology in the biotech industry and oversees our cybersecurity program. They have experience developing and leading cybersecurity programs, including evaluating and implementing tools and technologies that enable defense and response capabilities, and developing critical cybersecurity procedures and training and awareness programs. Our cybersecurity consultant has served in various roles in information technology and information security for approximately 25 years. We also consult with two different service providers who specialize in corporate cybersecurity.\n\n99  \n---  \n  \nItem 2. Properties\n\nOur principal executive office is located in South San Francisco, California, where we lease approximately 115,466 square feet for our corporate headquarters and to conduct, or expand, research and development activities. The lease expires in December 2027.\n\nWe also have a manufacturing facility and manufacturing-support facility in San Carlos, California, where we lease a total of approximately 29,600 square feet of space in two buildings. In June 2021, we extended the lease of the manufacturing facility and manufacturing-support facility for a period of five years. The lease on such facilities will expire in July 2026 and June 2026, respectively, and both lease terms include the option to renew the lease for an additional five years.\n\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\n\nFrom time to time, we may be involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not presently a party to any legal proceedings that, in the opinion of management, would have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us due to defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, negative publicity and reputational harm, and other factors.\n\nItem 4.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\n\nMarket Information for Common Stock\n\nOur common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol “STRO.”\n\nHolders of Record\n\nAs of March 20, 2024, there were approximately 69 stockholders of record of our common stock. The actual number of stockholders is greater than this number of record holders, and includes stockholders who are beneficial owners, but whose shares are held in street name by brokers and other nominees. This number of holders of record also does not include stockholders whose shares may be held in trust by other entities.\n\nDividend Policy\n\nWe currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, for use in the operation of our business and to fund future growth. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Payment of cash dividends, if any, in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on then-existing conditions, including our financial condition, operating results, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects and other factors our Board of Directors may deem relevant.\n\n101  \n---  \n  \nStock Performance Graph\n\nThe following graph shows the total stockholder’s return on an initial investment of $100 in cash at market close on September 27, 2018 (the first day of trading of our common stock), through December 31, 2023 for (i) our common stock, (ii) the Nasdaq Composite Index and (iii) the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index. Pursuant to applicable Securities and Exchange Commission rules, all values assume reinvestment of pre-tax amount of all dividends; however, no dividends have been declared on our common stock to date.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the attached financial statements and notes thereto. This Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the following sections, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. For a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties, see the “Risk Factors” section in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We caution the reader not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect management’s analysis only as of the date of this Form 10-K. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements, which reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this Form 10-K.\n\nOverview\n\nWe are a clinical-stage oncology company developing site-specific and novel-format antibody drug conjugates, or ADCs, enabled by our proprietary integrated cell-free protein synthesis platform, XpressCF®, and our site-specific conjugation platform, XpressCF+®. We aim to design and develop therapeutics using the most relevant and potent modalities, including ADCs, bispecific ADCs, immunostimulatory ADCs, or iADCs, dual conjugate ADCs, or ADC2s, and cytokine derivatives. Our molecules are directed primarily against clinically validated targets where the current standard of care is suboptimal. We believe that our platform allows us to accelerate the discovery and development of potential first-in-class and/or best-in-class molecules by enabling the rapid and systematic evaluation of protein structure-activity relationships to create optimized homogeneous product candidates. Our mission is to transform the lives of patients by creating medicines with improved therapeutic profiles for areas of unmet need.\n\nOnce identified, production of protein drug candidates can be rapidly and predictably scaled in our current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, compliant manufacturing facility. We have the ability to manufacture our proprietary cell-free extract that supports our production of proteins on a large scale using a semi-continuous fermentation process. Ourmost advanced product candidate is STRO-002, or luveltamab tazevibulin, or luvelta, an ADC directed against folate receptor-alpha, or FolRα, for patients with FolRα-expressing cancers, including ovarian cancer.\n\nLuvelta was designed and optimized for an improved therapeutic index by placing a precise number of linker-warheads at four specific locations within the antibody using our proprietary XpressCF+® platform. Our first Phase 1 trial for luvelta is an open-label study evaluating luvelta as a monotherapy for patients with ovarian and endometrial cancers. This trial is being conducted in two-parts, dose escalation and dose expansion. The primary objectives of the clinical trial are to determine the safety and tolerability profile, to define the recommended Phase 2 dose level and interval and to evaluate preliminary anti-tumor activity. Our secondary objectives are to characterize the human pharmacokinetics and additional safety, tolerability and efficacy measures.\n\nIn 2019, we began enrolling patients in a Phase 1 trial of luvelta that focused on ovarian and endometrial cancers. The Phase 1 trial assessing safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of luvelta to treat platinum resistant ovarian cancer has been completed. In January 2024, we reported near-final results from this Phase 1 trial, in which luvelta exhibited a manageable safety profile together with promising preliminary efficacy data in the tested patient population. We also presented data from Phase 1b trials assessing safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy for the treatment of ovarian cancer with luvelta in combination with bevacizumab and for treatment of endometrial cancer. In August 2021, luvelta was granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for the treatment of patients with platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who have received one to three prior lines of systemic therapy. We began enrolling patients in a Phase 2/3 trial of luvelta for the treatment of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, the REFRαME-O1 study, in June 2023.\n\n104  \n---  \n  \nIn January 2024, we presented an aggregated data set from of our Phase I trials of luvelta. This data set included data from all ovarian cancer patients treated with luvelta as a monotherapy in Phase 1 studies, regardless of FolRα expression levels, dose level of luvelta, or platinum sensitivity or resistance, corresponding to a total of 99 patients, of which 92 were RECIST-evaluable, with 21% platinum sensitive patients and 78% platinum refractory patients. Patients received a median of three prior lines of therapy. There were 72% of the patients that had experienced prior bevacizumab therapy and 70% had been treated with a PARP inhibitor. These patients were not selected for FolRα expression levels and were treated at starting dose levels ≤2.9 mg/kg, 4.3 mg/kg, 5.2 mg/kg or ≥5.6 mg/kg.\n\nThe safety profile of luvelta from these aggregated data was shown to be manageable, with a low rate of discontinuation of treatment resulting from neutropenia. The predominant TEAE was neutropenia, encompassing neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and decreased neutrophil count, with 69.7% patients reporting any grade neutropenia and 64.6% patients reporting Grade 3 or higher neutropenia. Neuropathy and arthralgia were the other most commonly reported significant TEAEs, with 57.6% and 16% of patients reporting any grade and Grade 3 or higher arthralgia, respectively, and 44% and 7% patients reporting any grade and Grade 3 or higher neuropathy, respectively. The observed neutropenia was primarily uncomplicated, with less than 5% incidence of febrile neutropenia. Neutropenia and arthralgia each led to discontinuation of treatment in 1.5% of patients. Neuropathy led to discontinuation of treatment in 2.9% of patients. There were six patients that experienced grade 5 safety events on study, with one such event assessed as probably luvelta related and the remainder assessed as unrelated to luvelta.\n\nWe also presented a subset of the aggregated data from our Phase 1 trials of luvelta for which 43 patients with platinum resistant ovarian cancer selected for FolRα TPS ≥25%, or tumors with ≥25% of the tumor cells expressing FolRα at any level of staining intensity, were treated with 4.3 mg/kg or 5.2 mg/kg doses of luvelta, corresponding to all patients treated in phase 1 studies that would be eligible for enrollment in the REFRαME-O1 registrational study. The ORR observed for this subset population was 28%, with a DOR of 5.7 months and PFS of 5.8 months.\n\nBased on the data from our Phase 1 program, we selected FolRα expression TPS ≥25% as the target eligibility cutoff or threshold for further study in clinical development of luvelta. We estimate that approximately 80% of the platinum resistant ovarian cancer patients would be eligible for luvelta treatment based on this TPS ≥25% threshold for FolRα expression.\n\nWe also opened for enrollment a Phase 1 trial to assess the combination of luvelta and bevacizumab for treatment of ovarian cancer in December 2021 and presented initial preliminary results of this study in January 2024. Safety signals from this study were generally consistent with those previously reported and the combination treatment with luvelta and bevacizumab demonstrated clinical activity in treated patients regardless of their FolRα expression status.\n\nWe also began enrolling patients in an expansion cohort for FolRα-selected endometrial cancer in the fourth quarter of 2021 and presented initial preliminary results from the study at the 2023 ESMO Congress in October 2023. In this trial, luvelta showed encouraging preliminary anti-tumor activity in FolRα-selected patients, defined by a TPS of >25% FolRα expression, and the safety profile was consistent with prior data in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. We expect to present updated results from the bevacizumab combination study in 2024. Further, we plan to submit an IND for the treatment of NSCLC with luvelta in the first half of 2024.\n\nIn addition to the Phase 1 studies discussed above, we initiated a Phase 2/3 study, the REFRαME-O1 study, of luvelta for the treatment of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer in June 2023. This study comprises two parts; in Part 1, we anticipate enrolling 50 patients randomized 1:1 to two different doses of luvelta, either 4.3 mg/kg or 5.2 mg/kg plus prophylactic pegfilgrastim for two cycles, followed by reduction to 4.3 mg/kg. After proceeding to Part 2 of the study, the non-optimized dose of luvelta will be dropped and approximately 516 patients will be randomized 1:1 to the selected luvelta dose or investigators choice of chemotherapy. The protocol will include an optional interim analysis for ORR and DOR to support a potential application for accelerated approval and the endpoints that will be assessed for a potential full approval are PFS and OS. The REFRαME-O1 study patient population includes those with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, 1-3 lines of prior treatment and tumors that express FolRα at TPS≥25% and excludes primary platinum refractory patients and those with ECOG PS of 0-1. We announced the initiation of Part 1 of the REFRαME-O1 study in June 2023 and the study is ongoing. We anticipate that Part 1 will be fully enrolled by the end of the first half of 2024.\n\n105  \n---  \n  \nIn 2022 we initiated an exploratory cohort, or cohort C, of 15 patients to assess the safety of treatment with luvelta at 5.2 mg/kg in combination with prophylactic pegfilgrastim and presented preliminary data from ten patients from this cohort in January 2023. In January 2024 we announced updated data from this cohort based on 16 patients. In particular:\n\n•\n\nGrade 3+ neutropenia was reduced from 66.7% to 6.3%, resulting in a 90.6% decrease in Grade 3+ neutropenia rates at the first cycle of luvelta (p=0.0002); Grade 3 neutropenia was reduced from 71.4% to 18.8%, resulting in a 73.7% decrease in Grade 3+ neutropenia rates at the first and second cycle (p=0015)\n\n•\n\nOverall Grade 3+ neutropenia was reduced from 76.2% to 37.5%\n\nIn addition, we have been offering compassionate use of luvelta to treat pediatric patients with relapsed/refractory CBFA2T3-GLIS2, or CBF/GLIS, acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, commonly known as RAM phenotype AML. Updated compassionate use data continued to show anti-leukemic activity of luvelta in pediatric patients with relapsed/refractory CBF/GLIS AML and was presented at the ASH 2023 in December 2023. The data showed that luvelta was well tolerated as a monotherapy agent and in combination with standard cancer therapies. Luvelta was granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA in December 2022 in this pediatric patient population. We expect to begin enrollment of a registration-directed trial of luvelta for treatment of pediatric RAM phenotype AML in the second half of 2024.\n\nOur most advanced assets in preclinical development are STRO-003 and STRO-004. We believe STRO-003 has the potential to be a first-in-class and best-in-class ADC targeting ROR1 and that STRO-004 has the potential to be a best-in-class ADC targeting TF. Preclinical data suggest that both STRO-003 and STRO-004 have potent antitumor activity and potential for a differentiated safety profile. We anticipate being ready to file an IND for each of STRO-003 and STRO-004 in 2024 and 2025, respectively.\n\nEnabled through our proprietary XpressCF® and XpressCF+®platforms, we have entered into multi-target, product-focused collaborations with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in the field of oncology, with our ongoing relationships that include an immunostimulatory antibody-drug conjugates collaboration with Astellas, a cytokine derivatives collaboration with Merck,and a licensing agreement for luvelta in Greater China with Tasly. In August 2023, Tasly received its first IND clearance by NMPA in Greater China for luvelta.\n\nOur XpressCF® and XpressCF+® platforms have also supported Vaxcyte, focused on discovery and development of vaccines for the treatment and prophylaxis of infectious disease. The lead programs for Vaxcyte are VAX-31 and VAX-24, its 31-valent and 24-valent, respectively, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine candidates. Vaxcyte is responsible for performing all research and development activities, and we provide technical support and supply XtractCF® and other materials to Vaxcyte. In June 2023, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Blackstone, in which Blackstone acquired the right to receive our 4% revenue interest in Vaxcyte’s future products, including Vaxcyte’s pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, or PCV, products such as VAX-24 and its second-generation PCV product, VAX-31. As described further below, following agreement with Vaxcyte on the Form Definitive Agreement and upon effectiveness of an amendment to the licensing agreement, the revenue interest in the 4% royalty on potential future sales of Vaxcyte products other than Vaxcyte’s PCV products reverted to us. In November 2023, Vaxcyte exercised its option to access expanded rights to develop and manufacture cell-free extract for use in development and manufacture of its vaccine products, among certain other rights.\n\nSince the commencement of our operations, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to performing research and development and manufacturing activities in support of our own product development efforts and those of our collaborators, raising capital to support and expand such activities and providing general and administrative support for these operations. We have funded our operations to date primarily from upfront, milestone and other payments under our collaboration agreements with BMS, Merck, Astellas, EMD Serono, Vaxcyte, BioNova, and Tasly, the issuance and sale of redeemable convertible preferred stock, our initial public offering, or IPO, follow-on public offerings of common stock, sales of our common stock through our ATM Facility, debt financing, and the royalty monetization agreement with Blackstone.\n\n106  \n---  \n  \nWe do not have any products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from commercial product sales. We had a loss from operations of $89.3 million and a net loss of $106.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, which net loss included the non-operating, unrealized gain of $9.9 million related to our holdings of Vaxcyte common stock. We had a loss from operations of $128.9 million and net loss of $119.2 million, which net loss included the non-operating, unrealized gain of $12.1 million related to our holdings of Vaxcyte common stock, for the year ended December 31, 2022. Substantially all of our losses have resulted from expenses incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We cannot assure you that we will have net income or that we will generate positive cash flow from operating activities in the future. As of December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of $559.4 million. We do not expect to generate any revenue from commercial product sales unless and until we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval for one or more of our product candidates, which we expect will take a number of years. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, access, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. Our operating expenses would significantly increase due to continued activities to develop, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates, engage in other research and development activities, expand our pipeline of product candidates, continue to develop our manufacturing facility and capabilities, maintain and expand our intellectual property portfolio, seek regulatory and marketing approval for any product candidates that we may develop, acquire or in-license other assets or technologies, ultimately establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain marketing approval, and operate as a public company. Current capital market conditions provide a challenging financing environment. In this context, we are continuing our process of evaluating our programs and spending. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, depending on the timing of our clinical trials, our expenditures on other research and development activities and the timing of achievement and receipt of upfront, milestones and other collaboration agreement payments.\n\nA discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021 is included in Item 7 of Part II “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the SEC on March 30, 2023.\n\nFinancial Operations Overview\n\nRevenue\n\nWe do not have any products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from commercial product sales. Our total revenue to date has been generated principally from our collaboration and license agreements with BMS, Merck, Astellas, EMD Serono, Vaxcyte, BioNova and Tasly, and to a lesser extent, from manufacturing, supply and services and materials we provide to the above collaborators.\n\nWe derive revenue from collaboration arrangements, under which we may grant licenses to our collaboration partners to further develop and commercialize our proprietary product candidates. We may also perform research and development activities under the collaboration agreements. Consideration under these contracts generally includes a nonrefundable upfront payment, development, regulatory and commercial milestones and other contingent payments, and royalties based on net sales of approved products. Additionally, the collaborations may provide options for the customer to acquire from us materials and reagents, clinical product supply or additional research and development services under separate agreements. We assess which activities in the collaboration agreements are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately. We develop assumptions that require judgement to determine whether the license to our intellectual property is distinct from the research and development services or participation in activities under the collaboration agreements.\n\nAt the inception of each agreement, we determine the arrangement transaction price, which includes variable consideration, based on the assessment of the probability of achievement of future milestones and contingent payments and other potential consideration. We recognize revenue over time by measuring our progress towards the complete satisfaction of the relevant performance obligation using an appropriate input or output method based on the nature of the service promised to the customer.\n\nFor arrangements that include multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to the identified performance obligations based on the standalone selling price, or SSP, of each distinct performance obligation. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, we develop assumptions that require judgment to\n\n107  \n---  \n  \ndetermine the SSP for each performance obligation identified in the contract. These key assumptions may include full-time equivalent, or FTE, personnel effort, estimated costs, discount rates and probabilities of clinical development and regulatory success.\n\nPlease see further discussion on the revenue recognition treatment of performance obligations under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.\n\nOperating Expenses\n\nResearch and Development\n\nResearch and development expenses represent costs incurred in performing research, development and manufacturing activities in support of our own product development efforts and those of our collaborators, and include salaries, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, laboratory supplies, outsourced research and development expenses, professional services and allocated facilities-related costs. We expense both internal and external research and development costs as they are incurred. Nonrefundable advance payments for services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses and recognized as expenses as the related services are performed.\n\nOur research and development expenses would increase in the future due to continued activities to advance our product candidates into and through preclinical studies and clinical trials, pursue regulatory approval of our product candidates, expand our pipeline of product candidates, and continue to develop our manufacturing facility and capabilities. The process of conducting the necessary preclinical and clinical research to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time consuming. The actual probability of success for our product candidates may be affected by a variety of factors including: the safety and efficacy of our product candidates, early clinical data, investment in our clinical programs, the ability of collaborators to successfully develop our licensed product candidates, competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. As a result of the uncertainties discussed above, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when and to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of our product candidates.\n\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses incurred during the indicated periods. The internal costs include personnel, facility costs and research and scientific related activities associated with our pipeline. The external program costs reflect external costs attributable to our clinical development candidates and preclinical candidates selected for further development. Such expenses include third-party costs for preclinical and clinical studies and research, development and manufacturing services, and other consulting costs.\n\nYear ended December 31,  \n---  \n2023 | 2022  \n(in thousands)  \nInternal costs:  \nResearch and drug discovery | $ | 34,822 | $ | 34,571  \nProcess and product development | 20,810 | 15,708  \nManufacturing | 44,176 | 39,613  \nClinical development | 12,601 | 9,159  \nTotal internal costs | 112,409 | 99,051  \nExternal Program Costs:  \nResearch and drug discovery | 3,955 | 3,621  \nProcess and product development | 3,052 | 642  \nManufacturing | 36,085 | 20,758  \nClinical development | 24,924 | 13,099  \nTotal external program costs | 68,016 | 38,120  \nTotal research and development expenses | $ | 180,425 | $ | 137,171  \n  \n108  \n---  \n  \nGeneral and Administrative\n\nOur general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, expenses for outside professional services, including legal, human resources, audit, accounting and tax services and allocated facilities-related costs. Personnel costs include salaries, employee benefits and stock-based compensation. We expect to incur expenses operating as a public company, including expenses related to compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC and listing standards applicable to companies listed on the Nasdaq Global Market, additional insurance expenses, investor relations activities and other administrative and professional services. The size of our administrative function and our general and administrative expenses to support the anticipated growth of our business would increase as we continue to advance our product candidates into and through the clinic.\n\nInterest Income\n\nInterest income consists primarily of interest earned on our invested funds.\n\nUnrealized Gain (Loss) on Equity Securities\n\nUnrealized gain (loss) on equity securities consists of the remeasurement of our investment in Vaxcyte common stock.\n\nNon-cash interest expense related to the sale of future royalties\n\nNon-cash interest expense related to the sale of future Vaxcyte royalties represents the imputed interest expense on our deferred royalty obligation related to the sale of future Vaxcyte royalties pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, using the effective interest method. As further described in the financial statements in Note 10. Deferred Royalty Obligation Related to the Sale of Future Royalties, in June 2023, we entered into the Purchase Agreement with Blackstone, pursuant to which we sold to Blackstone our 4% royalty, or revenue interest, in the potential future net sales of Vaxcyte products, including Vaxcyte’s PCV products, such as VAX-24 and VAX-31. As described further below, following agreement with Vaxcyte on the Form Definitive Agreement and upon effectiveness of an amendment to the licensing agreement, the revenue interest in the 4% royalty on potential future sales of Vaxcyte products other than Vaxcyte’s PCV products reverted to us.\n\nNon-cash interest expense will be recognized over the estimated life of the royalty term arrangement using the effective interest method based on the imputed interest rate derived from estimated amounts and timing of potential future royalty payments to be earned and received by Blackstone from Vaxcyte under the 2015 License Agreement.\n\nInterest and Other Income (Expense), Net\n\nInterest expense includes interest incurred on our debt and amortization of debt issuance costs, including accretion of the final payment. Additionally, we identified a financing component under the Astellas Agreement and recorded interest expense associated with the upfront payment. Other income (expense) includes realized gain (loss) on the equity securities.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nWe recorded an income tax charge of $18.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2023. The income tax charge was primarily due to unfavorable book-tax differences related to capitalizing and amortizing research and development expenditures under Internal Revenue Code, or IRC, Section 174, the upfront payment from the sale of future royalties, deferred revenue, foreign income tax, and IRC Section 382 limitations imposed on the utilization of our historical tax attributes as a result of cumulative ownership changes that we experienced in prior years.\n\nWe recorded a foreign income tax charge of $2.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, due to a withholding tax in China on an upfront license fee payment received from Tasly.\n\n109  \n---  \n  \nAll other income tax charges and benefits for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 have been immaterial, primarily due to the net loss in each year.\n\nOur deferred assets continue to be subject to full valuation allowance for the tax years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. We regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred income tax assets by considering both positive and negative evidence related to whether it is more likely than not that our deferred income tax assets will be realized. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred income tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred income tax liabilities, future tax rates, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations.\n\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\n\nYear ended December 31, | Change  \n---|---  \n2023 | 2022 | $ | %  \n(in thousands)  \nRevenue | $ | 153,731 | $ | 67,772 | $ | 85,959 | 127 | %  \nOperating expenses:  \nResearch and development | 180,425 | 137,171 | 43,254 | 32 | %  \nGeneral and administrative | 62,584 | 59,544 | 3,040 | 5 | %  \nTotal operating expenses | 243,009 | 196,715 | 46,294 | 24 | %  \nLoss from operations | (89,278 | ) | (128,943 | ) | 39,665 | (31 | )%  \nInterest income | 14,510 | 3,455 | 11,055 | 320 | %  \nUnrealized gain on equity securities | 9,917 | 12,130 | (2,213 | ) | (18 | )%  \nNon-cash interest expense related to the sale of future royalties | (12,570 | ) | - | (12,570 | ) | *  \nInterest and other income (expense), net | (11,180 | ) | (3,346 | ) | (7,834 | ) | 234 | %  \nLoss before provision for income taxes | (88,601 | ) | (116,704 | ) | 28,103 | (24 | )%  \nProvision for income taxes | 18,192 | 2,500 | 15,692 | 628 | %  \nNet loss | $ | (106,793 | ) | $ | (119,204 | ) | $ | 12,411 | (10 | )%  \n  \n*Percentage not meaningful\n\nRevenue\n\nWe have recognized revenue as follows during the indicated periods:\n\nYear Ended December 31, | Change  \n---|---  \n2023 | 2022 | $ | %  \n(in thousands)  \nBristol-Myers Squibb Company (\"BMS\") | $ | 5,590 | $ | 9,752 | $ | (4,162 | ) | (43 | )%  \nMerck Sharp & Dohme Corporation (\"Merck\") | 5,869 | 11,600 | (5,731 | ) | (49 | )%  \nMerck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany (operating in the United States and Canada under the name \"EMD Serono\") | 8 | 2,695 | (2,687 | ) | (100 | )%  \nAstellas Pharma Inc.

This was primarily due to a $97.5 million increase in Vaxcyte revenue from an earned $97.5 million in upfront and option exercise payments related to the Option exercised by Vaxcyte under the Vaxcyte Agreement, and a $23.1 million increase from Astellas, of which $13.1 million was from the ongoing performance related to partially unsatisfied performance obligations, $5.3 million was from research and development services, and $4.7 million was from the financing component related to the Astellas Agreement,. These increases were partially offset by an $18.0 million decrease in Tasly revenue from an earned $25.0 million upfront payment in 2022 under the Tasly License Agreement, partially offset by a contingent payment of $5.0 million earned in 2023, and a $2.0 million in clinical product supply under the 2023 Tasly Supply Agreement, a $5.7 million decrease in Merck revenue primarily due to an earned $10.0 million contingent payment from Merck in 2022, a $0.8 million decrease from the 2022 completion of the performance obligation associated with the extension of the research term for the first target program under the 2018 Merck Agreement, partially offset by a $5.1 million increase in manufacturing activities supporting clinical trial supply, a $4.0 million decrease in BioNova revenue due to an earned licensing option payment in 2022, and a $4.2 million and $2.7 million decrease in BMS and EMD Serono revenue, respectively, due to their decisions to end clinical development of CC-99712 and M1231, respectively, in 2023.\n\nResearch and Development Expense\n\nResearch and development expense increased by $43.2 million, or 32%, during the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The overall increase was primarily due to increases of $18.1 million in consulting and outside services mainly due to increased CMO-related activities, $13.4 million in personnel-related expenses due to higher headcount, $11.4 million in clinical development expenses, $3.9 million in facilities-related expenses, and $1.3 million in equipment and office-related expenses, partially offset by a decrease of $3.0 million in preclinical research expenses, and $1.9 million in laboratory supplies.\n\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\n\nGeneral and administrative expense increased by $3.0 million, or 5%, during the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The overall increase was primarily due to increases of $2.6 million in consulting and outside services, $1.1 million in equipment and office-related expenses, and $0.7 million in facilities-related expenses, partially offset by a $1.4 million decrease in personnel-related expenses.\n\nInterest Income\n\nInterest income increased by $11.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, due primarily to higher average investment balances and higher average rates of return in 2023.\n\nUnrealized Gain on Equity Securities\n\nUnrealized gain on equity securities was $9.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to an unrealized gain of $12.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. The unrealized gain on equity securities in each period was entirely due to the remeasurement of the estimated fair value of our investment in Vaxcyte common stock.\n\nNon-cash Interest Expense related to the Sale of Future Royalties\n\nNon-cash interest expense increased by $12.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. Non-cash interest expense was recognized on our deferred royalty obligation related to the June 2023 sale of future Vaxcyte royalties pursuant to the Purchase Agreement using the effective interest method based on the imputed interest rate derived from estimated amounts and timing of potential future royalty payments to be earned and received by Blackstone from Vaxcyte under the 2015 License Agreement. No non-cash interest expense was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\n111  \n---  \n  \nInterest and Other Income (Expense), Net\n\nInterest and other income (expense), net, increased by $7.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the increase of $4.7 million from the financing component related to the Astellas Agreement, a $4.1 million decrease in recognized gain on sale of equity securities sold during the year ended December 31, 2022, partially offset by a decrease of $1.1 million in interest incurred on our outstanding loan.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nSources of Liquidity\n\nTo date, we have incurred significant net losses, and negative cash flows from operations. Our operations have been funded primarily by payments received from our collaborators, and net proceeds from equity sales, debt, and a royalty monetization. As of December 31, 2023, we had $333.7 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, equity securities of $41.9 million, outstanding debt of $4.1 million and an accumulated deficit of $559.4 million.\n\nUpfront Payment from Blackstone\n\nIn June 2023, we entered into a Purchase Agreement with Blackstone, pursuant to which we sold to Blackstone our 4% royalty, or revenue interest, in potential future net sales of Vaxcyte products, including Vaxcyte’s PCV products, such as VAX-24 and VAX-31. As described further below, following agreement with Vaxcyte on the Form Definitive Agreement and upon effectiveness of an amendment to the licensing agreement, the revenue interest in the 4% royalty on potential future sales of Vaxcyte products other than Vaxcyte’s PCV products reverted to us.\n\nWe retain the right to discover and develop vaccines for the treatment or prophylaxis of any disease that is not caused by an infectious pathogen, including cancer.\n\nBlackstone made an upfront payment of $140.0 million to us and is also obligated to pay up to an additional $250.0 million upon the achievement of various return thresholds, as set forth in the Purchase Agreement.\n\nUpfront Payments from Vaxcyte and Vaxcyte Equity Ownership\n\nIn December 2022, we entered into a letter agreement (the “Vaxcyte Agreement”) with Vaxcyte under which the Company granted to Vaxcyte (i) authorization to enter into an agreement with an independent alternate contract manufacturing organization, or CMO, to source cell-free extract solely for the products it licensed from the us, allowing Vaxcyte to have direct oversight over financial and operational aspects of the relationship with the CMO, and (ii) a right, but not an obligation, to obtain certain exclusive rights to internally manufacture and/or source extract from certain CMOs and the right to independently develop and make improvements to extract for use in connection with the exploitation of certain vaccine compositions (the “Option”).\n\nPursuant to the Vaxcyte Agreement, we received from Vaxcyte a one-time, nonrefundable, non-creditable, upfront payment of $10.0 million in cash, and 167,780 shares of Vaxcyte’s common stock with a fair value of $7.5 million at the date of the transaction in December 2022.\n\nAdditionally, pursuant to the Vaxcyte Agreement, we agreed with Vaxcyte to negotiate the terms and conditions of the Form Definitive Agreement to be entered into in the event Vaxcyte exercises the Option. In September 2023, we mutually agreed in writing with Vaxcyte upon the Form Definitive Agreement, and in October 2023, we received a $5.0 million payment from Vaxcyte.\n\nIn November 2023 (the \"Exercise Date\"), Vaxcyte exercised the Option by submitting written notice thereof to us and concurrently paid us $50.0 million in cash as the first of two installment payments for the Option exercise price. Under the Vaxcyte Agreement, Vaxcyte is obligated to pay us an additional $25.0 million in cash within six months of the Exercise Date as the second of two installment payments for the Option exercise price. Upon the occurrence of certain regulatory milestones, Vaxcyte would be obligated to pay us up to $60.0 million in cash. In the event that Vaxcyte undergoes a change of control, certain rights and payments may be accelerated.\n\n112  \n---  \n  \nAs of December 31, 2023, we held 667,780 shares of Vaxcyte common stock, which include the 167,780 shares received from Vaxcyte under the Vaxcyte Agreement. The estimated fair value of Vaxcyte common stock was $41.9 million as of December 31, 2023.\n\nAt-The-Market Sales\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we sold an aggregate of 1,857,410 shares of our common stock through our ATM Facility pursuant to the Sales Agreement with Jefferies. The gross proceeds from these sales were approximately $12.4 million, before deducting fees of approximately $0.4 million, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $12.0 million.\n\nContingent and Upfront Payments from Tasly\n\nIn August 2023, Tasly received the first IND clearance by the NMPA in Greater China. As a result of this achievement, we earned a $5.0 million contingent payment from Tasly under the Tasly License Agreement. The contingent payment, net of withholding tax of $0.5 million, resulted in a net payment to us of $4.5 million received in October 2023.\n\nIn September 2023, we received a $5.0 million contingent payment from Tasly related to the first patient dosed in our REFRaME-O1 trial for luvelta, net of withholding tax of $0.5 million. The REFRaME-O1 study consists of two parts, Part I being the dose-finding portion and Part II being the portion of the study that will focus on the selected dose from Part I, and is intended to generate data to enable the potential registration of luvelta. Although we currently intend to conduct the REFRaME-O1 study to completion, we have the sole discretion to terminate the REFRaME-O1 study at any time. As such, we have agreed with Tasly, that in the event we terminate the REFRaME-O1 study prior to dosing the first patient in Part II, we will refund Tasly the contingent payment received by us within 30 days of such study termination.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we earned a $25.0 million nonrefundable upfront payment from Tasly under the Tasly License Agreement to grant Tasly an exclusive license to develop and commercialize luvelta in Greater China. The upfront payment, net of a withholding tax of $2.5 million, resulted in a net payment to us of $22.5 million received during the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\nUpfront Payment from Astellas\n\nIn June 2022, we entered into a License and Collaboration Agreement with Astellas, for the development of immunostimulatory antibody-drug conjugates for up to three biological targets, to be identified by Astellas. Pursuant to the agreement with Astellas, we received from Astellas a one-time, nonrefundable, non-creditable, upfront payment of $90.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\nContingent Payment from Merck\n\nIn July 2022, the first patient was dosed in a Phase 1 study of MK-1484, an investigational candidate resulting from the 2018 Merck Agreement for the first program in our collaboration to develop novel cytokine derivative therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. As a result of this achievement, we earned and received a $10.0 million contingent payment from Merck during the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\nTerm Loan\n\nOn February 28, 2020, or the Effective Date, we entered into a loan and security agreement, (the \"LSA\"), with Oxford Finance LLC, or Oxford, as the collateral agent and a lender, and Silicon Valley Bank, as a lender, together with Oxford, the Lenders, pursuant to which the Lenders have agreed to lend us up to an aggregate of $25.0 million (the \"Term A Loan\"). Upon entering into the Loan and Security Agreement, we borrowed $25.0 million from the Lenders, with approximately $9.6 million of such amount applied to the repayment of the outstanding principal, interest and final payment fees owed pursuant to the prior loan and security agreement dated August 4, 2017.\n\nIn June 2022, we entered into an amendment to the LSA with Oxford and SVB (the “LSA Amendment”). The LSA Amendment added a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a minimum unrestricted cash balance of\n\n113  \n---  \n  \n$10.0 million. We were in compliance with the financial covenant under the LSA Amendment as of December 31, 2023.\n\nIn June 2023, we entered into an amendment to the LSA with Oxford and SVB (the “5th LSA Amendment”). Under the 5th LSA Amendment, effective July 1, 2023, the loan bears interest at the floating per annum rate of interest equal to the greater of (i) 8.07% and (ii) the sum of (a) a specific published 1-month secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) reported on the last business day of the month that immediately precedes the month in which the interest will accrue, plus (b) 0.10%, plus (c) 6.40%. There was an immaterial impact of the 5th LSA Amendment on our financial statements.\n\nThe Term A Loan matured on March 1, 2024 (the “Maturity Date”) and the Company made a final payment of 3.83% of the original principal amount of the Term A Loan on the Maturity Date under the LSA.\n\nIn connection with entering into the LSA, we issued to the Lenders warrants exercisable for 81,257 shares of our common stock, or the Debt Warrants. The Debt Warrants are exercisable in whole or in part, immediately, and have a per share exercise price of $9.23, which was the closing price of our common stock reported on the Nasdaq Global Market on the day prior to the Effective Date. The Debt Warrants will terminate on the earlier of February 28, 2030 or the closing of certain merger or consolidation transactions.\n\nLeases\n\nIn June 2021, we entered into a third amendment, or Third Amendment, to our manufacturing facility lease, dated May 18, 2011, as amended, by and between Alemany Plaza LLC, located at San Carlos, California, or San Carlos Lease, as an extension to the term of the San Carlos Lease for a period of five years, or the Lease Extension Period. Pursuant to the Third Amendment, the San Carlos Lease will expire on July 31, 2026, and it includes an option to renew the San Carlos Lease for an additional five years. The aggregate estimated base rent payments due over the Lease Extension Period is approximately $4.2 million, subject to certain terms contained in the San Carlos Lease.\n\nIn June 2021, we entered into a first amendment, or First Amendment, to our manufacturing facility lease, dated March 4, 2015, as amended, by and between 870 Industrial Road LLC, located at San Carlos, California, or the Industrial Lease, as an extension to the term of the Industrial Lease for a period of five years, or the Industrial Lease Extension Period. Pursuant to the first Amendment, the Industrial Lease will expire on June 30, 2026, and it includes an option to renew the Industrial Lease for an additional five years. The aggregate estimated base rent payments due over the Industrial Lease Extension Period is approximately $4.3 million, subject to certain terms contained in the Industrial Lease.\n\n114  \n---  \n  \nIn September 2020, we entered into a sublease agreement, or the Sublease with Five Prime Therapeutics, Inc., or the Sublessor, for approximately 115,466 square feet, in a building located in South San Francisco, California, or the Premises. We use the Premises as our corporate headquarters and to conduct (or expand) research and development activities. We commenced making monthly payments for the first 85,755 square feet of the Premises, or Initial Premises, in July 2021, with occupancy of such space commencing in August 2021. We were provided early access to the Initial Premises in the fourth quarter of 2020 to conduct certain planning and tenant improvement work. The Sublease is subordinate to the lease agreement, effective December 12, 2016, between the Sublessor and HCP Oyster Point III LLC, or the Landlord. We commenced using the remaining 29,711 square feet of the Premises, or the Expansion Premises, on July 1, 2023 under the sublease agreement. The Sublease for both the Initial Premises and Expansion Premises will expire on December 31, 2027. With a commencement date on the Initial Premises of July 1, 2021, and Expansion Premises of July 1, 2023, the aggregate estimated base rent payments due over the term of the Sublease are approximately $39.1 million, including the approximately $5.2 million in potential financial benefit to us of base rent abatement to be provided by the Sublessor, subject to certain terms contained in the Sublease. The Sublease contains customary provisions requiring us to pay our pro rata share of utilities and a portion of the operating expenses and certain taxes, assessments and fees of the Premises and provisions allowing the Sublessor to terminate the Sublease upon the termination of the lease with the Landlord or if we fail to remedy a breach of certain of its obligations within specified time periods. Additionally, we posted a security deposit of $0.9 million, which is reflected as restricted cash in non-current assets on our Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\nFunding Requirements\n\nBased upon our current operating plan, we believe that our existing capital resources will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next twelve months after the date of this filing. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. We will continue to require additional financing to advance our current product candidates into and through clinical development, to develop, acquire or in-license other potential product candidates, pay our obligations and to fund operations for the foreseeable future.\n\nWe may seek to raise any necessary additional capital through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements, marketing and distribution arrangements, royalty monetizations, or other sources of financing. Adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Any failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on our financial condition and on our ability to pursue our business plans and strategies, and may cause us to delay, reduce the scope of or suspend one or more of our pre-clinical and clinical studies, research and development programs or commercialization efforts, and may necessitate us to delay, reduce or terminate planned activities in order to reduce costs. Due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates and the extent to which we may enter into additional collaborations with third parties to participate in their development and commercialization, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical studies.\n\nTo the extent we raise additional capital through new collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our product candidates, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we do raise additional capital through public or private equity or convertible debt offerings, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our stockholders’ rights. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, we may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.\n\n115  \n---  \n  \nCash Flows\n\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows during the periods indicated:\n\nYear Ended December 31,  \n---  \n2023 | 2022  \n(in thousands)  \nCash (used in) provided by operating activities | $ | (111,616 | ) | $ | 3,549  \nCash used in investing activities | (3,924 | ) | (35,022 | )  \nCash provided by financing activities | 137,554 | 48,313  \nNet increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash | $ | 22,014 | $ | 16,840  \n  \nCash Flows from Operating Activities\n\nCash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $111.6 million. Our net loss of $106.8 million included non-cash charges of $24.9 million for stock-based compensation, $12.6 million for non-cash interest expense on our deferred royalty obligation, $9.9 million for the unrealized gain on equity securities as a result of the remeasurement of the estimated fair value of our investment in Vaxcyte common stock, $9.1 million for the accretion of discount on our marketable securities, $6.8 million for depreciation and amortization, $3.6 million for noncash lease expenses and $0.6 million in other non-cash charges. Cash used in operating activities also reflected a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $34.4 million, due to a decrease of $32.6 million in our deferred revenue from revenue recognized under our collaboration agreements, an increase of $28.9 million in accounts receivable primarily due to a receivable from Vaxcyte under the Vaxcyte Agreement, and a decrease of $4.6 million in our operating lease liability, which were partially offset by an increase of $30.1 million in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities mainly due to the tax liability and timing of payments, an increase of $1.5 million in accrued compensation due to increased headcount, and a decrease of $0.1 million in prepaid expenses and other assets.\n\nCash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $3.5 million. Our net loss of $119.2 million included non-cash charges of $26.3 million for stock-based compensation, $12.1 million for the unrealized gain on equity securities as a result of the remeasurement of the estimated fair value of our investment in Vaxcyte common stock, $5.7 million for depreciation and amortization, $4.1 million for the realized gain on equity securities, $2.6 million for noncash lease expenses, $0.4 million for the accretion of discount on our marketable securities and $0.3 million in other non-cash charges. Cash provided by operating activities also reflected a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $104.4 million, due to an increase of $93.6 million in our deferred revenue balance primarily due to the upfront payment from Astellas, a decrease of $5.3 million in accounts receivable from our collaborators, an increase of $5.3 million in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities due to timing of payments, an increase of $1.7 million in accrued compensation due to increased headcount, and an increase of $1.9 million in our operating lease liability, which were partially offset by an increase of $3.5 million in prepaid expenses and other assets.\n\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\n\nCash used in investing activities of $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily related to purchases of marketable securities of $460.3 million and purchases of property and equipment of $4.3 million, principally for laboratory equipment, partially offset by maturities and sales of marketable securities of $460.7 million.\n\nCash used in investing activities of $35.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily related to purchases of marketable securities of $216.7 million and purchases of property and equipment of $7.9 million, principally for laboratory equipment, partially offset by maturities and sales of marketable securities of $160.8 million and proceeds from sale of Vaxcyte equity securities of $28.7 million.\n\n116  \n---  \n  \nCash Flows from Financing Activities\n\nCash provided by financing activities of $137.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily related to $136.2 million of net proceeds from the sale of future royalties, $12.0 million of net proceeds from our ATM Facility sales of common stock, $2.0 million of net proceeds received from participants in our employee equity plans and $0.3 million of proceeds received from the exercise of common stock options, partially offset by debt repayment of $12.5 million and a $0.5 million tax payment related to the net share settlement of certain vested restricted stock units.\n\nCash provided by financing activities of $48.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily related to $56.3 million of net proceeds from our ATM Facility sales of common stock, $1.6 million of net proceeds received from participants in our employee equity plans and $0.3 million of proceeds received from the exercise of common stock options, partially offset by debt repayment of $9.4 million and a $0.5 million tax payment related to the net share settlement of certain vested restricted stock units.\n\nContractual Obligations and Other Commitments\n\nIn addition to the contractual obligations and commitments as noted above and elsewhere in this Annual Report with regards to the leases and term loans, we enter into agreements in the normal course of business, including with contract research organizations for clinical trials, contract manufacturing organizations for certain manufacturing services, and vendors for preclinical studies and other services and products for operating purposes, which are generally cancelable upon written notice.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nOur management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenue generated and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our financial statements included elsewhere in this report, we believe that the following critical accounting policies are most important to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results.\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nWe do not have any products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from commercial product sales. Our total revenue to date has been generated principally from our collaboration and license agreements with BMS, Merck, Astellas, EMD Serono, Vaxcyte, BioNova, Tasly, and to a lesser extent, from manufacturing, supply and services and materials we provide to our collaborators.\n\nWhen we enter into collaboration agreements, we assess whether the arrangements fall within the scope of ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements (ASC 808) based on whether the arrangements involve joint operating activities and whether both parties have active participation in the arrangement and are exposed to significant risks and rewards. To the extent that the arrangement falls within the scope of ASC 808, we assess whether the payments between us and our collaboration partner fall within the scope of other accounting literature. If we conclude that payments from the collaboration partner to us represent consideration from a customer, such as license fees and contract research and development activities, we account for those payments within the scope of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\n\nUnder ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of ASC 606, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii)\n\n117  \n---  \n  \nidentify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. However, if we conclude that our collaboration partner is not a customer for certain activities and associated payments, such as for certain collaborative research, development, manufacturing and commercial activities, we present such payments as a reduction of research and development expense or general and administrative expense, based on where we present the underlying expense.\n\nCollaboration revenue: We derive revenue from collaboration arrangements, under which we may grant licenses to our collaboration partners to further develop and commercialize our proprietary product candidates. We may also perform research and development activities under the collaboration agreements. Consideration under these contracts generally includes a nonrefundable upfront payment, development, regulatory and commercial milestones and other contingent payments, and royalties based on net sales of approved products. Additionally, the collaborations may provide options for the customer to acquire from us materials and reagents, clinical product supply or additional research and development services under separate agreements.\n\nWe assess which activities in the collaboration agreements are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately. We develop assumptions that require judgement to determine whether the license to our intellectual property is distinct from the research and development services or participation in activities under the collaboration agreements.\n\nAt the inception of each agreement, we determine the arrangement transaction price, which includes variable consideration, based on the assessment of the probability of achievement of future milestones and contingent payments and other potential consideration. We recognize revenue over time by measuring the progress towards the complete satisfaction of the relevant performance obligation using an appropriate input or output method based on the nature of the service promised to the customer.\n\nFor arrangements that include multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to the identified performance obligations based on the standalone selling price, or SSP, of each distinct performance obligation. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, we develop assumptions that require judgment to determine the SSP for each performance obligation identified in the contract. These key assumptions may include full-time equivalent, or FTE, personnel effort, estimated costs, discount rates and probabilities of clinical development and regulatory success.\n\nUpfront Payments: For collaboration arrangements that include a nonrefundable upfront payment, if the license fee and research and development services cannot be accounted for as separate performance obligations, the transaction price is deferred and recognized as revenue over the expected period of performance using a cost-based input methodology. We use judgement to assess the pattern of delivery of the performance obligation. In addition, amounts paid in advance of services being rendered may result in an associated financing component to the upfront payment. Accordingly, the interest on such borrowing cost component will be recorded as interest expense and revenue, based on an appropriate borrowing rate applied to the value of services to be performed by us over the estimated service performance period.\n\nLicense Grants: For collaboration arrangements that include a grant of a license to our intellectual property, we consider whether the license grant is distinct from the other performance obligations included in the arrangement. For licenses that are distinct, we recognize revenues from nonrefundable, upfront payments and other consideration allocated to the license when the license term has begun and we have provided all necessary information regarding the underlying intellectual property to the customer, which generally occurs at or near the inception of the arrangement.\n\nMilestone and Contingent Payments: At the inception of the arrangement and at each reporting date thereafter, we assess whether we should include any milestone and contingent payments or other forms of variable consideration in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue would not occur upon resolution of the uncertainty, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, we re-evaluate the probability of achievement of each such milestone and any related constraint and, if necessary, adjust our estimate of the overall transaction price. Since milestone and contingent payments may become payable to us upon the initiation of a clinical study or filing for or receipt of regulatory approval, we review the relevant facts and circumstances to determine when we should update the transaction price, which may occur\n\n118  \n---  \n  \nbefore the triggering event. When we update the transaction price for milestone and contingent payments, we allocate the changes in the total transaction price to each performance obligation in the agreement on the same basis as the initial allocation. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period of adjustment, which may result in recognizing revenue for previously satisfied performance obligations in such period. Our collaborators generally pay milestones and contingent payments subsequent to achievement of the triggering event.\n\nResearch and Development Services: For amounts allocated to our research and development obligations in a collaboration arrangement, we recognize revenue over time using a cost-based input methodology, representing the transfer of goods or services as activities are performed over the term of the agreement.\n\nMaterials Supply: We provide materials and reagents, clinical materials and services to certain of our collaborators under separate agreements. The consideration for such services is generally based on FTE personnel effort used to manufacture those materials, reimbursed at an agreed upon rate in addition to agreed-upon pricing for the provided materials. The amounts billed are recognized as revenue as the performance obligations are met by us.\n\nRevenue subject to governmental withholding taxes is recognized on a gross basis with the withholding taxes recorded as a component of income tax expense.\n\nResearch and Development\n\nWe record accrued expenses for estimated costs of our research and development activities conducted by third party service providers, which include outsourced research and development expenses, professional services and contract manufacturing activities. We record the estimated costs of research and development activities based upon the estimated amount of services provided but not yet invoiced, and include these costs in current liabilities in the Balance Sheets and within research and development expense in the Statements of Operations.\n\nNonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are deferred and capitalized and recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed.\n\nFor outsourced research and development expenses, such as professional fees payable to third parties for preclinical studies, clinical trials and research services and other consulting costs, we estimate the expenses based on the services performed, pursuant to contracts with research institutions that conduct and manage preclinical studies, clinical trials and research services on our behalf. We estimate these expenses based on discussions with internal management personnel and external service providers as to the progress or stage of completion of services and the contracted fees to be paid for such services. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the original estimates, we will adjust the accrual accordingly. Payments made to third parties under these arrangements in advance of the performance of the related services by the third parties are recorded as prepaid expenses until the services are rendered.\n\nStock-Based Compensation\n\nWe measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based awards, including restricted stock units, stock options, and the ESPP, to employees, consultants and nonemployee directors based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the grant date. The fair value of stock options and purchase rights under the ESPP are estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes model requires use of assumptions and judgments about the variables used in the calculations, including the expected term, the expected volatility of the underlying stock, the related risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the award and the expected dividends.\n\nStock-based compensation expense for restricted stock units and stock options is generally recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period. Stock-based compensation expense for the ESPP is recognized on a straight-line basis over the offering period. We account for forfeitures of stock-based awards as they occur.\n\n119  \n---  \n  \nThe closing sale price per share of our common stock as reported on the Nasdaq Global Market on the date of grant is used to determine the exercise price per share of our stock-based awards to purchase common stock.\n\nDeferred Royalty Obligation related to the Sale of Future Royalties and Non-cash Interest Expense\n\nWe treated the sale of Vaxcyte future royalties to Blackstone as a deferred royalty obligation, as we had ongoing manufacturing obligations under the 2015 License Agreement in the generation of the cash flows. Due to our then ongoing manufacturing obligations, we will account for any royalties earned as non-cash revenue. As royalties are remitted to Blackstone from Vaxcyte, the balance of the deferred royalty obligation will be effectively amortized over the estimated life of the royalty term arrangement. We recorded the proceeds from this transaction as a liability on our Balance Sheets related to the sale of future royalties to be amortized to interest expense using the effective interest rate method over the estimated life of the royalty term arrangement. The liability related to the sale of future royalties and the related interest expense are based on our current estimates of future royalties expected to be earned by Blackstone from Vaxcyte over the estimated life of the royalty term arrangement. We periodically assess the estimated royalties to be earned using forecasts from external sources. To the extent our future estimates of earned royalties are greater or less than previous estimates or the estimated timing of such payments is materially different than our previous estimates, we will prospectively recognize related non-cash interest expense.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had federal net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards of $140.2 million and federal general business credits from research and development expenses totaling $20.0 million, as well as state NOL carryforwards of $100.5 million and state research and development credits of $26.0 million. If not utilized, the federal NOL carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in 2027, and the federal credits will expire at various dates beginning in 2032. The state NOL carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in 2031, if not utilized. The state research and development tax credits can be carried forward indefinitely.\n\nUtilization of the net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Tax Reform Act of 1986, or the Tax Reform Act, as amended, and similar state provisions. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of NOLs and credits before utilization. We have performed Section 382 study through December 31, 2022, and concluded that we experienced an ownership change on November 20, 2019, and December 31, 2022. This change does not limit our ability to use our existing NOLs within the carryforward period provided by the Internal Revenue Code, subject to availability of taxable income. We may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of equity offerings or other shifts in our stock ownership, some of which are outside our control. If there is a subsequent event or further change in ownership, these losses may be subject to limitations, resulting in their expiration before they can be utilized.\n\nWe assess all material positions taken in any income tax return, including all significant uncertain positions, in all tax years that are still subject to assessment or challenge by relevant taxing authorities. Assessing an uncertain tax position begins with the initial determination of the position’s sustainability and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. As of each balance sheet date, unresolved uncertain tax positions must be reassessed, and we will determine whether (i) the factors underlying the sustainability assertion have changed and (ii) the amount of the recognized tax benefit is still appropriate. The recognition and measurement of tax benefits requires significant judgment. Judgments concerning the recognition and measurement of a tax benefit might change as new information becomes available.\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nSee Note 2 to our audited financial statements included elsewhere in this report for more information.\n\n120  \n---  \n  \nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\n\nWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate sensitivities. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital to fund our operations. We also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk. To achieve our objectives, we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities of high credit quality.\n\nWe had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $333.7 million and $302.3 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which consisted of money market funds, commercial paper, corporate debt securities, asset-backed securities, U.S. government securities, U.S. agency securities and supranational debt securities. Such interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk; however, historical fluctuations in interest income have not been significant. Additionally, we had equity securities of $41.9 million as of December 31, 2023, consisting solely of common stock of Vaxcyte.\n\nEquity risk is the risk we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in equity prices. Our potential exposure to changes in equity prices results from our Vaxcyte common stock holdings. Therefore, we are subject to market risk if such holdings materially decrease in value. A hypothetical 10 percent decrease in the market price for our equity investments as of December 31, 2023 would decrease the fair value by $4.2 million. We intend to manage equity price risk going forward by continuously evaluating market conditions.\n\nWe do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure. We have not been exposed nor do we anticipate being exposed to material risks due to changes in interest rates. A hypothetical 10% change in market interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial statements. We do not believe that our cash, cash equivalents or marketable securities have significant risk of default or illiquidity.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had $4.1 million and $16.3 million, respectively, in debt outstanding, net of debt discount and accretion of final payment. Until June 30, 2023, our existing debt with Oxford and SVB bore interest at a floating per annum rate equal to the greater of (i) 8.07% or (ii) the sum of (a) the greater of (1) the thirty (30) day U.S. LIBOR rate reported in the Wall Street Journal on the last business day of the month that immediately precedes the month in which the interest will accrue or (2) 1.67%, plus (b) 6.40%. In June 2023, we entered into an amendment to the LSA with Oxford and SVB (the “5th LSA Amendment”). Under the 5th LSA Amendment, effective July 1, 2023, the loan bears interest at the floating per annum rate of interest equal to the greater of (i) 8.07% and (ii) the sum of (a) a specific published 1-month secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) reported on the last business day of the month that immediately precedes the month in which the interest will accrue, plus (b) 0.10%, plus (c) 6.40%. There was an immaterial impact of the 5th LSA Amendment on our financial statements. This debt matured on March 1, 2024 and was interest-only through March 1, 2022. Such interest-bearing debt carried a limited degree of interest rate risk. If overall interest rates had increased or decreased by 100 basis points during the periods presented our interest expense would not have been materially affected.\n\n121  \n---  \n  \nItem 8.

(the Company) as of December 31, 2023, and 2022, the related statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023, and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\n\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\nCritical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\nRoyalty agreement with Blackstone Life Sciences  \n---  \nDescription of the Matter | As discussed in Note 2 and Note 10 to the financial statements, on June 21, 2023, the Company closed a purchase and sale agreement (the “Agreement”) with Blackstone Life Sciences (“Blackstone”), pursuant to which the Company sold to Blackstone its 4% royalty in potential net sales of Vaxcyte Inc.’s products and received an upfront payment of $140 million. The Company concluded the Agreement represented a sale of future royalties and accounted for the transaction under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 470 as debt. The Company estimated the amount of future royalty payments and expected interest expense using the effective interest rate method over the life of the agreement. The carrying  \n  \n123  \n---  \n  \nvalue of the liability related to the sale of future royalties at December 31, 2023 was $149.1 million and the interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $12.6 million. The auditing of the Agreement was complex due to the significant judgment and estimation used by management related to the sale of future royalties and due to the nature and extent of audit effort required to address these matters. The accounting involves significant judgment and inherent uncertainties as it relates to the Company's estimate of future sales for which royalties will be paid, which in turn significantly impacts the calculation of interest expense recognized.  \n---  \nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit | To test the carrying value of the liability related to the sale of future royalties and the amount of interest expense recognized, our audit procedures included, among others, assessing the methodology used, evaluating the reasonableness of the significant estimates discussed above, and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used by the Company. Specifically, we tested the calculation of the liability balance including the classification of the balance as non-current. In addition, we evaluated the Company’s estimate of future sales, by comparing the estimates to available peer data and market research. We also recalculated the current year interest expense using the effective interest method based on the Company’s estimate of future royalties to be paid. We involved professionals outside of the core audit team to assist in the assessment of the estimation methodology and significant assumptions used in determining the future sales for which royalties will be paid.  \n  \n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2007.\n\nSan Mateo, California\n\nMarch 25, 2024\n\n124  \n---  \n  \nSUTRO BIOPHARMA, INC.\n\nBALANCE SHEETS\n\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\n\nDecember 31,  \n---  \n2023 | 2022  \nAssets  \nCurrent assets:  \nCash and cash equivalents | $ | 69,268 | $ | 47,254  \nMarketable securities | 264,413 | 255,090  \nInvestment in equity securities | 41,937 | 32,020  \nAccounts receivable | 36,078 | 7,122  \nPrepaid expenses and other current assets | 9,846 | 11,667  \nTotal current assets | 421,542 | 353,153  \nProperty and equipment, net | 21,940 | 24,621  \nOperating lease right-of-use assets | 22,815 | 26,443  \nOther non-current assets | 3,567 | 1,855  \nRestricted cash | 872 | 872  \nTotal assets | $ | 470,736 | $ | 406,944  \nLiabilities and Stockholders’ Equity  \nCurrent liabilities:  \nAccounts payable | $ | 9,440 | $ | 4,797  \nAccrued compensation | 14,686 | 13,142  \nDeferred revenue-current | 20,666 | 16,759  \nOperating lease liability-current | 6,420 | 4,585  \nDebt-current | 4,061 | 12,500  \nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities | 38,473 | 14,764  \nTotal current liabilities | 93,746 | 66,547  \nDeferred revenue, non-current | 53,379 | 89,885  \nOperating lease liability-non-current | 23,154 | 29,574  \nDebt-non-current | -

Organization and Principal Activities\n\nDescription of Business\n\nSutro Biopharma, Inc. (the “Company”), is a clinical-stage oncology company developing site-specific and novel-format antibody drug conjugates, or ADCs. The Company was incorporated on April 21, 2003 and is headquartered in South San Francisco, California.\n\nThe Company operates in one business segment, the development of biopharmaceutical products. Operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available and is evaluated regularly by the Chief Executive Officer, the Company’s chief operating decision maker, in deciding how to allocate resources and assessing performance. The Company operates and manages its business as one operating segment. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer reviews financial information on an aggregate basis for the purposes of allocating and evaluating financial performance.\n\nAll of the Company’s long-lived assets are maintained in the United States.\n\nAt-The-Market Sales\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company sold an aggregate of 1,857,410shares of its common stock through its At-the-Market Facility (“ATM Facility”) pursuant to its Open Market Sales AgreementSM dated April 2, 2021 with Jefferies LLC (“Jefferies”), as sales agent (the “Sales Agreement”).\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the gross proceeds from these sales were approximately $12.4 million, before deducting fees of approximately $0.4 million, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $12.0 million, to the Company.\n\nLiquidity\n\nThe Company has incurred significant losses and has negative cash flows from operations. As of December 31, 2023, there was an accumulated deficit of $559.4 million. Management expects to continue to incur additional substantial losses in the foreseeable future as a result of the Company’s research and development and other operational activities.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $333.7 million and equity securities of $41.9 million, consisting solely of common stock of Vaxcyte, which are available to fund future operations. The Company will need to raise additional capital to support the completion of its research and development activities and to support its operations.\n\nThe Company believes that its unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and investments in equity securities as of December 31, 2023 will enable the Company to maintain its operations for a period of at least 12 months following the filing date of these financial statements.\n\n130  \n---  \n  \n2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nBasis of Presentation and Use of Estimates\n\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and market-specific or other relevant assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the Company’s Balance Sheets and the amounts of expenses and income reported for each of the periods presented are affected by estimates and assumptions, which are used for, but are not limited to, determining research and development periods under collaboration arrangements, stock-based compensation expense, valuation of marketable securities, impairment of long-lived assets, income taxes, deferred royalty obligation related to the sale of future royalties and related non-cash interest expense, and certain accrued liabilities. Actual results could differ from such estimates or assumptions.\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\n\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which enhances the disclosures required for operating segments in the Company's annual and interim financial statements. ASU 2023-07 is effective for the Company in the Company's annual reporting for fiscal 2024 and for interim period reporting beginning in fiscal 2025 on a retrospective basis. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2023-07 on the Company's financial statements.\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which enhances the disclosures required for income taxes in the Company's annual financial statements. ASU 2023-09 is effective for the Company in the Company's annual reporting for fiscal 2025 on a prospective basis. Early adoption and retrospective reporting are permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2023-09 on the Company's financial statements.\n\nCash, Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities and Restricted Cash\n\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Investments with original maturities of greater than 90 days from the date of purchase but less than one year from the balance sheet date, or where the Company's intent is to use the investments to fund current operations or to make them available for current operations are classified as current, while investments with maturities in one year or beyond one year from the balance sheet date are classified as long-term investments.\n\nAvailable-for-sale marketable securities are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Realized gains and losses are included in interest income in the Company’s Statements of Operations. There were no material realized gains or losses in the periods presented. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific-identification method.\n\nThe Company evaluates, on a quarterly basis, its marketable securities for potential impairment. For marketable securities in an unrealized loss position, the Company assesses whether such declines are due to credit loss based on factors such as changes to the rating of the security by a ratings agency, market conditions and supportable forecasts of economic and market conditions, among others. If a credit loss exists, the Company assesses whether it has plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not it will be required to sell any marketable security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either condition is met, the security’s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value and is recognized through interest and other income (expense), net.\n\n131  \n---  \n  \nIf neither condition is met, declines as a result of credit losses, if any, are recognized as an allowance for credit loss, limited to the amount of unrealized loss, through interest and other income (expense), net. Any portion of unrealized loss that is not a result of a credit loss, is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss).\n\nThe Company invests in money market funds, commercial paper, corporate debt securities, asset-based securities, U.S. government securities, U.S. agency securities and supranational debt securities with high credit ratings. The Company has established guidelines regarding diversification of its investments and their maturities, with the objectives of maintaining safety and liquidity while maximizing yield.\n\nUnder certain agreements, the Company has pledged cash and cash equivalents as collateral. As of both December 31, 2023 and 2022, restricted cash related to such agreements was $0.9 million.\n\nA reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported within the Company’s Balance Sheets to the amount reported within the accompanying Statements of Cash Flows was as follows:\n\nDecember 31,  \n---  \n2023 | 2022 | 2021  \n(in thousands)  \nCash and cash equivalents | $ | 69,268 | $ | 47,254 | $ | 30,414  \nRestricted cash | 872 | 872 | 872  \nTotal cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash shown in the Statements of Cash Flows | $ | 70,140 | $ | 48,126 | $ | 31,286  \n  \nConcentrations of Credit Risk\n\nCash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist of financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk, to the extent of the amounts recorded on the Balance Sheets. The Company minimizes the amount of credit exposure by investing cash that is not required for immediate operating needs in money market funds, government obligations and/or commercial paper with short maturities.\n\nThe Company performs a regular review of its collaborators’ credit risk and payment histories when circumstances warrant, including payments made subsequent to year-end. When appropriate, the Company provides for an allowance for credit risks by reserving for specifically identified doubtful accounts, although historically the Company has not experienced credit losses from its accounts receivable.\n\nInvestments in Equity Securities\n\nVaxcyte common stock held by the Company is measured at fair value at each reporting period based on the closing price of Vaxcyte’s common stock on the last trading day of each reporting period, with any realized or unrealized gains and losses recorded in the Company’s Statements of Operations.\n\nProperty and Equipment, Net\n\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is determined using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally three to five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the term of the lease. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred and costs of improvement are capitalized.\n\n132  \n---  \n  \nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\n\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets, including property and equipment, leasehold improvements and right-of-use assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when the estimated, undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount. Impairment, if any, is measured at the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.\n\nThe Company did not recognize any impairment charges during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, management believes that no revision to the remaining useful lives or write down of the remaining long-lived assets is required.\n\nLeases\n\nThe Company adoptedASU 2016-02 (Topic 842), Leases (Accounting Standards Codification, or “ASC”, 842) on July 1, 2021, effective as of January 1, 2021. The Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at contract inception by assessing whether the arrangement contains an identified asset and whether the lessee has the right to control such asset. The Company is required to classify leases as either finance or operating leases and to record a Right-of-Use (ROU) asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term greater than 12 months regardless of the lease classification. The lease classification will determine whether the lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest rate method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The Company determines the initial classification and measurement of its ROU assets and lease liabilities at the lease commencement date and thereafter, if modified. The Company does not have material finance leases.\n\nFor leases with a term greater than 12 months, the Company records the related ROU asset and lease liability at the present value of lease payments over the term of the lease. The term of the Company’s leases equals the non-cancellable period of the lease, including any rent-free periods provided by the lessor, and also includes options to extend or terminate the lease that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise. The ROU asset equals the carrying amount of the related lease liability, adjusted for any lease payments made prior to lease commencement and lease incentives provided by the lessor. Variable lease payments are expensed as incurred and do not factor into the measurement of the applicable ROU asset or lease liability.\n\nThe Company has elected, for all classes of underlying assets, not to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term of 12 months or less. Lease cost for short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has also elected to not separate lease and non-lease components for its leases and, as a result, accounts for lease and non-lease components as one component.\n\nThe Company’s leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate. Therefore, the Company estimates its incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments based on information available at lease commencement. The Company determines its incremental borrowing rate based on the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow, on a collateralized basis over a similar term, an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment.\n\nLease payments may be fixed or variable; however, only fixed payments are included in the Company’s lease liability calculation. Lease costs for the Company’s operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis within operating expenses over the lease term. The Company’s lease agreements may contain variable non-lease components such as common area maintenance, operating expenses or other costs, which are expensed as incurred.\n\nDeferred Royalty Obligation related to the Sale of Future Royalties and Non-cash Interest Expense\n\nIn June 2023, the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Blackstone, pursuant to which the Company sold to Blackstone its 4% royalty, or revenue interest, in the potential future net sales of Vaxcyte products, including Vaxcyte’s pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, or PCV, products such as VAX-24 and its second-generation PCV product, VAX-31, (the “Purchased Interest”) under that certain Amended and Restated SutroVax Agreement, dated October 12, 2015, by and between the Company and Vaxcyte, as amended (the “2015 License Agreement”). In June 2023, Blackstone made an upfront payment of\n\n133  \n---  \n  \n$140.0 million to the Company and will also pay up to an additional $250.0 million upon the achievement of various return thresholds as set forth in the Purchase Agreement. The net proceeds from the upfront payment received by the Company from the sale of future royalties from Vaxcyte are recorded as deferred royalty obligation related to the sale of future royalties on the Company's Balance Sheets. As royalties are earned and remitted pursuant to the 2015 License Agreement, the balance of the deferred royalty obligation will be amortized over the estimated life of the royalty term arrangement, and non-cash interest expense related to the sale of future royalties is recorded using the effective interest method. To determine the amortization of the deferred royalty obligation, the Company is required to estimate the total amount of future royalties to be earned under the 2015 License Agreement. There are a number of factors that could materially affect the amount and timing of royalty payments earned, most of which are not within the Company's control. The Company periodically assesses the amount of royalty payments expected to be earned which are subject to the Purchase Agreement and, to the extent that the amount or timing of such earned royalties is materially different than the Company's original estimates, the Company will prospectively adjust the imputed interest rate and the related amortization of the deferred royalty obligation. As described in Note 5. Collaboration and License Agreements and Supply Agreements, Vaxcyte Agreement, following agreement with Vaxcyte on the Form Definitive Agreement and upon effectiveness of the amendment No. 3 to the 2015 License Agreement, the revenue interest in the 4% royalty on potential future net sales of Vaxcyte products other than Vaxcyte’s PCV products reverted to the Company.\n\nIssuance fees and costs directly related to the Purchase Agreement were offset against the initial carrying value of the deferred royalty obligation and were amortized using the effective interest method over the estimated life of the royalty term arrangement.\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nWhen the Company enters into collaboration agreements, it assesses whether the arrangements fall within the scope of ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements (\"ASC 808\") based on whether the arrangements involve joint operating activities and whether both parties have active participation in the arrangement and are exposed to significant risks and rewards. To the extent that the arrangement falls within the scope of ASC 808, the Company assesses whether the payments between the Company and its collaboration partner fall within the scope of other accounting literature. If it concludes that payments from the collaboration partner to the Company represent consideration from a customer, such as license fees and contract research and development activities, the Company accounts for those payments within the scope of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09 (Topic 606), Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”).\n\nUnder ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of ASC 606, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies a performance obligation. However, if the Company concludes that its collaboration partner is not a customer for certain activities and associated payments, such as for certain collaborative research, development, manufacturing and commercial activities, the Company presents such payments as a reduction of research and development expense or general and administrative expense, based on where the Company presents the underlying expense.\n\nThe Company has no products approved for commercial sale and has not generated any revenue from commercial product sales. The total revenue to date has been generated principally from collaboration and license agreements and to a lesser extent, from manufacturing, supply and services and materials the Company provides to its collaboration partners.\n\nCollaboration Revenue: The Company derives revenue from collaboration arrangements, under which the Company may grant licenses to its collaboration partners to further develop and commercialize its proprietary product candidates. The Company may also perform research and development activities under the collaboration agreements. Consideration under these contracts generally includes a nonrefundable upfront payment, development, regulatory and commercial milestones and other contingent payments, and royalties based on net sales of approved products. Additionally, the collaborations may provide options for the customer to acquire from the Company materials and reagents, clinical product supply or additional research and development services under separate agreements.\n\n134  \n---  \n  \nThe Company assesses which activities in the collaboration agreements are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately. The Company develops assumptions that require judgement to determine whether the license to the Company’s intellectual property is distinct from the research and development services or participation in activities under the collaboration agreements.\n\nAt the inception of each agreement, the Company determines the arrangement transaction price, which includes variable consideration, based on the assessment of the probability of achievement of future milestones and contingent payments and other potential consideration. The Company recognizes revenue over time by measuring its progress towards the complete satisfaction of the relevant performance obligation using an appropriate input or output method based on the nature of the service promised to the customer.\n\nFor arrangements that include multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price to the identified performance obligations based on the standalone selling price, or SSP, of each distinct performance obligation. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, the Company develops assumptions that require judgment to determine the SSP for each performance obligation identified in the contract. These key assumptions may include full-time equivalent, or FTE, personnel effort, estimated costs, discount rates and probabilities of clinical development and regulatory success.\n\nUpfront Payments: For collaboration arrangements that include a nonrefundable upfront payment, if the license fee and research and development services cannot be accounted for as separate performance obligations, the transaction price is deferred and recognized as revenue over the expected period of performance using a cost-based input methodology. The Company uses judgement to assess the pattern of delivery of the performance obligation. In addition, amounts paid in advance of services being rendered may result in an associated financing component to the upfront payment. Accordingly, the interest on such borrowing cost component will be recorded as interest expense and revenue, based on an appropriate borrowing rate applied to the value of services to be performed by the Company over the estimated service performance period.\n\nLicense Grants: For collaboration arrangements that include a grant of a license to the Company’s intellectual property, the Company considers whether the license grant is distinct from the other performance obligations included in the arrangement. For licenses that are distinct, the Company recognizes revenues from nonrefundable, upfront payments and other consideration allocated to the license when the license term has begun and the Company has provided all necessary information regarding the underlying intellectual property to the customer, which generally occurs at or near the inception of the arrangement.\n\nMilestone and Contingent Payments: At the inception of the arrangement and at each reporting date thereafter, the Company assesses whether it should include any milestone and contingent payments or other forms of variable consideration in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue would not occur upon resolution of the uncertainty, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, the Company re-evaluates the probability of achievement of each milestone and any related constraint and, if necessary, adjusts its estimate of the overall transaction price. Since milestone and contingent payments may become payable to the Company upon the initiation of a clinical study or filing for or receipt of regulatory approval, the Company reviews the relevant facts and circumstances to determine when the Company should update the transaction price, which may occur before the triggering event. When the Company updates the transaction price for milestone and contingent payments, the Company allocates the changes in the total transaction price to each performance obligation in the agreement on the same basis as the initial allocation. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period of adjustment, which may result in recognizing revenue for previously satisfied performance obligations in such period. The Company’s collaborators generally pay milestones and contingent payments subsequent to achievement of the triggering event.\n\nResearch and Development Services: For amounts allocated to the Company’s research and development obligations in a collaboration arrangement, the Company recognizes revenue over time using a cost-based input methodology, representing the transfer of goods or services as activities are performed over the term of the agreement.\n\n135  \n---  \n  \nMaterials Supply: The Company provides materials and reagents, clinical materials and services to certain of its collaborators under separate agreements. The consideration for such services is generally based on FTE personnel effort used to manufacture those materials reimbursed at an agreed upon rate in addition to agreed-upon pricing for the provided materials. The amounts billed are recognized as revenue as the performance obligations are met by the Company.\n\nRevenue subject to governmental withholding taxes is recognized on a gross basis with the withholding taxes recorded as a component of income tax expense.\n\nResearch and Development\n\nThe Company records accrued expenses for estimated costs of the research and development activities conducted by third party service providers, which include outsourced research and development expenses, professional services and contract manufacturing activities. The Company records the estimated costs of research and development activities based upon the estimated amount of services provided but not yet invoiced, and includes these costs in current liabilities in the Balance Sheets and within research and development expense in the Statements of Operations.\n\nNonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are deferred and capitalized and recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed.\n\nFor outsourced research and development expenses, such as professional fees payable to third parties for preclinical studies, clinical trials and research services and other consulting costs, the Company estimates the expenses based on the services performed, pursuant to contracts with research institutions that conduct and manage preclinical studies, clinical trials and research services on the Company’s behalf. The Company estimates these expenses based on discussions with internal management personnel and external service providers as to the progress or stage of completion of services and the contracted fees to be paid for such services. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the original estimates, the Company will adjust the accrual accordingly. Payments made to third parties under these arrangements in advance of the performance of the related services by the third parties are recorded as prepaid expenses until the services are rendered.\n\nStock-Based Compensation\n\nThe Company maintains a stock-based compensation plan as a long-term incentive for employees, consultants, and members of the Company’s Board of Directors. The plan allows for the issuance of restricted stock units, non-statutory and incentive stock options to employees and non-statutory stock options to nonemployees. The Company also maintains an employee stock purchase plan.\n\nThe Company measures and recognizes compensation expense for all stock-based awards, including restricted stock units, stock options, and the ESPP, to employees, consultants and nonemployee directors based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the grant date. The fair value of stock options and purchase rights under the ESPP are estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes model requires the Company to make assumptions and judgments about the variables used in the calculations, including the expected term, the expected volatility of the underlying stock over the expected term of the award, the related risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the award and the expected dividends.\n\nStock-based compensation expense for restricted stock units and stock options is generally recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period. Stock-based compensation expense for the ESPP is recognized on a straight-line basis over the offering period. The Company accounts for forfeitures of stock-based awards as they occur.\n\nThe closing sale price per share of our common stock as reported on the Nasdaq Global Market on the date of grant is used to determine the exercise price per share of our stock-based awards to purchase common stock.\n\n136  \n---  \n  \nIncome Taxes\n\nThe Company provides for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Current income tax expense or benefit represents the amount of income taxes expected to be payable or refundable for the current year. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and net operating loss and credit carryforwards, and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such items are expected to reverse. Deferred income tax assets are reduced, as necessary, by a valuation allowance when management determines it is more likely than not that some or all of the tax benefits will not be realized.\n\nThe Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 740-10, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. The Company assesses all material positions taken in any income tax return, including all significant uncertain positions, in all tax years that are still subject to assessment or challenge by relevant taxing authorities. Assessing an uncertain tax position begins with the initial determination of the position’s sustainability and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. As of each balance sheet date, unresolved uncertain tax positions must be reassessed, and the Company will determine whether (i) the factors underlying the sustainability assertion have changed and (ii) the amount of the recognized tax benefit is still appropriate. The recognition and measurement of tax benefits requires significant judgment. Judgments concerning the recognition and measurement of a tax benefit might change as new information becomes available.\n\nThe Company includes any penalties and interest expense related to income taxes as a component of interest and other income (expense), net, as necessary.\n\nFair Value Measurements\n\nFair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability, or an exit price, in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date, and establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available, and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The Company determined the fair value of financial assets and liabilities using the fair value hierarchy that describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value, as follows:\n\nLevel 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities;\n\nLevel 2—Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; and\n\nLevel 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\n\nThe carrying amounts of accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and accrued compensation and benefits approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these items.\n\nThe fair value of the Company’s outstanding loan(See Note 7) is estimated using the net present value of the payments, discounted at an interest rate that is consistent with market interest rate, which is a Level 2 input. The estimated fair value of the Company’s outstanding loan approximates the carrying amount, as the loan bears a floating rate that approximates the market interest rate.\n\nThe carrying value of the deferred royalty obligation related to the sale of future royalties under the 2015 License Agreement with Vaxcyte approximates its fair value as of December 31, 2023, and is based on the Company's current estimates of future royalties expected to be earned over the estimated life of the royalty term arrangement. See Note 10. Deferred Royalty Obligation Related to the Sale of Future Royalties for a description of the Level 3 inputs used to estimate the fair value of the liability.\n\n137  \n---  \n  \nNet Loss Per Share\n\nBasic net loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period, without consideration for potential dilutive common shares. Basic net loss per share is the same as diluted net loss per share as the inclusion of all potentially dilutive securities would have been anti-dilutive given the net loss of the Company.\n\n3. Fair Value Measurements\n\nThe following table sets forth the fair value of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis by level within the fair value hierarchy: \n\nDecember 31, 2023  \n---  \nTotal | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3  \n(in thousands)  \nAssets:  \nMoney market funds | $ | 56,397 | $ | 56,397 | $ | - | $ | -  \nCommercial paper | 82,152 | - | 82,152 | -  \nCorporate debt securities | 61,894 | - | 61,894 | -  \nEquity securities | 41,937 | 41,937 | - | -  \nAsset-backed securities | 10,505 | - | 10,505 | -  \nU.S. government securities | 113,652 | 113,652 | - | -  \nU.S. agency securities | 4,961 | - | 4,961 | -  \nTotal | $ | 371,498 | $ | 211,986 | $ | 159,512 | $ | -  \nDecember 31, 2022  \n---  \nTotal | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3  \n(in thousands)  \nAssets:  \nMoney market funds | $ | 36,486 | $ | 36,486 | $ | - | $ | -  \nCommercial paper | 87,140 | - | 87,140 | -  \nCorporate debt securities | 36,429 | - | 36,429 | -  \nEquity securities | 32,020 | 32,020 | - | -  \nAsset-backed securities | 14,016 | - | 14,016 | -  \nU.S. government securities | 91,251 | 91,251 | - | -  \nU.S. agency securities | 16,607 | - | 16,607 | -  \nSupranational debt securities | 16,481 | - | 16,481 | -  \nTotal | $ | 330,430 | $ | 159,757 | $ | 170,673 | $ | -  \n  \nWhere applicable, the Company uses quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets to determine fair value. This pricing methodology applies to Level 1 investments, which are comprised of money market funds, U.S. government securities and the shares of Vaxcyte common stock held by the Company.\n\nIf quoted prices in active markets for identical assets are not available, then the Company uses quoted prices for similar assets or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, either directly or indirectly. These investments are included in Level 2 and consist of commercial paper, corporate debt securities, asset-backed securities, U.S. agency securities and supranational debt securities. These assets are valued using market prices when available, adjusting for accretion of the purchase price to face value at maturity.\n\nA financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires management to make judgments and consider factors specific to the asset or liability.\n\nIn certain cases where there is limited activity or less transparency around inputs to valuation, securities are classified as Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy. As of December 31, 2023, the deferred royalty obligation\n\n138  \n---  \n  \nrelated to the sale of future Vaxcyte royalties was classified as Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy. Refer to Note 10 below for information relating to the Purchase Agreement between the Company and Blackstone, pursuant to which the Company sold to Blackstone its 4% royalty, or revenue interest, in potential future net sales of Vaxcyte products, including VAX-24 and VAX-31. As of December 31, 2022, the Company did not hold any securities that were classified as Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy.\n\nInvestments in Equity Securities\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company held 667,780shares of Vaxcyte common stock with an estimated fair value of $41.9 million and $32.0 million, respectively. The Company recognized an unrealized gain (loss) of $9.9 million, $12.1 million and $(4.5) million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nTheCompany sold zero and 1,058,434 shares of Vaxcyte common stock at their fair market value during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company recognized a gain of $4.1 million on equity securities during the year ended December 31, 2022 which is recorded under interest and other income (expense), net, in the Statements of Operations.\n\n4. Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\n\nCash equivalents and marketable securities consisted of the following:\n\nDecember 31, 2023  \n---  \nAmortizedCost Basis | UnrealizedGains | UnrealizedLosses | FairValue  \n(in thousands)  \nMoney market funds | $ | 56,397 | $ | - | $ | - | $ | 56,397  \nCommercial paper | 82,179 | 1 | (28 | ) | 82,152  \nCorporate debt securities | 61,887 | 12 | (5 | ) | 61,894  \nAsset-based securities | 10,505 | - | - | 10,505  \nU.S. government securities | 113,612 | 40 | - | 113,652  \nU.S. agency securities | 4,960 | 1 | - | 4,961  \nTotal | 329,540 | 54 | (33 | ) | 329,561  \nLess: amounts classified as cash equivalents | (65,144 | ) | (4 | ) | - | (65,148 | )  \nTotal marketable securities | $ | 264,396 | $ | 50 | $ | (33 | ) | $ | 264,413  \nDecember 31, 2022  \n---  \nAmortizedCost Basis | UnrealizedGains | UnrealizedLosses | FairValue  \n(in thousands)  \nMoney market funds | $ | 36,486 | $ | - | $ | - | $ | 36,486  \nCommercial paper | 87,140 | - | - | 87,140  \nCorporate debt securities | 36,554 | 2 | (127 | ) | 36,429  \nAsset-based securities | 14,026 | - | (10 | ) | 14,016  \nU.S. government securities | 91,619 | 8 | (376 | ) | 91,251  \nU.S. agency securities | 16,646 | - | (39 | ) | 16,607  \nSupranational debt securities | 16,555 | - | (74 | ) | 16,481  \nTotal | 299,026 | 10 | (626 | ) | 298,410  \nLess: amounts classified as cash equivalents | (43,318 | ) | (2 | ) | - | (43,320 | )  \nTotal marketable securities | $ | 255,708 | $ | 8 | $ | (626 | ) | $ | 255,090  \n  \nNo marketable securities had maturities of more than one year as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\nThere were $110.9 million and $139.5 million of investments in an unrealized loss position of $33,000 and $0.6 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not record any other-than-temporary impairment charges on its available-for-sale\n\n139  \n---  \n  \nsecurities. Based on the Company’s procedures under the expected credit loss model, including an assessment of unrealized gains and losses on the portfolio after December 31, 2023, the Company concluded that the unrealized losses for its marketable securities were not attributable to credit and therefore an allowance for credit losses for these securities has not been recorded as of December 31, 2023. Also, based on the scheduled maturities of the investments, the Company was more likely than not to hold these investments for a period of time sufficient for a recovery of the Company’s cost basis.\n\nThe Company recognized no material gains or losses on its cash equivalents and current marketable securities as of December 31, 2023 and as a result, the Company did not reclassify any amounts out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the year then ended.\n\n5. Collaboration and License Agreements and Supply Agreements\n\nThe Company has entered into collaboration and license agreements and supply agreements with various pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. The Company analyzes its agreements to determine whether it should account for the agreements within the scope of ASC 808, and, if so, it analyzes whether it should account for any elements under ASC 606.\n\nThe Company’s accounts receivable balances may contain billed and unbilled amounts from upfront payments, milestones and other contingent payments, as well as reimbursable costs from collaboration and license agreements and supply agreements. The Company has not experienced credit losses from its accounts receivable and, therefore, has not recorded a reserve for estimated credit losses as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\nIn accordance with the collaboration, license, and supply agreements, the Company recognized revenue as follows:\n\nYear Ended December 31,  \n---  \n2023 | 2022 | 2021  \n(in thousands)  \nBristol-Myers Squibb Company (\"BMS\") | $ | 5,590 | $ | 9,752 | $ | 11,483  \nMerck Sharp & Dohme Corporation (\"Merck\") | 5,869 | 11,600 | 42,780  \nMerck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany (operating in the United States and Canada under the name \"EMD Serono\") | 8 | 2,695 | 4,576  \nAstellas Pharma Inc.

(“BioNova”) | - | 4,000 | -  \nTotal revenue | $ | 153,731 | $ | 67,772 | $ | 61,880  \n  \nThe following table presents the changes in the Company’s deferred revenue balance from the agreements during the year ended December 31, 2023:\n\nYear ended  \n---  \nDecember 31, 2023  \n(in thousands)  \nDeferred revenue—December 31, 2022 | $ | 106,644  \nAdditions to deferred revenue | 11,018  \nRecognition of revenue in current period | (43,617 | )  \nDeferred revenue—December 31, 2023 | $ | 74,045  \n  \nThe Company’s balance of deferred revenue contains upfront and contingent payments for obligations from our agreements which remain partially unsatisfied. The Company expects to recognize approximately$20.7 million of the deferred revenue over the next twelve months.\n\n140  \n---  \n  \nCollaboration with BMS\n\nBMS Agreement and 2018 BMS Master Services Agreement\n\nIn September 2014, the Company signed a Collaboration and License Agreement (the “BMS Agreement”) with BMS to discover and develop bispecific antibodies and/or antibody-drug conjugates (“ADCs”), focused primarily on the field of immuno-oncology, using the Company’s proprietary integrated cell-free protein synthesis platform, XpressCF®. In August 2017, the Company entered into an amended and restated collaboration and license agreement with BMS to refocus the collaboration on four programs that were advancing through preclinical development, including an ADC program targeting B cell maturation antigen (“BCMA ADC” or “CC-99712”).\n\nIn May 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration cleared the investigational new drug (“IND”) application for the BCMA ADC, which was discovered and manufactured by the Company and is the first collaboration program IND.\n\nIn March 2018, the Company entered into a Master Development and Clinical Manufacturing Services Agreement (the “2018 BMS Master Services Agreement”) with BMS, wherein BMS requested the Company to provide development, manufacturing and supply chain management services, including clinical product supply.\n\nIn June 2023, the Company received a notice of termination from BMS indicating that it was stopping development of CC-99712 due to a portfolio prioritization decision. The termination of the BMS Agreement was effective as of October 7, 2023 (the \"Termination Date\"). Following the Termination Date, the Company has sole worldwide rights to CC-99712.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there was no deferred revenue under the BMS Agreement.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there was zero and $3.1 million, respectively, of deferred revenue under the 2018 BMS Master Services Agreement.\n\nRevenues under the BMS Agreement and the 2018 BMS Master Services Agreement were as follows:\n\nYear ended December 31,  \n---  \n2023 | 2022 | 2021  \n(in thousands)  \nResearch and development services | $ | 412 | $ | 700 | $ | 940  \nMaterials supply | 5,178 | 9,052 | 10,543  \nTotal revenue | $ | 5,590 | $ | 9,752 | $ | 11,483  \n  \nCollaboration with Merck\n\n2018 Merck Agreement\n\nIn July 2018, the Company entered into an agreement (the “2018 Merck Agreement”) with Merck for access to the Company’s technology and the identification and preclinical research and development of two target programs, with an option for Merck to engage the Company to continue these activities for a third program, upon the payment of an additional amount, focusing on cytokine derivatives for cancer and autoimmune disorders, with an initial transaction price of $60.0 million. The option to expand activities to a third program expired in January 2021.\n\nIn March 2020, Merck exercised its option to extend the research term of the collaboration’s first cytokine-derivative program by one year, which, pursuant to the terms of the 2018 Merck Agreement, triggered a payment of $5.0 million.\n\nIn April 2021, the Company earned a $15.0 million contingent payment for the initiation by Merck of the first IND-enabling toxicology study under the first cytokine-derivative program in the collaboration.\n\n141  \n---  \n  \nIn September 2021, the Company entered into an amendment to the 2018 Merck Agreement (the “2021 Amendment”) to extend the research term for the first program in the 2018 Merck Agreement. Under the terms of the 2021 Amendment, the Company received a payment of $2.5 million with an additional $7.5 million to be received upon the achievement of certain developmental milestones by Merck on a second molecule under the first cytokine-derivative program of the collaboration. Merck decided not to pursue further development of a second molecule under the first cytokine-derivative program of the collaboration and, therefore, allowed the option to extend the period for nomination of additional clinical candidates under the 2021 Amendment to expire in June 2022.\n\nIn December 2021, Merck did not extend the research term for the second research program of the collaboration, which research program reverted to the Company. The first research program of the collaboration is focused on MK-1484, a distinct cytokine derivative molecule for the treatment of cancer. The Company is eligible to receive aggregate contingent payments of up to approximately $500 million for the target program selected by Merck, assuming the development and sale of the therapeutic candidate and all possible indications identified under the collaboration. If one or more products from the target program is developed for non-oncology or a single indication, the Company will be eligible for reduced aggregate contingent payments. In addition, the Company is eligible to receive tiered royalties ranging from mid-single digit to low teen percentages on the worldwide sales of any commercial products that may result from the collaboration.\n\nIn July 2022, the first patient was dosed with MK-1484 in a Phase 1 study. As a result of this achievement, the Company earned and received a $10.0 million contingent payment from Merck during the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there was no deferred revenue under the 2018 Merck Agreement and 2021 Amendment.\n\n2020 Merck Master Services Agreement\n\nIn August 2020, the Company entered into a Pre-Clinical and Clinical Supply Agreement (the “2020 Merck Master Services Agreement”) with Merck, wherein Merck requested the Company to provide development, manufacturing and supply chain management services, including clinical product supply, upon completion of the research programs under the 2018 Merck Agreement.\n\nAs of both December 31, 2023 and 2022, there was no deferred revenue under the 2020 Merck Master Services Agreement.\n\nRevenues under the 2018 Merck Agreement and the 2020 Merck Master Services Agreement were as follows:\n\nYear ended December 31,  \n---  \n2023 | 2022 | 2021  \n(in thousands)  \nOngoing performance related to unsatisfied performance obligations | $ | - | $ | 862 | $ | 35,098  \nContingent payment | - | 10,000 | -  \nResearch and development services | 245 | 577 | 2,666  \nFinancing component on unearned revenue | - | - | 610  \nMaterials supply | 5,624 | 161 | 4,406  \nTotal revenue | $ | 5,869 | $ | 11,600 | $ | 42,780  \n  \nCollaboration with EMD Serono\n\nMDA Agreement and 2019 EMD Serono Supply Agreement\n\nThe Company signed a Collaboration Agreement and a License Agreement with EMD Serono in May 2014 and September 2014, respectively, which were entered into in contemplation of each other and therefore treated as a single agreement for accounting purposes. The Collaboration Agreement was subsumed into the License Agreement (the “MDA Agreement”), which agreement is to develop ADCs for multiple cancer targets.\n\n142  \n---  \n  \nIn April 2019, the Company entered into an ADC Product Preclinical and Phase I Clinical Supply Agreement (the “2019 EMD Serono Supply Agreement”) with EMD Serono, wherein EMD Serono requested the Company to provide development, manufacturing and supply chain management services, including clinical product supply.\n\nIn March 2023, EMD Serono disclosed its decision to close the Phase 1a trial of M1231 in patients with solid tumors and not initiate a previously planned expansion study. EMD Serono stated that the decision was based on strategic portfolio considerations.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there was no deferred revenue related to payments received by the Company under the EMD Serono agreements.\n\nRevenues under the EMD Serono agreements were as follows:\n\nYear ended December 31,  \n---  \n2023 | 2022 | 2021  \n(in thousands)  \nContingent payment | $ | - | $ | - | $ | 2,000  \nResearch and development services | 6 | 510 | 851  \nMaterials supply | 2 | 2,185 | 1,725  \nTotal revenue | $ | 8 | $ | 2,695 | $ | 4,576  \n  \nAstellas License and Collaboration Agreement\n\nIn June 2022, the Company entered into a License and Collaboration Agreement (the “Astellas Agreement”) with Astellas for the development of immunostimulatory antibody-drug conjugates for up to three biological targets, to be identified by Astellas. The Company will conduct research and pre-clinical development of any compound (as designated by Astellas) in each of the three programs in accordance with the terms of a research plan between the Company and Astellas. Astellas will have an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize any such designated compound, subject to the Company’s rights to participate in cost and profit sharing in the United States, as described below.\n\nPursuant to the Astellas Agreement, the Company received from Astellas a one-time, nonrefundable, non-creditable, upfront payment of $90.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. Under ASC 808 and ASC 606, the Company determined that both parties are active participants in the activities and are exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the success of the development program, and identified four performance obligations under the Astellas Agreement as: (1) performance of services related to the first target program; (2) performance of services related to the second target program; (3) performance of services related to the third target program; and (4) the Company’s estimated future services on the collaboration JSC. The transaction price of $90.0 million was allocated among the performance obligations using the Company’s best estimate of the standalone selling price, or SSP, for each of the associated performance obligations. Revenue allocated to the three target programs, which totaled $89.1 million, is being recognized on a proportion of performance basis, using FTE cost as the basis of measurement, with such performance expected to occur over an estimated service period of four years for each target program. As it pertains to the JSC performance obligation, the revenue allocated to such performance obligation was $0.9 million, and is being recognized on a proportion of performance basis using FTE cost as the basis of measurement, and such effort is expected to be incurred on a relatively consistent basis throughout the term of the Astellas Agreement.\n\nAdditionally, under ASC 606, the Company determined a financing component associated with the $90.0 million upfront payment and has calculated $32.8 million as of December 31, 2023 on the unearned revenue portion beyond one year from the effective date of the agreement, which amount is being recognized as interest expense and revenue over the estimated service period for the three target programs.\n\nThe Company is also eligible to receive up to $422.5 million in development, regulatory and commercial milestones for each product candidate, and tiered royalties ranging from low double-digit to mid-teen percentages on worldwide sales of any commercial products that may result from the collaboration, subject to customary deductions under certain circumstances. The Company can also elect to convert any product candidate into a cost and profit-sharing arrangement, for the United States only. In the event the Company makes such election, it will share commercialization costs and profits relating to such product candidate equally with Astellas in the United States, and no royalties will be due from Astellas for net sales of such product candidates in the United States.\n\n143  \n---  \n  \nRevenues under the Astellas Agreement were as follows:\n\nYear ended December 31,  \n---  \n2023 | 2022 | 2021  \n(in thousands)  \nOngoing performance related to unsatisfied performance obligations | $ | 17,015 | $ | 3,940 | $ | -  \nResearch and development services | 6,584 | 1,878 | -  \nFinancing component on unearned revenue | 9,836 | 5,079 | -  \nMaterials supply | 557 | - | -  \nTotal revenue | $ | 33,992 | $ | 10,897 | $ | -  \n  \nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there was $69.0 million and $86.1 million of deferred revenue, respectively, related to the upfront payment received by the Company under the Astellas Agreement.\n\nCollaboration with Tasly\n\nTasly License Agreement\n\nIn December 2021, the Company entered into a license agreement with Tasly to grant Tasly an exclusive license to develop and commercialize STRO-002, or luveltamab tazevibulin, or luvelta, in Greater China (the “Tasly License Agreement”). Tasly will pursue the clinical development, regulatory approval, and commercialization of luvelta in multiple indications, including ovarian cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, and other indications in Greater China. The Company will retain development and commercial rights of luvelta globally outside of Greater China, including the United States.\n\nUnder the Tasly License Agreement, Tasly was obligated to make to the Company an initial nonrefundable upfront payment of $40.0 million, with additional potential payments totaling up to $345 million related to development, regulatory and commercialization contingent payments and milestones. The Company will provide luvelta to Tasly under appropriate clinical and commercial supply service agreements. Upon commercialization, the Company will receive tiered royalties, ranging from low- to mid-teen percentages based on annual net sales of luvelta in Greater China for at least ten years following the first commercial sale of luvelta in Greater China.\n\nThe Company determined that the Tasly License Agreement falls within the scope of ASC 808, as both parties are active participants in the activities and are exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the success of the commercialization of indications for luvelta in Greater China. The Company concluded that the Tasly License Agreement contained the following units of account: i) licensed know-how and Sutro patents, license to trademark rights, and initial regulatory data and information necessary to prepare an IND; and ii) collaboration governance and information sharing activities, such as JSC participation and ongoing regulatory and pharmacovigilance support.\n\nThe promises related to the licensed know-how and Sutro patents, license to trademark rights, and initial regulatory data and information necessary to prepare an IND are considered to be interdependent and not distinct from each other, representing a combined output. The Company determined that these promises are capable of being distinct from the collaboration governance and information sharing activities discussed below and further determined that this unit of account is a vendor-customer relationship and accounted for it in accordance with ASC 606. All potential future milestones and other payments were considered constrained at the inception of the Tasly License Agreement since the Company could not conclude it was probable that a significant reversal in the amount of revenue recognized would not occur. Since there is only one performance obligation accounted for under ASC 606, no allocation of the transaction price was necessary.\n\n144  \n---  \n  \nThe Company determined that the unit of account consisting of collaboration governance and information sharing activities, such as JSC participation and ongoing regulatory and pharmacovigilance support, do not represent a customer-vendor relationship between the Company and Tasly. These promises are considered to be interdependent and not distinct from each other, representing a combined output. However, the Company determined that these promises are capable of being distinct from the intellectual property and data license promises discussed above. As such, based on the nature of the agreement and collaborative activities, the Company determined that the costs associated with these governance and information sharing activities performed under the agreement will be included in research and development expenses in the Statements of Operations, with any reimbursement of costs by Tasly reflected as a reduction of such expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company did not recognize any material reduction of research and development expenses under the Tasly License Agreement.\n\nIn April 2022, the Company entered into amendment No. 1 (the “Tasly Amendment”) to the Tasly License Agreement with Tasly. Pursuant to the Tasly Amendment, the initial nonrefundable upfront payment due by Tasly was amended to $25.0 million, and a $15.0 million payment will become payable to the Company upon the achievement of certain regulatory milestones. The Tasly Amendment also added an additional regulatory milestone payment to the Tasly License Agreement, providing additional potential payments totaling up to $350.0 million related to development, regulatory and commercialization milestones, beyond the payments described above, and made certain other ministerial edits.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized the $25.0 million upfront payment as revenue after the payment, net of a withholding tax, was received by the Company from Tasly. The withholding tax of $2.5 million was recorded as an income tax charge related to the upfront payment.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized a $5.0 million contingent payment as revenue, net of withholding tax, after Tasly received its first IND clearance by National Medical Products Administration, or NMPA, in Greater China. The withholding tax of $0.5 million was recorded as an income tax charge related to the contingent payment.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company also recorded a $5.0 million contingent payment, received by the Company from Tasly related to the first patient dosed in the Company’s REFRaME-O1 trial for luvelta, as deferred revenue, net of withholding tax of $0.5 million. The REFRaME-O1 study consists of two parts, Part I being the dose-finding portion and Part II being the portion of the study that will focus on the selected dose from Part I, and is intended to generate data to enable the potential registration of luvelta. Although it currently intends to conduct the REFRaME-O1 study to completion, the Company has the sole discretion to terminate the REFRaME-O1 study at any time. As such, the Company has agreed with Tasly that, in the event the Company terminates the REFRaME-O1 study prior to dosing the first patient in Part II, the Company will refund Tasly the contingent payment received by the Company within 30 days of such study termination. Given the above, the contingent payment received by the Company was considered constrained for accounting purposes during the year ended December 31, 2023, since the Company could not conclude it was probable that a significant reversal in the amount of revenue recognized would not occur. The withholding tax was recorded by the Company as a tax charge related to the received contingent payment.\n\n2023 Tasly Supply Agreement\n\nIn June 2023, the Company entered into a Master Development and Clinical Supply Agreement (the “2023 Tasly Supply Agreement”) with Tasly, wherein Tasly requested the Company to provide development, manufacturing and supply chain management services, including clinical product supply.\n\n145  \n---  \n  \nRevenues under the Tasly agreements were as follows:\n\nYear ended December 31,  \n---  \n2023 | 2022 | 2021  \n(in thousands)  \nUpfront payment | $ | - | $ | 25,000 | $ | -  \nContingent payment | 5,000 | - | -  \nResearch and development services | 92 | - | -  \nMaterials supply | 1,878 | - | -  \nTotal revenue | $ | 6,970 | $ | 25,000 | $ | -  \n  \nAgreements with Vaxcyte\n\nVaxcyte Supply Agreement\n\nIn May 2018, the Company entered into a Supply Agreement (the “Supply Agreement”) with Vaxcyte, wherein Vaxcyte engaged the Company to provide research and development services and to supply extracts and custom reagents, as requested by Vaxcyte. The pricing is based on an agreed upon cost-plus arrangement.\n\nDuring 2020, upon Vaxcyte’s request and their agreement to reimburse the related costs, the Company entered into agreements with third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to conduct process transfers to allow for such CMOs to manufacture and supply extract and custom reagents for Vaxcyte. As part of the agreement with Vaxcyte, should the Company decide to purchase extract from the extract CMO, the Company would be required to reimburse Vaxcyte for a portion of all incurred process transfer costs. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there was $6.9 million and $4.8 million in such accruals related to the Vaxcyte Supply Agreement.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the agreed-upon reimbursements by Vaxcyte of the costs associated with such arrangements, principally for pass-through costs from the CMOs, were $8.6 million, $12.4 million and $8.9 million, respectively, and were accounted for by the Company as a reduction to research and development expense based on the Company’s conclusion that Vaxcyte was not a customer for such activities and associated payments.\n\nVaxcyte Agreement\n\nIn December 2022, the Company entered into a letter agreement (the “Vaxcyte Agreement”) with Vaxcyte under which the Company granted to Vaxcyte (i) authorization to enter into an agreement with an independent alternate CMO to source cell-free extract solely for the products it licensed from the Company, allowing Vaxcyte to have direct oversight over financial and operational aspects of the relationship with the CMO (“CMO Relationship Rights”), and (ii) a right, but not an obligation, to obtain certain exclusive rights to internally manufacture and/or source extract from certain CMOs and the right to independently develop and make improvements to extract for use in connection with the exploitation of certain vaccine compositions (the “Option”). The Option was exercisable for five years following the effective date of the Vaxcyte Agreement (the “Option Period”), subject to potential acceleration in the event of a change of control of Vaxcyte.\n\nPursuant to the Vaxcyte Agreement, the Company received a one-time, nonrefundable, non-creditable, upfront payment of $10.0 million in cash, and 167,780 shares of Vaxcyte common stock with a fair value of $7.5 million in December 2022.\n\nAdditionally, pursuant to the Vaxcyte Agreement, the Company and Vaxcyte agreed to negotiate the terms and conditions of a form definitive agreement to be entered into in the event Vaxcyte exercises the Option (the “Form Definitive Agreement”). In September 2023, the Company and Vaxcyte mutually agreed upon the Form Definitive Agreement, and in October 2023, the Company received a $5.0 million payment from Vaxcyte.\n\nEffective immediately upon agreement to the Form Definitive Agreement, the Company and Vaxcyte entered into amendment No 3. (the “Amendment”) to that certain license agreement between the Company and Vaxcyte, dated August 1, 2014, and amended and restated on October 12, 2015, and amended again on May 9, 2018 and May 29, 2018 (the “License Agreement”). The Amendment amended certain terms of the License Agreement including with respect to (i) royalty reduction provisions applicable in the event of expiration of relevant patent\n\n146  \n---  \n  \nclaims, which would result in lower royalties payable by Vaxcyte under certain circumstances, (ii) the ownership, prosecution, maintenance and enforcement of certain intellectual property rights licensed or arising under the License Agreement, and (iii) the timing and form for financial reporting of royalty payment calculations.\n\nIn November 2023 (the \"Exercise Date\"), Vaxcyte exercised the Option by submitting written notice thereof to the Company and concurrently paid the Company $50.0 million in cash as the first of two installment payments for the Option exercise price. Under the Vaxcyte Agreement, Vaxcyte is obligated to pay the Company an additional $25.0 million in cash within six months of the Exercise Date as the second of two installment payments for the Option exercise price.\n\nUpon the occurrence of certain regulatory milestones, Vaxcyte would be obligated to pay the Company certain additional payments totaling up to $60.0 million in cash. In the event that Vaxcyte undergoes a change of control, certain rights and payments may be accelerated. These contingent payments were considered constrained variable consideration or otherwise not eligible for revenue recognition at inception and as of December 31, 2023.\n\nThe Company evaluated the terms of the Vaxcyte Agreement and concluded that the Vaxcyte Agreement is considered a new standalone contract and distinct from the previously existing agreements with Vaxcyte. Under ASC 606, the Company determined that Vaxcyte is a customer for this arrangement and identified the promised goods and services under the Vaxcyte Agreement as: (1) the Option; (2) the Form Definitive Agreement; (3) CMO Relationship Rights; and (4) Joint steering committee participation. The Company concluded that the promises within the contract are interrelated and interdependent of one another. As such, these are not considered distinct but are combined as a single performance obligation. This single performance obligation is considered a material right as it provides Vaxcyte with the right to acquire additional goods at a price it would not have received without having entered into the Vaxcyte Agreement. Revenue from the single performance obligation amounting to $97.5 million was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2023, as the Option was exercised by Vaxcyte on the Exercise Date and the single performance obligation was satisfied under the Vaxcyte Agreement.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there was zero and $17.5 million, respectively, of deferred revenue related to the payments received by the Company under the Vaxcyte Agreement.\n\nRevenues under the Vaxcyte agreementswere as follows:\n\nYear ended December 31,  \n---  \n2023 | 2022 | 2021  \n(in thousands)  \nUpfront payments | $ | 97,500 | $ | - | $ | -  \nResearch and development services | 2,435 | 2,356 | 1,131  \nMaterials supply | 1,367 | 1,472 | 1,910  \nTotal revenue | $ | 101,302 | $ | 3,828 | $ | 3,041  \n  \nRefer to Note 10 below for information relating to the Purchase Agreement between the Company and Blackstone, pursuant to which the Company sold to Blackstone its 4% royalty, or revenue interest, in potential future net sales of Vaxcyte products, including VAX-24 and VAX-31.\n\nBioNova Option Agreement\n\nIn October 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with BioNova granting BioNova the option to obtain exclusive rights to develop and commercialize STRO-001 in China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan (“Greater China”) and amended the BioNova Option Agreement with BioNova in the first quarter of 2023. In March 2024, BioNova notified the Company that it had decided to terminate both the BioNova Option Agreement and clinical development of STRO-001 in Greater China. Following receipt of this notice, the Company decided to suspend development of STRO-001.\n\n147  \n---  \n  \n6.

Loan and Security Agreement\n\nIn August 2017, the Company entered into a loan and security agreement with Oxford Finance LLC (“Oxford”) and Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB”) under which it borrowed $15.0 million (the “August 2017 Loan”). In connection with the August 2017 Loan, the Company issued to Oxford and SVB warrants to purchase 46,359 shares of Company's common stock.\n\nOn February 28, 2020, (the “Effective Date”), the Company entered into a loan and security agreement (the “Loan and Security Agreement”) with Oxford as the collateral agent and a lender, and SVB as a lender (together with Oxford, the “Lenders”), pursuant to which the Lenders agreed to lend the Company up to an aggregate of $25.0 million (the “Term A Loan”). Upon entering into the Loan and Security Agreement, the Company borrowed $25.0 million from the Lenders, with approximately $9.6 million of such amount applied to the repayment of the outstanding principal, interest and final payment fees owed pursuant to the August 2017 Loan. As such, the August 2017 Loan has been paid in full. The Company accounted for the issuance of the Loan and Security Agreement and repayment of the August 2017 Loan as a debt modification. The associated unamortized debt discount on the August 2017 Loan and new lender fees from the debt issuance was amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method until the maturity date of the Term A Loan.\n\nIn June 2022, the Company entered into an amendment to the Loan and Security Agreement with Oxford and SVB (the “LSA Amendment”). The LSA Amendment added a financial covenant that requires the Company to maintain a minimum unrestricted cash balance of $10.0 million. The Company was in compliance with the financial covenant under the LSA Amendment as of December 31, 2023.\n\nIn June 2023, the Company entered into an amendment to the Loan and Security Agreement with Oxford and SVB (the “5th LSA Amendment”). Under the 5th LSA Amendment, effective July 1, 2023, the loan bore interest at the floating per annum rate of interest equal to the greater of (i) 8.07% and (ii) the sum of (a) a specific published 1-month secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) reported on the last business day of the month that immediately precedes the month in which the interest will accrue plus (b) 0.10%, plus (c) 6.40%. There was an immaterial impact of the 5th LSA Amendment on the financial statements of the Company.\n\nThe Term A Loan matured on March 1, 2024 (the “Maturity Date”) and the Company made a final payment of 3.83% of the original principal amount of the Term A Loan on the Maturity Date. \n\n148  \n---  \n  \nIn connection with entering into the Loan and Security Agreement, the Company issued to the Lenders warrants exercisable for 81,257 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “2020 Warrants”). The 2020 Warrants are exercisable in whole or in part, immediately, and have a per share exercise price of $9.23, which was the closing price of the Company’s common stock reported on the Nasdaq Global Market on the day prior to the Effective Date. The 2020 Warrants will terminate on the earlier of February 28, 2030 or the closing of certain merger or consolidation transactions. The estimated fair value upon issuance of the Warrants of $0.6 million is recorded as a debt discount on the associated borrowings on the Company’s Balance Sheet. The debt discount was amortized to interest expense over the repayment period of the loan using the effective-interest method.\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded interest expense related to loans outstanding of $1.3 million, $2.4 million and $2.6 million, respectively, with average interest rates of 11.49%, 8.72% and 8.07%, respectively, which includes interest related to the accretion of debt discount of $0.3 million, $0.5 million and $0.6 million, respectively.\n\nLong-term debt and net premium balances are as follows:\n\nDecember 31,  \n---  \n2023 | 2022  \n(in thousands)  \nPrincipal amount of debt outstanding | $ | 3,125 | $ | 15,625  \nNet premium associated with accretion of final payment and other debt issuance costs | 936 | 646  \nDebt, current and non-current | 4,061 | 16,271  \nLess: Debt, current portion | (4,061 | ) | (12,500 | )  \nDebt, non-current portion | $ | - | $ | 3,771  \n  \nFuture minimum payments of principal and estimated payments of interest on the Company’s Loan and Security Agreement as of December 31, 2023 are as follows:\n\nYear Ending December 31: | Amount  \n---|---  \n(in thousands)  \nTotal future maturities - 2024 | $ | 4,126  \nLess: amount representing interest | (43 | )  \nLess: final payment | (958 | )  \nTotal principal amount of debt outstanding | $ | 3,125  \n  \n8. Commitments and Contingencies\n\nLeases\n\nIn June 2021, the Company entered into a third amendment (the “Third Amendment”) to its manufacturing facility lease, dated May 18, 2011, as amended, by and between Alemany Plaza LLC, located in San Carlos, California (the “San Carlos Lease”), as an extension to the term of the San Carlos Lease for a period of five years (the “Lease Extension Period”). Pursuant to the Third Amendment, the San Carlos Lease will expire on July 31, 2026, and it includes an option to renew the San Carlos Lease for an additional five years. The aggregate estimated base rent payments due over the Lease Extension Period is approximately $4.2 million, subject to certain terms contained in the San Carlos Lease.\n\nIn June 2021, the Company entered into a first amendment (the “First Amendment”) to its manufacturing support facility lease, dated March 4, 2015, as amended, by and between 870 Industrial Road LLC, located in San Carlos, California (the “Industrial Lease”), as an extension to the term of the Industrial Lease for a period of five years (the “Industrial Lease Extension Period”). Pursuant to the first Amendment, the Industrial Lease will expire on June 30, 2026, and it includes an option to renew the Industrial Lease for an additional five years. The aggregate estimated base rent payments due over the Industrial Lease Extension Period is approximately $4.3 million, subject to certain terms contained in the Industrial Lease.\n\n149  \n---  \n  \nIn September 2020, the Company entered into a sublease agreement (the “Sublease”) with Five Prime Therapeutics, Inc. (the “Sublessor”), for approximately 115,466 square feet, in a building located in South San Francisco, California (the “Premises”). The Company uses the Premises as its corporate headquarters and to conduct (or expand) research and development activities. The Company commenced making monthly payments for the first 85,755 square feet of the Premises (“Initial Premises”) in July 2021, with occupancy of such space commencing in August 2021. The Company was provided early access to the Initial Premises commencing in the fourth quarter of 2020 to conduct certain planning and tenant improvement work. The Sublease is subordinate to the lease agreement, effective December 12, 2016, between the Sublessor and HCP Oyster Point III LLC (the “Landlord”). The Company commenced using the remaining 29,711 square feet of the Premises, or the Expansion Premises on July 1, 2023 under the sublease agreement. The Sublease for both the Initial Premises and Expansion Premises will expire on December 31, 2027. With a commencement date on the Initial Premises of July 1, 2021, and Expansion Premises of July 1, 2023, the aggregate estimated base rent payments due over the term of the Sublease are approximately $39.1 million, including the approximately $5.2 million in potential financial benefit to the Company of base rent abatement to be provided by the Sublessor, subject to certain terms contained in the Sublease. The Sublease contains customary provisions requiring the Company to pay its pro rata share of utilities and a portion of the operating expenses and certain taxes, assessments and fees of the Premises and provisions allowing the Sublessor to terminate the Sublease upon the termination of the lease with the Landlord or if the Company fails to remedy a breach of certain of its obligations within specified time periods. Additionally, the Company posted a security deposit of $0.9 million, which is reflected as restricted cash in non-current assets on the Company’s Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\nThe Company recognizes rent expense for these operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease period. The components of lease costs, which the Company includes in operating expenses in the Statements of Operations, were as follows:\n\nYear ended December 31,  \n---  \n2023 | 2022 | 2021  \n(in thousands)  \nOperating lease cost | $ | 7,039 | $ | 6,154 | $ | 8,355  \nShort-term lease cost | 274 | 82 | 117  \nVariable lease cost | 2,047 | 1,610 | 2,089  \nTotal lease cost | $ | 9,360 | $ | 7,846 | $ | 10,561  \n  \nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded operating lease expense of $7.0 million, $6.2 million and $8.4 million, respectively, and paid $8.0 million, $1.7 million, and $6.2 million, respectively, of operating lease payments related to the lease liabilities, which the Company includes in net cash used in operating activities in the Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the weighted-average remaining lease term was 3.8 years and 4.8 years, respectively, and the weighted-average discount rate used to determine the operating lease liability was 10.8% for both years.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the maturities of the Company’s operating lease liabilities were as follows:\n\nYear Ending December 31, | Amount  \n---|---  \n(in thousands)  \n2024 | $ | 9,219  \n2025 | 9,533  \n2026 | 8,994  \n2027 | 8,289  \nTotal lease payments | 36,035  \nLess: imputed interest | (6,461 | )  \nOperating lease liabilities | 29,574  \nLess: current portion | (6,420 | )  \nTotal lease liabilities, non-current | $ | 23,154  \n  \n150  \n---  \n  \nIndemnification & Other\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to vendors, lessors, business partners, board members, officers, and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of breach of such agreements, services to be provided by the Company, negligence or willful misconduct of the Company, violations of law by the Company, or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with directors and certain officers and employees that will require the Company, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors, officers or employees. No demands have been made upon the Company to provide indemnification under such agreements, and thus, there are no claims that the Company is aware of that could have a material effect on the Company’s Balance Sheets, Statements of Operations, or Statements of Cash Flows. The Company currently has directors’ and officers’ liability insurance.\n\nIn addition, the Company enters into agreements in the normal course of business, including with contract research organizations for clinical trials, contract manufacturing organizations for certain manufacturing services, and vendors for preclinical studies and other services and products for operating purposes, which are generally cancelable upon written notice.\n\n9. Accrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities\n\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities consist of the following:\n\nDecember 31,  \n---  \n2023 | 2022  \n(in thousands)  \nVaxcyte-related accrual under Vaxcyte Supply Agreement | $ | 6,933 | $ | 4,830  \nCMO-related accrual | 8,195 | 3,900  \nClinical trials-related accrual | 4,283 | 2,954  \nTax and related expenses | 15,165 | -  \nOther | 3,897 | 3,080  \nTotal accrued expenses and other current liabilities | $ | 38,473 | $ | 14,764  \n  \n10. Deferred Royalty Obligation related to the Sale of Future Royalties\n\nIn June 2023, the Company entered into the Purchase Agreement with Blackstone, pursuant to which the Company sold to Blackstone its 4% royalty, or revenue interest, in the potential future net sales of Vaxcyte products, including the Purchased Interest under the 2015 License Agreement. As described in Note 5. Collaboration and License Agreements and Supply Agreements, Vaxcyte Agreement, following agreement with Vaxcyte on the Form Definitive Agreement and upon effectiveness of the amendment No. 3 to the 2015 License Agreement, the revenue interest in the 4% royalty on potential future net sales of Vaxcyte products other than Vaxcyte’s PCV products reverted to the Company. The Company retains the right to discover and develop vaccines for the treatment or prophylaxis of any disease that is not caused by an infectious pathogen, including cancer.\n\nIn June 2023, Blackstone made an upfront payment of $140.0 million to the Company and will also pay up to an additional $250.0 million upon the achievement of various return thresholds as set forth in the Purchase Agreement.\n\nUnder the Purchase Agreement, and in connection with its sale of the Purchased Interest, the Company has agreed to certain covenants with respect to the exercise of its rights under the 2015 License Agreement, including with respect to the Company’s right to amend, assign and terminate the 2015 License Agreement. The Purchase Agreement contains other customary terms and conditions, including representations and warranties, covenants, and indemnification obligations in favor of each party.\n\nThe Company recorded the $140.0 million upfront payment from Blackstone as a deferred royalty obligation related to the sale of future royalties on the Company's Balance Sheets. Due to the Company's then ongoing manufacturing obligations under the 2015 License Agreement, the Company accounted for the proceeds as imputed debt and, therefore, will recognize future non-cash royalty revenues. Non-cash interest expense will be\n\n151  \n---  \n  \nrecognized over the estimated life of the royalty term arrangement using the effective interest method based on the imputed interest rate derived from estimated amounts and timing of potential future royalty payments to be received from Vaxcyte. As part of the sale, the Company incurred approximately $3.8 million in transaction costs, which are being amortized over the estimated life of the royalty term arrangement using the effective interest method. As future royalties are earned from Vaxcyte by Blackstone, the balance of the deferred royalty obligation will be amortized over the estimated life of the royalty term arrangement.\n\nThere are a number of factors that could materially affect the fair value of the deferred royalty obligation. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of potential future royalty payments to be earned and received by Blackstone from Vaxcyte under the 2015 License Agreement, changing standards of care, the introduction of competing products, manufacturing or other delays, intellectual property matters, adverse events that result in governmental health authority imposed restrictions on the use of the vaccine products, and other events or circumstances that could result in reduced royalty payments from Vaxcyte to Blackstone, which are not within the Company's control, and all of which would result in a reduction of non-cash royalty revenues and the non-cash interest expense over the estimated life of the royalty term arrangement. The Company periodically assesses the estimated royalty payments to be earned by Blackstone from Vaxcyte and, to the extent that the amount or timing of such payments is materially different than our original estimates, the Company will prospectively adjust the imputed interest rate and the related amortization of the deferred royalty obligation. As of December 31, 2023, our effective interest rate used to amortize the liability is 17.0%.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized approximately $12.6 million of non-cash interest expense on the deferred royalty obligation, which amount will increase such balance. As of December 31, 2023, Blackstone has not received any royalty payment from Vaxcyte and, therefore, the deferred royalty obligation has not begun to be amortized.\n\nThe following table shows the activity of the deferred royalty obligation since transaction inception through December 31, 2023:\n\nDecember 31,  \n---  \n2023  \n(in thousands)  \nProceeds from the sale of future Vaxcyte royalties | $ | 140,000  \nIssuance costs | (3,792 | )  \nNon-cash interest expense associated with the sale of future Vaxcyte royalties | 12,570  \nAmortization of issuance costs | 336  \nDeferred royalty obligation related to the sale of future Vaxcyte royalties, net | $ | 149,114  \n  \n11. Stockholders’ Equity\n\nCommon Stock\n\nHolders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters to be voted upon by the stockholders of the Company.\n\nThe Company has reserved common stock, on an if-converted basis, for issuance as follows:\n\nDecember 31,  \n---  \n2023 | 2022  \nCommon stock options issued and outstanding | 7,905,032 | 7,310,611  \nCommon stock awards issued and outstanding | 5,244,873 | 3,958,478  \nRemaining shares reserved for issuance under 2018 Equity Incentive Plan and 2021 Equity Inducement Plan | 1,777,919 | 1,541,706  \nShares reserved for issuance under 2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan | 914,911 | 865,995  \nWarrants to purchase common stock | 127,616 | 127,616  \nTotal | 15,970,351 | 13,804,406  \n  \n152  \n---  \n  \nPreferred Stock\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized with a par value of $0.001 per share. No shares of preferred stock were outstanding as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\n12. Equity Incentive Plans, Equity Inducement Plans, Employee Stock Purchase Plan and Stock-Based Compensation\n\n2004 Equity Incentive Plan, 2018 Equity Incentive Plan, 2021 Equity Inducement Plan, and Amended and Restated 2021 Equity Inducement Plan\n\nIn September 2018, the Company adopted the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (“2018 Plan”), which became effective on September 25, 2018. As a result, the Company will not grant any additional awards under the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (“2004 Plan”). The terms of the 2004 Plan and applicable award agreements will continue to govern any outstanding awards thereunder. In addition to the shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under the 2004 Plan that were added to the 2018 Plan upon its effective date, the Company initially reserved 2,300,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the 2018 Plan. In addition, the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 2018 Plan will automatically increase on the first day of January for a period of up to ten years, commencing on January 1, 2019, in an amount equal to 5% of the total number of shares of the Company’s capital stock outstanding on the last day of the preceding year (rounded to the nearest whole share), or a lesser number of shares determined by the Company’s board of directors. As a result, common stock reserved for issuance under the 2018 Plan was increased by 2,874,977 shares on January 1, 2023.\n\nIn August 2021, the Company adopted the 2021 Equity Inducement Plan (“2021 Plan”), which became effective on August 4, 2021. Upon its effective date, the Company initially reserved 750,000 shares of common stock for issuance pursuant to non-qualified stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) under the 2021 Plan. In accordance with Rule 5635(c)(4) of the Nasdaq listing rules, equity awards under the 2021 Plan may only be made to an employee if he or she is granted such equity awards in connection with his or her commencement of employment with the Company and such grant is an inducement material to his or her entering into employment with the Company or such subsidiary. In addition, awards under the 2021 Plan may only be made to employees who have not previously been an employee or member of the Board (or any parent or subsidiary of the Company) or following a bona fide period of non-employment of the employee by the Company (or a parent or subsidiary of the Company). At all times the Company will reserve and keep available a sufficient number of shares as will be required to satisfy the requirements of all outstanding awards granted under the 2021 Plan.\n\nIn August 2022, the Company amended and restated the 2021 Plan (the “Amended and Restated 2021 Plan”) and reserved an additional 750,000 shares of common stock available for issuance under the Amended and Restated 2021 Plan to be granted by the Company to certain employees as a material inducement to their acceptance of employment with the Company in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c)(4).\n\nAdditionally, in February 2023, the Company amended and restated the Amended and Restated 2021 Plan and reserved an additional 500,000 shares of common stock available for issuance under the Amended and Restated 2021 Plan to be granted by the Company to certain employees as a material inducement to their acceptance of employment with the Company in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c)(4). The total number of shares reserved for issuance pursuant to the Amended and Restated 2021 Plan is 2,000,000 shares.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had 1,777,919 shares available for grant under the 2018 Plan and the 2021 Plan.\n\n153  \n---  \n  \nThe following table summarizes option activity under the Company’s 2004 Plan, 2018 Plan and 2021 Plan:\n\nShares | Weighted-AverageExercise Price | Weighted-AverageRemainingContract Term(Years) | AggregateIntrinsic Value(in thousands)  \n---|---|---|---  \nStock options outstanding at December 31, 2022 | 7,310,611 | $ | 12.68 | 6.66 | $ | 2,187  \nGranted | 1,611,500 | 5.35  \nExercised | (53,060 | ) | 5.92  \nCanceled and forfeited | (964,019 | ) | 12.63  \nStock options outstanding at December 31, 2023 | 7,905,032 | $ | 11.24 | 6.02 | $ | 180  \nStock options exercisable at December 31, 2023 | 5,717,050 | $ | 12.42 | 5.14 | $ | 14  \n  \nThe aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total intrinsic value (the difference between our closing stock price on the last trading day of fiscal 2023 and the exercise prices, multiplied by the number of in-the-money stock options) that would have been received by the stock option holders had all stock option holders exercised their stock options on December 31, 2023. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $30,000, $0.1 million and $2.8 million, respectively, determined at the date of the option exercise.\n\nEmployee Stock Options Valuation\n\nFor determining stock-based compensation expense, the fair-value-based measurement of each employee stock option was estimated as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with assumptions as follows:\n\nYear Ended December 31,  \n---  \n2023 | 2022 | 2021  \nExpected term (in years) | 5.3-6.1 | 5.3-6.1 | 5.3-6.1  \nExpected volatility | 80.7%-84.1% | 81.8%-83.5% | 80.9%-84.9%  \nRisk-free interest rate | 3.6%-4.7% | 1.7%-4.2% | 0.6%-1.3%  \nExpected dividend | - | - | -  \n  \nExpected Term—The expected term represents the period that the stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. The Company used the “simplified” method to determine the expected term of options granted, which calculates the expected term as the average of the weighted-average vesting term and the contractual term of the option.\n\nExpected Volatility—Since the Company has limited information available on the volatility of its common stock due to its short trading history, the expected volatility was estimated based on the average historical volatilities of common stock of comparable publicly traded entities over a period equal to the expected term of the stock option grants. The Company will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of its own stock price becomes available.\n\nRisk-Free Interest Rate—The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to the expected term of the options.\n\nExpected Dividend—The Company has never paid dividends on its common stock. Therefore, the Company used an expected dividend of zero.\n\nUsing the Black-Scholes option-valuation model, the weighted-average estimated grant-date fair value of employee stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $3.84, $5.03 and $14.24 per share, respectively.\n\n154  \n---  \n  \nRestricted Stock Units\n\nRestricted stock units (“RSUs”) are share awards that entitle the holder to receive freely tradable shares of the Company’s common stock upon vesting. The RSUs cannot be transferred and the awards are subject to forfeiture if the holder’s employment terminates prior to the release of the vesting restrictions. The RSUs generally vest over a four-year period provided the employee remains continuously employed with the Company. The fair value of the RSUs is equal to the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date.\n\nA summary of the status and activity of non-vested RSUs for the year ended December 31, 2023 is as follows:\n\nNumber ofShares | WeightedAverage Grant-DateFair Value  \n---|---  \nNon-vested December 31, 2022 | 3,958,478 | $ | 11.70  \nGranted | 2,823,725 | 5.41  \nReleased | (1,155,644 | ) | 12.31  \nCanceled | (381,686 | ) | 9.92  \nNon-vested December 31, 2023 | 5,244,873 | $ | 8.31  \n  \n2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\n\nIn September 2018, the Company adopted the 2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), which became effective on September 26, 2018, in order to enable eligible employees to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock. The Company initially reserved 230,000 shares of common stock for sale under the ESPP. The aggregate number of shares reserved for sale under the ESPP will automatically increase on the first day of January for a period of up to ten years, commencing on January 1, 2019, in an amount equal to 1% of the total number of shares of the Company’s capital stock outstanding on the last day of the preceding year (rounded to the nearest whole share), or a lesser number of shares determined by the Company’s board of directors. As a result, common stock reserved for issuance under the ESPP was increased by 574,995 shares on January 1, 2023. The aggregate number of shares issued over the term of the Company’s ESPP, subject to stock-splits, recapitalizations or similar events, may not exceed 2,300,000 shares of the Company’s common stock.\n\nThe fair value of the ESPP shares is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the fair value of ESPP shares was estimated using the following assumptions:\n\nYear Ended December 31,  \n---  \n2023 | 2022 | 2021  \nExpected term (in years) | 0.5 | 0.5 | 0.5  \nExpected volatility | 79.6-89.9% | 65.9-88.1% | 65.9-111.4%  \nRisk-free interest rate | 3.8%-5.5% | 0.1%-3.8% | 0.1 | %  \nExpected dividend | - | - | -  \n  \nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, 526,079, 270,516, and 145,809 shares, respectively, had been purchased. As of December 31, 2023, 914,911 shares were available for future issuance under the ESPP.\n\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\n\nThe Company believes that the fair value of the stock options, RSUs and ESPP shares is more reliably measurable than the fair value of services received.\n\n155  \n---  \n  \nTotal stock-based compensation expense recognized was as follows:\n\nYear Ended December 31,  \n---  \n2023 | 2022 | 2021  \n(in thousands)  \nResearch and development expense:  \nStock options | $ | 2,183 | $ | 2,287 | $ | 2,208  \nRestricted stock units | 8,885 | 7,227 | 4,280  \nESPP | 764 | 592 | 638  \nSubtotal | 11,832 | 10,106 | 7,126  \nGeneral and administrative expense:  \nStock options | 6,066 | 10,261 | 11,045  \nRestricted stock units | 6,796 | 5,781 | 4,920  \nESPP | 214 | 156 | 150  \nSubtotal | 13,076 | 16,198 | 16,115  \nTotal | $ | 24,908 | $ | 26,304 | $ | 23,241  \n  \nAs of December 31, 2023, unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to the unvested stock options and RSUs granted was $11.0 million and $30.9 million, respectively. The remaining unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.0 years and 2.3 years, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, there is $0.3 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to the ESPP.\n\n13. Income Taxes\n\nCurrent provision for income taxes consists of the following:\n\nYear Ended December 31,  \n---  \n2023 | 2022 | 2021  \n(in thousands)  \nFederal | $ | 16,646 | $ | - | $ | -  \nState | 603 | - | -  \nForeign | 943 | 2,500 | -  \nTotal current provision for income taxes | $ | 18,192 | $ | 2,500 | $ | -  \n  \nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized an income tax expense of $18.2 million. The income tax charge for the year ended December 31, 2023, was primarily due to unfavorable book-tax differences related to capitalizing and amortizing research and development expenditures under Internal Revenue Code, or IRC, Section 174, the upfront payment from the sale of future royalties, deferred revenue, foreign income tax, and IRC Section 382 limitations imposed on the utilization of the Company's historical tax attributes as a result of cumulative ownership changes that the Company experienced in prior years. The effective tax rates for the year ended December 31, 2023 vary from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21% primarily due to the Company’s inability to recognize the benefit from its net deferred tax assets, which are offset by a valuation allowance. The Company has established a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of such assets. All losses to date have been incurred domestically.\n\nThe Company recorded a foreign income tax charge of $2.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, due to a withholding tax in China on its license revenue from Tasly.\n\n156  \n---  \n  \nThe effective tax rate of the Company’s provision (benefit) for income taxes differs from the federal statutory rate as follows:\n\nYear Ended December 31,  \n---  \n2023 | 2022 | 2021  \nFederal statutory rate | 21.0 | % | 21.0 | % | 21.0 | %  \nState tax | (0.6 | ) | - | -  \nChange in valuation allowance | (41.2 | ) | (26.2 | ) | (24.7 | )  \nTax credits | (0.7 | ) | 5.1 | 3.7  \nStock compensation | (3.2 | ) | (3.2 | ) | (0.2 | )  \nForeign-Derived Intangible Income deduction | 1.5 | - | -  \nForeign withholding | (1.1 | ) | (2.1 | ) | -  \nOther | 3.7 | 3.3 | 0.2  \nTotal | (20.6 | )% | (2.1 | )% | 0 | %  \n  \nThe components of the Company’s deferred tax assets consist of the following:\n\nDecember 31  \n---  \n2023 | 2022  \n(in thousands)  \nDeferred tax assets:  \nNet operating loss carryforwards | $ | 37,231 | $ | 60,952  \nResearch and development credits | 32,800 | 40,396  \nCapitalized research and development expenditure | 46,260 | 24,481  \nDeferred royalty obligation | 31,944 | -  \nDeferred revenue | 15,274 | -  \nAccruals and other | 5,309 | 3,849  \nOperating lease liability | 6,335 | 7,471  \nStock based compensation | 5,613 | 4,562  \nFixed asset basis | - | 663  \nTotal deferred tax assets | 180,766 | 142,374  \nLess: valuation allowance | (167,693 | ) | (131,228 | )  \nGross deferred tax assets | 13,073 | 11,146  \nDeferred tax liabilities:  \nOperating lease right-of-use asset | (4,887 | ) | (5,783 | )  \nFixed asset basis | (809 | ) | -  \nVaxcyte investment | (7,377 | ) | (5,363 | )  \nTotal deferred tax liabilities | (13,073 | ) | (11,146 | )  \nTotal net deferred tax assets | $ | - | $ | -  \n  \nRealization of the future tax benefits is dependent on the Company’s ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period. Due to the Company’s history of operating losses and future sources of taxable income, the Company believes that the realization of the deferred tax assets is currently not more likely than not to be realized and, accordingly, have provided a full valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the net increase in the valuation allowance was $36.5 million, $30.6 million and $26.2 million, respectively.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of $140.2 million and federal general business credits from research and development expenses totaling $20.0 million, as well as state net operating loss carryforwards of $100.5 million and state research and development credits of $26.0 million.\n\nThe federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in 2027, and the federal credits will expire at various dates beginning in 2032, if not utilized. The state net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in 2031, if not utilized. The state research and development tax credits can be carried forward indefinitely.\n\n157  \n---  \n  \nEvents which cause limitations in the amount of net operating losses that the Company may utilize in any one year include, but are not limited to, a cumulative ownership change of more than 50%, as defined, over a three-year testing period. Under the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions, certain substantial changes in the Company's ownership could result in an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss and credit carryforwards that can be utilized in future years to offset future taxable income. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credit carryforwards before utilization. The Company completed Section 382 analysis through December 31, 2022, and concluded that the Company experienced an ownership change on November 20, 2019, and December 31, 2022. If there is subsequent event or further change in ownership, these losses may be subject to limitations, resulting in their expiration before they can be utilized.\n\nThe Company files U.S. federal and state tax returns with varying statutes of limitations. Due to net operating loss and credit carryforwards, all of the tax years since inception through the 2022 tax year remain subject to examination by the U.S. federal and some state authorities. The actual amount of any taxes due could vary significantly depending on the ultimate timing and nature of any settlement. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, that would affect the effective tax rate is $8.7 million, $8.6 million and $6.4 million as of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. One or more of these unrecognized tax benefits could be subject to a valuation allowance if and when recognized in a future period, which could impact the timing of any related effective tax rate benefit. The Company believes that the amount by which the unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease within the next 12 months is not estimable.\n\nThe Company has elected to recognize, if incurred, interest and penalties related to liabilities for uncertain tax positions as a part of income tax expense. Interest and penalties were immaterial during the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nThe Company determines its uncertain tax positions based on a determination of whether and how much of a tax benefit taken by the Company in its tax filings is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant income tax authorities.\n\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\n\nDecember 31  \n---  \n2023 | 2022 | 2021  \n(in thousands)  \nGross unrecognized tax benefit at January 1 | $ | 8,649 | $ | 6,409 | $ | 4,902  \nAdditions for tax positions taken in the current year | 2,631 | 2,255 | 1,492  \nAdditions / (Reductions) for tax positions of prior years | (2,550 | ) | (15 | ) | 15  \nGross unrecognized tax benefit at December 31 | $ | 8,730 | $ | 8,649 | $ | 6,409  \n  \n14.

Controls and Procedures\n\nConclusions Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (our principal accounting officer), performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\n\nDisclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objective and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.\n\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n\n•\n\npertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets;\n\n•\n\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and\n\n•\n\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.\n\n160  \n---  \n  \nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in its 2013 Internal Control – Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment, our management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.\n\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of the Company’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by the Company’s registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management’s report in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.\n\nItem 9B.
