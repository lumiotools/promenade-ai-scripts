Content costs as a component of cost of revenues were RMB4.0 billion (US$569.0 million), decreasing 5% year over year. The decrease in content cost was primarily due to lighter movie offerings in the quarter.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were RMB907.9 million (US$129.4 million), decreasing 7% year over year. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the marketing spending.\n\nResearch and development expenses were RMB449.0 million (US$64.0 million), flat year over year.\n\nOperating income was RMB238.9 million (US$34.0 million), decreasing 68% year over year.

The year over year variance was primarily driven by gain from foreign exchange, partially offset by the increase in impairment provision.\n\nIncome before income taxes was RMB247.3 million (US$35.2 million), compared to income before income taxes of RMB492.5 million in the same period in 2023.\n\nIncome tax expense was RMB11.5 million (US$1.6 million), compared to income tax expense of RMB9.0 million in the same period in 2023.\n\nNet income attributable to iQIYI was RMB229.4 million (US$32.7 million), decreasing 52% year over year.

Free cash flow was RMB234.8 million (US$33.5 million), compared to free cash flow of RMB826.5 million in the same period of 2023.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term restricted cash included in prepayments and other assets of RMB4.7 billion (US$673.8 million). In August 2024, PAG drew down US$200.0 million under the loan facility, bringing the total draw down under the facility agreements to US$400.0 million as of September 30, 2024.

These statements are made under the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as \"will,\" \"expects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"future,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"confident\" and similar statements. Among other things, the quotations from management in this announcement, as well as iQIYI's strategic and operational plans, contain forward-looking statements. iQIYI may also make written or oral forward-looking statements in its periodic reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, in its annual report to shareholders, in press releases and other written materials and in oral statements made by its officers, directors or employees to third parties. Statements that are not historical facts, including but not limited to statements about iQIYI's beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement, including but not limited to the following: iQIYI's strategies; iQIYI's future business development, financial condition and results of operations; iQIYI's ability to retain and increase the number of users, members and advertising customers, and expand its service offerings; competition in the online entertainment industry; changes in iQIYI's revenues, costs or expenditures; Chinese governmental policies and regulations relating to the online entertainment industry, general economic and business conditions globally and in China and assumptions underlying or related to any of the foregoing. Further information regarding these and other risks is included in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All information provided in this press release and in the attachments is as of the date of the press release, and iQIYI undertakes no duty to update such information, except as required under applicable law.\n\n**_Non-GAAP Financial Measures_**\n\nTo supplement iQIYI’s consolidated financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, iQIYI uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating income margin, non-GAAP net income attributable to iQIYI, non-GAAP diluted net income attributable to iQIYI per ADS and free cash flow. The presentation of the non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\niQIYI believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its operating performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of its business operating results, such as operating performance excluding non-cash charges or non-operating in nature. The Company believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to the non-GAAP financial measures in assessing its performance and when planning and forecasting future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to iQIYI’s historical operating performance. The Company believes the non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making. A limitation of using these non-GAAP financial measures is that the non-GAAP measures exclude certain items that have been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant component in the Company’s results of operations.

Content costs as a component of cost of revenues were RMB4.1 billion (US$559.4 million), decreasing 2% year over year.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were RMB969.7 million (US$133.4 million), decreasing 1% year over year.\n\nResearch and development expenses were RMB448.7 million (US$61.7 million), increasing 2% year over year.\n\nOperating income was RMB342.1 million (US$47.1 million), decreasing 44% year over year. Operating income margin was 5%, compared to operating income margin of 8% in the same period in 2023. Non-GAAP operating income was RMB501.4 million (US$69.0 million), decreasing 36% year over year. Non-GAAP operating income margin was 7%, compared to non-GAAP operating income margin of 10% in the same period in 2023.\n\nTotal other expense was RMB240.4 million (US$33.1 million), increasing 2% year over year.\n\nIncome before income taxes was RMB101.7 million (US$14.0 million), compared to income before income taxes of RMB375.8 million in the same period in 2023.\n\nIncome tax expense was RMB25.7 million (US$3.5 million), compared to income tax expense of RMB7.9 million in the same period in 2023.\n\nNet income attributable to iQIYI was RMB68.7 million (US$9.5 million), decreasing 81% year over year. Diluted net income attributable to iQIYI per ADS was RMB0.07 (US$0.01) for the second quarter of 2024, compared to diluted net income attributable to iQIYI per ADS of RMB0.37 in the same period of 2023. Non-GAAP net income attributable to iQIYI was RMB246.9 million (US$34.0 million), decreasing 58% year over year. Non-GAAP diluted net income attributable to iQIYI per ADS was RMB0.25 (US$0.03), compared to non-GAAP diluted net income attributable to iQIYI per ADS of RMB0.61 in the same period of 2023.\n\nOperating cash flow was RMB410.8 million (US$56.5 million), compared to operating cash flow of RMB885.6 million in the same period of 2023. Free cash flow was RMB382.5 million (US$52.6 million), compared to free cash flow of RMB872.3 million in the same period of 2023.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company had cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term restricted cash included in prepayments and other assets of RMB8.6 billion (US$1.2 billion).\n\n**Repurchase of 4% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026**\n\nIn August 2024, the Company completed the repurchase right offer for its 4% convertible senior notes due 2026 (the “Notes”). An aggregate principal amount of US$395.5 million of the Notes were validly surrendered and repurchased with an aggregate repurchase price (including the aggregate principal amount of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest) of US$397.5 million. Following settlement of the repurchase, less than US$0.2 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes remains outstanding and continues to be subject to the existing terms of the Indenture and the Notes.\n\n**PAG Facility Agreements**\n\nIn August 2024, the Company entered into a facility agreement with PAG, adding to the previous facility agreement from September 2023. Together, these facility agreements provide PAG with loan facilities with an aggregate amount of up to US$522.5 million, with an interest rate of 6% per annum. At each draw down, PAG shall release the equivalent amount of restricted cash collateralized by the Company under the PAG Notes. As a result, the foregoing facility arrangement does not impact the Company’s cash available for daily operations.\n\nUpon PAG’s total draw down of US$400 million under the facility agreements, the corresponding restricted cash collateral will be released, and the repurchase right for the US$522.5 million principal of the PAG Notes will be waived. Such repurchase right would have allowed PAG to require the Company to repurchase the PAG Notes during the three-month period starting on December 30, 2025.\n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\niQIYI's management will hold an earnings conference call at 7:00 AM on August 22, 2024, U.S. Eastern Time (7:00 PM on August 22, 2024, Beijing Time).\n\nPlease register in advance of the conference using the link provided below.

These statements are made under the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as \"will,\" \"expects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"future,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"confident\" and similar statements. Among other things, the quotations from management in this announcement, as well as iQIYI's strategic and operational plans, contain forward-looking statements. iQIYI may also make written or oral forward-looking statements in its periodic reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, in its annual report to shareholders, in press releases and other written materials and in oral statements made by its officers, directors or employees to third parties. Statements that are not historical facts, including but not limited to statements about iQIYI's beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement, including but not limited to the following: iQIYI's strategies; iQIYI's future business development, financial condition and results of operations; iQIYI's ability to retain and increase the number of users, members and advertising customers, and expand its service offerings; competition in the online entertainment industry; changes in iQIYI's revenues, costs or expenditures; Chinese governmental policies and regulations relating to the online entertainment industry, general economic and business conditions globally and in China and assumptions underlying or related to any of the foregoing. Further information regarding these and other risks is included in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All information provided in this press release and in the attachments is as of the date of the press release, and iQIYI undertakes no duty to update such information, except as required under applicable law.\n\n**_Non-GAAP Financial Measures_**\n\nTo supplement iQIYI’s consolidated financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, iQIYI uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating income margin, non-GAAP net income attributable to iQIYI, non-GAAP diluted net income attributable to iQIYI per ADS and free cash flow. The presentation of the non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\niQIYI believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its operating performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of its business operating results, such as operating performance excluding non-cash charges or non-operating in nature. The Company believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to the non-GAAP financial measures in assessing its performance and when planning and forecasting future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to iQIYI’s historical operating performance. The Company believes the non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making. A limitation of using these non-GAAP financial measures is that the non-GAAP measures exclude certain items that have been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant component in the Company’s results of operations. These non-GAAP financial measures presented here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.
