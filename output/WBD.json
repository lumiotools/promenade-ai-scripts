Discovery's Q3 results demonstrate once again that while we continue to confront\nextraordinary disruption in our environment, the strategy we have undertaken to ready Warner\nBros. Discovery for future success is showing important results. Thanks to our rapid international\nexpansion and continued investment in high quality, diverse content, we saw momentum\naccelerate in our global Direct-to-Consumer business in Q3. In total, Max delivered 7.2 million net\nsubscriber adds, the strongest quarterly gain since the platform’s launch, resulting in healthy\nsubscriber-related revenue growth and meaningful progress toward achieving our 2025 Direct-to-\nConsumer segment financial objectives. Likewise, our recently announced strategic partnership\nwith Charter Communications, for both linear network distribution and bundling of Max, not only\nreinforced the value of our content portfolio, but represented our willingness to work with our\npartners to enhance the consumers’ experience as our industry undergoes transformation.\n– David Zaslav, President & CEO\nQ3 Financial Summary & Operational Highlights\n• Q3 total revenues were $9.6 billion, a 3% ex-FX(1)(*) decrease compared to the prior year quarter.\n• Net income available to Warner Bros.

Discovery, Inc.\n(1) Foreign Exchange Impacting Comparability: The impact of exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period-to-period\ncomparisons of our results. For example, our international revenues are favorably impacted as the U.S. dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies,\nand unfavorably impacted as the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency\nbasis (“ex-FX”), in addition to results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP provides useful information about our operating performance because the\npresentation ex-FX excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility and highlights our core operating results. The presentation of results on a constant\ncurrency basis should be considered in addition to, but not a substitute for, measures of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe ex-FX change represents the percentage change on a period-over-period basis adjusted for foreign currency impacts. The ex-FX change is calculated\nas the difference between the current year amounts translated at a baseline rate, which is a spot rate for each of our currencies determined early in the fiscal\nyear as part of our forecasting process (the “2024 Baseline Rate”), and the prior year amounts translated at the same 2024 Baseline Rate. In addition,\nconsistent with the assumption of a constant currency environment, our ex-FX results exclude the impact of our foreign currency hedging activities, as well as\nrealized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to\nsimilarly titled measures used by other companies.\n(2) Adjusted EBITDA: The Company evaluates the operating performance of its operating segments based on financial measures such as revenues and\nAdjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as operating income excluding: (i) employee share-based compensation, (ii) depreciation and amortization,\n(iii) restructuring and facility consolidation, (iv) certain impairment charges, (v) gains and losses on business and asset dispositions, (vi) third-party\ntransaction and integration costs, (vii) amortization of purchase accounting fair value step-up for content, (viii) amortization of capitalized interest for content,\nand (ix) other items impacting comparability.\nThe Company uses this measure to assess the operating results and performance of its segments, perform analytical comparisons, identify strategies to\nimprove performance, and allocate resources to each segment. The Company believes Adjusted EBITDA is relevant to investors because it allows them to\nanalyze the operating performance of each segment using the same metric management uses. The Company excludes employee share-based\ncompensation, restructuring, certain impairment charges, gains and losses on business and asset dispositions, and transaction and integration costs from\nthe calculation of Adjusted EBITDA due to their impact on comparability between periods. Integration costs include transformative system implementations\nand integrations, such as Enterprise Resource Planning systems, and may take several years to complete.\nThe Company also excludes the depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets, amortization of purchase accounting fair value step-up for\ncontent, and amortization of capitalized interest for content, as these amounts do not represent cash payments in the current reporting period. Certain\ncorporate expenses and inter-segment eliminations related to production studios are excluded from segment results to enable executive management to\nevaluate segment performance based upon the decisions of segment executives. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, but not a substitute\nfor, operating income, net income, and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We prospectively updated certain\ncorporate allocations at the beginning of 2024. The impact to prior periods was immaterial.\n(3) Free cash flow: The Company defines free cash flow as cash flow from operations less acquisitions of property and equipment. The Company believes\nfree cash flow is an important indicator for management and investors of the Company’s liquidity, including its ability to reduce debt, make strategic\ninvestments, and return capital to stockholders.\n(4) Gross debt: The Company defines gross debt of $40.7 billion as total debt of $40.2 billion, plus finance leases of $452 million. The Company believes\nthis measure is relevant to investors as it is a financial measure frequently used in evaluating a company's financial condition.\n(5) Net leverage: The Company defines net leverage as the calculation where net debt (gross debt of $40.7 billion, less cash, cash equivalents, and\nrestricted cash of $3.5 billion) is divided by the sum of the most recent four quarters Adjusted EBITDA of $8,781 million. The Company believes this measure\nis relevant to investors as it is a financial measure frequently used in evaluating a company's financial condition.\nPlease refer to the Trending Schedules and Non-GAAP Reconciliations posted in the \"Quarterly Results\" section of the Company's investor relations website\n(https://ir.wbd.com) for the full reconciliation of net leverage.\n13\nQ3 2024 Earnings Press Release | November 7, 2024\nDefinitions and Sources for\nWarner Bros.

Where daily values are not available, the sum of beginning of period and end of period divided by\ntwo is used.\nExcluded from the ARPU calculation are: (i) Revenue and subscribers for DTC products, other than discovery+, HBO, HBO Max, Max, a Premium Sports\nProduct, and independently-branded, regional products (currently consisting of TVN/Player and BluTV), that may be offered by us or by certain joint venture\npartners or affiliated parties from time to time; (ii) A limited amount of international discovery+ revenue and subscribers that are part of non-strategic partnerships\nor short-term arrangements as may be identified by the Company from time to time; (iii) Cinemax, Max/HBO hotel and bulk institution (i.e., subscribers billed on a\nbulk basis), and international basic HBO revenue and subscribers; and (iv) Users on free trials who convert to a subscription for which we have recognized\nsubscription revenue within the first seven days of the calendar month immediately following the month in which their free trial expires.\n(8) Source: Warner Bros.

The Company may exclude revenues from the AT&T SportsNet business at the consolidated level,\nsegment level, or both.

DISCOVERY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(unaudited)\nNOTE 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nDescription of Business\nWarner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (“Warner Bros. Discovery”, “WBD”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) is a leading global\nmedia and entertainment company that creates and distributes a differentiated and complete portfolio of branded content across\ntelevision, film, streaming and gaming. Warner Bros. Discovery inspires, informs and entertains audiences worldwide through its\niconic brands and products including: Discovery Channel, Max, discovery+, CNN, DC, TNT Sports, Eurosport, HBO, HGTV,\nFood Network, OWN, Investigation Discovery, TLC, Magnolia Network, TNT, TBS, truTV, Travel Channel, MotorTrend, Animal\nPlanet, Science Channel, Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group, Warner Bros. Television Group, Warner Bros. Pictures Animation,\nWarner Bros. Games, New Line Cinema, Cartoon Network, Adult Swim, Turner Classic Movies, Discovery en Español, Hogar de\nHGTV and others.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries in which a\ncontrolling interest is maintained, including variable interest entities (“VIE”) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary.\nIntercompany accounts and transactions between consolidated entities have been eliminated.\nUnaudited Interim Financial Statements\nThese consolidated financial statements are unaudited; however, in the opinion of management, they reflect all adjustments\nconsisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary to state fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows\nfor the periods presented in conformity with U.S. GAAP applicable to interim periods. The results of operations for the interim\nperiods presented are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year or future periods. These consolidated financial statements\nshould be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the “2023 Form 10-K”).\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments\nand assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results\nmay differ from these estimates.\nAccounting and Reporting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nSegment Reporting\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued guidance updating the disclosure\nrequirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The\namendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning\nafter December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods\npresented in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance and will update its segment\ndisclosures upon adoption.\nIncome Taxes\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued guidance updating the disclosure requirements for income taxes, primarily through\nstandardization and disaggregation of rate reconciliation categories and income taxes paid by jurisdiction. The amendments are\neffective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The amendments should be applied\nprospectively; however, retrospective application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance\nand will update its tax disclosures upon adoption.\nDisaggregation of Income Statement Expenses\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued guidance updating the disclosure requirements for income statement expenses, primarily\nthrough disaggregation of certain types of expenses presented on the income statement. The amendments are effective for fiscal\nyears beginning after December 15, 2026 and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. Early\nadoption is permitted. The amendments may be applied either: (1) prospectively to financial statements issued for reporting periods\nafter the effective date, or (2) retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently\nevaluating the impact this guidance will have on its disclosures.\n10\nWARNER BROS. DISCOVERY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(unaudited)\nNOTE 2. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nWe perform fair value-based impairment tests of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives on an annual basis, and\nbetween annual tests if an event occurs or if circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a\nreporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value.\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Company performed goodwill and intangible assets impairment monitoring\nprocedures for all of its reporting units and concluded the delta between market capitalization and book value, continued softness\nin the U.S. linear advertising market, and uncertainty related to affiliate and sports rights renewals, including the NBA, represented\na triggering event in the second quarter of 2024 for the Networks reporting unit.\nAs a result, the Company elected to perform a quantitative impairment assessment for all of its reporting units in the second\nquarter of 2024. For the Networks reporting unit, fair value was determined using a Discounted Cash Flow (“DCF”) method. The\nkey judgments and assumptions used in the DCF method to determine the fair value of the Networks reporting unit were as\nfollows:\n• The expected future cash flows in terms of their amount and timing. These cash flows, utilized in the DCF analysis, are\nderived from the reporting unit’s budget and its strategic long-term plan, which reflect expectations based upon operating\nperformance and assumptions consistent with those of a market participant with regards to affiliate revenue, sports rights,\nand continued softness in the U.S. linear advertising market.\n• Long-term growth rate of negative 3%.\n• A discount rate of 10.5%. This is reflective of the risks inherent in the future cash flows of the reporting unit and market\nconditions.\nGiven the inherent uncertainty in determining the assumptions underlying a DCF analysis, actual results may differ from\nthose used in the valuations.\nThe carrying value of the Networks reporting unit exceeded its fair value and the Company recorded a pre-tax, non-cash\ngoodwill impairment charge of $9.1 billion during the three months ended June 30, 2024 in impairments and loss on dispositions\non the consolidated statements of operations. The goodwill impairment charge does not have an impact on the calculation of the\nCompany’s financial covenants under the Company’s debt arrangements.\nAs of June 30, 2024, the carrying value of remaining goodwill assigned to the Networks reporting unit was $8.4 billion and\nthe net assets of the reporting unit were approximately $25.6 billion. The Networks segment included accumulated impairments of\n$10.8 billion and $1.6 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company performed goodwill and intangible assets impairment\nmonitoring procedures for all of its reporting units and identified no indicators of impairment or triggering events. The Company\ncontinues to monitor its reporting units for triggers that could impact recoverability of goodwill. Long-term trends and risks the\nCompany is monitoring in its ongoing assessment include, but are not limited to, the following:\n• the delta between market capitalization and book value;\n• uncertainty related to affiliate rights renewals associated with the Company’s Networks and DTC reporting units;\n• declining levels of global GDP growth and continued softness in the U.S. linear advertising market associated with the\nCompany’s Networks reporting unit;\n• content licensing trends and volatility related to the performance of theatrical film and game slates in our Studios\nreporting unit; and\n• risks in executing the projected growth strategies of the Company’s DTC reporting unit.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe determination of fair value of the Company’s reporting units represents a Level 3 fair value measurement in the fair\nvalue hierarchy due to its use of internal projections and unobservable measurement inputs. Changes in significant judgments and\nestimates could significantly impact the determined fair value of the reporting unit or the valuation of intangible assets. Changes to\nassumptions that would decrease the fair value of the reporting unit may result in corresponding increases to the impairment of\ngoodwill at the reporting unit.\nIntangible Assets\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, as a result of the goodwill impairment charge recorded in the second\nquarter of 2024 and the long-term trends and risks associated with the Company’s Networks reporting unit, the Company\nreassessed and shortened the useful lives for certain of its linear networks trade names. This change was considered a change in\n11\nWARNER BROS. DISCOVERY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(unaudited)\nestimate, was accounted for prospectively, and resulted in incremental amortization expense of $94 million during the three months\nended September 30, 2024.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company reassessed the useful lives and amortization methods for\nits linear networks and HBO trademarks and trade names and concluded the pattern of amortization should be accelerated.\nAccordingly, the Company changed the amortization method for these assets from the straight-line method to the sum-of-the\nmonths’ digits method effective July 1, 2023. This change was considered a change in estimate, was accounted for prospectively,\nand resulted in incremental amortization expense of $171 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nNOTE 3. RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES\nIn connection with the completion of its merger (the “Merger”) with the WarnerMedia business (the “WarnerMedia\nBusiness”) of AT&T Inc. on April 8, 2022, the Company has announced and has taken actions to implement projects to achieve\ncost synergies for the Company, which includes, among other things, strategic content programming assessments, organization\nrestructuring, facility consolidation activities, and other contract termination costs. While the Company’s restructuring efforts are\nongoing, the merger-related restructuring program is expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2024. During the three\nmonths ended June 30, 2024, the Company initiated an organizational and personnel restructuring plan and, during 2023, initiated a\nstrategic realignment plan associated with its Warner Bros. Pictures Animation group.\nRestructuring and other charges by reportable segments and corporate and inter-segment eliminations were as follows (in\nmillions).\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nStudios $ 2 $ 134 $ 32 $ 220\nNetworks 5 48 58 161\nDTC (16) 34 1 61\nCorporate and inter-segment eliminations 18 53 70 68\nTotal restructuring and other charges $ 9 $ 269 $ 161 $ 510\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, restructuring and other charges were primarily related to organization\nrestructuring costs.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate market risk and interest rate\nfluctuations. As part of its risk management strategy, the Company uses derivative financial instruments, primarily foreign\ncurrency forward contracts, fixed-to-fixed currency swaps, total return swaps and interest rate swaps to hedge certain foreign\ncurrency, market value, and interest rate exposures. The Company’s objective is to reduce earnings volatility by offsetting gains\nand losses resulting from these exposures with losses and gains on the derivative contracts used to hedge them. The Company does\nnot enter into or hold derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.\nThere were no amounts eligible to be offset under master netting agreements as of September 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023. The fair value of the Company’s derivative financial instruments was determined using a market-based approach (Level 2).\nThe following table summarizes the impact of derivative financial instruments on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets (in\nmillions).\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nFair Value Fair Value\nPrepaid Prepaid\nexpenses Accounts expenses Accounts\nand Other payable Other and Other payable Other\nother non- and non- other non- and non-\ncurrent current accrued current current current accrued current\nNotional assets assets liabilities liabilities Notional assets assets liabilities liabilities\nCash flow hedges:\nForeign exchange $ 1,712 $ 43 $ 23 $ 25 $ 15 $ 1,484 $ 40 $ 8 $ 37 $ 8\nNet investment hedges: (a)\nCross-currency swaps 1,546 16 31 — 17 1,779 23 12 7 42\nFair value hedges:\nInterest rate swaps — — — — — 1,500 7 — — 5\nNo hedging designation:\nForeign exchange 1,013 19 2 16 97 1,058 1 1 1 83\nInterest rate swaps 3,000 1 — 2 — — — — — —\nTotal return swaps 451 7 — — — 395 19 — — —\nTotal $ 86 $ 56 $ 43 $ 129 $ 90 $ 21 $ 45 $ 138\n(a) Excludes £402 million of sterling notes ($513 million equivalent at December 31, 2023), and €1,275 million of euro notes ($1,427 million\nequivalent at September 30, 2024) designated as a net investment hedge. (See Note 8.)\nDerivatives Designated for Hedge Accounting\nCash Flow Hedges\nThe Company uses foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the foreign currency risk related to revenues, production\nrebates and production expenses. As production spend occurs or when rebate receivables are recognized, foreign forward exchange\ncontracts designated as cash flow hedges are de-designated. Upon de-designation, gains and losses on these derivatives directly\nimpact earnings in the same line and same period as the hedged risk.\nIn April 2023, the Company unwound cross-currency swaps related to its Sterling debt and recognized a gain of $76 million\nas an adjustment to other comprehensive income. The Sterling debt was subsequently re-designated as a net investment hedge\neffective May 2023, and in May 2024, the Company de-designated £255 million of the Sterling debt. During the three months\nended September 30, 2024, the Company repaid the Sterling debt in full at maturity and settled the remaining £145 million\ndesignated as a net investment hedge.\n19\nWARNER BROS.

The maximum length of time the Company is hedging exposure to the variability\nin future cash flows is 31 years.\nNet Investment Hedges\nThe Company uses fixed-to-fixed cross currency swaps to mitigate foreign currency risk associated with the net assets of\nnon-USD functional entities.\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2024, to mitigate the currency risk associated with the net assets of non-USD\nfunctional entities, the Company designated its €1,500 million denominated debt issued in May 2024 as a net investment hedge\n(See Note 8) and designated an additional €300 million of fixed-to-fixed cross currency swaps as a net investment hedge. The\nCompany de-designated €225 million of its Euro denominated debt during the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2023, to mitigate the currency risk associated with the net assets of non-USD\nfunctional entities, the Company re-designated its Sterling denominated debt due in 2024 as a net investment hedge after the\nunwind of the cash flow hedge previously noted.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company settled its Euro denominated debt that was designated as\nthe hedging instrument in a net investment hedge.\nThe following table presents the pre-tax impact of derivatives designated as net investment hedges on other comprehensive\nloss (in millions).

Simultaneously, the Company entered into a fixed-to-floating interest rate swap designated as a fair value hedge to\nallow the Company to mitigate the variability in the fair value of its senior notes due to fluctuations in the benchmark interest rate.\nChanges in the fair value of the senior note and the interest rate swap were recorded in interest expense, net. The fair value hedge\nwas subsequently settled during the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nDerivatives Not Designated for Hedge Accounting\nThe Company has deferred compensation plans that have risk related to the fair value gains and losses on these investments\nand entered into total return swaps to mitigate this risk. The gains and losses associated with these swaps are recorded to selling,\ngeneral and administrative expenses, offsetting the deferred compensation investment gains and losses.\nThe Company is exposed to risk of secured overnight financing rate changes in connection with securitization interest paid on\nthe receivables securitization program. To mitigate this risk, the Company entered into $3.0 billion notional of non-designated\ninterest rate swaps.

For the three months ended September 30,\n2024, the increase in income tax benefit compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily attributable to the effect of foreign\noperations, including a net tax benefit related to prior year tax positions finalized in tax returns filed during the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024. The increase in income tax benefit was partially offset by a decrease in pre-tax book loss. For the nine months\nended September 30, 2024, the decrease in income tax benefit compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily attributed to a\ndecrease in pre-tax book loss (excluding the non-cash goodwill impairment charge), and an increase in uncertain tax positions,\nprimarily attributable to a one-time favorable audit resolution reserve release included in the 2023 income tax benefit for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in tax benefits associated with the foreign\noperations.\nIncome tax benefit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflects an effective income tax rate that differs\nfrom the federal statutory tax rate primarily attributable to the non-deductible goodwill impairment charge and the effect of foreign\noperations.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company’s reserves for uncertain tax positions totaled $2,443 million\nand $2,147 million, respectively. It is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits related to certain of the\nCompany’s uncertain tax positions could decrease by as much as $99 million within the next twelve months as a result of ongoing\naudits, lapses of statutes of limitations or regulatory developments.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had accrued $707 million and $571 million, respectively, of\ntotal interest and penalties payable related to unrecognized tax benefits. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to\nunrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\n23\nWARNER BROS. DISCOVERY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(unaudited)\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) Pillar Two Global Anti-Base Erosion\n(“GloBE”) model rules, issued under the OECD Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, introduce a global\nminimum tax of 15% applicable to multinational enterprise groups with consolidated financial statement revenue in excess of €750\nmillion. Numerous foreign jurisdictions have already enacted tax legislation based on the GloBE rules, with some effective as early\nas January 1, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we recognized a nominal income tax expense for Pillar Two GloBE minimum tax.\nThe Company is continuously monitoring the evolving application of this legislation and assessing its potential impact on our\nfuture tax liability.\nNOTE 13.

As a result of executing the subleases, recoverability tests were performed and the Company recorded a combined right-of-\nuse (“ROU”) asset impairment charge of $231 million.

DISCOVERY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(unaudited)\nNoncontrolling Interest\nIn August 2023, the Company and JCOM Co., Ltd. (“JCOM”) executed a series of transaction agreements to which the\nCompany and JCOM each contributed to Discovery Japan, Inc. (“JVCo”), an existing 80/20 joint venture between the Company\nand JCOM, certain rights, liabilities, or rights via license agreements in exchange for new common shares of JVCo, resulting in the\nCompany and JCOM owning 51% and 49% of JVCo, respectively. Retaining controlling financial interest subsequent to the\ntransaction, the Company continues to consolidate the joint venture. As the terms of the agreement no longer incorporate JCOM’s\noption to put its noncontrolling interest to the Company, JCOM’s noncontrolling interest was reclassified from redeemable\nnoncontrolling interest to noncontrolling interest outside of stockholders’ equity on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nThe table below presents the changes in the components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of taxes (in millions).\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024\nAccumulated\nPension Plan Other\nCurrency and SERP Comprehensive\nTranslation Derivatives Liability Loss\nBeginning balance $ (866) $ 36 $ (60) $ (890)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications 482 15 — 497\nReclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive loss to net\nincome — (8) — (8)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) 482 7 — 489\nEnding balance $ (384) $ 43 $ (60) $ (401)\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2023\nAccumulated\nPension Plan Other\nCurrency and SERP Comprehensive\nTranslation Derivatives Liability Loss\nBeginning balance $ (1,012) $ 22 $ (52) $ (1,042)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications (393) 15 (1) (379)\nReclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive loss to net\nincome — (6) — (6)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) (393) 9 (1) (385)\nEnding balance $ (1,405) $ 31 $ (53) $ (1,427)\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nAccumulated\nPension Plan Other\nCurrency and SERP Comprehensive\nTranslation Derivatives Liability Loss\nBeginning balance $ (699) $ 18 $ (60) $ (741)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications 315 40 — 355\nReclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive loss to net\nincome — (15) — (15)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) 315 25 — 340\nEnding balance $ (384) $ 43 $ (60) $ (401)\n26\nWARNER BROS.

Related parties include entities\nthat share common directorship, such as Liberty Global plc (“Liberty Global”), Liberty Broadband Corporation (“Liberty\nBroadband”) and their subsidiaries (collectively the “Liberty Group”). The Company’s Board of Directors includes Dr. John\nMalone, who is Chairman of the Board of Liberty Global and Liberty Broadband and beneficially owns approximately 31% and\n49% of the aggregate voting power with respect to the election of directors of Liberty Global and Liberty Broadband, respectively.\nThe majority of the revenue earned from the Liberty Group relates to multi-year network distribution arrangements. Related party\ntransactions also include revenues and expenses for content and services provided to or acquired from equity method investees, or\nminority partners of consolidated subsidiaries.\nThe table below presents a summary of the transactions with related parties (in millions).\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenues and service charges:\nLiberty Group $ 18 $ 469 $ 497 $ 1,443\nEquity method investees 122 161 422 560\nOther 97 63 210 157\nTotal revenues and service charges $ 237 $ 693 $ 1,129 $ 2,160\nExpenses $ 58 $ 79 $ 218 $ 271\nDistributions to noncontrolling interests and redeemable\nnoncontrolling interests $ 11 $ 13 $ 172 $ 282\nThe table below presents receivables due from and payables due to related parties (in millions).\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nReceivables $ 273 $ 363\nPayables $ 8 $ 18\nNOTE 15. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nPut Rights\nThe Company has granted put rights to non-controlling interest holders in certain consolidated subsidiaries, but the Company\nis unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of any payment.\n27\nWARNER BROS. DISCOVERY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(unaudited)\nLegal Matters\nFrom time to time, in the normal course of its operations, the Company is subject to various litigation matters and claims,\nincluding claims related to employees, stockholders, vendors, other business partners, government regulations, or intellectual\nproperty, as well as disputes and matters involving counterparties to contractual agreements, such as disputes arising out of\ndefinitive agreements entered into in connection with the Merger. A determination as to the amount of the accrual required for such\ncontingencies is highly subjective and requires judgment about future events. In connection with a contract dispute arising out of\ndefinitive agreements entered into in connection with the Merger, the Company established an immaterial accrual in the first\nquarter of 2024. At this time, the Company is not able to estimate the reasonably possible range of loss or any loss in excess of the\naccrual associated with such matter. There can be no assurance that any settlement of such dispute will be reached and, if a\nsettlement is reached, what the total dollar amount will be of any such settlement.\nThe Company may not currently be able to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss for certain matters until\ndevelopments in such matters have provided sufficient information to support an assessment of such loss. In the absence of\nsufficient information to support an assessment of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss, no accrual for such contingencies is\nmade and no loss or range of loss is disclosed. Although the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty and the\nimpact of the final resolution of these matters on the Company’s results of operations in a particular subsequent reporting period is\nnot known, management does not currently believe that the resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany’s future consolidated financial position, future results of operations, or cash flows.\nNOTE 16. REPORTABLE SEGMENTS\nThe Company’s operating segments are determined based on: (i) financial information reviewed by its chief operating\ndecision maker, the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), (ii) internal management and related reporting structure, and (iii) the basis\nupon which the CEO makes resource allocation decisions.\nThe accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Company’s, except that certain inter-segment\ntransactions that are eliminated for consolidation are not eliminated at the segment level. Inter-segment transactions primarily\ninclude advertising and content licenses. The Company records inter-segment transactions of content licenses at market value. The\nCompany does not report assets by segment because it is not used to allocate resources or evaluate segment performance.\nThe Company evaluates the operating performance of its operating segments based on financial measures such as revenues\nand Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as operating income excluding:\n• employee share-based compensation;\n• depreciation and amortization;\n• restructuring and facility consolidation;\n• certain impairment charges;\n• gains and losses on business and asset dispositions;\n• third-party transaction and integration costs;\n• amortization of purchase accounting fair value step-up for content;\n• amortization of capitalized interest for content; and\n• other items impacting comparability.\nThe Company uses this measure to assess the operating results and performance of its segments, perform analytical\ncomparisons, identify strategies to improve performance, and allocate resources to each segment. The Company believes Adjusted\nEBITDA is relevant to investors because it allows them to analyze the operating performance of each segment using the same\nmetric management uses. The Company excludes employee share-based compensation, restructuring, certain impairment charges,\ngains and losses on business and asset dispositions, and transaction and integration costs from the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA\ndue to their impact on comparability between periods. Integration costs include transformative system implementations and\nintegrations, such as Enterprise Resource Planning systems, and may take several years to complete. The Company also excludes\nthe depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets, amortization of purchase accounting fair value step-up for\ncontent (which is included in consolidated costs of revenues), and amortization of capitalized interest for content, as these amounts\ndo not represent cash payments in the current reporting period. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, but not a\nsubstitute for, operating income, net income, and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nWe prospectively updated certain corporate allocations at the beginning of 2024. The impact to prior periods was immaterial.\n28\nWARNER BROS.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nRevolving Credit Facility\nIn October 2024, DCL entered into a multicurrency revolving credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), replacing the existing\n$6.0 billion credit agreement dated June 9, 2021. The Credit Agreement provides for a senior revolving credit facility with\naggregate commitments of $6.0 billion and includes a $150 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit. DCL may\nalso request additional commitments up to $1.0 billion from the lenders upon satisfaction of certain conditions. Obligations under\nthe Credit Agreement are unsecured and are guaranteed by WBD, Scripps Networks and WMH. The Credit Agreement is available\non a revolving basis until October 2029, with an option for up to two additional 364-day renewal periods subject to the lenders’\nconsent. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties as well as affirmative and negative covenants,\nand requires DCL to maintain a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.00 and a maximum consolidated\nleverage ratio of 4.50 to 1.00.\nDispositions\nIn October 2024, the Company completed the sale of a minority interest in Formula E to Liberty Global, a related party, and\nexpects to record a gain of $61 million.\n30\nITEM 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is a supplement to and should be read\nin conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes. This section provides additional\ninformation regarding our businesses, current developments, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Additional\ncontext can also be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the “2023 Form 10-K”).\nINDUSTRY TRENDS\nThe Writers Guild of America (“WGA”) and Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists\n(“SAG-AFTRA”) went on strike in May and July 2023, respectively, following the expiration of their respective collective\nbargaining agreements with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (“AMPTP”). The WGA strike ended on\nSeptember 27, 2023, and a new collective bargaining agreement was ratified on October 9, 2023. The SAG-AFTRA strike ended\non November 9, 2023, and a new collective bargaining agreement was ratified on December 5, 2023.\nThe strikes had a material impact on the operations and results of the Company in 2023, including a pause on certain\ntheatrical and television productions. Effects included a positive impact on cash flow from operations attributed to delayed\nproduction spend, and a negative impact on the results of operations attributed to timing and performance of the 2023 film slate, as\nwell as the Company’s ability to produce, license, and deliver content. The Company experienced content delivery delays in the\nfirst quarter of 2024 due to the pause in television productions in 2023, but does not expect any material impacts for the remainder\nof 2024.\nOther headwinds in the industry, such as continued pressures on linear distribution and continued softness in the U.S. linear\nadvertising market, have had, and are expected to continue to have, a material impact on the operations and results of the\nCompany, including a negative impact on the results of operations attributed to declines in linear advertising revenue. In addition,\ndeclines in linear subscribers are expected to continue throughout 2024. The increase of digital advertising available in the\nmarketplace has also resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, increased competition for advertising expenditures for\nboth traditional linear networks and ad-supported tiers in streaming services.\nWe continue to closely monitor the ongoing impact of industry trends to our business; however, the full effects on our\noperations and results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW\nWarner Bros. Discovery is a leading global media and entertainment company that creates and distributes a differentiated and\ncomplete portfolio of branded content across television, film, streaming and gaming. Warner Bros. Discovery inspires, informs and\nentertains audiences worldwide through its iconic brands and products including: Discovery Channel, Max, discovery+, CNN, DC,\nTNT Sports, Eurosport, HBO, HGTV, Food Network, OWN, Investigation Discovery, TLC, Magnolia Network, TNT, TBS,\ntruTV, Travel Channel, MotorTrend, Animal Planet, Science Channel, Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group, Warner Bros.\nTelevision Group, Warner Bros. Pictures Animation, Warner Bros. Games, New Line Cinema, Cartoon Network, Adult Swim,\nTurner Classic Movies, Discovery en Español, Hogar de HGTV and others.\nWe are home to powerful creative engines and one of the largest collections of owned content in the world. WBD has one of\nthe strongest hands in the industry in terms of the completeness and quality of assets and intellectual property across sports, news,\nlifestyle, and entertainment in virtually every region of the globe and in most languages. We serve audiences and consumers\naround the world with content that informs, entertains, and, when at its best, inspires.\nOur asset mix positions us to drive a balanced approach to creating long-term value for shareholders. It represents the full\nentertainment ecosystem, and the ability to serve consumers across the entire spectrum of offerings from domestic and\ninternational networks, premium pay-TV, streaming, production and release of feature films and original series, related consumer\nproducts and themed experience licensing, and interactive gaming.\nIn connection with the Merger, the Company has announced and has taken actions to implement projects to achieve cost\nsynergies for the Company. The Company’s ongoing restructuring and transformation initiatives include, among other things,\nstrategic content programming assessments, organization restructuring, facility consolidation activities, and other contract\ntermination costs. While the Company’s restructuring efforts are ongoing, this restructuring program is expected to be substantially\ncompleted by the end of 2024. We expect to incur up to $5.3 billion in pre-tax charges, of which we have incurred $4.5 billion as\nof September 30, 2024 related to this plan. Of the total expected pre-tax charges, we expect total cash expenditures to be $1.0 -\n$1.5 billion.\n31\nAs of September 30, 2024, we classified our operations in three reportable segments:\n• Studios - Our Studios segment primarily consists of the production and release of feature films for initial exhibition\nin theaters, production and initial licensing of television programs to third parties and our networks/DTC services,\ndistribution of our films and television programs to various third party and internal television and streaming\nservices, distribution through the home entertainment market (physical and digital), related consumer products and\nthemed experience licensing, and interactive gaming.\n• Networks - Our Networks segment primarily consists of our domestic and international television networks.\n• DTC - Our DTC segment primarily consists of our premium pay-TV and streaming services.\nOur segment presentation is aligned with our management structure and the financial information management uses to make\ndecisions about operating matters, such as the allocation of resources and business performance assessments.\n32\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nForeign Exchange Impacting Comparability\nThe impact of exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons of our\nresults. For example, our international revenues are favorably impacted as the U.S. dollar weakens relative to other foreign\ncurrencies, and unfavorably impacted as the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies. We believe the\npresentation of results on a constant currency basis (“ex-FX”), in addition to results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP\nprovides useful information about our operating performance because the presentation ex-FX excludes the effects of foreign\ncurrency volatility and highlights our core operating results. The presentation of results on a constant currency basis should be\nconsidered in addition to, but not a substitute for, measures of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe ex-FX change represents the percentage change on a period-over-period basis adjusted for foreign currency impacts. The\nex-FX change is calculated as the difference between the current year amounts translated at a baseline rate, which is a spot rate for\neach of our currencies determined early in the fiscal year as part of our forecasting process (the “2024 Baseline Rate”), and the\nprior year amounts translated at the same 2024 Baseline Rate. In addition, consistent with the assumption of a constant currency\nenvironment, our ex-FX results exclude the impact of our foreign currency hedging activities, as well as realized and unrealized\nforeign currency transaction gains and losses. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to\nsimilarly titled measures used by other companies.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe table below presents our consolidated results of operations (in millions).\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n% Change % Change\n2024 2023 % Change (ex-FX) 2024 2023 % Change (ex-FX)\nRevenues:\nDistribution $ 4,920 $ 5,026 (2) % (1) % $ 14,784 $ 15,324 (4) % (2) %\nAdvertising 1,682 1,796 (6) % (7) % 6,260 6,613 (5) % (5) %\nContent 2,721 2,840 (4) % (4) % 7,388 8,240 (10) % (10) %\nOther 300 317 (5) % (7) % 862 860 — % (1) %\nTotal revenues 9,623 9,979 (4) % (3) % 29,294 31,037 (6) % (5) %\nCosts of revenues, excluding\ndepreciation and amortization 5,181 5,309 (2) % (2) % 17,443 18,630 (6) % (6) %\nSelling, general and\nadministrative 2,385 2,291 4 % 4 % 7,078 7,241 (2) % (2) %\nDepreciation and amortization 1,762 1,989 (11) % (11) % 5,394 5,961 (10) % (9) %\nRestructuring and other charges 9 269 (97) % (97) % 161 510 (68) % (69) %\nImpairments and loss on\ndispositions 5 24 (79) % NM 9,412 61 NM NM\nTotal costs and expenses 9,342 9,882 (5) % (5) % 39,488 32,403 22 % 22 %\nOperating income (loss) 281 97 NM NM (10,194) (1,366) NM NM\nInterest expense, net (494) (574) (1,527) (1,719)\nGain on extinguishment of debt 23 22 590 17\nLoss from equity investees, net (18) (14) (89) (73)\nOther income (expense), net 30 (63) 188 (109)\nLoss before income taxes (178) (532) (11,032) (3,250)\nIncome tax benefit 319 125 190 563\nNet income (loss) 141 (407) (10,842) (2,687)\nNet income attributable to\nnoncontrolling interests (3) (8) (20) (32)\nNet (income) loss attributable to\nredeemable noncontrolling interests (3) (2) 45 (7)\nNet income (loss) available to Warner\nBros.

The ex-FX percent changes of line\nitems below operating loss in the table above are not included as the activity is principally in U.S. dollars.\n33\nRevenues\nDistribution revenue decreased 1% and 2% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily\nattributable to a 9% and 8% decline in Networks domestic linear subscribers for the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2024, respectively, and lower domestic subscribers at DTC largely resulting from continued linear wholesale subscriber declines in\nthe U.S., partially offset by a 5% increase in domestic, linear contractual affiliate rates for both the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, respectively, and a 15% increase in subscribers and an increase in pricing for both the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024, following the launch of Max in Latin America in the first quarter of 2024 and in Europe in the second\nquarter of 2024.\nAdvertising revenue decreased 7% and 5% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily\nattributable to audience declines in domestic linear networks of 21% and 15% for the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2024, respectively, partially offset by an increase in domestic Max ad-lite subscribers.\nContent revenue decreased 4% and 10% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The decrease\nfor the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to a 40% decrease in theatrical product revenue\nattributable to lower film rental revenue due to the strong prior year performance of Barbie, which was released in the third quarter\nof 2023, partially offset by the sublicensing of Olympic sports rights in Europe in the current year, which had a favorable impact of\n$578 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nThe decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to a 60% decrease in games revenue\ndue to the strong performance of the 2023 slate, including Hogwarts Legacy, compared to the 2024 slate and a 10% decrease in\ntelevision product revenue attributable to fewer television series availabilities resulting in lower licensing revenue, partially offset\nby the sublicensing of Olympic sports rights in Europe in the current year which had a favorable impact of $578 million for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024.\nOther revenue decreased 7% and 1% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily\nattributable to the timing of services provided to the unconsolidated TNT Sports UK joint venture. In addition, the decrease for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 was also attributable to lower studio production services due to the impact of the WGA and\nSAG-AFTRA strikes, partially offset by the opening of Warner Bros. Studio Tour Tokyo in June 2023.\nCosts of Revenues\nOur principal component of costs of revenues is content expense. Content expense includes television/digital series, specials,\nfilms, games, and sporting events. Amortization related to both historical cost basis and any fair value adjustments to content\narising from business combinations is included in costs of revenues. The costs of producing a content asset and bringing that asset\nto market consist of production costs, participation costs, and exploitation costs.\nCosts of revenues decreased 2% and 6% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The decrease\nfor the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to a 37% decrease in theatrical product content expense\nas a result of lower revenues, lower content expense related to the amortization of purchase accounting fair value step-up for\ncontent, and lower Networks and DTC content expense, including our exit from the AT&T SportsNet business, partially offset by\nthe broadcast of the Olympics in Europe in the current year.\nThe decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to lower content expense related to the\namortization of purchase accounting fair value step-up for content, a 14% decrease in television product expense commensurate\nwith lower television revenue, and lower Networks content expense, including our exit from the AT&T SportsNet business,\npartially offset by the broadcast of the Olympics in Europe in the current year. The exit from the AT&T SportsNet business had\nfavorable impacts to costs of revenues of $97 million and $276 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively. The broadcast of the Olympics in Europe in the current year had unfavorable impacts to costs of revenues of\n$663 million and $665 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased 4% and decreased 2% for the three and nine months ended September\n30, 2024, respectively. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to higher overhead\nexpenses. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to lower marketing costs due to\nthe prior year launch of Max in the U.S. and lower overhead expenses.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization decreased 11% and 9% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively,\nprimarily attributable to intangible assets acquired during the Merger that are being amortized using the sum of the months’ digits\nmethod, partially offset by the shortening of the useful lives of certain intangible assets. (See Note 2 to the accompanying\nconsolidated financial statements.)\n34\nRestructuring and other charges\nRestructuring and other charges decreased 97% and 69% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively. Restructuring and other charges primarily includes contract terminations, facility consolidation activities,\norganizational restructuring, and other charges. (See Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nImpairments and Loss on Dispositions\nImpairments and loss on dispositions was $5 million and $9,412 million for the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2024, respectively. Impairments and loss on dispositions for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable\nto a $9.1 billion pre-tax, non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to the Networks reporting unit during the three months\nended June 30, 2024 (see Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements) and a $231 million ROU asset impairment\ncharge related to the Hudson Yards, New York office lease. (See Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nInterest Expense, net\nInterest expense, net decreased $80 million and $192 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively, primarily attributable to lower debt during the period. (See Note 8 and Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated\nfinancial statements.)\nGain on extinguishment of debt\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repaid in full at maturity $40 million of aggregate principal amount\noutstanding of our floating rate notes due March 2024 and we repurchased or repaid $5,387 million of aggregate principal amount\noutstanding of our senior notes. (See Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nLoss From Equity Investees, net\nLosses from our equity method investees were $18 million and $89 million for the three and nine months ended September\n30, 2024, respectively. The changes are attributable to our share of earnings and losses from our equity investees. (See Note 7 to\nthe accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nOther Income (Expense), net\nThe table below presents the details of other income (expense), net (in millions).\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nForeign currency losses, net $ (15) $ (83) $ (206) $ (180)\n(Losses) gains on derivative instruments, net (6) (2) (29) 1\nChange in the value of investments with readily determinable\nfair value (5) — (7) 21\nGain on sale of equity method investments — — 203 —\nChange in fair value of equity investments without readily\ndeterminable fair value — (2) (27) (73)\nInterest income 49 43 172 128\nIndemnification receivable accrual 4 (14) 100 (9)\nOther (loss) income, net 3 (5) (18) 3\nTotal other income (expense), net $ 30 $ (63) $ 188 $ (109)\n35\nIncome Tax Benefit\nIncome tax benefit was $319 million and $125 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively, and income tax benefit was $190 million and $563 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of\n$9.1 billion, the majority of which was not deductible for tax purposes. (See Note 2.) For the three months ended September 30,\n2024, the increase in income tax benefit compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily attributable to the effect of foreign\noperations, including a net tax benefit related to prior year tax positions finalized in tax returns filed during the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024. The increase in income tax benefit was partially offset by a decrease in pre-tax book loss. For the nine months\nended September 30, 2024, the decrease in income tax benefit compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily attributed to a\ndecrease in pre-tax book loss (excluding the non-cash goodwill impairment charge), and an increase in uncertain tax positions,\nprimarily attributable to a one-time favorable audit resolution reserve release included in the 2023 income tax benefit for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in tax benefits associated with the foreign\noperations.\nIncome tax benefit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflects an effective income tax rate that differs\nfrom the federal statutory tax rate primarily attributable to the non-deductible goodwill impairment charge and the effect of foreign\noperations.\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) Pillar Two Global Anti-Base Erosion\n(“GloBE”) model rules, issued under the OECD Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, introduce a global\nminimum tax of 15% applicable to multinational enterprise groups with consolidated financial statement revenue in excess of €750\nmillion. Numerous foreign jurisdictions have already enacted tax legislation based on the GloBE rules, with some effective as early\nas January 1, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we recognized a nominal income tax expense for Pillar Two GloBE minimum tax.\nThe Company is continuously monitoring the evolving application of this legislation and assessing its potential impact on our\nfuture tax liability.\nSegment Results of Operations\nThe Company evaluates the operating performance of its operating segments based on financial measures such as revenues\nand Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as operating income excluding:\n• employee share-based compensation;\n• depreciation and amortization;\n• restructuring and facility consolidation;\n• certain impairment charges;\n• gains and losses on business and asset dispositions;\n• third-party transaction and integration costs;\n• amortization of purchase accounting fair value step-up for content;\n• amortization of capitalized interest for content; and\n• other items impacting comparability.\nThe Company uses this measure to assess the operating results and performance of its segments, perform analytical\ncomparisons, identify strategies to improve performance, and allocate resources to each segment. The Company believes Adjusted\nEBITDA is relevant to investors because it allows them to analyze the operating performance of each segment using the same\nmetric management uses. The Company excludes employee share-based compensation, restructuring, certain impairment charges,\ngains and losses on business and asset dispositions, and transaction and integration costs from the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA\ndue to their impact on comparability between periods. Integration costs include transformative system implementations and\nintegrations, such as Enterprise Resource Planning systems, and may take several years to complete. The Company also excludes\nthe depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets, amortization of purchase accounting fair value step-up for\ncontent (which is included in consolidated costs of revenues), and amortization of capitalized interest for content, as these amounts\ndo not represent cash payments in the current reporting period. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, but not a\nsubstitute for, operating income, net income, and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nWe prospectively updated certain corporate allocations at the beginning of 2024. The impact to prior periods was immaterial.\n36\nThe table below presents our Adjusted EBITDA for each of the Company’s reportable segments, corporate, and inter-\nsegment eliminations (in millions).\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 % Change 2024 2023 % Change\nStudios $ 308 $ 727 (58) % $ 702 $ 1,640 (57) %\nNetworks $ 2,115 $ 2,396 (12) % $ 6,232 $ 6,855 (9) %\nDTC $ 289 $ 111 NM $ 268 $ 158 70 %\nCorporate $ (296) $ (328) 10 % $ (927) $ (928) — %\nInter-segment eliminations $ (3) $ 63 NM $ 35 $ 4 NM\n37\nStudios Segment\nThe following table presents, for our Studios segment, revenues by type, certain operating expenses, Adjusted EBITDA and a\nreconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to operating income (loss) (in millions).\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n% Change % Change\n2024 2023 % Change (ex-FX) 2024 2023 % Change (ex-FX)\nRevenues:\nDistribution $ 6 $ 13 (54) % (54) % $ 14 $ 19 (26) % (26) %\nAdvertising 1 4 (75) % (75) % 5 11 (55) % (55) %\nContent 2,463 3,000 (18) % (18) % 7,323 8,425 (13) % (13) %\nOther 210 209 — % — % 608 564 8 % 7 %\nTotal revenues 2,680 3,226 (17) % (17) % 7,950 9,019 (12) % (12) %\nCosts of revenues, excluding\ndepreciation and amortization 1,736 1,794 (3) % (3) % 5,356 5,398 (1) % (1) %\nSelling, general and administrative 636 705 (10) % (10) % 1,892 1,981 (4) % (5) %\nAdjusted EBITDA 308 727 (58) % (58) % 702 1,640 (57) % (56) %\nDepreciation and amortization 171 143 531 458\nEmployee share-based compensation — — (1) —\nRestructuring and other charges 2 134 32 220\nTransaction and integration costs — 1 2 5\nFacility consolidation costs 1 — 2 —\nImpairment and amortization of fair\nvalue step-up for content 34 173 45 886\nAmortization of capitalized interest for\ncontent 8 12 38 34\nInter-segment eliminations — — — 1\nImpairments and loss on dispositions (5) — (6) (1)\nOperating income $ 97 $ 264 $ 59 $ 37\nUnless otherwise indicated, the discussion of percent changes below is on an ex-FX basis. The Studios discussion below also\nincludes intra-segment revenue and expense between product lines, which represented less than 3% of total revenues and operating\nexpenses for this segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Intra-segment revenue and expense are\neliminated at the Studios segment level.\nFluctuations in results for our Studios segment may occur due to various factors, including (but not limited to) the timing and\nnumber of new film releases each quarter, the timing of marketing expenses recognized relative to (i.e., prior to) a film’s release,\nand the mix of content distributed each period.\nRevenues\nContent revenue decreased 18% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily attributable to a 40% decrease in\ntheatrical product revenue and a 31% decrease in games revenue, partially offset by a 30% increase in television product revenue.\n• The decrease in theatrical product revenue was attributable to lower film rental revenue due to the strong prior year\nperformance of Barbie, which was released in the third quarter of 2023.\n• The decrease in games revenue was attributable to the better prior year performance of Mortal Kombat 1, which was\nreleased in September 2023 compared to less significant releases in the third quarter of 2024.\n• The increase in television product revenue was attributable to higher initial telecast revenue due to the impact of the WGA\nand SAG-AFTRA strikes in the prior year.\nContent revenue decreased 13% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily attributable to a 60% decrease in\ngames revenue, a 10% decrease in television product revenue, and a 2% decrease in theatrical product revenue.\n• The decrease in theatrical product revenue was attributable to lower film rental revenue and intra-segment licensing\nrevenue, partially offset by higher home entertainment revenue. Film rental revenue decreased due to the strong prior year\nperformance of Barbie, which was released in the third quarter of 2023, partially offset by higher carryover releases from\nthe fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Home entertainment revenue increased due to the\nperformance of Dune: Part Two, Wonka, and Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire.\n38\n• The decrease in games revenue was attributable to the strong performance of the 2023 slate, including Hogwarts Legacy,\ncompared to the 2024 slate.\n• The decrease in television product revenue was attributable to fewer television series availabilities in 2024 resulting in\nlower licensing revenue.\nOther revenue was flat and increased 7% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The increase\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to the opening of Warner Bros. Studio Tour Tokyo in\nJune 2023, partially offset by lower studio production services due to the impact of the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes.\nCosts of Revenues\nCosts of revenues decreased 3% and 1% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The decrease\nfor the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to a 37% decrease in theatrical product content expense\nas a result of lower revenues and lower average cost per title, partially offset by 31% higher television product content expense\ncommensurate with higher television product revenue, and 47% higher games content expense due to impairments of $122 million.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a 14% decrease in television product expense commensurate with lower television\nproduct revenue was partially offset by a 6% increase in theatrical product content expense due to product mix, and a 9% increase\nin games content expense due to impairments of $335 million. The increase in games content expense was partially offset by lower\nintra-segment licensing costs.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased 10% and 5% for the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2024, respectively. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to lower theatrical and\ngames marketing expenses. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to lower\noverhead expenses and lower games marketing expenses.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased 58% and 56% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.\nNetworks Segment\nThe table below presents, for our Networks segment, revenues by type, certain operating expenses, Adjusted EBITDA and a\nreconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to operating income (in millions).\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n% Change % Change\n2024 2023 % Change (ex-FX) 2024 2023 % Change (ex-FX)\nRevenues:\nDistribution $ 2,598 $ 2,833 (8) % (7) % $ 8,070 $ 8,769 (8) % (7) %\nAdvertising 1,490 1,709 (13) % (13) % 5,691 6,394 (11) % (11) %\nContent 833 215 NM NM 1,396 744 88 % 87 %\nOther 89 111 (20) % (21) % 250 300 (17) % (18) %\nTotal revenues 5,010 4,868 3 % 3 % 15,407 16,207 (5) % (4) %\nCosts of revenues, excluding\ndepreciation and amortization 2,185 1,800 21 % 22 % 7,088 7,243 (2) % (1) %\nSelling, general and administrative 710 672 6 % 6 % 2,087 2,109 (1) % — %\nAdjusted EBITDA 2,115 2,396 (12) % (11) % 6,232 6,855 (9) % (9) %\nDepreciation and amortization 1,048 1,202 3,205 3,768\nRestructuring and other charges 5 48 58 161\nTransaction and integration costs 3 (8) 3 3\nImpairment and amortization of fair\nvalue step-up for content — — 419 400\nInter-segment eliminations — (10) — 5\nImpairments and loss on dispositions 5 11 9,159 16\nOperating income (loss) $ 1,054 $ 1,153 $ (6,612) $ 2,502\nUnless otherwise indicated, the discussion of percent changes below is on an ex-FX basis.\n39\nRevenues\nDistribution revenue decreased 7% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily attributable to a 9%\nand 8% decline in domestic linear subscribers for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, partially\noffset by a 5% increase in domestic contractual affiliate rates for both periods. In addition, the exit from the AT&T SportsNet\nbusiness had unfavorable impacts of $68 million and $215 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively. Declines in linear subscribers are expected to continue throughout 2024.\nAdvertising revenue decreased 13% and 11% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively,\nprimarily attributable to audience declines in domestic networks of 21% and 15% for the three and nine months ended September\n30, 2024, respectively, and continued softness in the U.S. linear advertising market, partially offset by the broadcast of the\nOlympics in Europe in the current year.\nContent revenue increased $618 million and $652 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively, primarily attributable to the sublicensing of Olympic sports rights in Europe in the current year, which had a favorable\nimpact of $578 million on content revenue.\nOther revenue decreased 21% and 18% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily\nattributable to the timing of services provided to the unconsolidated TNT Sports UK joint venture.\nCosts of Revenues\nCosts of revenues increased 22% and decreased 1% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.\nThe increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to the broadcast of the Olympics in Europe\nin the current year, partially offset by lower content expense, including our exit from the AT&T SportsNet business. The decrease\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to our exit from the AT&T SportsNet business and lower\ncontent expense, including the allocation of U.S. sports costs to DTC, partially offset by the broadcast of the Olympics in Europe in\nthe current year. The exit from the AT&T SportsNet business had favorable impacts to costs of revenues of $97 million and $276\nmillion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The broadcast of the Olympics in Europe in the\ncurrent year had unfavorable impacts to costs of revenues of $663 million and $665 million for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, respectively.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased 6% and was flat for the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2024, respectively. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to higher overhead\nexpenses and marketing expenses related to the broadcast of the Olympics in Europe. For the nine months ended September 30,\n2024, lower overhead expenses were offset by higher marketing expenses related to the broadcast of the Olympics in Europe.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased 11% and 9% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The\nbroadcast of the Olympics in Europe negatively impacted Adjusted EBITDA by $65 million and $66 million for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, respectively.\n40\nDTC Segment\nThe following table presents, for our DTC segment, revenues by type, certain operating expenses, Adjusted EBITDA and a\nreconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to operating loss (in millions).\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n% Change % Change\n2024 2023 % Change (ex-FX) 2024 2023 % Change (ex-FX)\nRevenues:\nDistribution $ 2,320 $ 2,179 6 % 8 % $ 6,707 $ 6,536 3 % 3 %\nAdvertising 205 138 49 % 51 % 620 362 71 % 73 %\nContent 107 120 (11) % (11) % 329 715 (54) % (54) %\nOther 2 1 NM NM 6 12 (50) % (50) %\nTotal revenues 2,634 2,438 8 % 9 % 7,662 7,625 — % 1 %\nCosts of revenues, excluding\ndepreciation and amortization 1,776 1,874 (5) % (5) % 5,699 5,640 1 % 2 %\nSelling, general and administrative 569 453 26 % 27 % 1,695 1,827 (7) % (6) %\nAdjusted EBITDA 289 111 NM NM 268 158 70 % 72 %\nDepreciation and amortization 450 590 1,425 1,520\nRestructuring and other charges (16) 34 1 61\nTransaction and integration costs (1) 1 (1) 2\nFacility consolidation costs — — 5 —\nImpairment and amortization of fair\nvalue step-up for content 57 111 230 349\nInter-segment eliminations — 8 — 10\nImpairments and loss on dispositions 1 3 17 4\nOperating loss $ (202) $ (636) $ (1,409) $ (1,788)\nUnless otherwise indicated, the discussion of percent changes below is on an ex-FX basis.\nRevenues\nSubscriber information consisted of the following (in millions).\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 % Change\nTotal Domestic subscribers1 52.6 52.6 — %\nTotal International subscribers1 57.9 43.3 34 %\nTotal DTC subscribers1 110.5 95.9 15 %\n1\nDirect-to-Consumer subscriber - We define a “Core DTC Subscription” as:\n(i) a retail subscription to discovery+, HBO, HBO Max, Max, or a Premium Sports Product (defined below) for which we have recognized subscription\nrevenue, whether directly or through a third party, from a direct-to-consumer platform; (ii) a wholesale subscription to discovery+, HBO, HBO Max, Max, or a\nPremium Sports Product for which we have recognized subscription revenue from a fixed-fee arrangement with a third party and where the individual user has\nactivated their subscription; (iii) a wholesale subscription to discovery+, HBO, HBO Max, Max, or a Premium Sports Product for which we have recognized\nsubscription revenue on a per subscriber basis; (iv) a retail or wholesale subscription to an independently-branded, regional product sold on a stand-alone basis that\nincludes discovery+, HBO, HBO Max, Max, and/or a Premium Sports Product, for which we have recognized subscription revenue (as per (i)-(iii) above); and (v)\nusers on free trials who convert to a subscription for which we have recognized subscription revenue within the first seven days of the calendar month immediately\nfollowing the month in which their free trial expires.\nThe Company defines a “Premium Sports Product” as a strategically prioritized, sports-focused product sold on a stand-alone basis and made available\ndirectly to consumers. The current “independently-branded, regional products” referred to in (iv) above consist of TVN/Player and BluTV. Subscribers to multiple\nWBD DTC products (listed above) are counted as a paid subscriber for each individual WBD DTC product subscription. We may refer to the aggregate number of\nDTC Subscriptions as “subscribers”.\nThe reported number of “subscribers” included herein and the definition of “DTC Subscription” as used herein excludes: (i) individuals who subscribe to DTC\nproducts, other than discovery+, HBO, HBO Max, Max, a Premium Sports Product, and independently-branded, regional products (currently consisting of TVN/\nPlayer and BluTV) that may be offered by us or by certain joint venture partners or affiliated parties from time to time; (ii) a limited number of international\ndiscovery+ subscribers that are part of non-strategic partnerships or short-term arrangements as may be identified by the Company from time to time; (iii) domestic\nand international Cinemax subscribers, and international basic HBO subscribers; and (iv) users on free trials except for those users on free trial that convert to a\nDTC Subscription within the first seven days of the next month as noted above.\nDomestic subscriber - We define a Domestic subscriber as a subscription based either in the United States of America or Canada.\nInternational subscriber - We define an International subscriber as a subscription based outside of the United States of America or Canada.\n41\nDistribution revenue increased 8% and 3% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily\nattributable to a 15% increase in subscribers and an increase in pricing following the launch of Max in Latin America in the first\nquarter of 2024 and in Europe in the second quarter of 2024, partially offset by continued domestic linear wholesale subscriber\ndeclines.\nAdvertising revenue increased 51% and 73% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively,\nprimarily attributable to an increase in domestic ad-lite subscribers.\nGlobal ARPU consisted of the following.\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n% Change % Change\n2024 2023 (ex-FX) 2024 2023 (ex-FX)\nDomestic ARPU $ 11.99 $ 11.29 6 % $ 11.93 $ 11.06 8 %\nInternational ARPU $ 4.05 $ 3.98 7 % $ 3.89 $ 3.84 5 %\nGlobal ARPU2 $ 7.84 $ 7.88 1 % $ 7.89 $ 7.73 3 %\nGlobal ARPU increased 1% and 3% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily\nattributable to subscriber growth of the ad-lite tier domestically, higher pricing, and a continuing subscriber mix shift from linear\nwholesale, partially offset by growth in lower ARPU international markets.\nContent revenue decreased 11% and 54% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily\nattributable to fewer third-party licensing deals.\nCosts of Revenues\nCosts of revenues decreased 5% and increased 2% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.\nThe decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to lower content expense due to timing of\nprogramming releases, partially offset by the broadcast of the Olympics in Europe. The increase for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to higher sports related expenses driven by the allocation of U.S. sports from the\nNetworks segment and the broadcast of the Olympics in Europe, partially offset by decreased non-sports content expense.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased 27% and decreased 6% for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, respectively. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to higher\noverhead expenses, higher marketing expenses due to the continuation of Max launches, and the broadcast of the Olympics in\nEurope in the current year. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to lower\nmarketing costs due to the prior year launch of Max in the U.S. and lower overhead expenses, partially offset by the continuation of\nMax launches internationally.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $178 million and $110 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively. The broadcast of the Olympics in Europe negatively impacted Adjusted EBITDA by $41 million and $42 million for\nthe three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.\n2\nARPU: The Company defines DTC Average Revenue Per User (“ARPU”) as total subscription revenue plus net advertising revenue for the period divided by the\ndaily average number of paying subscribers for the period. Where daily values are not available, the sum of beginning of period and end of period divided by two is\nused.\nExcluded from the ARPU calculation are: (i) Revenue and subscribers for DTC products, other than discovery+, HBO, HBO Max, Max, a Premium Sports\nProduct, and independently-branded, regional products (currently consisting of TVN/Player and BluTV), that may be offered by us or by certain joint venture\npartners or affiliated parties from time to time; (ii) A limited amount of international discovery+ revenue and subscribers that are part of non-strategic partnerships\nor short-term arrangements as may be identified by the Company from time to time; (iii) Cinemax, Max/HBO hotel and bulk institution (i.e., subscribers billed on a\nbulk basis), and international basic HBO revenue and subscribers; and (iv) Users on free trials who convert to a subscription for which we have recognized\nsubscription revenue within the first seven days of the calendar month immediately following the month in which their free trial expires.\n42\nCorporate\nThe following table presents our Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to operating loss (in millions).\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n% Change % Change\n2024 2023 % Change (ex-FX) 2024 2023 % Change (ex-FX)\nAdjusted EBITDA $ (296) $ (328) 10 % 10 % $ (927) $ (928) — % (1) %\nDepreciation and amortization 93 54 233 215\nEmployee share-based compensation 157 140 413 381\nRestructuring and other charges 18 53 70 70\nTransaction and integration costs 31 37 161 115\nFacility consolidation costs 1 14 2 37\nImpairment and amortization of fair\nvalue step-up for content 1 1 2 (7)\nInter-segment eliminations — 2 — (16)\nImpairments and loss on dispositions 4 10 242 42\nOperating loss $ (601) $ (639) $ (2,050) $ (1,765)\nCorporate operations primarily consist of executive management and administrative support services, which are recorded in\nselling, general and administrative expense, as well as substantially all of our share-based compensation and third-party transaction\nand integration costs.\nAdjusted EBITDA improved 10% and decreased 1% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.\nThe improvement for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to lower facility costs and personnel\ncosts, partially offset by higher overhead expenses. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily\nattributable to higher overhead and securitization expenses, partially offset by lower facility costs.\nInter-segment Eliminations\nThe following table presents our inter-segment eliminations by revenue and expense, Adjusted EBITDA and a\nreconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to operating loss (in millions).\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nInter-segment revenue eliminations $ (705) $ (551) $ (1,731) $ (1,811)\nInter-segment expense eliminations (702) (614) (1,766) (1,815)\nAdjusted EBITDA (3) 63 35 4\nRestructuring and other charges — — — (2)\nImpairment and amortization of fair value step-up for content 64 108 217 358\nOperating loss $ (67) $ (45) $ (182) $ (352)\nInter-segment revenue and expense eliminations primarily represent inter-segment content transactions and marketing and\npromotion activity between reportable segments. In our current segment structure, in certain instances, production and distribution\nactivities are in different segments. Inter-segment content transactions are presented at market value (i.e., the segment producing\nand/or licensing the content reports revenue and profit from inter-segment transactions in a manner similar to the reporting of third-\nparty transactions, and the required eliminations are reported on the separate “Eliminations” line when presenting our summary of\nsegment results). Generally, timing of revenue recognition is similar to the reporting of third-party transactions. The segment\ndistributing the content, e.g., via our DTC or linear services, capitalizes the cost of inter-segment content transactions, including\n“mark-ups” and amortizes the costs over the shorter of the license term, if applicable, or the expected period of use. The content\namortization expense related to the inter-segment profit is also eliminated on the separate “Eliminations” line when presenting our\nsummary of segment results.\n43\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nLiquidity\nSources of Cash\nHistorically, we have generated a significant amount of cash from operations. During the nine months ended September 30,\n2024, we funded our working capital needs primarily through cash flows from operations. As of September 30, 2024, we had $3.3\nbillion of cash and cash equivalents on hand. We are a well-known seasoned issuer and have the ability to conduct registered\nofferings of securities, including debt securities, common stock and preferred stock, on short notice, subject to market conditions.\nAccess to sufficient capital from the public market is not assured. We have a $6.0 billion revolving credit facility and a commercial\npaper program described below. We also participate in a revolving receivables program and an accounts receivable factoring\nprogram described below.\n• Debt\nRevolving Credit Facility and Commercial Paper\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had a multicurrency revolving credit agreement (the “Revolving Credit Agreement”) and\nhad the capacity to borrow up to $6.0 billion under the Revolving Credit Agreement (the “Credit Facility”). We could also\nrequest additional commitments up to $1.0 billion from the lenders upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. The\nRevolving Credit Agreement contained customary representations and warranties as well as affirmative and negative\ncovenants. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all covenants and there were no events of\ndefault under the Revolving Credit Agreement. In October 2024, the Company replaced the Revolving Credit Agreement\nwith a new multicurrency revolving credit agreement. (See Note 17 to the accompanying consolidated financial\nstatements.)\nAdditionally, our commercial paper program is supported by the Credit Facility. Under the commercial paper program, we\nmay issue up to $1.5 billion, including up to $500 million of euro-denominated borrowings. Borrowing capacity under the\nCredit Facility is effectively reduced by any outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper program.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we borrowed and repaid $14,203 million under our Credit Facility and\ncommercial paper program. As of September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility or the\ncommercial paper program.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued €650 million of 4.302% fixed rate senior notes\ndue January 2030 and €850 million of 4.693% fixed rate senior notes due May 2033. After December 2029 and February\n2033, respectively, the senior notes are redeemable at par plus accrued and unpaid interest.\n• Revolving Receivables Program\nWe have a revolving agreement to transfer up to $5,200 million of certain receivables through our bankruptcy-remote\nsubsidiary, Warner Bros. Discovery Receivables Funding, LLC, to various financial institutions on a recurring basis in\nexchange for cash equal to the gross receivables transferred. We service the sold receivables for the financial institution\nfor a fee and pay fees to the financial institution in connection with this revolving agreement. As customers pay their\nbalances, our available capacity under this revolving agreement increases and typically we transfer additional receivables\ninto the program. In some cases, we may have collections that have not yet been remitted to the bank, resulting in a\nliability. The outstanding portfolio of receivables derecognized from our consolidated balance sheets was $4,761 million\nas of September 30, 2024.\n• Accounts Receivable Factoring\nWe have a factoring agreement to sell certain of our non-U.S. trade accounts receivable on a limited recourse basis to a\nthird-party financial institution. Total trade accounts receivable sold under the Company’s factoring arrangement was $57\nmillion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n• Investments\nIn May 2024, we sold our 50% interest in All3Media, an equity method investment, for proceeds of $324 million.\nUses of Cash\nOur primary uses of cash include the creation and acquisition of new content, business acquisitions, income taxes, personnel\ncosts, costs to develop and market our enhanced streaming service Max, principal and interest payments on our outstanding senior\nnotes, funding for various equity method and other investments, and repurchases of our capital stock.\n44\n• Content Acquisition\nWe plan to continue to invest significantly in the creation and acquisition of new content, as well as certain sports rights.\nContractual commitments to acquire content have not materially changed as set forth in “Material Cash Requirements\nfrom Known Contractual and Other Obligations” in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations” in our 2023 Form 10-K.\n• Debt\nFloating Rate Notes\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repaid $40 million of aggregate principal amount of our floating\nrate notes due March 2024.\nSenior Notes\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased or repaid $5,387 million of aggregate principal\namount outstanding of our senior notes. In addition, we have $296 million of senior notes coming due in November 2024,\nand an additional $2,749 million of senior notes coming due through September 30, 2025.\nWe may from time to time seek to prepay, retire or purchase our other outstanding indebtedness through prepayments,\nredemptions, open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers or otherwise. Any such repurchases\nor exchanges will be dependent upon several factors, including our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, general\nmarket conditions, as well as applicable regulatory, legal and accounting factors. Whether or not we repurchase or\nexchange any debt and the size and timing of any such repurchases or exchanges will be determined at our discretion.\n• Capital Expenditures\nWe effected capital expenditures of $662 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, including amounts\ncapitalized to support Max. In addition, we expect to continue to incur significant costs to develop and market Max.\n• Investments and Business Combinations\nOur uses of cash have included investments in equity method investments and equity investments without readily\ndeterminable fair value. (See Note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) We also provide funding to\nour investees from time to time. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we contributed $104 million for\ninvestments in and advances to our investees.\n• Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest and Noncontrolling Interest\nWe had redeemable equity balances of $117 million at September 30, 2024, which may require the use of cash in the\nevent holders of noncontrolling interests put their interests to us. Distributions to noncontrolling interests and redeemable\nnoncontrolling interests totaled $172 million and $282 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively.\n• Income Taxes and Interest\nWe expect to continue to make payments for income taxes and interest on our outstanding senior notes. During the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, we made cash payments of $832 million and $1,873 million for income taxes and\ninterest on our outstanding debt, respectively.\nCash Flows\nThe following table presents changes in cash and cash equivalents (in millions).\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, beginning of period $ 4,319 $ 3,930\nCash provided by operating activities 2,660 3,899\nCash used in investing activities (355) (1,025)\nCash used in financing activities (3,149) (4,308)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 15 (66)\nNet change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash (829) (1,500)\nCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, end of period $ 3,490 $ 2,430\n45\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities was $2,660 million and $3,899 million during the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to a decrease in net\nincome, excluding non-cash items, partially offset by lower net content investment in 2024. Cash flow for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 was also positively impacted by the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities was $355 million and $1,025 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023, respectively. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to fewer purchases of property and\nequipment and proceeds from the sale of investments during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used in financing activities was $3,149 million and $4,308 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023, respectively. The decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to lower net debt activity and\nlower distributions to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests, partially offset by a decrease in\nsecuritization receivables collected but not remitted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nCapital Resources\nAs of September 30, 2024, capital resources were comprised of the following (in millions).\nSeptember 30, 2024\nTotal Outstanding Unused\nCapacity Indebtedness Capacity\nCash and cash equivalents $ 3,336 $ — $ 3,336\nRevolving credit facility and commercial paper program 6,000 — 6,000\nSenior notes (a) 40,232 40,232 —\nTotal $ 49,568 $ 40,232 $ 9,336\n(a) Interest on the senior notes is paid annually or semi-annually. Our senior notes outstanding as of September 30, 2024 had interest rates that\nranged from 1.90% to 8.30% and will mature between 2024 and 2062.\nWe expect that our cash balance, cash generated from operations and availability under the Revolving Credit Agreement will\nbe sufficient to fund our cash needs for both the short-term and the long-term. Our borrowing costs and access to capital markets\ncan be affected by short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based, in part, on our\nperformance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. Credit rating agencies may continue to\nreview and adjust our ratings or outlook. For example, in August 2024, S&P revised our ratings outlook from stable to negative\nprimarily due to declines in our linear business, including as a result of the weak operating environment for linear networks.\nThe 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act features a participation exemption regime with current taxation of certain foreign income\nand imposes a mandatory repatriation toll tax on unremitted foreign earnings. Notwithstanding the U.S. taxation of these amounts,\nwe intend to continue to reinvest these funds outside of the U.S. Our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate to the\nU.S. However, if these funds were to be needed in the U.S., we would be required to accrue and pay non-U.S. taxes to repatriate\nthem. The determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liability with respect to these undistributed foreign\nearnings is not practicable.\nSummarized Guarantor Financial Information\nBasis of Presentation\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding senior notes issued by DCL, a wholly\nowned subsidiary of the Company, and guaranteed by the Company, Scripps Networks, and WMH; senior notes issued by WMH\nand guaranteed by the Company, Scripps Networks, and DCL; senior notes issued by the legacy WarnerMedia Business (not\nguaranteed); and senior notes issued by Scripps Networks (not guaranteed). (See Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated\nfinancial statements.) DCL primarily includes the Discovery Channel and TLC networks in the U.S. DCL is a wholly owned\nsubsidiary of the Company. Scripps Networks is also wholly owned by the Company.\n46\nThe tables below present the summarized financial information as combined for Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (the “Parent”),\nScripps Networks, DCL, and WMH (collectively, the “Obligors”). All guarantees of DCL and WMH’s senior notes (the “Note\nGuarantees”) are full and unconditional, joint and several and unsecured, and cover all payment obligations arising under the senior\nnotes.\nNote Guarantees issued by Scripps Networks, DCL or WMH, or any subsidiary of the Parent that in the future issues a Note\nGuarantee (each, a “Subsidiary Guarantor”) may be released and discharged (i) concurrently with any direct or indirect sale or\ndisposition of such Subsidiary Guarantor or any interest therein, (ii) at any time that such Subsidiary Guarantor is released from all\nof its obligations under its guarantee of payment, (iii) upon the merger or consolidation of any Subsidiary Guarantor with and into\nDCL, WMH or the Parent or another Subsidiary Guarantor, as applicable, or upon the liquidation of such Subsidiary Guarantor and\n(iv) other customary events constituting a discharge of the Obligors’ obligations.\nSummarized Financial Information\nThe Company has included the accompanying summarized combined financial information of the Obligors after the\nelimination of intercompany transactions and balances among the Obligors and the elimination of equity in earnings from and\ninvestments in any subsidiary of the Parent that is a non-guarantor (in millions).\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nCurrent assets $ 786 $ 1,539\nNon-guarantor intercompany trade receivables, net 259 336\nNoncurrent assets 4,109 5,709\nCurrent liabilities 3,771 2,847\nNoncurrent liabilities 37,535 42,157\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024\nRevenues $ 1,433\nOperating income 61\nNet income (619)\nNet income available to Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (573)\nMATERIAL CASH REQUIREMENTS FROM KNOWN CONTRACTUAL AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into commitments for the purchase of goods or services that require us to make\npayments or provide funding in the event certain circumstances occur. Contractual commitments have not materially changed as\nset forth in “Material Cash Requirements from Known Contractual and Other Obligations” in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion\nand Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2023 Form 10-K.\nRELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into transactions with related parties, primarily the Liberty Group and our equity\nmethod investees. (See Note 14 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur critical accounting estimates have not changed since December 31, 2023. For a discussion of each of our critical\naccounting estimates, including information and analysis of estimates and assumptions involved in their application, see “Critical\nAccounting Estimates” included in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations” in our 2023 Form 10-K.\nNEW ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nNo new accounting and reporting standards were adopted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. (See Note 1 to\nthe accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\n47\nCAUTIONARY NOTE CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nCertain statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the\nPrivate Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding our business, marketing and operating strategies,\nintegration of acquired businesses, new product and service offerings, financial prospects and anticipated sources and uses of\ncapital. Words such as “anticipate,” “assume,” “believe,” “continue,” “estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “future,” “intend,” “plan,”\n“potential,” “predict,” “project,” “strategy,” “target” and similar terms, and future or conditional tense verbs like “could,” “may,”\n“might,” “should,” “will” and “would,” among other terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future\noperating or financial performance identify forward-looking statements. Where, in any forward-looking statement, we express an\nexpectation or belief as to future results or events, such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and believed to have a\nreasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that the expectation or belief will result or be accomplished. The following is a list\nof some, but not all, of the factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated:\n• more intense competitive pressure from existing or new competitors in the industries in which we operate;\n• reduced spending on domestic and foreign television advertising, due to macroeconomic, industry or consumer behavior\ntrends or unexpected reductions in our number of subscribers;\n• uncertainties associated with product and service development and market acceptance, including the development and\nprovision of programming for new television and telecommunications technologies, and the success of our streaming\nservices;\n• market demand for foreign first-run and existing content libraries;\n• negative publicity or damage to our brands, reputation or talent;\n• realizing direct-to-consumer subscriber goals;\n• industry trends, including the timing of, and spending on, sports programming, feature film, television and television\ncommercial production;\n• the possibility or duration of an industry-wide strike, such as the strikes of the WGA and SAG-AFTRA in 2023, player\nlock-outs or other job action affecting a major entertainment industry union, athletes or others involved in the\ndevelopment and production of our sports programming, television programming, feature films and interactive\nentertainment (e.g., games) who are covered by collective bargaining agreements;\n• disagreements with our distributors or other business partners;\n• continued consolidation of distribution customers and production studios;\n• potential unknown liabilities, adverse consequences or unforeseen increased expenses associated with the WarnerMedia\nBusiness or our efforts to integrate the WarnerMedia Business;\n• adverse outcomes of legal proceedings or disputes, including those related to our acquisition of the WarnerMedia\nBusiness;\n• changes in, or failure or inability to comply with, laws and government regulations, including, without limitation,\nregulations of the Federal Communications Commission and similar authorities internationally and data privacy\nregulations and adverse outcomes from regulatory proceedings;\n• inherent uncertainties involved in the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of financial forecasts;\n• our level of debt, including the significant indebtedness incurred in connection with the acquisition of the WarnerMedia\nBusiness, and our future compliance with debt covenants;\n• changes to our corporate or debt-specific credit ratings or outlook;\n• threatened or actual cyber-attacks and cybersecurity breaches;\n• theft of our content and unauthorized duplication, distribution and exhibition of such content; and\n• general economic and business conditions, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, global events such as\npandemics, and political unrest in the international markets in which we operate.\n48\nThese risks have the potential to impact the recoverability of the assets recorded on our balance sheets, including goodwill\nand other intangibles. Management’s expectations and assumptions, and the continued validity of any forward-looking statements\nwe make, cannot be foreseen with certainty and are subject to change due to a broad range of factors affecting the U.S. and global\neconomies and regulatory environments, factors specific to Warner Bros. Discovery, and other factors described under Part I, Item\n1A, “Risk Factors,” in our 2023 Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” in our Form 10-Q for the quarters-ended March\n31, 2024, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2024. These forward-looking statements and such risks, uncertainties, and other\nfactors speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to disseminate\nany updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained herein, to reflect any change in our expectations with regard\nthereto, or any other change in events, conditions, or circumstances on which any such statement is based.\nITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nQuantitative and qualitative disclosures about our existing market risk are set forth in Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative\nDisclosures About Market Risk,” in the 2023 Form 10-K. Our exposures to market risk have not materially changed since\nDecember 31, 2023.\nITEM 4. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the\neffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,”\nas defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), means\ncontrols and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in\nthe reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods\nspecified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures\ndesigned to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange\nAct is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial\nofficers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable\nassurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship\nof possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024,\nour Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures\nwere effective.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as\ndefined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f), that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting.\n49\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1. Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, in the normal course of its operations, the Company is subject to various litigation matters and claims,\nincluding claims related to employees, stockholders, vendors, other business partners, government regulations, or intellectual\nproperty, as well as disputes and matters involving counterparties to contractual agreements, such as disputes arising out of\ndefinitive agreements entered into in connection with the Merger. A determination as to the amount of the accrual required for such\ncontingencies is highly subjective and requires judgment about future events. The Company may not currently be able to estimate\nthe reasonably possible loss or range of loss for certain matters until developments in such matters have provided sufficient\ninformation to support an assessment of such loss. In the absence of sufficient information to support an assessment of the\nreasonably possible loss or range of loss, no accrual for such contingencies is made and no loss or range of loss is disclosed. (See\nNote 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) Although the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with\ncertainty and the impact of the final resolution of these matters on the Company’s results of operations in a particular subsequent\nreporting period is not known, management does not currently believe that the resolution of these matters will have a material\nadverse effect on the Company’s future consolidated financial position, future results of operations, or cash flows.\nBetween September 23, 2022 and October 24, 2022, two purported class action lawsuits (Collinsville Police Pension Board v.\nDiscovery, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-08171; Todorovski v. Discovery, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-09125) were filed in the\nUnited States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaints named Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.,\nDiscovery, Inc., David Zaslav, and Gunnar Wiedenfels as defendants. The complaints generally alleged that the defendants made\nfalse and misleading statements in SEC filings and in certain public statements relating to the Merger, in violation of Sections 11,\n12(a)(2), and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and sought damages and other relief. On November 4, 2022, the court\nconsolidated the Collinsville and Todorovski complaints under case number 1:22-CV-8171, and on December 12, 2022, the court\nappointed lead plaintiffs and lead counsel. On February 15, 2023, the lead plaintiffs filed an amended complaint adding Advance/\nNewhouse Partnership, Advance/Newhouse Programming Partnership, Steven A. Miron, Robert J. Miron, and Steven O.\nNewhouse as defendants. The amended complaint asserted violations of Sections 11, 12(a)(2), and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933,\nas amended, and sought damages and other relief. On February 5, 2024, the court dismissed the amended complaint with prejudice.\nOn March 4, 2024, plaintiffs filed an appeal. On November 1, 2024, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit\naffirmed the February 5, 2024 judgment.\nITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nInvestors should carefully review and consider the information regarding certain factors that could materially affect our\nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows as set forth under Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” of the\nCompany’s 2023 Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A “Risk Factors” of the Company’s Form 10-Q for the quarter-ended March 31,\n2024 and Form 10-Q for the quarter-ended June 30, 2024. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we\ncurrently believe not to be material may also adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial position, and cash\nflows.\n50\nITEM 6.

          "content": "Merger with the WarnerMedia Business of AT&T\nOn April 8, 2022, Discovery, Inc. (“Discovery”) completed its merger (the “Merger”) with the WarnerMedia business of AT&T Inc. (the “WarnerMedia Business”) and changed its\nname to “Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.” (“Warner Bros. Discovery”, “WBD”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”).\nPurpose of Trending Schedules\nThe trending schedules summarize unaudited pro forma combined financial information to facilitate your review and understanding of the Company’s operating results. The\ntrending schedules set forth important financial measures utilized by the Company defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The Company uses\nnon-GAAP financial measures, among other measures, to evaluate the operating performance of our business. These non-GAAP financial measures are in addition to, not a\nsubstitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nPro Forma Combined Financial Information\nThe unaudited pro forma combined financial information in the trending schedules presents the combined results of the Company and the WarnerMedia Business as if the\nMerger had been completed on January 1, 2021. Our Networks, DTC (as defined below), Studios and Corporate and Intersegment-eliminations pro forma financial information\nis based on the historical operating results and includes adjustments in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X to illustrate the effects of the Merger as if it had occurred\non January 1, 2021. The unaudited pro forma combined financial information is presented for informational purposes and is not indicative of the results of operations that\nwould have been achieved if the Merger had occurred on January 1, 2021, nor is it indicative of future results.\nThe unaudited pro forma financial information includes, where applicable, adjustments for (i) additional costs of revenues from the fair value step-up of film and television\nlibrary, (ii) additional amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets, (iii) additional depreciation expense from the fair value of property and equipment, (iv)\ntransaction costs and other one-time non-recurring costs, (v) additional interest expense for borrowings related to the Merger and amortization associated with fair value\nadjustments of debt assumed, (vi) changes to align accounting policies, (vii) elimination of intercompany activity, and (viii) associated tax-related impacts of adjustments.\nThese pro forma adjustments are based on available information as of the date hereof and upon assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable to reflect the impact\nof the Merger with the WarnerMedia Business on the Company's historical financial information on a supplemental pro forma basis. Adjustments do not include costs related to\nintegration activities, cost savings or synergies that have been or may be achieved by the combined business.\nReporting Segments\nIn connection with the Merger, the Company reevaluated and changed its segment presentation during the quarter ended June 30, 2022. Accordingly, beginning in the quarter\nended June 30, 2022, and for all periods presented, we are reporting results based on the following segments:\nNetworks, consisting primarily of our domestic and international television networks\nDirect-to-Consumer (\"DTC\"), consisting primarily of our premium pay TV and digital content services\nStudios, consisting primarily of the production and release of feature films for initial exhibition in theaters and/or on our DTC services, production and initial licensing\nof television programs to third party and our networks/DTC services, distribution of our films and television programs to various third party and internal television and\nstreaming services, distribution through the home entertainment market (physical and digital), related consumer products and themed experience licensing, and\ninteractive gaming.\nFinancial Measures\nWarner Bros. Discovery previously used the non-GAAP measure of Adjusted OIBDA as an important financial measure, among other measures, to evaluate the operating\nperformance of our business. Adjusted OIBDA was defined as operating income excluding: (i) employee share-based compensation, (ii) depreciation and\namortization, (iii) restructuring and other charges, (iv) certain impairment charges, (v) gains and losses on business and asset dispositions, (vi) certain inter-segment\neliminations related to production studios, (vii) third-party transaction and integration costs, and (viii) other items impacting comparability.\nBeginning with the period ended June 30, 2022, and for all periods presented, Warner Bros. Discovery will utilize the non-GAAP measure of Adjusted EBITDA, as defined\nbelow and in the Notes & Definitions section as an important financial measure, among other measures, to evaluate the operating performance of our business.\nThe Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as operating income excluding: (i) employee share-based compensation, (ii) depreciation and amortization, (iii) restructuring and\nfacility consolidation, (iv) certain impairment charges, (v) gains and losses on business and asset dispositions, (vi) third-party transaction and integration costs, (vii)\namortization of purchase accounting fair value step-up for content, (viii) amortization of capitalized interest for content, and (ix) other items impacting comparability. Adjusted\nEBITDA should be considered in addition to, but not a substitute for, operating income, net income and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with\nU.S. GAAP.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, this communication may also contain certain non-GAAP financial measures, identified with an \"(*)\".\nReconciliations between the non-GAAP financial measures and the closest GAAP financial measures are available in the trending schedules and in the \"Quarterly Results\"\nsection of the Warner Bros.

Adjusted EBITDA - The Company evaluates the operating performance of its operating segments based on financial measures such as revenues and Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as operating\nincome excluding: (i) employee share-based compensation, (ii) depreciation and amortization, (iii) restructuring and facility consolidation, (iv) certain impairment charges, (v) gains and losses on business and asset\ndispositions, (vi) third-party transaction and integration costs, (vii) amortization of purchase accounting fair value step-up for content, (viii) amortization of capitalized interest for content, and (ix) other items impacting\ncomparability.\nThe Company uses this measure to assess the operating results and performance of its segments, perform analytical comparisons, identify strategies to improve performance, and allocate resources to each segment.\nThe Company believes Adjusted EBITDA is relevant to investors because it allows them to analyze the operating performance of each segment using the same metric management uses. The Company excludes\nemployee share-based compensation, restructuring, certain impairment charges, gains and losses on business and asset dispositions, and transaction and integration costs from the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA due\nto their impact on comparability between periods. Integration costs include transformative system implementations and integrations, such as Enterprise Resource Planning systems, and may take several years to\ncomplete. The Company also excludes the depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets, amortization of purchase accounting fair value step-up for content, and amortization of capitalized interest\nfor content, as these amounts do not represent cash payments in the current reporting period. Certain corporate expenses and inter-segment eliminations related to production studios are excluded from segment\nresults to enable executive management to evaluate segment performance based upon the decisions of segment executives. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, but not a substitute for, operating\nincome, net income, and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We prospectively updated certain corporate allocations at the beginning of 2024. The impact to prior periods\nwas immaterial.\n2). Average Revenue Per Subscriber (\"ARPU\") - The Company defines DTC Average Revenue Per User (\"ARPU\") as total subscription revenue plus net advertising revenue for the period divided by the daily\naverage number of paying subscribers for the period. Where daily values are not available, the sum of beginning of period and end of period divided by two is used.\nExcluded from the ARPU calculation are: (i) Revenue and subscribers for DTC products, other than discovery+, HBO, HBO Max, Max, a Premium Sports Product, and independently-branded, regional products\n(currently consisting of TVN/Player and BluTV), that may be offered by us or by certain joint venture partners or affiliated parties from time to time; (ii) A limited amount of international discovery+ revenue and\nsubscribers that are part of non-strategic partnerships or short-term arrangements as may be identified by the Company from time to time; (iii) Cinemax, Max/HBO hotel and bulk institution (i.e., subscribers billed on a\nbulk basis), and international basic HBO revenue and subscribers; and (iv) Users on free trials who convert to a subscription for which we have recognized subscription revenue within the first seven days of the\ncalendar month immediately following the month in which their free trial expires.\n3). Direct-to-Consumer (\"DTC\") subscriber - The Company defines a “Core DTC Subscription” as: (i) a retail subscription to discovery+, HBO, HBO Max, Max, or a Premium Sports Product (defined below) for which\nwe have recognized subscription revenue, whether directly or through a third party, from a direct-to-consumer platform; (ii) a wholesale subscription to discovery+, HBO, HBO Max, Max, or a Premium Sports Product\nfor which we have recognized subscription revenue from a fixed-fee arrangement with a third party and where the individual user has activated their subscription; (iii) a wholesale subscription to discovery+, HBO, HBO\nMax, Max, or a Premium Sports Product for which we have recognized subscription revenue on a per subscriber basis; (iv) a retail or wholesale subscription to an independently-branded, regional product sold on a\nstand-alone basis that includes discovery+, HBO, HBO Max, Max, and/or a Premium Sports Product, for which we have recognized subscription revenue (as per (i) –(iii) above); and (v) users on free trials who convert\nto a subscription for which we have recognized subscription revenue within the first seven days of the calendar month immediately following the month in which their free trial expires.\nThe Company defines a “Premium Sports Product” as a strategically prioritized, sports-focused product sold on a stand- alone basis and made available directly to consumers.\nThe current “independently-branded, regional products” referred to in (iv) above consist of TVN/Player and BluTV.\nSubscribers to multiple WBD DTC products (listed above) are counted as a paid subscriber for each individual WBD DTC product subscription.\nWe may refer to the aggregate number of Core DTC Subscriptions as “subscribers”.\nThe reported number of “subscribers” included herein and the definition of “DTC Subscription” as used herein excludes: (i) individuals who subscribe to DTC products, other than discovery+, HBO, HBO Max, Max, a\nPremium Sports Product, and independently-branded, regional products (currently consisting of TVN/Player and BluTV), that may be offered by us or by certain joint venture partners or affiliated parties from time to\ntime; (ii) a limited number of international discovery+ subscribers that are part of non-strategic partnerships or short-term arrangements as may be identified by the Company from time to time; (iii) domestic and\ninternational Cinemax subscribers, and international basic HBO subscribers; and (iv) users on free trials except for those users on free trial that convert to a DTC Subscription within the first seven days of the next\nmonth as noted above.\nDomestic subscriber - We define a Domestic subscriber as a subscription based either in the United States of America or Canada.\nInternational subscriber - We define an International subscriber as a subscription based outside of the United States of America or Canada.\n4). Free Cash Flow - The Company defines free cash flow as cash flow from operations less acquisitions of property and equipment. The Company believes free cash flow is an important indicator for management and\ninvestors of the Company’s liquidity, including its ability to reduce debt, make strategic investments, and return capital to stockholders.\nFor the period ended March 31, 2022 (3/31/22), Reported Free Cash Flow represents standalone Discovery, Inc.

Discovery\n5). Gross Debt - The Company defines gross debt as total debt plus finance leases. The Company uses gross debt to monitor and evaluate the Company's overall liquidity, financial flexibility and leverage. The\nCompany believes this measure is relevant to investors as it is a financial measure frequently used in evaluating a company's financial condition.\n6). Net Debt - The Company defines net debt as total debt plus finance leases less cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash. The Company uses net debt to monitor and evaluate the Company's overall liquidity,\nfinancial flexibility and leverage. The Company believes this measure is relevant to investors as it is a financial measure frequently used in evaluating a company's financial condition.\n7).
