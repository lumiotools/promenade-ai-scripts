Inventory at the end of the third quarter of 2024 was $85.9 million, compared to $95.9 million at December 31, 2023. Long-term debt, net of current portion and deferred debt issuance costs was $645.0 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $649.0 million as of December 31, 2023.\n\n**Fiscal Year 2024 Guidance**\n\nThe Company updated its guidance for net sales, adjusted net income and adjusted EBITDA for fiscal year 2024, as set forth below.\n\n**(Dollars in millions)** | **Prior Fiscal Year 2024 Guidance** | **Updated Fiscal Year 2024 Guidance**  \n---|---|---  \nNet Sales | $435-$463 | $405-$415  \nAdjusted Net Income* | $87-$100 | $67-$73  \nAdjusted EBITDA* | $143-$159 | $121-$127  \n  \nThe fiscal year 2024 net sales, adjusted net income and adjusted EBITDA guidance are approximations and are based on the Company’s plans and assumptions for the relevant period, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\n  * Net Sales: \n    * The Company's updated net sales guidance reflects three primary factors: \n      * First, the Company anticipates weaker performance from its international business resulting from the Company's actions to simplify and further realign its distribution network in an effort to strengthen its international sales operations, as well as the Company's limited approach to international marketing that is expected to lead to softer demand.\n      * Second, while the Company believes that sell-through on an absolute dollar basis at U.S. key accounts is largely consistent with trends throughout the year, the business is not yet experiencing the level of lift in demand from the deployment of new sales and marketing investments that the Company previously anticipated.\n      * Third, the Company anticipates increased promotional activity during the holiday period across geographies relative to its previous assumption.\n  * Adjusted Gross Profit Margin: \n    * The Company anticipates adjusted gross profit margin* in the range of 70.9% to 71.6% compared to its prior assumption of 72.5% to 73.1% in fiscal year 2024.\n    * The Company expects that adjusted gross profit margin will be lower than previously anticipated primarily due to greater deleverage from lower sales volumes on its fixed warehousing costs, as well as additional promotional activity expected during the fourth quarter of 2024.\n  * Adjusted SG&A: \n    * The Company expects adjusted SG&A* in the range of $167 million to $170 million in fiscal year 2024 compared to its prior assumption of $172 million to $179 million.\n    * The Company anticipates that adjusted SG&A will be lower than previously expected primarily due to a reduction in fiscal year 2024 non-payroll-related advertising and marketing expenses compared to its previous assumption.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA Margin: \n    * The Company now expects adjusted EBITDA margin* in the range of 29.9% to 30.6% for fiscal year 2024, compared to prior assumption of 32.8% to 34.3%.\n    * The Company now expects more adjusted EBITDA margin deleverage as compared to the prior fiscal year 2024 assumption due to its lower net sales forecast against expectations for continued investment in operating expenses.\n  * Net Interest Expense: \n    * The Company now expects net interest expense to be approximately $34 million during fiscal year 2024, compared to its previous assumption of $32 million to $34 million.\n  * Adjusted Effective Tax Rate: \n    * The Company now expects an adjusted effective tax rate* of approximately 19.5% for fiscal year 2024, compared to its previous assumption of 19.5% to 20.5%.\n\n\n\n_*Adjusted net income, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted gross profit margin, adjusted SG &A, adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted effective tax rate are non-GAAP financial measures. See “Disclosure Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for additional information._\n\n**Webcast and Conference Call Information**\n\nThe Company plans to host an investor conference call and webcast to review third quarter 2024 financial results at 9:00am ET/6:00am PT on November 7, 2024.

Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, the Company’s actual results, performance or achievements may vary materially from those described in this press release as anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended, planned or projected. The forward-looking statements in this press release represent management’s views as of the date hereof. Unless required by law, the Company neither intends nor assumes any obligation to update these forward-looking statements for any reason after the date hereof to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in the Company’s expectations or otherwise.\n\n**Disclosure Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nIn addition to the financial measures presented in this release in accordance with GAAP, the Company has included certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income, adjusted effective tax rate, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross profit margin, adjusted SG&A and adjusted basic and diluted EPS. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the Company’s financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s operating performance and facilitate internal comparisons of its historical operating performance on a more consistent basis by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of its business, results of operations or outlook. In particular, management believes that the use of these non-GAAP measures may be helpful to investors as they are measures used by management in assessing the health of the Company’s business, determining incentive compensation and evaluating its operating performance, as well as for internal planning and forecasting purposes.\n\nThe Company calculates adjusted EBITDA as net income, adjusted to exclude: (1) interest expense, net; (2) income tax provision; (3) depreciation and amortization; (4) share-based compensation expense; (5) non-ordinary inventory adjustments; (6) non-ordinary costs and fees; (7) non-ordinary legal costs; and (8) Tax Receivable Agreement liability adjustments. The Company calculates adjusted EBITDA margin by dividing adjusted EBITDA by net sales. The Company calculates adjusted net income as net income, adjusted to exclude: (1) amortization of intangible assets (excluding software); (2) non-ordinary costs and fees; (3) non-ordinary legal costs; (4) non-ordinary inventory adjustments; (5) share-based compensation expense; (6) Tax Receivable Agreement liability adjustments; and (7) tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments. The Company calculates adjusted effective tax rate as effective income tax rate, adjusted to exclude the tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments referenced in item (7) of the immediately preceding sentence. The Company calculates adjusted gross profit as gross profit, adjusted to exclude: (1) non-ordinary inventory adjustments and (2) amortization of patented formulations. The Company calculates adjusted gross profit margin by dividing adjusted gross profit by net sales. The Company calculates adjusted SG&A as SG&A, adjusted to exclude: (1) share-based compensation expense; (2) non-ordinary legal costs; and (3) non-ordinary costs and fees. The Company calculates adjusted basic and diluted EPS as adjusted net income divided by weighted average basic and diluted shares outstanding, respectively. Please refer to \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP Equivalents\" located in the financial supplement in this release for further information regarding these adjustments for the periods presented.\n\nPlease refer to \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP Equivalents\" located in the financial supplement in this release for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP metrics to their most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP.\n\nThis release includes forward-looking guidance for adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income, adjusted gross profit margin, adjusted effective tax rate and adjusted SG&A. The Company is not able to provide, without unreasonable effort, a reconciliation of the guidance for adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income, adjusted gross profit margin, adjusted effective tax rate and adjusted SG&A to the most directly comparable GAAP measure because the Company does not currently have sufficient data to accurately estimate the variables and individual adjustments included in the most directly comparable GAAP measure that would be necessary for such reconciliations, including (a) income tax related accruals in respect of certain one-time items, (b) costs related to potential debt or equity transactions, and (c) other non-recurring expenses that cannot reasonably be estimated in advance. These adjustments are inherently variable and uncertain and depend on various factors that are beyond the Company's control and as a result it is also unable to predict their probable significance. Therefore, because management cannot estimate on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort the impact these variables and individual adjustments will have on its reported results in accordance with GAAP, it is unable to provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures included in its fiscal year 2024 guidance.\n\n**CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS**\n\n_(amounts in thousands, except per share and share data)_\n\n_(Unaudited)_\n\n**September 30, 2024** | **December 31, 2023**  \n---|---  \n**Assets**  \nCurrent Assets:  \nCash and cash equivalents | $ | 538,829 | $ | 466,400  \nAccounts receivable, net of allowances of $21,309 and $21,465 | 34,886 | 40,921  \nInventory | 85,907 | 95,922  \nOther current assets | 10,090 | 9,953  \nTotal current assets | 669,712 | 613,196  \nProperty and equipment, net | 1,238 | 930  \nIntangible assets, net | 911,477 | 947,714  \nGoodwill | 168,300 | 168,300  \nOther assets | 8,430 | 10,198  \nTotal assets | $ | 1,759,157 | $ | 1,740,338  \n**Liabilities and stockholders’ equity**  \nCurrent Liabilities:  \nAccounts payable | $ | 11,356 | $ | 7,073  \nSales and income taxes payable | 5,654 | 9,067  \nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities | 19,797 | 20,576  \nCurrent portion of long-term debt | 6,750 | 6,750  \nCurrent portion of Related Party payable pursuant to Tax Receivable Agreement | 13,006 | 12,675  \nTotal current liabilities | 56,563 | 56,141  \nLong-term debt | 645,040 | 649,023  \nDeferred tax liabilities | 3,636 | 3,016  \nRelated Party payable pursuant to Tax Receivable Agreement | 172,390 | 185,496  \nOther liabilities | 1,798 | 1,694  \nTotal liabilities | 879,427 | 895,370  \nContingencies  \nStockholders’ equity:  \nCommon stock, $0.001 par value per share; 2,000,000,000 shares authorized, 662,479,324 and 660,731,935 shares issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively | 662 | 671  \nPreferred stock, $0.001 par value per share; 25,000,000 shares authorized and no shares issued and outstanding | — | —  \nAdditional paid-in capital | 325,288 | 316,489  \nAccumulated other comprehensive (loss) income | (985 | ) | 1,365  \nRetained earnings | 554,765 | 526,443  \nTotal stockholders’ equity | 879,730 | 844,968  \nTotal liabilities and stockholders’ equity | $ | 1,759,157 | $ | 1,740,338  \n  \n**CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME**\n\n_(amounts in thousands, except per share and share data)_\n\n_(Unaudited)_\n\n**Three Months EndedSeptember 30,** | **Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \nNet sales | $ | 119,080 | $ | 123,555 | $ | 321,929 | $ | 346,583  \nCost of sales:  \nCost of product (excluding amortization) | 34,781 | 37,415 | 89,361 | 98,431  \nAmortization of patented formulations | 2,565 | 2,592 | 7,054 | 6,298  \nTotal cost of sales | 37,346 | 40,007 | 96,415 | 104,729  \nGross profit | 81,734 | 83,548 | 225,514 | 241,854  \nOperating expenses:  \nSelling, general, and administrative | 42,956 | 36,433 | 128,816 | 119,770  \nAmortization of other intangible assets | 10,782 | 10,378 | 32,807 | 31,025  \nTotal operating expenses | 53,738 | 46,811 | 161,623 | 150,795  \nOperating income | 27,996 | 36,737 | 63,891 | 91,059  \nInterest expense | (15,610 | ) | (14,692 | ) | (44,708 | ) | (43,283 | )  \nInterest income | 6,605 | 5,182 | 19,067 | 13,024  \nOther income (expense), net | 670 | (970 | ) | (541 | ) | (1,328 | )  \nIncome before provision for income taxes | 19,661 | 26,257 | 37,709 | 59,472  \nIncome tax provision | 4,864 | 5,891 | 9,387 | 11,986  \nNet income | $ | 14,797 | $ | 20,366 | $ | 28,322 | $ | 47,486  \nNet income per share:  \nBasic | $ | 0.02 | $ | 0.03 | $ | 0.04 | $ | 0.07  \nDiluted | $ | 0.02 | $ | 0.03 | $ | 0.04 | $ | 0.07  \nWeighted average common shares outstanding:  \nBasic | 662,248,231 | 654,702,392 | 661,586,351 | 653,603,665  \nDiluted | 666,151,359 | 678,758,020 | 664,723,301 | 681,089,543  \nOther comprehensive (loss) income:  \nUnrealized (loss) gain on derivatives, net of income tax effect | $ | (906 | ) | $ | (861 | ) | $ | (2,350 | ) | $ | 229  \nTotal other comprehensive (loss) income | (906 | ) | (861 | ) | (2,350 | ) | 229  \nComprehensive income | $ | 13,891 | $ | 19,505 | $ | 25,972 | $ | 47,715  \n  \n**CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS**\n\n_(amounts in thousands)_\n\n_(Unaudited)_\n\n**Nine Months Ended****September 30,**  \n---  \n**2024** | **2023**  \nCash flows from operating activities  \nNet income | $ | 28,322 | $ | 47,486  \nAdjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities | 65,088 | 81,011  \nNet cash provided by operating activities | 93,410 | 128,497  \nNet cash used in investing activities | (3,369 | ) | (2,902 | )  \nNet cash used in financing activities | (17,612 | ) | (18,817 | )  \nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents | 72,429 | 106,778  \nCash and cash equivalents -

Inventory at the end of the second quarter of 2024 was $100.2 million, compared to $95.9 million at December 31, 2023. Long-term debt, net of current portion and deferred debt issuance costs was $646.4 million as of June 30, 2024, compared to $649.0 million as of December 31, 2023.\n\n**Fiscal Year 2024 Guidance**\n\nThe Company is reiterating guidance for net sales, adjusted net income and adjusted EBITDA for fiscal year 2024, as initially disclosed by the Company on February 29, 2024. The Company's fiscal year 2024 guidance outlined below incorporates management's expectations regarding consumer demand, and investments and actions aimed at driving sell-through, improving upon foundational capabilities, and building a healthier brand.\n\n**For Fiscal 2024:**  \n---  \n**(Dollars in millions)** | **Fiscal Year 2024** | **Fiscal Year 2023 Actual** | **% change**  \nNet Sales | $435-$463 | $458 | (5)% to 1%  \nAdjusted Net Income* | $87-$100 | $108 | (20)% to (8)%  \nAdjusted EBITDA* | $143-$159 | $174 | (18)% to (9)%  \n  \nThe fiscal year 2024 net sales, adjusted net income and adjusted EBITDA guidance are approximations and are based on the Company’s plans and assumptions for the relevant period, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\n  * Adjusted Gross Profit Margin: \n    * The Company anticipates adjusted gross profit margin* in the range of 72.5% to 73.1% in fiscal year 2024, compared to 71.4% in fiscal year 2023, due primarily to the lapping of actions taken by the Company to address excess inventory in fiscal year 2023, as well as anticipated efficiencies derived from an internal cost savings program in fiscal year 2024, which is expected to more than offset modestly higher product costs.\n  * Adjusted SG&A: \n    * The Company expects adjusted SG&A* in the range of $172 million to $179 million in fiscal year 2024, an increase of $19 million to $26 million as compared to fiscal year 2023. The increase is expected to be primarily attributable to higher sales and marketing expenses and higher organizational costs due to annualizing the expense of headcount additions made during fiscal 2023.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA Margin: \n    * The Company expects adjusted EBITDA margin* in the range of 32.8% to 34.3% for fiscal year 2024.\n  * Net Interest Expense: \n    * The Company expects net interest expense to be approximately $32 million to $34 million during fiscal year 2024.\n  * Adjusted Effective Tax Rate: \n    * The Company expects an adjusted effective tax rate* of approximately 19.5% to 20.5% for fiscal year 2024.\n\n\n\n_*Adjusted net income, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted gross profit margin, adjusted SG &A, adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted effective tax rate are non-GAAP financial __measures_ _.

Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, the Company’s actual results, performance or achievements may vary materially from those described in this press release as anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended, planned or projected. The forward-looking statements in this press release represent management’s views as of the date hereof. Unless required by law, the Company neither intends nor assumes any obligation to update these forward-looking statements for any reason after the date hereof to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in the Company’s expectations or otherwise.\n\n**Disclosure Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nIn addition to the financial measures presented in this release in accordance with GAAP, the Company has included certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income, adjusted effective tax rate, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross profit margin, adjusted SG&A and adjusted diluted EPS. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the Company’s financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s operating performance and facilitate internal comparisons of its historical operating performance on a more consistent basis by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of its business, results of operations or outlook. In particular, management believes that the use of these non-GAAP measures may be helpful to investors as they are measures used by management in assessing the health of the Company’s business, determining incentive compensation and evaluating its operating performance, as well as for internal planning and forecasting purposes.\n\nThe Company calculates adjusted EBITDA as net income, adjusted to exclude: (1) interest expense, net; (2) income tax provision; (3) depreciation and amortization; (4) share-based compensation expense; (5) non-ordinary inventory adjustments; (6) non-ordinary costs and fees; (7) non-ordinary legal costs; and (8) Tax Receivable Agreement liability adjustments. The Company calculates adjusted EBITDA margin by dividing adjusted EBITDA by net sales. The Company calculates adjusted net income as net income, adjusted to exclude: (1) amortization of intangible assets (excluding software); (2) non-ordinary costs and fees; (3) non-ordinary legal costs; (4) non-ordinary inventory adjustments; (5) share-based compensation expense; (6) Tax Receivable Agreement liability adjustment; and (7) tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments. The Company calculates adjusted effective tax rate as effective income tax rate, adjusted to exclude the tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments referenced in item (7) of the immediately preceding sentence. The Company calculates adjusted gross profit as gross profit, adjusted to exclude: (1) non-ordinary inventory adjustments and (2) amortization of patented formulations pertaining to the acquisition of the Olaplex, LLC business in 2020 by certain investment funds affiliated with Advent International, L.P. and other investors (the \"Acquisition\"). The Company calculates adjusted gross profit margin by dividing adjusted gross profit by net sales. The Company calculates adjusted SG&A as SG&A, adjusted to exclude: (1) share-based compensation expense; (2) non-ordinary legal costs; and (3) non-ordinary costs and fees. The Company calculates adjusted basic and diluted EPS as adjusted net income divided by weighted average basic and diluted shares outstanding, respectively. Please refer to \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP Equivalents\" located in the financial supplement in this release for further information regarding these adjustments for the periods presented.\n\nPlease refer to \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP Equivalents\" located in the financial supplement in this release for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP metrics to their most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP.\n\nThis release includes forward-looking guidance for adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income, adjusted gross profit margin, adjusted effective tax rate and adjusted SG&A. The Company is not able to provide, without unreasonable effort, a reconciliation of the guidance for adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income, adjusted gross profit margin, adjusted effective tax rate and adjusted SG&A to the most directly comparable GAAP measure because the Company does not currently have sufficient data to accurately estimate the variables and individual adjustments included in the most directly comparable GAAP measure that would be necessary for such reconciliations, including (a) income tax related accruals in respect of certain one-time items, (b) costs related to potential debt or equity transactions, and (c) other non-recurring expenses that cannot reasonably be estimated in advance. These adjustments are inherently variable and uncertain and depend on various factors that are beyond the Company's control and as a result it is also unable to predict their probable significance. Therefore, because management cannot estimate on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort the impact these variables and individual adjustments will have on its reported results in accordance with GAAP, it is unable to provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures included in its fiscal year 2024 guidance.\n\n**CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS**\n\n_(amounts

OLAPLEX remains an incredibly powerful brand, and we are more confident than ever in delivering consistent and sustained growth.\"\n\n**For the****third****quarter of****2024****compared to the****third****quarter of****2023****:**\n\n  * Net sales decreased 3.6% to $119.1 million; \n    * By channel: \n      * Professional decreased 12.6% to $42.2 million;\n      * Direct-To-Consumer increased 6.8% to $34.3 million;\n      * Specialty Retail decreased 1.3% to $42.6 million;\n    * Net sales decreased 3.3% in the United States and decreased 3.9% internationally;\n  * Net income decreased 27.3% and adjusted net income decreased 13.8%;\n  * Diluted EPS was $0.02 for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to $0.03 for the third quarter of 2023; and\n  * Adjusted Diluted EPS was $0.04 for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to $0.05 for the third quarter of 2023. \n\n\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Results**\n\n**(Dollars in $000’s, except per share and share data)**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n**2024** | **2023** | **% Change**  \nNet Sales | $ | 119,080 | $ | 123,555 | (3.6)%  \nGross Profit | $ | 81,734 | $ | 83,548 | (2.2)  \nGross Profit Margin | 68.6 | % | 67.6 | %  \nAdjusted Gross Profit | $ | 84,299 | $ | 86,140 | (2.1)  \nAdjusted Gross Profit Margin | 70.8 | % | 69.7 | %  \nSG&A | $ | 42,956 | $ | 36,433 | 17.9  \nAdjusted SG&A | $ | 40,440 | $ | 33,744 | 19.8  \nNet Income | $ | 14,797 | $ | 20,366 | (27.3)  \nAdjusted Net Income | $ | 28,736 | $ | 33,354 | (13.8)  \nAdjusted EBITDA | $ | 44,638 | $ | 51,540 | (13.4)  \nAdjusted EBITDA Margin | 37.5 | % | 41.7 | %  \nDiluted EPS | $ | 0.02 | $ | 0.03 | (33.3)  \nAdjusted Diluted EPS | $ | 0.04 | $ | 0.05 | (20.0)%  \nWeighted Average Diluted Shares Outstanding | 666,151,359 | 678,758,020  \n  \n**Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Results**\n\n**(Dollars in $000’s, except per share and share data)**  \n---  \n**Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n**2024** | **2023** | **% Change**  \nNet Sales | $ | 321,929 | $ | 346,583 | (7.1)%  \nGross Profit | $ | 225,514 | $ | 241,854 | (6.8)  \nGross Profit Margin | 70.1 | % | 69.8 | %  \nAdjusted Gross Profit | $ | 232,568 | $ | 248,176 | (6.3)  \nAdjusted Gross Profit Margin | 72.2 | % | 71.6 | %  \nSG&A | $ | 128,816 | $ | 119,770 | 7.6  \nAdjusted SG&A | $ | 120,244 | $ | 108,924 | 10.4  \nNet Income | $ | 28,322 | $ | 47,486 | (40.4)  \nAdjusted Net Income | $ | 68,083 | $ | 85,975 | (20.8)  \nAdjusted EBITDA | $ | 112,176 | $ | 138,267 | (18.9)  \nAdjusted EBITDA Margin | 34.8 | % | 39.9 | %  \nDiluted EPS | $ | 0.04 | $ | 0.07 | (42.9)  \nAdjusted Diluted EPS | $ | 0.10 | $ | 0.13 | (23.1)%  \nWeighted Average Diluted Shares Outstanding | 664,723,301 | 681,089,543  \n  \nAdjusted gross profit, adjusted gross profit margin, adjusted SG&A, adjusted net income, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, and adjusted diluted EPS are measures that are not calculated or presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\").

Inventory at the end of the third quarter of 2024 was $85.9 million, compared to $95.9 million at December 31, 2023. Long-term debt, net of current portion and deferred debt issuance costs was $645.0 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $649.0 million as of December 31, 2023.\n\n**Fiscal Year 2024 Guidance**\n\nThe Company updated its guidance for net sales, adjusted net income and adjusted EBITDA for fiscal year 2024, as set forth below.\n\n**(Dollars in millions)** | **Prior Fiscal Year 2024 Guidance** | **Updated Fiscal Year 2024 Guidance**  \n---|---|---  \nNet Sales | $435-$463 | $405-$415  \nAdjusted Net Income* | $87-$100 | $67-$73  \nAdjusted EBITDA* | $143-$159 | $121-$127  \n  \nThe fiscal year 2024 net sales, adjusted net income and adjusted EBITDA guidance are approximations and are based on the Company’s plans and assumptions for the relevant period, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\n  * Net Sales: \n    * The Company's updated net sales guidance reflects three primary factors: \n      * First, the Company anticipates weaker performance from its international business resulting from the Company's actions to simplify and further realign its distribution network in an effort to strengthen its international sales operations, as well as the Company's limited approach to international marketing that is expected to lead to softer demand.\n      * Second, while the Company believes that sell-through on an absolute dollar basis at U.S. key accounts is largely consistent with trends throughout the year, the business is not yet experiencing the level of lift in demand from the deployment of new sales and marketing investments that the Company previously anticipated.\n      * Third, the Company anticipates increased promotional activity during the holiday period across geographies relative to its previous assumption.\n  * Adjusted Gross Profit Margin: \n    * The Company anticipates adjusted gross profit margin* in the range of 70.9% to 71.6% compared to its prior assumption of 72.5% to 73.1% in fiscal year 2024.\n    * The Company expects that adjusted gross profit margin will be lower than previously anticipated primarily due to greater deleverage from lower sales volumes on its fixed warehousing costs, as well as additional promotional activity expected during the fourth quarter of 2024.\n  * Adjusted SG&A: \n    * The Company expects adjusted SG&A* in the range of $167 million to $170 million in fiscal year 2024 compared to its prior assumption of $172 million to $179 million.\n    * The Company anticipates that adjusted SG&A will be lower than previously expected primarily due to a reduction in fiscal year 2024 non-payroll-related advertising and marketing expenses compared to its previous assumption.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA Margin: \n    * The Company now expects adjusted EBITDA margin* in the range of 29.9% to 30.6% for fiscal year 2024, compared to prior assumption of 32.8% to 34.3%.\n    * The Company now expects more adjusted EBITDA margin deleverage as compared to the prior fiscal year 2024 assumption due to its lower net sales forecast against expectations for continued investment in operating expenses.\n  * Net Interest Expense: \n    * The Company now expects net interest expense to be approximately $34 million during fiscal year 2024, compared to its previous assumption of $32 million to $34 million.\n  * Adjusted Effective Tax Rate: \n    * The Company now expects an adjusted effective tax rate* of approximately 19.5% for fiscal year 2024, compared to its previous assumption of 19.5% to 20.5%.\n\n\n\n_*Adjusted net income, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted gross profit margin, adjusted SG &A, adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted effective tax rate are non-GAAP financial measures. See “Disclosure Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for additional information._\n\n**Webcast and Conference Call Information**\n\nThe Company plans to host an investor conference call and webcast to review third quarter 2024 financial results at 9:00am ET/6:00am PT on November 7, 2024.

Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, the Company’s actual results, performance or achievements may vary materially from those described in this press release as anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended, planned or projected. The forward-looking statements in this press release represent management’s views as of the date hereof. Unless required by law, the Company neither intends nor assumes any obligation to update these forward-looking statements for any reason after the date hereof to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in the Company’s expectations or otherwise.\n\n**Disclosure Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nIn addition to the financial measures presented in this release in accordance with GAAP, the Company has included certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income, adjusted effective tax rate, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross profit margin, adjusted SG&A and adjusted basic and diluted EPS. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the Company’s financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s operating performance and facilitate internal comparisons of its historical operating performance on a more consistent basis by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of its business, results of operations or outlook. In particular, management believes that the use of these non-GAAP measures may be helpful to investors as they are measures used by management in assessing the health of the Company’s business, determining incentive compensation and evaluating its operating performance, as well as for internal planning and forecasting purposes.\n\nThe Company calculates adjusted EBITDA as net income, adjusted to exclude: (1) interest expense, net; (2) income tax provision; (3) depreciation and amortization; (4) share-based compensation expense; (5) non-ordinary inventory adjustments; (6) non-ordinary costs and fees; (7) non-ordinary legal costs; and (8) Tax Receivable Agreement liability adjustments. The Company calculates adjusted EBITDA margin by dividing adjusted EBITDA by net sales. The Company calculates adjusted net income as net income, adjusted to exclude: (1) amortization of intangible assets (excluding software); (2) non-ordinary costs and fees; (3) non-ordinary legal costs; (4) non-ordinary inventory adjustments; (5) share-based compensation expense; (6) Tax Receivable Agreement liability adjustments; and (7) tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments. The Company calculates adjusted effective tax rate as effective income tax rate, adjusted to exclude the tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments referenced in item (7) of the immediately preceding sentence. The Company calculates adjusted gross profit as gross profit, adjusted to exclude: (1) non-ordinary inventory adjustments and (2) amortization of patented formulations. The Company calculates adjusted gross profit margin by dividing adjusted gross profit by net sales. The Company calculates adjusted SG&A as SG&A, adjusted to exclude: (1) share-based compensation expense; (2) non-ordinary legal costs; and (3) non-ordinary costs and fees. The Company calculates adjusted basic and diluted EPS as adjusted net income divided by weighted average basic and diluted shares outstanding, respectively. Please refer to \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP Equivalents\" located in the financial supplement in this release for further information regarding these adjustments for the periods presented.\n\nPlease refer to \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP Equivalents\" located in the financial supplement in this release for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP metrics to their most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP.\n\nThis release includes forward-looking guidance for adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income, adjusted gross profit margin, adjusted effective tax rate and adjusted SG&A. The Company is not able to provide, without unreasonable effort, a reconciliation of the guidance for adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income, adjusted gross profit margin, adjusted effective tax rate and adjusted SG&A to the most directly comparable GAAP measure because the Company does not currently have sufficient data to accurately estimate the variables and individual adjustments included in the most directly comparable GAAP measure that would be necessary for such reconciliations, including (a) income tax related accruals in respect of certain one-time items, (b) costs related to potential debt or equity transactions, and (c) other non-recurring expenses that cannot reasonably be estimated in advance. These adjustments are inherently variable and uncertain and depend on various factors that are beyond the Company's control and as a result it is also unable to predict their probable significance. Therefore, because management cannot estimate on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort the impact these variables and individual adjustments will have on its reported results in accordance with GAAP, it is unable to provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures included in its fiscal year 2024 guidance.\n\n**CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS**\n\n_(amounts in thousands, except per share and share data)_\n\n_(Unaudited)_\n\n**September 30, 2024** | **December 31, 2023**  \n---|---  \n**Assets**  \nCurrent Assets:  \nCash and cash equivalents | $ | 538,829 | $ | 466,400  \nAccounts receivable, net of allowances of $21,309 and $21,465 | 34,886 | 40,921  \nInventory | 85,907 | 95,922  \nOther current assets | 10,090 | 9,953  \nTotal current assets | 669,712 | 613,196  \nProperty and equipment, net | 1,238 | 930  \nIntangible assets, net | 911,477 | 947,714  \nGoodwill | 168,300 | 168,300  \nOther assets | 8,430 | 10,198  \nTotal assets | $ | 1,759,157 | $ | 1,740,338  \n**Liabilities and stockholders’ equity**  \nCurrent Liabilities:  \nAccounts payable | $ | 11,356 | $ | 7,073  \nSales and income taxes payable | 5,654 | 9,067  \nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities | 19,797 | 20,576  \nCurrent portion of long-term debt | 6,750 | 6,750  \nCurrent portion of Related Party payable pursuant to Tax Receivable Agreement | 13,006 | 12,675  \nTotal current liabilities | 56,563 | 56,141  \nLong-term debt | 645,040 | 649,023  \nDeferred tax liabilities | 3,636 | 3,016  \nRelated Party payable pursuant to Tax Receivable Agreement | 172,390 | 185,496  \nOther liabilities | 1,798 | 1,694  \nTotal liabilities | 879,427 | 895,370  \nContingencies  \nStockholders’ equity:  \nCommon stock, $0.001 par value per share; 2,000,000,000 shares authorized, 662,479,324 and 660,731,935 shares issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively | 662 | 671  \nPreferred stock, $0.001 par value per share; 25,000,000 shares authorized and no shares issued and outstanding | — | —  \nAdditional paid-in capital | 325,288 | 316,489  \nAccumulated other comprehensive (loss) income | (985 | ) | 1,365  \nRetained earnings | 554,765 | 526,443  \nTotal stockholders’ equity | 879,730 | 844,968  \nTotal liabilities and stockholders’ equity | $ | 1,759,157 | $ | 1,740,338  \n  \n**CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME**\n\n_(amounts in thousands, except per share and share data)_\n\n_(Unaudited)_\n\n**Three Months EndedSeptember 30,** | **Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \nNet sales | $ | 119,080 | $ | 123,555 | $ | 321,929 | $ | 346,583  \nCost of sales:  \nCost of product (excluding amortization) | 34,781 | 37,415 | 89,361 | 98,431  \nAmortization of patented formulations | 2,565 | 2,592 | 7,054 | 6,298  \nTotal cost of sales | 37,346 | 40,007 | 96,415 | 104,729  \nGross profit | 81,734 | 83,548 | 225,514 | 241,854  \nOperating expenses:  \nSelling, general, and administrative | 42,956 | 36,433 | 128,816 | 119,770  \nAmortization of other intangible assets | 10,782 | 10,378 | 32,807 | 31,025  \nTotal operating expenses | 53,738 | 46,811 | 161,623 | 150,795  \nOperating income | 27,996 | 36,737 | 63,891 | 91,059  \nInterest expense | (15,610 | ) | (14,692 | ) | (44,708 | ) | (43,283 | )  \nInterest income | 6,605 | 5,182 | 19,067 | 13,024  \nOther income (expense), net | 670 | (970 | ) | (541 | ) | (1,328 | )  \nIncome before provision for income taxes | 19,661 | 26,257 | 37,709 | 59,472  \nIncome tax provision | 4,864 | 5,891 | 9,387 | 11,986  \nNet income | $ | 14,797 | $ | 20,366 | $ | 28,322 | $ | 47,486  \nNet income per share:  \nBasic | $ | 0.02 | $ | 0.03 | $ | 0.04 | $ | 0.07  \nDiluted | $ | 0.02 | $ | 0.03 | $ | 0.04 | $ | 0.07  \nWeighted average common shares outstanding:  \nBasic | 662,248,231 | 654,702,392 | 661,586,351 | 653,603,665  \nDiluted | 666,151,359 | 678,758,020 | 664,723,301 | 681,089,543  \nOther comprehensive (loss) income:  \nUnrealized (loss) gain on derivatives, net of income tax effect | $ | (906 | ) | $ | (861 | ) | $ | (2,350 | ) | $ | 229  \nTotal other comprehensive (loss) income | (906 | ) | (861 | ) | (2,350 | ) | 229  \nComprehensive income | $ | 13,891 | $ | 19,505 | $ | 25,972 | $ | 47,715  \n  \n**CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS**\n\n_(amounts in thousands)_\n\n_(Unaudited)_\n\n**Nine Months Ended****September 30,**  \n---  \n**2024** | **2023**  \nCash flows from operating activities  \nNet income | $ | 28,322 | $ | 47,486  \nAdjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities | 65,088 | 81,011  \nNet cash provided by operating activities | 93,410 | 128,497  \nNet cash used in investing activities | (3,369 | ) | (2,902 | )  \nNet cash used in financing activities | (17,612 | ) | (18,817 | )  \nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents | 72,429 | 106,778  \nCash and cash equivalents -

These statements include, but are not limited to, statements about our strategies, plans, objectives, expectations, intentions, expenditures and assumptions and other statements contained in or incorporated by reference in this Quarterly Report that are not historical or current facts. When used in this document, words such as “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “intend,” “potential,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “plan,” “target,” “predict,” “project,” “forecast,” “seek” and similar expressions as they relate to us are intended to identify forward-looking statements.\n\nThe forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report reflect our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition and results of operation. Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, statements we make regarding: our financial position, sales and operating results; our business plans, strategies, investments and objectives; general economic and industry trends; our business prospects; our reputation and brand; our product technology; future product development and introduction; growth and expansion opportunities, including expansion in existing markets and into new markets; our sales channels and omnichannel strategy; legal proceedings; changes in laws and regulations; future payments under our Tax Receivable Agreement; our customer base; our supply chain and global distribution network; our information technology; our employees and culture; our operational capabilities; interest rate derivatives; and our expenses, inventory levels, other working capital, indebtedness and liquidity. Forward-looking statements are predictions based upon assumptions that may not prove to be accurate, and they are not guarantees of future performance. As such, you should not place significant reliance on our forward-looking statements. Neither we nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of the forward-looking statements, including any such statements taken from third party industry and market reports.\n\nForward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, inherent uncertainties and other factors that are difficult to predict which may cause our actual results, performance, time frames or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance, time frames or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, the following:\n\n•competition in the beauty industry;\n\n•our ability to effectively maintain and promote a positive brand image, expand our brand awareness and maintain consumer confidence in the quality, safety and efficacy of our products;\n\n•our ability to anticipate and respond to market trends and changes in consumer preferences and execute on our growth strategies and expansion opportunities, including with respect to new product introductions;\n\n•our ability to accurately forecast customer and consumer demand for our products;\n\n•our dependence on the success of our long-term strategic plan; \n\n•our ability to limit the illegal distribution and sale by third parties of counterfeit versions of our products or the unauthorized diversion by third parties of our products;\n\n•our dependence on a limited number of customers for a large portion of our net sales;\n\n•our ability to develop, manufacture and effectively and profitably market and sell future products;\n\n•our ability to attract new customers and consumers and encourage consumer spending across our product portfolio;\n\n•our ability to successfully implement new or additional marketing efforts;\n\n•our relationships with and the performance of our suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and retailers and our ability to manage our supply chain;\n\n•impacts on our business from political, regulatory, economic, trade and other risks associated with operating internationally;\n\n•our ability to manage our executive leadership changes and to attract and retain senior management and other qualified personnel;\n\n•our reliance on our and our third-party service providers’ information technology; \n\n•our ability to maintain the security of confidential information;\n\n•our ability to establish and maintain intellectual property protection for our products, as well as our ability to operate our business without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the intellectual property rights of others;\n\n3\n\n[Table of Contents](#i930256eef7d84eb6937ad9c797231d51_7)\n\n•the outcome of litigation and regulatory proceedings;\n\n•the impact of changes in federal, state and international laws, regulations and administrative policy;\n\n•our existing and any future indebtedness, including our ability to comply with affirmative and negative covenants under the 2022 Credit Agreement;\n\n•our ability to service our existing indebtedness and obtain additional capital to finance operations and our growth opportunities;\n\n•volatility of our stock price;\n\n•our “controlled company” status and the influence of investment funds affiliated with Advent International, L.P. over us;\n\n•the impact of an economic downturn and inflationary pressures on our business;\n\n•fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations;\n\n•changes in our tax rates and our exposure to tax liability; and\n\n•the other factors identified in the “Risk Factors” section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the “2023 Form 10-K”) and in other documents that we file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time.\n\nMany of these factors are macroeconomic in nature and are, therefore, beyond our control. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results, performance or achievements may vary materially from those described in this Quarterly Report as anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended, planned or projected. We discuss many of these risks in greater detail in the “Risk Factors” section of our 2023 Form 10-K. The forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report are made only as of the date hereof. Unless required by law, we neither intend nor assume any obligation to update these forward-looking statements for any reason after the date of this Quarterly Report to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations or otherwise.\n\n4\n\n[Table of Contents](#i930256eef7d84eb6937ad9c797231d51_7)\n\nPART I - FINANCIAL INFORMATION\n\nITEM 1.

(“Olaplex Holdings” and, together with its subsidiaries, the “Company”) is a Delaware corporation that was incorporated on June 8, 2021. Olaplex Holdings is organized as a holding company and operates indirectly through Olaplex, Inc., its wholly owned indirect subsidiary, which conducts business under the name “Olaplex”. Olaplex is an innovative, science-enabled, technology-driven beauty company that is focused on delivering its patent-protected prestige hair care products to professional hair salons, retailers and everyday consumers. Olaplex develops, manufactures and distributes a line of hair care products developed to address three key uses: treatment, maintenance and protection.\n\nBasis of Presentation\n\nThe accompanying unaudited interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. The unaudited interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements furnished reflect all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented. The results of operations of any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for the full fiscal year. The unaudited interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying footnotes included in the Company’s 2023 Form 10-K.\n\nNOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nEstimates and Assumptions\n\nPreparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue recognition, determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as product returns, allowance for promotions, and refunds; loss contingencies; the fair value of share-based options and stock settled stock appreciation rights (“SARs”); the fair value of and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for the Company’s reporting unit; the fair value of the Company’s Interest Rate Caps (as defined below in “Note 5 - Fair Value Measurement”); useful lives of the Company’s tangible and intangible assets; estimated income tax expense and tax payments; future payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement; and the net realizable value of, and demand for the Company’s inventory. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management’s estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties.\n\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\n\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The authoritative guidance for fair value measurements established a framework for measuring fair value and established a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements as follows:\n\nLevel 1—Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. The Company’s Level 1 assets consist of its marketable securities.\n\nLevel 2—Observable quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and observable quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.\n\nLevel 3—Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.\n\n9\n\n[Table of Contents](#i930256eef7d84eb6937ad9c797231d51_7)\n\nCash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses are reflected at carrying value, which approximates fair value due to the short-term maturity. The Company’s long-term debt is recorded at its carrying value in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, which may differ from fair value. The Company’s Interest Rate Caps are recorded at their Level 2 fair values in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nAccounting Policies\n\nThere have been no material changes in significant accounting policies as described in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nConstructive Retirement of Common Stock Repurchases\n\nWhen the Company's common stock is retired or purchased for constructive retirement for net share settlement of stock options, any excess purchase price over par value is allocated between additional paid-in-capital, to the extent that previous net gains from sales or retirements are included therein, and the remainder to retained earnings.\n\nTax Receivable Agreement\n\nIn connection with the Reorganization Transactions, the Company entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement under which the Company will be required to pay to the Pre-IPO Stockholders 85% of the federal, state or local tax cash savings that the Company actually realizes on its taxable income following the IPO, as a result of the amortization of intangible assets and capitalized transaction costs that existed as of the date of the IPO. Under the Tax Receivable Agreement, generally the Company will retain the benefit of the remaining 15% of the applicable tax savings.\n\nThe Tax Receivable Agreement liability is calculated based on current tax laws and the assumption that the Company and its subsidiaries will earn sufficient taxable income to realize the full tax benefits subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement. Updates to the Company’s blended state tax rate, allocation of U.S. versus foreign sourced income and changes in tax rules on the amortization and depreciation of assets may significantly impact the established liability, and changes to that established liability would be recorded to other income (expense) in the period the Company made the determination regarding the applicable change. The Company expects that future payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement relating to the Pre-IPO Tax Assets could aggregate to $185.4 millionover the 11-year remaining period under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, which began in the year ended December 31, 2022, are not conditioned upon the parties’ continued ownership of equity in the Company.\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted \n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and early adoption is permitted. The guidance is to be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Upon transition, the segment expense categories and amounts disclosed in the prior periods should be based on the significant segment expense categories identified and disclosed in the period of adoption. The Company expects this update to impact its disclosures in the notes to its financial statements but does not anticipate any effect on its consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures”, which modifies the rules on income tax disclosures to require entities to disclose (1) specific categories in the rate reconciliation, (2) the income or loss from continuing operations before income tax expense or benefit (separated between domestic and foreign) and (3) income tax expense or benefit from continuing operations (separated by federal, state and foreign). This update also requires entities to disclose their income tax payments to international, federal, state and local jurisdictions, among other changes. The new guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company expects this update to impact its disclosures in the notes to its financial statements but does not anticipate any effect on its consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\n\n10\n\n[Table of Contents](#i930256eef7d84eb6937ad9c797231d51_7)\n\nIn March 2024, the SEC adopted the final rule under SEC Release No. 33-11275, The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors. This rule will require registrants to disclose certain climate-related information in annual reports. On April 4, 2024, the SEC determined to voluntarily stay the final rules pending completion of a judicial review of certain legal challenges. The Company is currently evaluating the final rule to determine its impact on the Company's disclosures.\n\nReclassifications\n\nCertain amounts presented have been reclassified within the “Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income” to conform with the current period presentation, including a prior year reclassification from Interest expense, net to Interest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The reclassifications occurred as a result of an increase in the significance of the current year amount. The reclassifications had no effect on the Company’s consolidated operating results, financial condition or cash flows.\n\nNOTE 3 – NET SALES\n\nThe Company distributes products in the U.S. and internationally through professional distributors in salons, directly to retailers for sale in their physical stores and e-commerce sites, and direct-to-consumer (“DTC”) through sales to third-party e-commerce customers and through its own Olaplex.com website.

These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets; Level 2, defined as observable quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and observable quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data. The Company’s Level 1 assets consist of its marketable securities. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\n\nOn August 11, 2022, the Company entered into an interest rate cap transaction (the “2022 Interest Rate Cap”) in connection with the 2022 Term Loan Facility, with a notional amount of $400 million. The 2022 Interest Rate Cap expired on July 31, 2024.\n\nIn advance of the expiration of the 2022 Interest Rate Cap, on May 7, 2024, the Company entered into a second interest rate cap transaction (the “2024 Interest Rate Cap” and, together with the 2022 Interest Rate Cap, the “Interest Rate Caps”) in connection with the 2022 Term Loan Facility, with a notional amount of $400 million. The 2024 Interest Rate Cap expires on July 31, 2026. \n\nThe 2024 Interest Rate Cap asset is, and the 2022 Interest Rate Cap was, measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Although the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value the Interest Rate Caps fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with the Interest Rate Caps utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by the Company and its counterparties. The Company has determined that the impact of the credit valuation adjustments made to the Interest Rate Caps were not significant to the overall valuation. As a result, the 2024 Interest Rate Cap as of September 30, 2024 and the 2022 Interest Rate Cap as of December 31, 2023 were classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\n12\n\n[Table of Contents](#i930256eef7d84eb6937ad9c797231d51_7)\n\nThe Company’s assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis and subject to fair value disclosure requirements at September 30, 2024 were as follows:\n\nTotal | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3  \n---|---|---|---  \nAssets:  \nOther assets  \n2024 Interest Rate Cap | $ | 142 | $ | — | $ | 142 | $ | —  \n  \nThe Company’s assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis and subject to fair value disclosure requirements at December 31, 2023 were as follows:\n\nTotal | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3  \n---|---|---|---  \nAssets:  \nOther assets  \n2022 Interest Rate Cap | $ | 2,391 | $ | — | $ | 2,391 | $ | —  \n  \n13\n\n[Table of Contents](#i930256eef7d84eb6937ad9c797231d51_7)\n\nNOTE 6 – GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n\nGoodwill and intangible assets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were comprised of the following:\n\nSeptember 30, 2024  \n---  \nEstimatedUseful Life | Gross Carrying Amount | Accumulated Amortization |  Net Carrying  Amount  \nBrand name | 25 years | $ | 952,000 | $ | (180,034) | $ | 771,966  \nProduct formulations | 15 years | 136,500 | (42,906) | 93,594  \nCustomer relationships | 20 years | 53,000 | (12,530) | 40,470  \nSoftware | 3-15 years | 9,054 | (3,607) | 5,447  \nTotal finite-lived intangibles | 1,150,554 | (239,077) | 911,477  \nGoodwill | Indefinite | 168,300 | —  | 168,300  \nTotal goodwill and other intangibles | $ | 1,318,854 | $ | (239,077) | $ | 1,079,777  \n  \nDecember 31, 2023  \n---  \nEstimatedUseful Life | Gross Carrying Amount | Accumulated Amortization |  Net Carrying  Amount  \nBrand name | 25 years | $ | 952,000 | $ | (151,475) | $ | 800,525  \nProduct formulations | 15 years | 136,500 | (36,082) | 100,418  \nCustomer relationships | 20 years | 53,000 | (10,541) | 42,459  \nSoftware | 3 years | 5,660 | (1,348) | 4,312  \nTotal finite-lived intangibles | 1,147,160 | (199,446) | 947,714  \nGoodwill | Indefinite | 168,300 | —  | 168,300  \nTotal goodwill and other intangibles | $ | 1,315,460 | $ | (199,446) | $ | 1,116,014  \n  \nThe amortization of the Company’s brand name, customer relationships and software is recorded to Amortization of other intangible assets in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had $150 million of available borrowing capacity under the 2022 Revolver.\n\nThe interest rate on outstanding debt under the 2022 Term Loan Facility was 8.4% per annum as of September 30, 2024. The interest rates for all facilities under the 2022 Credit Agreement are calculated based upon the Company’s election among (a) an adjusted term secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”) (subject to a 0.50% floor with respect to the 2022 Term Loan Facility, and a 0% floor with respect to the 2022 Revolver) plus an additional interest rate spread, (b) with respect to a borrowing in Euros under the 2022 Revolver, a euro interbank offered rate (subject to a 0% floor) plus an additional interest rate spread, or (c) an “Alternate Base Rate” (as defined in the 2022 Credit Agreement) (subject to a 1.50% floor with respect to the 2022 Term Loan Facility, and a 1.00% floor with respect to the 2022 Revolver) plus an additional interest rate spread.\n\nInterest expense, inclusive of debt amortization, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was $15.6 million and $14.7 million, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was $44.7 million and $43.3 million, respectively.\n\nThe fair value of the Company’s long-term debt is based on the market value of its long-term debt instrument. Based on the inputs used to value the long-term debt, the Company’s long-term debt is categorized within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. As of September 30, 2024, the carrying amount of the Company’s long-term debt under the 2022 Credit Agreement was $651.8 million, and the fair value of the Company’s long-term debt was $626.9 million. As of December 31, 2023, the carrying amount of the Company’s long-term debt under the 2022 Credit Agreement was $655.8 million, and the fair value of the Company’s long-term debt was $615.1 million.\n\nThe 2022 Credit Agreement includes, among other things, customary negative and affirmative covenants (including reporting, financial and maintenance covenants) and events of default (including a change of control) for facilities of this type. In addition, the 2022 Credit Agreement includes a springing first lien leverage ratio financial covenant, which is applicable only to the lenders under the 2022 Revolver. The Company was in compliance with these affirmative and negative covenants on September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The 2022 Term Loan Facility and the 2022 Revolver are secured by substantially all of the assets of Olaplex, Inc. and the other guarantors, subject to certain exceptions and thresholds.\n\nInterest Rate Cap Transactions\n\nThe Company’s results are subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations on borrowings under the 2022 Credit Agreement, including the 2022 Term Loan Facility. The Company may, from time to time, utilize interest rate derivatives in an effort to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. See further discussion in “Note 5 - Fair Value Measurement”. \n\n16\n\n[Table of Contents](#i930256eef7d84eb6937ad9c797231d51_7)\n\nThe Company performed an initial effectiveness assessment on the Interest Rate Caps and determined each to be an effective hedge of the cash flows related to the interest rate payments on the 2022 Term Loan Facility. The hedge is evaluated qualitatively on a quarterly basis for effectiveness. For derivatives designated, and that qualify, as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk, the gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into Interest expense in the same period(s) during which the hedged transaction affects earnings, as documented at hedge inception in accordance with the Company’s accounting policy election. Payments of the up-front premiums of the Interest Rate Caps are included within other current assets and other assets and liabilities within cash flows from operating activities on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company’s Interest Rate Caps generated an unrecognized pre-tax loss of $1.2 million and $3.0 million, respectively, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the same periods, the Company also recognized a $0.7 million and $3.4 million reduction, respectively, in interest expense related to the Company’s receipt of funds as a result of the interest rate cap settlements with the Company’s counterparty with respect to the Interest Rate Caps, partially offset by $0.3 million and $0.9 million, respectively,of interest expense related to amortization of the interest rate cap premiums paid by the Company in connection with the Interest Rate Caps. \n\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company’s 2022 Interest Rate Cap generated an unrecognized pre-tax loss of $0.7 million and a gain of $0.3 million, respectively, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the same periods, the Company also recognized a $1.3 million and a $2.8 million reduction, respectively, in interest expense related the Company’s receipt of funds as a result of the interest rate cap settlements with the Company’s counterparty, partially offset by $0.3 million and $0.8 million, respectively, related to amortization of the interest rate cap premium paid by the Company in connection with the 2022 Interest Rate Cap.\n\nThe Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes, nor does it hold or issue leveraged derivative instruments. By using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to interest rate fluctuations, the Company exposes itself to counterparty credit risk. The Company manages exposure to counterparty credit risk by entering into derivative financial instruments with highly rated institutions that can be expected to fully perform under the terms of the applicable contracts.\n\nNOTE 9 – EQUITY\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued 1,747,389shares of its common stock, of which 297,945 shares were issued as a result of stock options exercised and 1,449,444 shares were issued upon vesting of restricted stock units.\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company issued 109,620 shares of its common stock upon vesting and settlement of net stock-settled SARs. The Company withheld 83,501 of such shares of its common stock for the net settlement payment of exercise price and taxes related to such SARs.\n\nAdditionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company issued 4,606,867 shares of its common stock as a result of stock options exercised.\n\nNOTE 10 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\n\nIn August 2023, the Company entered into an agreement with Pacvue Corporation, an e-commerce advertising and software company, in which certain investment funds affiliated with Advent International L.P., the holder of a majority of the Company’s common stock (collectively the “Advent Funds”), hold a greater than 10% equity interest. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, payments to Pacvue Corporation were de minimis and $0.3 million, respectively. No payments were made to Pacvue Corporation during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nIn connection with the Reorganization Transactions, the Company entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement with the Pre-IPO Stockholders. See further discussion in “Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Tax Receivable Agreement”. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company made payments of $0.2 million and $12.8 million, respectively, as required pursuant to the terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company did not make any payments pursuant to the terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company made payments of $16.6 millionas required pursuant to the terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement.\n\n17\n\n[Table of Contents](#i930256eef7d84eb6937ad9c797231d51_7)\n\nNOTE 11 – CONTINGENCIES\n\nFrom time to time, the Company is subject to various legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company cannot predict with reasonable assurance the outcome of these legal actions brought against the Company as they are subject to uncertainties. Accordingly, any settlement or resolution in these legal actions may occur and affect the Company’s net income in such period as the settlement or resolution.\n\nPending Legal Proceedings: \n\nOn November 17, 2022, a putative securities class action was filed against the Company and certain of its current and former officers and directors in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, captioned Lilien v. Olaplex Holdings, Inc. et al., No. 2:22-cv-08395. A consolidated complaint was filed on April 28, 2023, which names as additional defendants the underwriters for the Company’s IPO and various stockholders that sold shares of common stock of the Company in the IPO. The action is brought on behalf of a putative class of purchasers of the Company’s common stock in or traceable to the Company’s IPO and asserts claims under Sections 11, 12, and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933. The action seeks certification of the putative class, compensatory damages, attorneys’ fees and costs, and any other relief that the court determines is appropriate. The defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated complaint on July 19, 2023. The court held hearings on the defendants’ motions to dismiss on October 16, 2023 and July 1, 2024. A decision has yet to be issued. On August 23, 2024, the court issued an order staying this action pending the United States Supreme Court’s resolution of the appeal in Facebook, Inc., et al. v. Amalgamated Bank, et al., No. 23-980. The underwriter defendants have notified the Company of their intent to seek indemnification from the Company pursuant to the IPO underwriting agreement regarding the claims asserted in this action. The Company intends to vigorously defend the pending lawsuit.\n\nOn November 15, 2023, a purported derivative action was filed against the Company, Advent International Corporation, and certain of the Company’s current and former officers and directors in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, captioned Ciuffo v. Dagousset, et al., No. 2:23-cv-09712-SVW-SK. This action is premised on allegations similar to those asserted in the Lilien federal securities litigation. On February 1, 2024, the parties filed a joint stipulation to stay the purported derivative action pending a decision on the motions to dismiss filed in the Lilien federal securities action. \n\nOn March 22, 2024, a second purported derivative action was filed against the Company, Advent International Corporation, and certain of the Company’s current and former officers and directors in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, captioned Hutchinson v. Advent International Corporation, et al., No. 2:24-cv-02364. This action is premised on allegations similar to those asserted in the Lilien federal securities litigation and in the Ciuffo federal derivative action. On April 19, 2024, the parties in both purported derivative actions filed a joint stipulation to consolidate the two derivative actions and to stay proceedings in the consolidated case, which the court granted on June 26, 2024.\n\nOn February 9, 2023, twenty-eight plaintiffs filed Albahae, et al. v. Olaplex Holdings, Inc., et al., No. 2:23-cv-00982, a complaint alleging personal and economic injury and asserting claims for breach of warranty, negligence/gross negligence, products liability, unjust enrichment, and violations of California False Advertising Law and Unfair Competition Law, against the Company and Cosway Company, Inc., the Company’s primary contract manufacturer, in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. On March 2, 2023, the plaintiffs amended the complaint to include seventy-three additional plaintiffs. The plaintiffs allege that certain ingredients used in some Company products have purportedly caused irritation or posed a hazard to consumers, and that the Company engaged in misrepresentation with respect to those products. The plaintiffs seek actual and consequential damages, punitive damages, restitution in the form of disgorgement of profits, attorneys’ fees and costs, and any other relief that the court determines is appropriate. On April 17, 2023, the Company moved to dismiss and to sever the plaintiffs’ claims. On July 11, 2023, the Court granted the Company’s motion to sever and dismissed all but the first named plaintiff. The Court also dismissed the operative complaint with leave to re-file on the grounds that it now contained allegations that were not relevant to the claims of the one, remaining plaintiff. On July 24, 2023, the remaining plaintiff filed a notice, voluntarily dismissing her claims without prejudice. As of the date of issuance of these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, none of the plaintiffs have re-filed their claims. \n\nAny potential loss associated with these pending legal proceedings is not probable or reasonably estimable at this time.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company was not subject to any other currently pending legal matters or claims that could have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows should such litigation be resolved unfavorably.\n\n18\n\n[Table of Contents](#i930256eef7d84eb6937ad9c797231d51_7)\n\nNOTE 12 – NET INCOME PER SHARE\n\nThe following is a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator in the basic and diluted net income per common share computations:\n\nThree Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \nNumerator:  \nNet income | $ | 14,797 | $ | 20,366 | $ | 28,322 | $ | 47,486  \nDenominator:  \nWeighted average common shares outstanding – basic | 662,248,231 | 654,702,392 | 661,586,351 | 653,603,665  \nDilutive common equivalent shares from common stock equivalents | 3,903,128 | 24,055,628 | 3,136,950 | 27,485,878  \nWeighted average common shares outstanding – diluted | 666,151,359 | 678,758,020 | 664,723,301 | 681,089,543  \nNet income per share:  \nBasic | $ | 0.02 | $ | 0.03 | $ | 0.04 | $ | 0.07  \nDiluted | $ | 0.02 | $ | 0.03 | $ | 0.04 | $ | 0.07  \n  \nThe shares of the Company’s common stock underlying stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and SARs that were excluded in the computation of diluted net income per common share because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive were as follows:\n\nThree Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \nStock options | 6,522,429 | 4,473,909 | 8,495,650 | 2,887,141  \nRSUs | 4,427,600 | 2,939,647 | 4,759,093 | 61,205  \nSARs | 182,250 | 345,926 | 182,250 | 260,518  \n  \n19\n\n[Table of Contents](#i930256eef7d84eb6937ad9c797231d51_7)\n\nITEM 2 – MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and with our audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2023 Form 10-K.\n\nSome of the information contained in this discussion and analysis, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from management’s expectations as a result of various factors. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in this Quarterly Report and in “Item 1A. - Risk Factors” in the 2023 Form 10-K.\n\nCompany Overview\n\nOLAPLEX is an innovative, science-enabled, technology-driven beauty company. Since our inception in 2014, we have focused on delivering effective, patent-protected and proven performance in the prestige hair care category. \n\nOLAPLEX disrupted and revolutionized the prestige hair care category by creating the bond-building space in 2014. We have grown from an initial assortment of three products sold exclusively through the professional channel to a broader suite of products offered through the professional, specialty retail and DTC channels that have been strategically developed to address three key uses: treatment, maintenance and protection. Our patent-protected bond-building technologies relink disulfide bonds in human hair that are destroyed via chemical, thermal, mechanical, environmental and aging processes. Our current product portfolio is comprised of twenty-two unique and complementary products.\n\nThe strength of our business model and ability to scale have created a compelling financial profile. We have developed a synergistic omnichannel model that leverages the strength of each of our channels and our strong digital capabilities that we apply across our sales platforms. Our professional channel serves as the foundation for our brand. Through this channel, professional hairstylists introduce consumers to our products and, we believe, influence consumer purchasing decisions. Our specialty retail channel works to increase awareness of, and education for, our products and expand consumer penetration. Our DTC channel, comprised of Olaplex.com and sales through third-party e-commerce platforms, also provides us with the opportunity to engage directly with our consumers to provide powerful feedback that drives decisions we make around new product development.\n\nStrategicPillars\n\nWe are focused on executing against our key strategic pillars that we believe will support our long-term growth. These include igniting our global brand, disrupting with innovation, amplifying channel coverage and charting new geographies. These key strategic pillars are supported by our efforts to build capabilities and infrastructure that we believe will enable our aspirations.\n\nIgniting our Global Brand\n\nWe believe we have built one of the most powerful brands in the prestige hair care category. We plan to continue growing awareness of our global brand, in an effort to deepen connections with existing customers as well as reach new audiences. We will also continue to invest in enhancing our brand equity. Our marketing model remains focused on implementing high return on investment, performance marketing activities aimed at fueling growth. Key levers of our marketing include organic social media activations, strategic paid media, education and training regarding our brand, community engagement with our professional hairstylists, influencer partnerships, and retailer activations such as sampling and in-store events. \n\nDisrupting with Innovation\n\nWe believe we have a strong pipeline of disruptive innovation that leverages our science-based technology and patented ingredients. We plan to launch two-to-four products annually over the next three years. To support this pipeline, we intend to continue to invest in research and development to strengthen our internal innovation capabilities. We recently entered into hair care adjacent categories and remain excited about the opportunity to further grow where our technology can serve as a foundation for entry that we believe is supported by consumer trust in our brand.\n\n20\n\n[Table of Contents](#i930256eef7d84eb6937ad9c797231d51_7)\n\nAmplifying Channel Coverage\n\nIn our professional channel, we have undertaken efforts to support and reassert strong relationships with the professional hairstylist community and maintain brand awareness by increasing our field support efforts, deepening partnerships with distributors and customers, and refreshing educational content. We are also pursuing opportunities to further penetrate premium and prestige salons. In specialty retail, we are enhancing visual merchandising in stores, investing in brand store pages online and deploying targeted communications intended to enable new customer acquisition. For our DTC business, we are evolving the digital experiences on Olaplex.com and third party e-commerce websites. On Olaplex.com, we expect to continue to invest in site enhancements and more advanced personalization efforts.\n\nCharting New Geographies\n\nWe believe there is substantial opportunity to grow globally. Our priority international regions are currently key markets in Europe and Asia. Across Europe and other regions, we aim to implement our business model by first establishing a strong professional channel and then complementing that channel through entry into specialty retail and DTC. In Asia, we intend to partner with distributors in the region that will support omni-channel distribution and sales for our brand.\n\nSupporting our Strategic Pillars\n\nTo enable these key growth pillars, we intend to continue to build our capabilities and infrastructure. These efforts extend across our organization, including focusing on cultivating top talent and building a strong corporate culture, evolving our operational capabilities as we scale, creating a strong financial foundation for growth, and ensuring that we have the right organizational infrastructure, technology and data to support our growth. \n\nBusiness Environment & Trends\n\nWe continue to monitor the effects of the global macro-economic environment, including the risk of recession, inflationary pressures, competitive products and discounting, currency volatility, high interest rates, social and political issues, geopolitical tensions and regulatory matters. We also are mindful of inflationary pressures on our consumers, and are monitoring the impact that increasing inflationary pressures may have on consumer spending and preferences and inventory rebalancing at our customers in an increasingly competitive industry.\n\nCompetition in the beauty industry is based on a variety of factors, including innovation, product efficacy, accessible pricing, brand recognition and loyalty, service to the consumer, promotional activities, advertising, special events, new product introductions, e-commerce initiatives, sustainability and other activities. We have seen increased competitive activity including discounting in the prestige hair care category, which may continue in a heightened inflationary environment. We believe we have a well-recognized and strong reputation in our core markets and that the quality and performance of our products, our emphasis on innovation, and our engagement with our professional and consumer communities position us to compete effectively.\n\n21\n\n[Table of Contents](#i930256eef7d84eb6937ad9c797231d51_7)\n\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Summary\n\n•Net sales decreased 3.6% from $123.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to $119.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024.

We also utilize cash for strategic investments. Fluctuations in working capital are primarily caused by customer demand of our product, timing of when a retailer rearranges or restocks our products, timing of inventory purchases, and timing of our payables and expenses. Capital expenditures typically vary and are currently limited, and future capital expenditure requirements depend on strategic initiatives selected for the fiscal year, including investments in infrastructure, expansion into new national and international distributors and expansion of our customer base.\n\nA considerable portion of our operating income is related to sales to customers outside of the U.S.; however, the majority of our bank deposits are held within the U.S.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had $538.8 million of cash and cash equivalents. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, we had borrowing capacity of $150.0 million under the 2022 Revolver, plus $74.3 million of working capital excluding cash and cash equivalents for a combined liquidity position of $763.1 million.\n\n28\n\n[Table of Contents](#i930256eef7d84eb6937ad9c797231d51_7)\n\nCash Flows\n\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented:\n\nNine Months Ended September 30,  \n---  \n(in thousands) | 2024 | 2023  \nNet cash provided by (used in):  \nOperating activities | $ | 93,410  | $ | 128,497   \nInvesting activities | (3,369) | (2,902)  \nFinancing activities | (17,612) | (18,817)  \nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents | $ | 72,429  | $ | 106,778   \n  \nOperating Activities \n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $93.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily reflecting our net income of $28.3 million, net of non-cash cost items and changes in operating working capital. Non-cash adjustments were primarily driven by amortization of other intangibles of $32.8 million, share-based compensation expense of $8.6 million and amortization of patent formulations of $7.1 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities increased cash provided by operating activities by $8.9 million.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $128.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily reflecting our net income of $47.5 million, net of non-cash cost items and changes in operating working capital. Non-cash adjustments were primarily driven by amortization of other intangibles of $31.0 million, inventory write-off and disposals of $9.8 million, share-based compensation expense of $7.3 million and amortization of patent formulations of $6.3 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities increased cash provided by operating activities by $21.7 million.\n\nInvesting Activities \n\nNet cash used in investing activities was $3.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting investments of $2.7 million primarily related to the development of internal-use software and purchases of property and equipment of $0.7 million.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities was $2.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily reflecting investments of $2.2 million primarily related to the development of internal-use software, purchases of intangible assets of $0.5 million and purchases of property and equipment of $0.2 million.\n\nFinancing Activities \n\nNet cash used in financing activities was $17.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily consisting of $12.8 million of payments pursuant to our Tax Receivable Agreement and $5.1 million of principal payments for the 2022 Term Loan Facility. \n\nNet cash used in financing activities was $18.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily consisting of $16.5 million of payments pursuant to our Tax Receivable Agreement and $6.8 million of principal payments for the 2022 Term Loan Facility partially offset by proceeds of $4.4 million from stock option exercises.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources Requirements\n\nBased on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our cash, cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated operating costs, required payments of principal and interest, working capital needs, ordinary course capital expenditures, and other commitments for at least the next 12 months.\n\n29\n\n[Table of Contents](#i930256eef7d84eb6937ad9c797231d51_7)\n\nIf necessary, we may borrow funds under our 2022 Revolver to finance our liquidity requirements, subject to customary borrowing conditions. To the extent additional funds are necessary to meet our long-term liquidity needs as we continue to execute our business strategy, we anticipate that they will be obtained through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, equity financings or a combination of these potential sources of funds; however, such financing may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. Our ability to meet our operating, investing and financing needs depends, to a significant extent, on our future financial performance, which will be subject in part to general economic, competitive, financial, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control, including those described in “Item 1A. - Risk Factors” in our 2023 Form 10-K. In addition to these general economic and industry factors, the principal factors in determining whether our cash flows will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements will be our ability to continue providing innovative products to our customers and consumers and manage production and our supply chain.\n\n2022 Credit Facility\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding indebtedness under the 2022 Credit Agreement of $658.1 million, of which $6.8 million was classified as current. As of September 30, 2024, we had $150.0 million of available borrowing capacity under the 2022 Revolver. \n\nThe interest rate on outstanding amounts under the 2022 Term Loan Facility was 8.4% per annum as of September 30, 2024. We have not drawn on the 2022 Revolver as of September 30, 2024. The 2022 Term Loan Facility is repayable in mandatory quarterly installments equal to $1.6 million, with the balance payable at maturity. The maturity date of the 2022 Term Loan Facility is February 23, 2029, and the maturity date of the 2022 Revolver is February 23, 2027.\n\nThe 2022 Credit Agreement contains a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict the Company’s ability to (subject to certain exceptions) pay dividends and distributions or repurchase its capital stock, incur additional indebtedness, create liens on assets, engage in mergers or consolidations and sell or otherwise dispose of assets. The 2022 Credit Agreement also includes reporting, financial and maintenance covenants, including a springing first lien leverage ratio financial covenant. The Company was in compliance with these affirmative and negative covenants on September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Substantially all the assets of the Company constitute collateral under the 2022 Credit Agreement.\n\nOn August 11, 2022, we entered into the 2022 Interest Rate Cap in connection with the 2022 Term Loan Facility, with a notional amount of $400.0 million, in order to limit our exposure to potential increases in future interest rates related to the 2022 Term Loan Facility. The 2022 Interest Rate Cap expired on July 31, 2024.\n\nOn May 7, 2024, in advance of the expiration of the 2022 Interest Rate Cap, we entered into the 2024 Interest Rate Cap in connection with the 2022 Term Loan Facility, with a notional amount of $400.0 million, amortizing to $200.0 million on August 29, 2025. The 2024 Interest Rate Cap expires on July 31, 2026. We have designated the Interest Rate Caps as cash-flow hedges for accounting purposes. \n\nSee “Note 8 - Long-Term Debt” in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1. Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report for additional information.\n\nTax Receivable Agreement Obligations\n\nIn connection with the Reorganization Transactions, we entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement under which we will be required to pay to the Pre-IPO Stockholders 85% of the federal, state or local tax cash savings that we actually realize on our taxable income following the IPO, as a result of the amortization of intangible assets and capitalized transaction costs that existed as of the transaction date. Under the Tax Receivable Agreement, generally we will retain the benefit of the remaining 15% of the applicable tax savings.\n\nThe Tax Receivable Agreement liability is calculated based on current tax laws and the assumption that we and our subsidiaries will earn sufficient taxable income to realize the full tax benefits subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement. Updates to our blended state tax rate, allocation of U.S. versus foreign sourced income and changes in tax rules on the amortization and depreciation of assets may significantly impact the established liability and changes would be recorded to other income (expense) in the period we made the determination. We expect that future payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement relating to the Pre-IPO Tax Assets could aggregate to $185.4 million over the 11-year remaining period under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, which began in the year ended December 31, 2022, are not conditioned upon the parties’ continued ownership of equity in the Company.\n\n30\n\n[Table of Contents](#i930256eef7d84eb6937ad9c797231d51_7)\n\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\n\nThere were no material changes to our contractual obligations since the filing of our 2023 Form 10-K.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nOur unaudited interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on other factors that we believe to be reasonable. Actual results may differ from those estimates. We review these estimates on a periodic basis to ensure reasonableness. Although actual amounts may differ from such estimated amounts, we believe such differences are not likely to be material. For additional detail regarding our critical accounting policies and estimates, see our discussion for the year ended December 31, 2023 in the 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to these critical accounting estimates in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. \n\n31\n\n[Table of Contents](#i930256eef7d84eb6937ad9c797231d51_7)\n\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK \n\nWe are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions in the normal course of our business. This includes risk associated with interest rates, our interest rate cap transactions, inflation and foreign exchange.\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nOur results are subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations on borrowings under the 2022 Credit Agreement. Our borrowings bear interest at a variable rate; therefore, we are exposed to market risks relating to changes in interest rates. Interest rate changes generally affect the amount of our interest payments and, therefore, our future earnings and cash flows. As of September 30, 2024, we had $658.1 million of outstanding variable rate loans under the 2022 Term Loan Facility. Based on our September 30, 2024 variable rate loan balances, an increase or decrease of 1% in the effective interest rate would cause an increase or decrease in interest cost of approximately $6.6 million over the next 12 months.\n\nInterest Rate Cap\n\nOn May 7, 2024, we entered into the 2024 Interest Rate Cap in connection with the 2022 Term Loan Facility, as more fully described in “Note 5 - Fair Value Measurement” in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report. We use the 2024 Interest Rate Cap to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. The fair value of the 2024 Interest Rate Cap is measured at the end of each reporting period using observable inputs other than quoted prices. The fair value of the 2024 Interest Rate Cap recorded in other assets at September 30, 2024 was $0.1 million. A hypothetical 50 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an increase to the fair value of the 2024 Interest Rate Cap of approximately $0.3 million. A hypothetical 50 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease to the fair value of the 2024 Interest Rate Cap of approximately $0.1 million.\n\nInflation\n\nInflationary factors such as increases in the cost to produce our products and overhead costs have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our operating results. Sustained increases in warehousing costs, transportation costs, wages and raw material costs, or other inflationary pressures in the future, may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross profit margin if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs, or if we cannot identify other cost efficiencies.\n\nForeign Exchange Risk\n\nOur reporting currency, including our U.K. foreign subsidiary, Olaplex UK Limited, is the U.S. dollar. Gains or losses due to transactions in foreign currencies are reflected in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income under the line-item Other income (expense), net. We have not engaged in the hedging of foreign currency transactions to date, although we may choose to do so in the future. We do not believe that an immediate 10% increase or decrease in the relative value of the U.S. dollar to other currencies would have a material effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements.\n\n32\n\n[Table of Contents](#i930256eef7d84eb6937ad9c797231d51_7)\n\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES \n\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures \n\nOur disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.\n\nOur management has evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024.\n\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. \n\n33\n\n[Table of Contents](#i930256eef7d84eb6937ad9c797231d51_7)\n\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION \n\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS \n\nWe have, and may in the future, from time to time, become involved in litigation or other legal proceedings incidental to our business, including litigation related to intellectual property, regulatory matters, contract, advertising and other consumer claims. In addition, we believe that protecting our intellectual property is essential to our business and we have in the past, and may in the future, become involved in proceedings to enforce our rights. Regardless of outcome, litigation (including the litigation referenced below) can have an adverse impact on our reputation, financial condition and business, including by utilizing our resources and potentially diverting the attention of our management from the operation of our business.\n\nFor detail on certain legal proceedings, see “Note 11 - Contingencies - Pending Legal Proceedings” included in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report.\n\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS \n\nAn investment in our common stock involves risks.

OTHER INFORMATION\n\n(a)On November 5, 2024, the Board of Directors of Olaplex Holdings appointed Kenneth F. Egan as Interim Chief Accounting Officer of the Company, effective as of such date. Mr. Egan assumes the responsibilities of Kristi Belhumeur, who resigned from her role of Senior Vice President - Accounting of the Company, effective October 11, 2024, as previously disclosed by the Company in its Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the SEC on September 26, 2024.\n\nMr. Egan, age 54, has served as a Partner and the New York Office Managing Partner at CrossCountry Consulting LLC (“CrossCountry Consulting”), a consulting firm that focuses on corporate advisory services, since May 2022.

While\nindependent consultant reports, industry publications and other published industry sources generally indicate that the information contained therein was obtained from sources believed to be reliable, the Company has not independently verified such information. The\nCompany’s internal data and estimates are based upon information obtained from trade and business organizations and other contacts in the markets in which the Company operates and management’s understanding of industry conditions. Although the Company believes\nthat such information is reliable, the Company has not had this information verified by any independent sources. Similarly, the Company’s internal research is based upon management’s understanding of industry conditions, and such information has not been verified by any\nindependent sources. To the extent that any estimates underlying such market-derived information and other factors are incorrect, actual results may differ materially from those expressed in the independent parties’ estimates and in the Company’s estimates.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis presentation contains “non-GAAP financial measures,” including adjusted net income, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross profit margin, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted SG&A, adjusted basic and diluted EPS and adjusted effective tax rate. These are\nfinancial measures that are not calculated or presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) and may exclude items that are significant in understanding and assessing the Company’s financial results. Therefore, these\nmeasures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to measures of profitability, liquidity or performance under GAAP. You should be aware that the Company’s presentation of these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used and may be\ncalculated differently. Please refer to the Appendix to this presentation for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP metrics to their most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP.\nThis presentation includes forward-looking guidance for adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income, adjusted gross profit margin, adjusted effective tax rate and adjusted SG&A. The Company is not able to provide, without unreasonable effort, a\nreconciliation of the guidance for adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income, adjusted gross profit margin, adjusted effective tax rate and adjusted SG&A to the most directly comparable GAAP measure because the Company does not currently have\nsufficient data to accurately estimate the variables and individual adjustments included in the most directly comparable GAAP measure that would be necessary for such reconciliations, including (a) income tax related accruals in respect of certain one-time items, (b) costs\nrelated to potential debt or equity transactions, and (c) other non-recurring expenses that cannot reasonably be estimated in advance. These adjustments are inherently variable and uncertain and depend on various factors that are beyond the Company's control and as a\nresult it is also unable to predict their probable significance. Therefore, because management cannot estimate on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort the impact these variables and individual adjustments will have on its reported results in accordance with\nGAAP, it is unable to provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures included in its fiscal year 2024 guidance.\nQ3 2024 EARNINGS 3\nAMANDA BALDWIN\nChief Executive Officer\nQ3 2024 EARNINGS 4\nTHIRD QUARTER 2024 RESULTS\nNet Sales Adjusted EBITDA(1)\nQ3 24 Net Sales Q3 24 Adjusted EBITDA(1)\n$44.6MM\n$119.1MM\n• Representing sequential improvement\nfrom Q2 24 Q3 24 Adjusted EBITDA Margin(1)\n• Weaker than expected results in our\ninternational business\n37.5%\n• Continue in our efforts to build the\nright foundation for the future\n(1) Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial measures.

Furthermore, this information involves assumptions and\nlimitations, and you are cautioned not to give undue weight to these estimates.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Amanda.\nAmanda Baldwin\nThank you, Patrick. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.\nThis morning, we reported third quarter net sales of $119.1 million, which declined 3.6%\ncompared to a year ago. While this represented sequential improvement from Q2, we did\nunderperform our expectations, primarily due to weaker-than-expected results in our\ninternational business as we continue in our efforts to build the right foundation for the future.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $44.6 million for an adjusted EBITDA margin of 37.5%.\nCoupling our third quarter results with our updated learnings, we are revising our guidance for\nfiscal year 2024 and now expect net sales in the range of $405 million to $415 million and an\nadjusted EBITDA margin in the range of 29.9% to 30.6%. As we have shared on past earnings\ncalls, we planned for 2024 as a year to begin our transformation, taking a long-term view and\nprioritizing the strategies and initiatives aimed at building a healthier business. While we now\nbelieve it will take longer than originally expected to achieve our goal, we are making great\nprogress and taking the steps we believe are necessary for the long-term health of the business.\nMuch of this work has been happening behind the scenes, while at the same time this quarter,\nwe announced three new innovative products: our No. 5 Leave-In Conditioner, Bond Shaper\nCurl Rebuilding Salon Treatment and No. 10 Bond Shaper Curl Defining Gel. Although we are\ndisappointed with this revised outlook for the remainder of the year, I remain confident that we\nInComm Conferencing Page 2 of 18 www.incommconferencing.com\nhave the right strategy and are implementing the right actions to achieve a solid foundation for\nlong-term growth.\nOlaplex at its core is an innovative, science-enabled and pro-inspired beauty company with\ndemonstrated global appeal. As a top brand in the prestige hair care category, Olaplex had four\nof the five best-selling prestige hair care products year-to-date 2024 per Circana's retail tracking\ndata of the U.S. hair market. Our research indicates that the Olaplex brand remains strong with\npositive associations to build upon, including innovative, reparative, healthy and effective. And\nwe possess a healthy balance sheet and strong cash generation, which provide flexibility and\nenable us to invest in future growth. Overall, I continue to believe that the best years lie ahead\nfor this company.\nLet me walk you through three key assumptions that drove the revision to our full year outlook.\nFirst, we anticipate weaker performance from our international business as we reset for the\nfuture. We conducted a market-by-market review to better understand our business, evaluate\nour current structure and partnerships and develop the go-forward road map for our global\nreach. I personally spent time meeting with many of our key partners and traveling the globe to\nsee the brand in this current presentation on the ground and better understand the end\nconsumer and unique markets.\nFrom this assessment, while the enthusiasm and passion for this brand remain incredibly high,\nwe now believe that the issues within our international business are more complex than we\noriginally anticipated. This requires simplifying our international model with fewer distributor\npartners, as well as developing localized direct distribution approaches and brand support that\nare designed to be appropriate for the unique dynamics across the world. This work will take\ntime, but we believe it will ultimately better position our business for long-term success.\nWe have referenced throughout the year that we are consistently executing an international\ndistributor rationalization program. This effort has primarily impacted our international pro\nbusiness, where we have closed certain accounts that we believe were the source of diverted\nproduct as well as our international DTC channel, where we have deprioritized certain\ninternational e-commerce customers that we believe do not build equity in our brand. As the\nyear has progressed, we now believe it is appropriate to further realign our distributor network\nto fewer, stronger partners with clear accountabilities for market and brand development.\nWhile this activity will reduce net sales in the near term, we believe we're selecting the right\npartners who are excited with where we are taking the brand and will prioritize Olaplex, better\nsupport our transformation and be more integrated into our own internal processes.\nAdditionally, while we are redefining our international go-to-market strategy, we have felt it\nprudent to wait to align our new marketing efforts to coincide with deeper partnerships and\nour new brand vision in order to position ourselves to maximize the return on the investment.\nAs such, we believe the slower investment in international sales and marketing in the near term\nhas contributed to a moderation in demand.\nInComm Conferencing Page 3 of 18 www.incommconferencing.com\nSecond, from a sales and marketing perspective, we now believe it will take longer to\nexperience a lift in the overall demand from our brand investments. Earlier this year, we kicked\noff the beginning of our marketing evolution, building a stronger go-to-market engine, which\nincludes elevated content creation and a creator-led approach, focused investments on\nlaunches and our core products, deeper coordination with our stylists and retail partners and\nmore efficient ROI-driven media spend.\nWe recently started to deploy this new strategy in the U.S. We have observed positive early\nindicators that our new marketing activations are resonating with pros and consumers with\nimprovements in brand engagement and momentum in earned media value metrics. In this\nregion, we continue to observe sell-through trends at our key accounts that are largely\nconsistent on an absolute dollar basis with what we have seen throughout the year,\ndemonstrating continued progress towards stabilization. However, coming into the year, we did\nanticipate that these investments would begin to yield growth across the entire business, but\nwe have not yet experienced the overall lift in demand that we were expecting.\nWe are encouraged by the sell-through trends of our new products launched during the third\nquarter, supporting our belief that powerful innovation, clear messaging and stronger\nexecution can drive better results. We plan to apply these learnings next year across our entire\nportfolio. But as mentioned, we now believe it will take longer for this new strategy to yield\nimproved top line performance across the assortment.\nThird, the beauty market remains healthy, but also highly competitive. We previously believed\nthat we would be able to pull back on promotional levels during the quarter, but now expect\nthat the overall promotional environment will intensify during the holiday period and that we\nwill need to participate effectively to win over the consumer. We continue to prioritize strategic\npromotions that maintain brand health and new customer acquisition, but we anticipate our\npromotional activity across geographies during Q4 will be higher than originally expected.\nAt this stage in our transformation, we continue to believe marketing investment is essential for\nthe long term as we engage with our community and broaden the knowledge of our\ncompetitive strength, making a clear statement that Olaplex delivers results and stands apart\nfrom other brands. Therefore, we will continue to make such investments in the fourth quarter\nin an effort to maximize our performance during the important holiday season and build for the\nfuture.\nI am proud of the progress we have made so far on our transformation journey as we continue\nto execute against our three key strategic initiatives for 2024. As a reminder, these include\nmaximizing the impact of our sales, marketing and education investments to generate demand,\nstrengthening our capabilities and culture to support our future and developing the long-term\nroad map and future vision for Olaplex.\nInComm Conferencing Page 4 of 18 www.incommconferencing.com\nAs it relates to our first initiative to maximizing the impact of our sales, marketing and\neducation investments to drive demand. One of the most important priorities of our new sales\nand marketing strategy has been to return to our stylist roots and nurture our connection to\nthe pro community. By showing up in salons and listening to stylists' feedback, elevating our\npresence at industry shows and investing in additional educational tools, we aim to increase\nour visibility, demonstrate our commitment and deepen our engagement with this key\naudience. As an industry leader, we also recognize the significant role we play in delivering\ninnovation and new services that can help stylists make their business even more successful.\nTo that end, among our new launches launched during the third quarter, were two products for\ncurly hair consumers, which were developed with the pro in mind. First, our Bond Shaper Curl\nRebuilding Treatment, which is a three-step professional curl treatment to repair, redefine and\nlock in the shape of natural waves, curls and coils, created with new patented technology. And\nsecond, our No. 10 Bond Shaper Curl Defining Gel, which is an at-home reparative curl styling\ngel that revives natural curl pattern.\nTo support these launches, our education team in partnership with our pro ambassadors and\nmembers of the Olaplex Pro Collective influencer team educated at more than 50 national and\nregional trade events and hosted virtual training sessions to educate stylists and our distributor\npartners about our new technology. We are pleased with the early performance as early\nadopter salons across the globe are offering the Bond Shaper Curl Rebuilding Treatment to\ntheir clients and our No. 10 Bond Shaper Curl Defining gel ranked in the Top Three within Ulta\nBeauty's Curl subcategory.\nAnother important initiative for our marketing team during the third quarter was generating\nexcitement and buzz of our consumer-focused new product launch, No. 5 Leave-In Conditioner.\nSupported by a holistic marketing plan with social media and experiential pop-up during New\nYork Fashion Week and trade activations, powered with support from our influencers and pro\nambassadors, the campaign generated strong response with more than 2 million social media\nimpressions, people testing the product and touting its efficacy. Exceeding initial forecast, No. 5\nLeave-In Conditioner became a Top Two SKU on olaplex.com and a Top Five SKU in Sephora's\nU.S. leave-in conditioner subcategory.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we believe these successful launches are signs of a stronger innovation\nengine and improved marketing strategy, delivering enhanced creative partnerships and\nimproved content creation. On our last earnings call, we highlighted a new marketing campaign\nlaunched during the second quarter, featuring the transformative benefits of a complete\nroutine of Olaplex No. 4 Bond Maintenance Shampoo and No. 5 Bond Maintenance\nConditioner. The campaign drove positive lifts and brand favorability above our peer\nbenchmarks, and Olaplex's brand engagement levels have risen year-to-date across our\ncompetitive set.\nInComm Conferencing Page 5 of 18 www.incommconferencing.com\nAlso, we believe our strategic participation in our customers' tentpole marketing events\nindicate strong consumer interest in our brand. For example, our performance during a key\ncustomer's promotion in July was very successful, with nearly 70% of customers during that\nperiod identifying as new Olaplex users and five of our SKUs featured in the event were the #1\nranked items in their respective categories.\nAnd lastly, according to data tracked by CreatorIQ, we regained our position as the #1 U.S. hair\ncare brand in earned media value in the third quarter with momentum building throughout as\nwe earned the #1 spot in both August and September.\nMoving to our second priority to strengthen our capabilities and culture to support our future,\nwe recently strengthened our leadership team with several highly talented appointments who\nwe believe will position Olaplex for future success. Over the last several months, we've added a\nnew Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Catherine Dunleavy, who is here with\nme today, as well as the Chief Marketing Officer and a Senior Vice President of International,\nboth of whom will be important leaders of our go-to-market strategies across the globe.\nWith these new senior leaders in place, we are transforming how we work across the\norganization to strengthen our foundation. We have implemented and continue to deploy\nenhancements to new, integrated business planning approach that will give us a better global\nview of the business. Also, we launched a new strategic planning process, bringing leadership\nteams across the organization together more frequently, working in even greater detail to craft\nthe strategic plans for the future.\nAs it relates to our marketing processes, we are streamlining and integrating how the entire\nmarketing organization engages with our agency partners, developing a more disciplined\napproach that we believe will yield better planning and a higher quality creative content\nengine. We also expect this to strengthen each new product introduction as our new approach\nallows us to present marketing messages that are better aligned with how consumers interact\nwith brands. We have more to do, but we're deep in this work.\nOverall, we believe we are creating a corporate culture that is more collaborative and makes\ninformed decisions based on data and business processes that can be applied across the globe.\nIt's rewarding and exciting to see our teams come together to work towards achieving a\ncommon goal. Our business leaders and team members are energized, committed and working\nhard to move our business forward in a positive way.\nOur third priority is developing the long-term road map and future vision for Olaplex.\nSupported by an in-depth brand perception study rooted in pro and consumer insights, we've\ndeveloped a new and clear brand vision for Olaplex that will start to be visible to the pro and\nconsumer in the coming year. At various stages of this work, we have been in active dialogue\nwith our partners. The feedback from these conversations have been overwhelmingly positive,\nbut there is strong support and excitement for this new phase of Olaplex.\nInComm Conferencing Page 6 of 18 www.incommconferencing.com\nWe also completely redesigned our new product pipeline, development and go-to-market\nprocesses following the creation of our new innovation team to align with our new brand\nvision. We rolled out new commercialization strategies for our product launches with additional\nenhancements planned for the next year. Additionally, as we work to inflect to growth, we're\ncontinuing to finalize our strategic plan and expect to provide details in early 2025.\nIn conclusion, this is a truly transformational period for Olaplex that requires thinking and\nacting for the long term. I remain confident in the brand's strong foundation that we can build\nupon to return to sustainable growth, truly differentiated science that will deliver superior\nresults, a powerful R&D platform, a passionate community of stylists and consumers who love\nour products and a unique global footprint and a talented team that is dedicated to position\nthis brand for success.\nWith that, I will now pass it over to Catherine, who has been a tremendous partner already, and\nthe company and myself are incredibly fortunate to have her with us on this journey.\nCatherine?\nCatherine Dunleavy\nThank you, Amanda, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to speak with you today on my\nfirst earnings call as the Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Olaplex. Since I've\nnot met or spoken with many of you since I joined the company, I thought it would be helpful\nto provide you with a short summary of my background and what I've been focused on during\nthe first 12 weeks of my time at Olaplex.\nFor the past two decades, I have held senior leadership roles at leading global consumer and\nmedia companies, including Away, Nike, Comcast, NBCUniversal and GE. During this time, I led\nand executed strategic operational and financial initiatives that helped drive profitable growth.\nThe decision to join Olaplex was an easy one. As an everyday user, I am a loyal fan of Olaplex\nand have admired how the company disrupted the hair care category with its patented\ntechnology. I also thrive in fast-paced environments and see significant opportunity to take part\nin driving the strategy and elevating the company's financial foundation to provide the\nframework to maximize the power of our brand.\nOlaplex is an innovative company and one of my strengths is managing core functions with\ndiscipline, execution and rigor while also leaving room for flexibility to enable creativity. Having\nbeen in the role for almost 90 days, I am very enthusiastic about the potential ahead. Olaplex\npossesses a strong community of people, partners, stylists and consumers, and I am proud to\nbe in a position to help shape our future.\nI recognize there are many opportunities to bring operational best practices to life at Olaplex,\nand I look forward to helping the company to continue to build out an infrastructure that will\nsupport future growth for this business.\nInComm Conferencing Page 7 of 18 www.incommconferencing.com\nNow, let me share more details about our third quarter results and our updated outlook. Net\nsales for the third quarter declined 3.6% year-over-year to $119.1 million. Although our Q3 net\nsales performance improved sequentially from the second quarter, this result was below our\nexpectation with the underperformance largely driven by our international business. For the\nquarter, we continue to observe sell-through trends at our key accounts in the U.S. that are\nlargely consistent with what have been seen throughout the year on an absolute dollar basis.\nOutside the U.S., sell-in was negatively impacted by our ongoing efforts to realign our business,\nas well as a moderation in demand trends due to slower investment in international sales and\nmarketing, as Amanda discussed earlier. We continue to believe that the months on hand of\ncore inventory positions at our major U.S. accounts remain in healthy position.\nIn regards to performance by channel, specialty retail sales were little changed, down 1.3%\nyear-over-year to $42.6 million, with our performance reflective of increased competitive\nintensity on our core SKUs, partially offset by the addition of product launches. Professional\nchannel net sales decreased 12.6% year-over-year to $42.2 million, driven by our international\nbusiness, which decreased due to weaker demand and a focus on prioritizing international\ndistributors and partners that build brand equity, which more than offset the slight growth in\nour North American professional business.\nDirect-to-consumer sales were up 6.8% year-over-year compared to the third quarter of 2023\nto $34.3 million due to strong sell-in ahead of a successful major customer promotion in July\nand growth from olaplex.com, which increased double digits year-over-year. This growth was\npartially offset by a decline in international DTC.\nMoving on, adjusted gross profit margin was 70.8%, up 110 basis points from 69.7% in the third\nquarter of 2023. This expansion was primarily driven by favorability due to lapping higher levels\nof inventory obsolescence reserves from last year. This increase was partially offset by\ncontraction primarily due to an unfavorable product mix driven by the sell-in of holiday kits,\nwhich are highly profitable, but lower margin relative to the rest of our assortment, as well as\nslight deleverage on warehouse and distribution costs.\nAdjusted SG&A increased to $40.4 million compared to $33.7 million in the third quarter of\n2023, driven primarily by an increase in sales and marketing expense. During the third quarter\nof 2024, we spent approximately $16 million in non-payroll-related advertising and marketing\nexpenses compared to approximately the same amount in the second quarter of 2024, bringing\nthe year-to-date total to approximately $43 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA declined 13.4% to $44.6 million versus $51.5 million in the third quarter of\n2023. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 37.5% compared to 41.7% a year ago. Adjusted net income\ndecreased to $28.7 million or $0.04 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2024 from $33.4\nmillion or $0.05 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2023.\nInComm Conferencing Page 8 of 18 www.incommconferencing.com\nLet me now turn to our balance sheet. Inventory at the end of the third quarter of 2024 was\n$85.9 million, a decrease of $14.3 million from $100.2 million at the end of the second quarter\nof 2024. The sequential decrease was primarily the result of the sell-in of our holiday kits and\nnew products during the third quarter.\nMoving to cash flow. During the first nine months of 2024, we generated $93.4 million of cash\nfrom operations. We anticipate that 2024 will be another year of healthy cash flow generation\nas we continue to drive an asset-light model and high profitability. We ended the third quarter\nwith $538.8 million in cash and cash equivalents, an increase of $30.9 million from the end of\nthe second quarter of 2024. This cash is generating interest income at an annual rate of about\n5%. Long-term debt, net of current position of deferred fees was $645 million.\nNow, turning to our financial outlook. As disclosed in the press release issued this morning, we\nare revising our guidance for fiscal year 2024. Starting with the top line, for fiscal year 2024, we\nnow expect net sales in the range of $405 million to $415 million, down from the previous\nrange of $435 million to $463 million.\nAs Amanda mentioned earlier in the call, the revision can be broken down into three primary\nbuckets. First, we anticipate weaker performance from our international business. As Amanda\ndiscussed earlier, we have performed a deeper assessment of our international operations and\ndiscovered that the issues are more complex than we originally thought. We are now redefining\nour international go-to-market strategy.\nSecond, while we believe we continue to observe sell-through trends in our U.S. key accounts\nthat are largely consistent on an absolute dollar basis with what we have seen throughout the\nyear and our key accounts remain in healthy core inventory positions, we are not yet\nexperiencing the anticipated lift in demand from the deployment of new sales and marketing\ninvestments.\nAnd third, we anticipate increased promotional activity during the holiday period across\ngeographies relative to our previous assumptions.\nIn the fourth quarter, from the perspective of year-over-year net sales growth rates in order of\nmagnitude, we expect our professional channel to be the most pressured followed by our\ndirect-to-consumer and specialty retail. We now anticipate adjusted gross margin in the range\nof 70.9% to 71.6% compared to our initial assumption in the range of 72.5% to 73.1%. We\nexpect that the primary driver of this decrease will be additional promotional activity during the\nfourth quarter and greater deleverage from lower sales volumes on our fixed warehousing\ncosts.\nFurthermore, we now expect full year 2024 adjusted SG&A expenses in the range of $167\nmillion to $170 million compared to our previous expectation of $172 million to $179 million.\nSpecifically, we expect full year non-payroll-related advertising and marketing expenses in the\nInComm Conferencing Page 9 of 18 www.incommconferencing.com\nrange of $62 million to $65 million compared to our previous assumption of $66 million to $70\nmillion as we continue to invest through our transformation.\nGiven the lower net sales forecast against our expectations for continued investment in\noperating expenses, we now expect more adjusted EBITDA deleverage than our prior\nassumption. For 2024, we expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $121 million to $127 million\nor a margin of 29.9% to 30.6%. This compares to our previous range of $143 million to $159\nmillion or a margin of 32.8% to 34.3%. We expect net interest expense to be $34 million, and an\nadjusted effective tax rate of approximately 19.5% for the year.\nIn conclusion, Olaplex has significant competitive strengths that we believe we can build upon\nto deliver consistent and sustained rates of growth. We believe that we have identified key\nissues that have contributed to recent challenges as well as the appropriate actions to correct\nthem. Fundamentally, we are working to build a better Olaplex, strengthening operating\ndiscipline, improving our business and financial processes and maintaining strong cash\ngeneration. I look forward to sharing our progress along the way.\nI will now pass it over to Amanda for some closing remarks.\nAmanda Baldwin\nThank you, Catherine. Olaplex remains an incredibly powerful brand, a leader in the attractive\nhigh-growth prestige hair care category and an important strategic partner for our customers\nwho are supportive of and excited about the direction we are taking the business. The\ntrajectory of our transformation may have shifted, we are progressing and making the tough\ndecisions that we believe are necessary to create a healthy business set up for long-term\nsuccess. Ultimately, we believe we are still in the early stages of the history of this company and\nthat Olaplex can perform at a higher level. I remain optimistic as ever about the future.\nThis concludes our prepared remarks. We will now turn the call back over to the operator for\nquestions. Operator?\nOperator\nThank you. We will now conduct a question-and-answer session. If you would like to ask a\nquestion, please press Star 1 on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate your\nline is in the question queue. You may press Star 2 if you'd like to remove your question from\nthe queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your\nhandset before pressing the Star key. Once again, that's Star 1 at this time. One moment while\nwe poll for our first question.\nOur first question comes from Jungwon Kim with TD Cowen. Please proceed.\nJungwon Kim\nInComm Conferencing Page 10 of 18 www.incommconferencing.com\nThank you for taking my question. Just curious on the overall consumer health, what you're\nseeing at the salon and as well as your DTC and on the retail side overall? You've mentioned\nhigher promotions. Do you think it's more because the consumers are cautious? I would love\nany color there. And I would love to dig a little bit deeper into what you saw in terms of your\ninternational business. What are your, you know, key assessment there? And how you're\nthinking about the opportunity going forward and what it could be as a percentage of the mix\nover time? Thank you so much.\nAmanda Baldwin\nThank you for the question, and thank you, everyone, for being here today. You know, first, I'll\ntake the first half of that, which is with respect to kind of what we're seeing around the\nconsumer, and I believe you're asking about both within the salon channel as well as, you know,\nretail and the consumer more broadly. You know, within the salon channel, I think we've been\ntalking about, you know, earlier on throughout the year about overall trends within the salon\ncategory where there certainly over time has been less frequent visits into the salon. That\nhasn't changed in either direction in particular. I think it is sort of the way that people are\nthinking about their salon. And certainly, part of our focus and our strategy in supporting the\nstylist and rooted behind the launch of something like Bond Shaper Curl Rebonding Treatment\nis really supporting the stylists and making sure there's more reasons to come back to the\nsalon. So, we're excited to really support our stylists in that way.\nWith respect to the consumer overall, yes, we did make a very conscious decision as we were\nthinking about going into this quarter and watching what we're seeing out in the marketplace\nand expecting overall a more promotional environment, making sure we're doing that, both,\nyou know, some typical promotions, which we do use from a strategic point of view around key\ntentpole moments, but also in trade marketing and overall support for our retailer partners,\nboth on the pro side as well as to the consumer. So, that is something that we're watching\ncarefully. And I think, you know, we'll see a lot of the things that many others have been talking\nabout as we go into this key holiday season.\nWith respect to international, I have spent a lot of time very recently on this topic. The first\nthing I would say is that the enthusiasm for this brand is incredibly strong. One of the things\nand one of the reasons why I joined this brand nearly a year ago was because I think it's very\nrare to find brands that have such global resonance. And that I have now seen on the ground,\nhaving been with consumers, having been with our retailer partners, distributor partners,\nsitting in salons around the world, this product really resonates and really translates.\nI think what we've really learned and what we were talking about today was that in order to\nensure that we really maximize that opportunity, we need to be much closer. We can't have\narms relationships. We need to be much more involved with our distributor partners. We need\nto be better with translating our marketing efforts, all the things that we've started working on\nhere in the United States that we are seeing early signs of opportunity around our marketing\nefforts. We need to be translating those internationally. And so, in order to do that, that does\nInComm Conferencing Page 11 of 18 www.incommconferencing.com\nrequire making sure that we have fewer, bigger partnerships that we are -- you know, that was\npart of the rationale of bringing on someone to lead that part of our business, so that we're just\nbetter partners, and we can support this brand globally.\nJungwon Kim\nThank you.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Ashley Helgans with Jefferies. Please proceed.\nAshley Helgans\nHi, thanks so much for taking our question. So, I know you kind of talked about not yet seeing\nthe marketing efforts provide any sort of lift. Just any more color on when you expect to start\nto see a lift? And any changes you think you need to make to the strategy? Thanks so much.\nAmanda Baldwin\nYes. Thanks for the question. I want to make sure that we really pull apart what we are seeing\nwithin our new launches and what we want to see across the entire portfolio and to draw a\ndistinction between those two. So, if we recall, you know, in marketing and sales education,\nyou know, I really believe that brand is the thing that will -- you know, along with innovation,\nwill drive this business going forward. We've spent a lot of time, as we talked about, getting the\nbrand, you know, vision right, getting the future product pipeline right. And what we had this\nfall was the opportunity to have two new launches and to start the process of really building a\nmarketing muscle in this organization.\nWe've seen a lot of really good things happen out of that. One of the things that we highlighted\nin the call was our No. 5 Leave-In Conditioner. I think that's really the first time that this brand\nhas had, what I'll call, a full 360 approach, a tight partnership with Sephora, the ability to launch\nan exclusive SKU with them to really put the right experiential marketing, the right influencer\nmarketing, the right kind of assets, the right kind of language. I mean we've been talking about\nthis really since the beginning about, it's not just the money we spend, but it's how we spend it.\nAnd that launch is outperforming our expectations. So, that's really exciting to see.\nWhat we need to see going forward and the thing that is sort of driving our guidance today is\nwe need to make sure that we have that across the entire portfolio. And that's really going to\nbe Phase Two of this. And as we think about going forward and how, you know, we have a\nbrand new CMO, Katie Gohman, who joined us in July, and she's fantastic and I think really\nhelping us take this to the next level. So, these things are a work in progress, but I do feel like\nwe're on the right track that we have, you know, again, a brand vision that I alluded to, and I\nlook forward to sharing more about that, as that becomes, you know, out in the world, and we\nhave a great product pipeline. And so, we're going to get better and better at this.\nAshley Helgans\nInComm Conferencing Page 12 of 18 www.incommconferencing.com\nThanks so much.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Susan Anderson with Canaccord. Please proceed.\nAlec Legg\nHi, good morning. Alec Legg on for Susan. On the fourth quarter sales really does take a big step\ndown with the updated guide. How much of that is from the international realignment and\nexpectations for how the U.S. will perform? Thank you.\nCatherine Dunleavy\nHi. Thanks for the question. Yes, international is the primary driver of what is driving our fourth\nquarter guidance down. While all three are very important, it really is mainly the international\nand the impacts of other two on international.\nAlec Legg\nThanks. And then just a follow-up. I guess, with international being reset and realigned, what is\nthe expectation for sales to start stabilizing? How long do you think it will take to kind of\nrecreate the brand that you're trying to work in -- with the distributors over in Europe? Thank\nyou.\nCatherine Dunleavy\nWell, we're still working through our plans for 2025 and beyond, and we're not really providing\nguidance today. But I can tell you a couple of things. One, as Amanda and I mentioned earlier,\nin our home market, on a week in and week out basis, our selling -- are relatively consistent. So,\nwe started in the U.S. and put in place our actions, and that is starting to work. So, then we just\nhave to take that playbook and put it in international. And as Amanda described, she spent a lot\nof time market by market, creating a very detailed strategic plan for how we're going to go to\nmarket. So, this is a transformation. It will take some time, but we're confident we've identified\nthe right actions to drive future success. And I'll just add that we are very fortunate to have a\nstrong balance sheet and healthy cash flow that allows us to make the tough decisions and\ncontinue to invest for long-term future profitability.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Korinne Wolfmeyer with Piper Sandler. Please proceed.\nKorinne Wolfmeyer\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I'd like to touch a little bit on the cost\nstructure and how we should be thinking about that for Q4 and heading into 2025. I believe the\nSG&A guidance implies still a meaningful step-up in Q4, even though you're pulling back on\nsome of the marketing and ad spend. So, can you touch on, you know, what's driving that\nnumber? And then as we head into 2025, how should we be thinking about your marketing and\nadvertising budget relative to the rest of the SG&A expense? Thanks.\nInComm Conferencing Page 13 of 18 www.incommconferencing.com\nAmanda Baldwin\nSo, thanks for the question. I think that, you know, as Catherine alluded to, we think it's\nimportant to continue to invest behind this brand in the fourth quarter. And so, you know, we'll\ncontinue to make sure that we're building for the future. We aren't providing guidance for 2025\nat this time, but, you know, we certainly are learning a lot as we, you know, as I talked about\nbefore. We're learning a lot from our marketing efforts that will help drive our planning for next\nyear. We're spending a lot of time on this international business, so we really understand what\nit's going to take to set that up for success as well as really, you know, spending a lot of time on\nthe road now with the future brand vision and really working with our partners to plan for next\nyear.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed.\nShovana Chowdhury\nThis is Shovana Chowdhury on for Andrea. Can you give us a little bit more insight on the\ninternational competitive landscape and your confidence level in bringing about fruitful results\nby realigning distribution network and updating the marketing strategy outside the U.S.? And\nadditionally, if I can tack another one, understand that the guidance was lower mainly due to\nthe international space. But in quarter 3, the U.S. market top line also declined by 3.3%. So, if\nyou could just tell us a little bit more like what is causing -- understand that it has to do with not\nseeing the lift in demand, but your new launches were doing pretty well as per the\ncommentary. Thank you.\nAmanda Baldwin\nSo, yes. I can take that -- that first one as we think about the international competitive\nlandscape. I think what you see is similar to a lot of different brands and different categories in\nbeauty. You'll see some global players who will be very similar across the globe. And then you\nobviously see some more local players. And that's, you know, when I was speaking earlier about\nkind of really getting on the ground, understanding the dynamics, understanding the different\nchannels, being in salons, being in the stores, watching what's happening online, really\nunderstanding what the consumer is seeing and what they're -- as well as the stylists and what\nthey're looking for in their respective markets.\nWhat I would say is it's more similar than it is different. There are certainly, like anything else,\nsome global nuances to this to be mindful of. And we do have a business that has incredible\nreach. And I think, again, I think there's a lot of appeal for this brand and the fundamental\nnature of hair health, of hair repair is something that is very consistent. But how you might\napproach the market. And that's actually a big advantage to having a distributor network, is\nthat they are on the ground, that they do really understand the nuances of their individual\nmarkets.\nInComm Conferencing Page 14 of 18 www.incommconferencing.com\nSo, we -- again, this is about a closer partnership about having much more involvement in how\nwe're going to market in these places and making sure that we're kind of taking advantage of\nboth of our sets of expertise, ours of our own brand and what it can do, that we're translating\nour marketing, our sales and our education across the globe and that we're leveraging those\npartnerships to be closer to the consumer, to be closer to the stylists and really have, you know,\nour hands -- you know, arms, legs, ears, eyes on the ground for us. So, that's really how we're\nthinking about that part of the business.\nCatherine Dunleavy\nAnd then I'll try to address your Q3 question. In Q3, our professional sales were down 12.6%\nand our retail sales were, you know, only down about 1.3% and our DTC was up. And then I\nthink your question was specifically in the retail channel, what were we seeing there? And, you\nknow, it was down 1.3%. We did see some timing with some of our major customers with the\nsell-in of holiday kits. And so, that might be some of the variance that you're seeing.\nShovana Chowdhury\nThank you for the color. I'll pass it on.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please proceed.\nLauren Lieberman\nHi, thanks. Good morning. Amanda, I missed the beginning of the call, so apologies if you've\nkind of directly answered this already. But, you know, I know you talked about it's taking longer\nto see the lift on new product launches and the new campaigns, but also spoke about the\nsuccess of the Leave-In Conditioner. So, I just wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about\nalmost like a postmortem on the -- what's not worked so far and why, you know, as contrasted\nto what has gone well with that Leave-In Conditioner product? And I know you talked about the\n360 on the Leave-In, so maybe it's more about the what wasn't working on the earlier pieces?\nThanks.\nAmanda Baldwin\nYes. I mean, I think the places were -- and as you can imagine, we certainly have done a lot of\nour own internal reflections. And we have, like I said, a brand-new CMO who joins us with an\nextraordinary background. She's really dug in on this with her team, and it is something that we\nreally think is very important as we go forward to make sure we understand what works and\nwhat doesn't and kind of continue to improve over time. That's certainly something I believe\nstrongly in. Again, I think what we really are seeing is that the brand resonates, right? I think\nthat's a very important thing to talk about that as we improve our marketing muscle, that the\npro responds, that the client response, right, like that was really what we needed to understand\nthis year, so that we have that information as we go into, you know, a future brand vision as we\nbring on this team as we build the muscle.\nInComm Conferencing Page 15 of 18 www.incommconferencing.com\nI think we feel, again, that there's some very important signs of success. One of the things that,\nyou know, we talked about very early on when I joined was this concept of creator-led\nmarketing. The concept -- and that is something that is, you know, certainly at the helm of a lot\nof how beauty industry operates and it is something that we really believe that we can do very\nsuccessfully. It was also the first time with the Leave-In Conditioner that we had an experiential\nevent, so a physical pop-up that we did for Fashion Week here in New York. And certainly, I had\nthe fun of getting to go to that and, you know, lines around the block. But I think that what was\nso interesting and exciting about that was that people really -- again, they wanted to see the\nbrand, they wanted to experience the brand, but they were also really curious about our\nscience.\nAnd that is something that we're seeing across the board is that people really do see the power\nof this product. They are interested in how it works. They're interested in how to use it. They\nwant to know about that, and we are getting better and better at explaining that. I think that\nwas also something that I called out very early on is that we have this unbelievable technical\nfoundation. We need to get much better at explaining it and explaining it, whether it's to a\nstylist, to a consumer and social media and influencers, leveraging the power of that technology\nand translating it into language that really makes sense for the broader universe is something\nthat I think, you know, I look at it as a really exciting proof point for what we're seeing today.\nBut, you know, I'll always be of the mindset we can do better. We can -- and that's certainly\nsomething that Catie and I share, and we'll continue to evolve our processes and the marketing\nthat we put up.\nLauren Lieberman\nAll right. Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Olivia Tong with Raymond James. Please proceed.\nOlivia Tong Cheang\nGreat, thanks. With respect to international, do you have a sense on how much has to come\nout of it and how long it will take? And what the business looks like after you have rightsized it?\nAnd more importantly, why do you think now is the right time to make the international\nchanges you're planning? Obviously, you've got quite a bit on your to-do list already. So, where\nis the incremental manpower coming from to drive more of a cleanup in international markets\nright now? Thanks.\nAmanda Baldwin\nI think, yes, we have the good fortune of being able to make the hard choices, right, and to\nmake sure that we're building for the future. And so, you know, I really believe -- and we've\ntalked about that the power of marketing, sales, education and innovation, those are the things\nthat are going to drive this business forward. We believe that we need to realign that\ninternational business in order to take advantage of that. So, I do think it's important. Like I\nInComm Conferencing Page 16 of 18 www.incommconferencing.com\nsaid, however, there is a lot of enthusiasm for this brand, so we're going to do this in the right\nway. So, at this point, I'm not going to be able to give a timeline. But, you know, we'll do the\nsame thing that we've done with everything else in this business is that we're going to operate\nwith a sense of urgency that's important in a transformation, but we're also going to take the\ntime to make sure we do the right analysis that we pick the right partners, that we do this in the\nright way. And those will obviously be in balance, and we'll certainly keep people posted as we\nwork through this.\nOlivia Tong Cheang\nGot it. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you. The last question will be from Rob Ottenstein with Evercore. Please proceed.\nRobert Ottenstein\nHi, thank you. You kind of touched on this a couple of times, but I just maybe want to give it\nanother shot and drill down a little bit. You know, I think all of us, you know, who have been\ninvolved were incredibly impressed with the product, the technology, the efficacy, right? And\nthen something happened and there were social media issues. And I think you're largely behind\nthat. Correct me if I'm wrong. But I think what may have also happened is, you know, increased\ncompetition that may have confused the consumer, you know, with various different kind of\nbonding products or trying to, you know, play off your claims, but in different ways. And so, I\nguess the question is, is, you know, is consumer confusion part of the problem? And then to the\nextent that is, and I know you talked about better communication, but can you be maybe even\nmore specific about how to deal with that confusion and how you can actually get across, you\nknow, that you're unique in terms of the science and the efficacy? And again, I know you\ntouched on it, but it's so important. I was just wondering if you can kind of address it a little bit\nmore? Thank you.\nAmanda Baldwin\nYes, absolutely. And I think it's a great question. I think when, you know, what I was saying\nbefore a little bit about the importance of our ability to explain our science, that is the crux of\nit, right? How do you take something that is truly world-class patented technology, it's\ncomplicated stuff, right? And how do you take that and how do you translate that to the\nconsumer? This is the place that we're really focused. And again, I think we're seeing some\nearly signs of success. We've made some very material changes in how we're approaching social\nmedia, how we're creating content.\nYou know, certainly, if you were to go on our Instagram page and you looked at it 12 months\nago and you look at it now, it's going to look different. That, I think, is a good indicator of how\nwe're approaching science in a different way and how are we thinking how we communicate\nbecause I think you are right that we need to make sure that people are clear on what sets us\napart. Just because we know that we are, doesn't mean that the consumer knows that and that\nInComm Conferencing Page 17 of 18 www.incommconferencing.com\nthe stylist knows that. And those are related, but not 100% the same thing, right? There's\noverlap in how they consume information, but there's also unique channels about it. So, that's\nsomething that we're thinking a lot about as we continue to build our marketing muscle.\nAnd then I think it's also the importance of innovation and the importance of introducing new\nSKUs that allow us to continue to push the boundaries of innovation. And I would say that I\nreally believe that this brand is certainly harnessing the power of bond building technology, but\nthis is way more than a bond brand. This is a prestige hair care brand. I really believe that, that's\nthe category that we compete in, that it's very important to establish the brand in that way and\nto communicate that way because that will, I really believe, increase our ability to really be a\npart of people's daily hair care routines.\nRobert Ottenstein\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you. At this time, I would like to turn the floor back to Amanda Baldwin for closing\nremarks.\nAmanda Baldwin\nWell, you know, I'll just say thank you for everyone who joined this morning, and please do\nreach out with any further questions.\nOperator\nThank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this\ntime. Thank you for your participation and have a great day.\nInComm Conferencing Page 18 of 18 www.incommconferencing.com"
