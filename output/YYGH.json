The movement of $2,952,470 in operating activities was primarily attributable to several key factors. First, there was an increase in operating expenses, driven by higher salaries and wages resulting from annual raises and the hiring of additional staff. The Company also expanded its marketing expenditures to maintain the market share. Following the IPO, the Company has reduced its use of AR factoring which is typically used to hedge the cash flow associated with account receivable. The reduction has resulted in an increase in accounts receivable. Concurrently, the Company engaged more subcontractors to support its business expansion, resulting in shorter payment terms. Additionally, the company made prepayments for IT enhancement costs and consultation fees which contributed to the overall increase in operating outflows during this period.\n\n**About Us**\n\nAt YY Group Holding, we are driven by a vision to shape futures and revolutionize industries. Our journey began with a mission to bridge the gap between talent and opportunity. Over the years, we have transformed into a premier talent acquisition and technology solutions conglomerate, operating across Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand.
