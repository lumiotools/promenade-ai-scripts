On the regulatory front, we are working closely with the FDA on our application for full body scanning, and the European Union regulatory bodies to complete the CE Mark designation process. We believe securing these approvals will further solidify our position in the market, while significantly expanding our total addressable market. Coupled with our growing sales and support infrastructure we have established this past year, we are well-positioned to maintain our strong commercial momentum into 2025 and beyond.”\n\n**Financial results for three months ended September 30, 2024**\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 (the “reported period”), the Company reported a net loss of $13.6 million, compared to a net loss of $21.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 (which is referred as the “comparable period”), representing a decrease of $7.8 million. The decrease was largely due to a decrease of $7.4 million in expenses related to the impairment of Goodwill which were recorded in the comparable period.\n\nThe Company reported revenue of $3.0 million in the reported period, compared to $2.5 million in the comparable period. During the reported period, the Company generated revenue through teleradiology services, the sales of its Imaging devices and services and the sale of its AI solutions. \n\nThe Company’s gross loss during the reported period totaled $2.8 million (gross loss margin of 93%) on a GAAP basis, as compared to $1.7 million (gross loss margin of 67%) in the comparable period. Non-GAAP gross loss for the reported period was $0.2 million (gross loss margin of approximately 6%), as compared to Non-GAAP gross profit of $0.9 million (gross profit margin of approximately 37%) in the comparable period.\n\nThe Company’s revenue from teleradiology services for the reported period was $2.6 million, compared to revenue of $2.2 million in the comparable period. The increase in the Company’s revenue from teleradiology services was mainly attributable to customer retention and increased volume of the Company’s reading services during the weekdays shifts.\n\nThe Company’s GAAP gross profit from teleradiology services for the reported period was $0.3 million (gross profit margin of approximately 13%), compared to $0.2 million (gross profit margin of approximately 11%) in the comparable period. Non-GAAP gross profit of the Company’s teleradiology services for the reported period was $0.9 million (gross profit margin of approximately 35%) compared to gross profit of $0.8 million (gross profit margin of approximately 36%) in the comparable period.\n\nDuring the reported period the Company generated revenue through the sales and deployment of its imaging systems which amounted to $29 thousand for the reported period, with a gross loss of $1.5 million on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis compared to revenue of $99 thousand with a gross profit of $36 thousand (gross profit margin of approximately 37%) on a GAAP and Non-GAAP basis in the comparable period. The revenue stems from the sale and deployment of our 2D systems in Africa and our Nanox.ARC systems in the U.S.\n\nThe Company’s revenue from its AI solutions for the reported period was $0.4 million with a gross loss of $1.6 million on a GAAP basis, compared to revenue of $141 thousand with a gross loss of $1.9 million in the comparable period. Non-GAAP gross profit of the Company’s AI solutions for the reported period was $0.4 million, compared to $0.1 million in the comparable period.\n\nResearch and development expenses, net, for the reported period were $4.7 million, compared to $6.0 million in the comparable period, reflecting a decrease of $1.3 million. The decrease was mainly due to a decrease of $0.3 million in salaries and wages and a decrease of $0.4 million in share-based compensation and $0.6 million in expenses related to our research and development activities.\n\nSales and marketing expenses for the reported period were $0.9 million compared to $1.1 in the comparable period.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the reported period were $5.7 million, compared to $5.0 million in the comparable period. The increase of $0.7 million was mainly due to an increase of $0.5 million in share-based compensation, increase in our legal expenses in the amount of $0.5 million which was offset by a decrease in the cost of the directors’ and officers’ liability insurance premium in the amount of $0.3 million.\n\nNon-GAAP net loss attributable to ordinary shares for the reported period was $8.7 million, compared to $9.4 million in the comparable period. The decrease of $0.7 million was mainly due to a decrease in non-GAAP operating expenses of $1.8 which was offset by a decrease of $1.1 million in our non-GAAP gross profit.\n\nNon-GAAP gross loss for the reported period was $0.2 million, compared to a Non-GAAP gross profit of $0.9 million in the comparable period. Non-GAAP research and development expenses, net for the reported period, were $4.0 million, compared to $4.9 million in the comparable period. Non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses for the reported period were $0.6 million, compared to $0.9 million in the comparable period. Non-GAAP general and administrative expenses for the reported and comparable periods were $4.5 million.\n\nThe difference between the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures above is mainly attributable to amortization of intangible assets, share-based compensation, change in contingent earnout liability, impairment of Goodwill, expenses related to an offering and legal fees in connection with the class-action litigation and the SEC investigation. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures for the three- and nine-months periods ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 is provided in the financial results that are part of this press release.\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nAs of September, 30, 2024, the Company had total cash, cash equivalents, restricted deposits and marketable securities of $57.1 million, compared to $82.8 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease of $25.7 million during the reported period was primarily due to negative cash flow from operations of $26.1 million.\n\n**Other Assets**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024 the Company had property and equipment of $44.7 million, compared to $42.3 million as of December 31, 2023.\n\nAs of September, 30, 2024, the Company had intangible assets of $72.6 million compared to $80.6 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease was attributable to the periodic amortization of intangible assets in the amount of $8.0 million.\n\n**Shareholders’ Equity**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately 58.5 million shares outstanding. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had approximately 57.8 million shares outstanding.\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast Details**\n\n_Tuesday, November 21, 2024 @ 8:30am ET_\n\nIndividuals interested in listening to the conference call may do so by joining the live webcast on the Investors section of the Nanox website under Events and Presentations.

dollars in thousands (except per share data))**  \n---  \n  \n**_Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures_**\n\nThe unaudited condensed consolidated financial information is prepared in conformity with GAAP. The Company uses information about certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including non-GAAP net loss attributable to ordinary shares, non-GAAP cost of revenue, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP research and development expenses non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses, non-GAAP general and administrative expenses, Non-GAAP other expenses (income) and non-GAAP basic and diluted loss per share. These non-GAAP measures are adjusted for (as applicable) amortization of intangible assets, share-based compensation expenses, impairment of Goodwill, change in contingent earnout liability, expenses related to an offering and legal fees in connection with the class-action litigation and the SEC investigation. The Company believes that separate analysis and exclusion of the one-off or non-cash impact of the above reconciling items (as applicable) adds clarity to the constituent parts of its performance. The Company reviews these non-GAAP financial measures together with GAAP financial measures to obtain a better understanding of its operating performance. It uses the non-GAAP financial measures for planning, forecasting, and measuring results against the forecast. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures are useful supplemental information for investors and analysts to assess its operating performance. However, these non-GAAP measures are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and, accordingly, should not be considered as alternatives to GAAP measures as indicators of operating performance.\n\n**Reconciliation of GAAP net loss attributable to ordinary shares to Non-GAAP net loss attributable to ordinary shares and Non-GAAP basic and diluted loss per share (U.S. dollars in thousands)**\n\n**Nine Months Ended**| **Three Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n**September 30,**| **September 30,**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \n**GAAP net loss attributable to ordinary shares**|  39,455| 50,528| 13,639| 21,403  \nNon-GAAP adjustments:  \nLess (Add): Class-action litigation and SEC investigation| 76| 4,203| -| (214| )  \nLess: Amortization of intangible assets| 7,959| 7,959| 2,653| 2,653  \nLess: Impairment of goodwill| -| 7,420| 7,420  \nLess: Offering expenses| 420| -| -| -
