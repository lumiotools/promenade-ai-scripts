Every year, more than 5,000 people are diagnosed with ALS in the U.S. alone, with an annual disease burden of $1 billion. The number of people living with ALS is expected to grow by 24% by 2040 in the U.S. and EU.\n\n**About ALSFRS-R**\n\nDisease progression is measured by the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R), which is the most widely used ALS tracking tool accepted by the FDA, utilized by neurologists treating ALS patients, in clinical trials, and by other regulators to determine disease progression. It tracks 12 changes in a person's physical abilities over time including functions such as: speech, walking, climbing stairs, dressing/hygiene, handwriting, turning in bed, cutting food, salivation, swallowing, and breathing. A single point change on the ALSFRS-R has a significant impact on ALS patients, such as the transition from independent feeding to requiring assistance or independent breathing to needing to use a machine ventilator.\n\n**About PARADIGM**\n\nPARADIGM is a prospective, multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b ([NCT05357950](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05357950)) clinical trial of PrimeC in ALS. The trial included 68 participants living with ALS in Canada, Italy, and Israel. 96% of the trial participants who completed the 6-month double-blind portion of the trial chose to receive treatment with PrimeC through a 12-month open label extension. Furthermore, to date (June 2024) all participants that completed the 18-month trial treatment duration, requested to continue PrimeC, which is provided to them in an Investigator Initiated Trial, not limited with time.\n\nAs previously reported, in the 6-month double-blind segment of the trial, the data showed clinically meaningful signs of efficacy with a 29% difference in favor of PrimeC vs placebo in analysis of the intent to treat (ITT) population. In the PP top-line analysis from PARADIGM, a statistically significant slowing of disease progression was observed with a 37.4% (p=0.03) difference in ALSFRS-R in favor of PrimeC vs placebo. Most patients enrolled in both the active and placebo arms of the trial were concurrently treated with Riluzole, the ALS standard of care medication, indicating PrimeC slowed disease progression well beyond the level afforded by the FDA approved ALS drug.\n\n**About PrimeC**\n\nPrimeC, NeuroSense's lead drug candidate, is a novel extended-release oral formulation composed of a unique fixed-dose combination of two FDA-approved drugs: ciprofloxacin and celecoxib. PrimeC is designed to synergistically target several key mechanisms of ALS that contribute to motor neuron degeneration, inflammation, iron accumulation and impaired ribonucleic acid (\"RNA\") regulation to potentially inhibit the progression of ALS. NeuroSense completed a Phase 2a clinical trial which met its safety and efficacy endpoints including reducing functional and respiratory deterioration and statistically significant changes in ALS-related biological markers indicating PrimeC's biological activity. PrimeC was granted Orphan Drug Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency.\n\n**About****NeuroSense**\n\nNeuroSense Therapeutics, Ltd. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on discovering and developing treatments for patients suffering from debilitating neurodegenerative diseases. NeuroSense believes that these diseases, which include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, among others, represent one of the most significant unmet medical needs of our time, with limited effective therapeutic options available for patients to date. Due to the complexity of neurodegenerative diseases and based on strong scientific research on a large panel of related biomarkers, NeuroSense's strategy is to develop combined therapies targeting multiple pathways associated with these diseases.\n\nFor additional information, we invite you to visit our [website](http://www.neurosense-tx.com/) and follow us on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/neurosense-therapeutics/mycompany/), [YouTube ](https://www.youtube.com/@neurosensetherapeutics5471)and [X](https://twitter.com/NeurosenseT).

These results illuminate a new frontier in the treatment of ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis), a disease long considered untreatable at its core. The trial demonstrating the significant impact of PrimeC on the regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs), which play a key role in ALS progression, providing compelling evidence of the drug's potential to alter the underlying mechanisms of the disease.\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/NeuroSense Therapeutics\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1707291/NeuroSense_Therapeutics_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1707291/NeuroSense_Therapeutics_Logo.html)\n\nALS is a fatal disease, known for its relentless destruction of motor neurons, leading to loss of muscle function, speech, and eventually, the ability to breathe. Understanding the molecular drivers of ALS is key to finding a way to slow or stop its progression. These findings represent a breakthrough in that understanding.\n\n**Key Findings** :\n\n  * **Regulation ofCritical miRNAs** : The PARADIGM trial revealed that PrimeC regulates specific miRNAs - key genetic markers that control gene expression involved in ALS progression. These miRNAs were unchanged in the placebo group, underscoring the profound impact of PrimeC on ALS's pathological pathways. MicroRNAs play a crucial role in regulating how genes express themselves, and their dysregulation has long been linked to ALS. By restoring balance to these genetic regulators, PrimeC offers a new method of combating this devastating disease.\n  * **Restoring miRNA Balance in ALS Treatment:** PrimeC enhances microRNA (miRNA) maturation, addressing the underlying mechanisms of ALS. By influencing Dicer, the endonuclease that processes precursor miRNA into active forms, PrimeC may restore the balance of dysregulated miRNAs in ALS patients. This modulation is thought to facilitate the production of functional miRNAs that regulate gene expression, allowing PrimeC to target disrupted genetic pathways in ALS and potentially slow disease progression and improve patient outcomes. **Clear Differentiation from Placebo** : Patients treated with PrimeC demonstrated consistent effect in miRNA manifestation, with no similar changes seen in the placebo group. This clear distinction offers compelling evidence of PrimeC's potential as a disease modifying treatment, rather than a symptomatic one.\n\n\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn conclusion, PrimeC demonstrated beneficial regulation of key miRNAs, supporting its potential to engage critical genetic targets involved in ALS progression. The 2-fold reduction of several miRNAs following PrimeC treatment is particularly striking, offering both a powerful biomarker for tracking ALS and a potential pathway for new therapeutic strategies. This regulation of miRNAs underscores PrimeC's capability to influence ALS at the regulatory level, where previous treatments have struggled.\n\nThis work was done in collaboration with Professor Noam Shomron who is a world-leading scientist in the field of genetics.\n\nThe results from the PARADIGM trial reflect NeuroSense Therapeutics' dedication to developing treatments that go beyond surface-level symptom management, aiming instead to address the root causes of neurodegenerative diseases. PrimeC's ability to regulate miRNAs represents an important step toward a future where ALS patients have more therapeutic options.\n\nFor more information about NeuroSense Therapeutics and its ongoing research, visit[ ](http://www.neurosense-tx.com/) _[www.neurosense-tx.com](http://www.neurosense-tx.com/)_.\n\n**About ALS**\n\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (\"ALS\") is an incurable neurodegenerative disease that causes complete paralysis and death within 2-5 years from diagnosis. Every year, more than 5,000 people are diagnosed with ALS in the U.S. alone, with an annual disease burden of $1 billion. The number of people living with ALS is expected to grow by 24% by 2040 in the U.S. and EU.\n\n**About PARADIGM**\n\nPARADIGM is a prospective, multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b ([NCT05357950](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05357950)) clinical trial of PrimeC in ALS. The trial included 68 participants living with ALS in Canada, Italy, and Israel. 96% of the trial participants who completed the 6-month double-blind portion of the trial chose to receive treatment with PrimeC through a 12-month open label extension. Furthermore, to date (June 2024) all participants that completed the 18-month trial treatment duration, requested to continue PrimeC, which is provided to them in an Investigator Initiated Trial, not limited with time.\n\nAs previously reported, in the 6-month double-blind segment of the trial, the data showed clinically meaningful signs of efficacy with a 29% difference in favor of PrimeC vs placebo in analysis of the intent to treat (ITT) population. In the PP top-line analysis from PARADIGM, a statistically significant slowing of disease progression was observed with a 37.4% (p=0.03) difference in ALSFRS-R in favor of PrimeC vs placebo. Most patients enrolled in both the active and placebo arms of the trial were concurrently treated with Riluzole, the ALS standard of care medication, indicating PrimeC slowed disease progression well beyond the level afforded by the FDA approved ALS drug. \n\n**About PrimeC**\n\nPrimeC, NeuroSense's lead drug candidate, is a novel extended-release oral formulation composed of a unique fixed-dose combination of two FDA-approved drugs: ciprofloxacin and celecoxib. PrimeC is designed to synergistically target several key mechanisms of ALS that contribute to motor neuron degeneration, inflammation, iron accumulation and impaired ribonucleic acid (\"RNA\") regulation to potentially inhibit the progression of ALS. NeuroSense completed a Phase 2a clinical trial which met its safety and efficacy endpoints including reducing functional and respiratory deterioration and statistically significant changes in ALS-related biological markers indicating PrimeC's biological activity. PrimeC was granted Orphan Drug Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency.\n\n**About****NeuroSense**\n\nNeuroSense Therapeutics, Ltd. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on discovering and developing treatments for patients suffering from debilitating neurodegenerative diseases. NeuroSense believes that these diseases, which include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, among others, represent one of the most significant unmet medical needs of our time, with limited effective therapeutic options available for patients to date. Due to the complexity of neurodegenerative diseases and based on strong scientific research on a large panel of related biomarkers, NeuroSense's strategy is to develop combined therapies targeting multiple pathways associated with these diseases.\n\nFor additional information, we invite you to visit our [website](http://www.neurosense-tx.com/) and follow us on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/neurosense-therapeutics/mycompany/), [YouTube ](https://www.youtube.com/@neurosensetherapeutics5471)and [X](https://twitter.com/NeurosenseT).
