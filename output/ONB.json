The approximate net proceeds of the offering will be $384 million (before offering expenses, assuming the underwriters do not exercise their option to purchase additional shares and assuming full physical settlement of the forward sale agreement at the initial forward price) in connection with the forward sale agreement described below.\n\nThe underwriters have been granted the option to purchase up to an additional 2,857,143 shares of Common Stock. If such option is exercised, then Old National plans to enter into an additional forward sale agreement with the forward purchaser in respect of the number of additional shares of Old National’s Common Stock that is subject to the exercise of such option. The offering is expected to close on November 26, 2024, subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions.\n\nCitigroup Global Markets Inc. (“Citi”) is acting as lead joint book-running manager and stabilization agent for the offering. Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc., _A Stifel Company_ (“KBW”) is acting as joint book-running manager.\n\nIn connection with the offering, Old National entered into a forward sale agreement with an affiliate of Citi (the “forward purchaser”), pursuant to which Old National has agreed to sell shares of Common Stock to the forward purchaser at the initial forward sale price, which is equal to the price per share at which the underwriters purchase the shares in the offering, as adjusted over the term of the forward sale agreement. In connection with the forward sale agreement, the forward purchaser or its affiliate is borrowing from third parties an aggregate of 19,047,619 shares of Common Stock. Such borrowed shares of Common Stock will be delivered by Citi (in such capacity, the “forward seller”) for sale to the underwriters in the offering.\n\nOld National expects to physically settle the forward sale agreement (by the delivery of shares of Common Stock) and receive proceeds from the sale of those shares of Common Stock upon one or more forward settlement dates within approximately 12 months from the date hereof. Old National may also elect cash settlement or net share settlement for all or a portion of its obligations under the forward sale agreement. If the forward purchaser or its affiliate does not borrow and deliver to the forward seller for sale all of the shares of Common Stock to be delivered and sold by it pursuant to the terms of the underwriting agreement, Old National will issue and sell directly to the underwriters the number of shares of Common Stock not borrowed and delivered for sale by the forward purchaser or its affiliate, and under such circumstances the number of shares of Common Stock underlying the forward sale agreement will be decreased by the number of shares of Common Stock that Old National issues and sells.\n\nOld National will not initially receive proceeds from the sale of the shares of Common Stock sold by the forward seller to the underwriters but will have the right to receive proceeds from physical settlement under the forward sale agreement, based on the then-prevailing forward sale price. Old National intends to use any net proceeds that it receives upon settlement of the forward sale agreement and the additional forward sale agreement, if any, for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other uses, contributing Tier 1 capital into Old National Bank. The precise amounts and timing of these uses of proceeds will depend on the funding requirements of Old National and its subsidiaries.\n\nThe Common Stock will be issued pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement (File No. 333- 272312) and a preliminary prospectus supplement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), and a final prospectus supplement to be filed with the SEC.\n\nCopies of the registration statement, the preliminary prospectus supplement and the accompanying base prospectus relating to the Common Stock offering can be obtained without charge by visiting the SEC's website at [www.sec.gov](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=w6YmldqwQIkoQrq3iuAEkrCR8GYUneCdToeblTFD9ujjmF0tWuqqCfHak0SeAY58fy7OtkFO0bws3B52iJoWEA==), or by contacting Citi, Citigroup, c/o Broadridge Financial Solutions, 1155 Long Island Avenue, Edgewood, NY 11717 or by telephone at (800) 831-9146 or KBW by telephone at (800) 966-1559 or by email at [USCapitalMarkets@kbw.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=SMwlfXUF6AC3x3SYxDqsbW1fgRCi8ub2jpMd2RpyiYAH0wDxFaeHWrOpy5k-ksqV8AwIBjo7IU1-a_p7WedlksgmW9txhQAROi_qDlq34uw=).\n\nThis press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of, the Common Stock in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction. Any offering of the Common Stock is being made only by means of a written prospectus meeting the requirements of Section 10 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\n\n**ABOUT OLD NATIONAL**\n\nOld National Bancorp (NASDAQ: ONB) is the holding company of Old National Bank.

Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the expected physical settlement of the forward sale agreement, the expected use of proceeds from the offering, the outlook and expectations of Old National with respect to the offering, and the benefits of the offering. Such statements are often characterized by the use of qualified words (and their derivatives) such as “may,” “will,” “anticipate,” “could,” “should,” “would,” “believe,” “contemplate,” “expect,” “estimate,” “continue,” “plan,” “project” and “intend,” or words of similar meaning or other statements concerning opinions or judgment of Old National and its management about future events. Forward-looking statements are based on assumptions as of the time they are made and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that are difficult to predict with regard to timing, extent, likelihood and degree of occurrence, which could cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results, expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such risks, uncertainties and assumptions, include, among others, Old National’s ability to complete the offering, future capital needs, and ability to deploy the net proceeds of the offering in the manner it expects.\n\nAdditional factors that could cause results to differ materially from those described above can be found in Old National’s most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and other documents subsequently filed by Old National with the SEC. The actual results anticipated may not be realized or, even if substantially realized, they may not have the expected consequences to or effects on Old National or its business or operations. Investors are cautioned not to rely too heavily on any such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and Old National undertakes no obligation to update or clarify these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n\nInvestor Relations:Lynell Durchholz(812) 464-1366lynell.durchholz@oldnational.com\n\nMedia Relations:Rick Vach(904) 535-9489rick.vach@oldnational.com\n\n![](https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=OTI4OTI4MCM2NjA4ODM0IzIwMDM4OTI=) ![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/YzI3NTcwZDMtN2RjNy00YmQ1LWE1MzYtZjE0MjUzMjkxMjkwLTEwMTU0NjU=/tiny/Old-National-Bancorp.png)\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/c3a793a4-70b0-4339-b125-d8f4277c2f05/small/onbancorp-png.png)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/c3a793a4-70b0-4339-b125-d8f4277c2f05)\n\nSource: Old National Bancorp\n\n[View All News](https://ir.oldnational.com/news/press-releases/default.aspx)\n\n### Email Alerts\n\nTo opt-in for investor email alerts, please enter your email address in the field below and select at least one alert option.

PAUL, Minn., Nov. 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Old National Bancorp (NASDAQ: ONB) (“Old National”) and Bremer Financial Corporation (“BFC” or “Bremer”) jointly announced today that they entered into a definitive merger agreement. Founded in 1943, BFC is the bank holding company for Bremer Bank.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, Bremer had $16.2 billion in total assets, $11.5 billion in total loans, and $13.2 billion in deposits. After the partnership is completed, Old National will become the third-largest bank in the Twin Cities. In addition, the partnership expands Old National’s reach into several other vibrant markets throughout Minnesota, North Dakota and Wisconsin. Once combined, the new organization would have over $70 billion in assets (based on September 30, 2024 asset figures), a significantly larger footprint, and offer additional banking capabilities and enhanced resources to serve customers.\n\n“This partnership represents an outstanding fit between two highly compatible, relationship- and community-focused banks,” said Old National Chairman and CEO Jim Ryan. “When you look at what has made Bremer Bank a leading institution since 1943, what you quickly find are the same strategic priorities and cultural principles that have guided Old National’s success for 190 years: a strong deposit franchise, a diversified loan portfolio accentuated by exceptional credit quality, and a passion for investing in and strengthening communities. I am incredibly confident that, through this partnership, Bremer and Old National will be even better together.”\n\n“For more than 80 years, we’ve been honored to carry out the legacy of our founder, Otto Bremer,” said Jeanne Crain, President and CEO of Bremer. “When our majority shareholder, the Otto Bremer Trust, reaffirmed its interest in selling Bremer Bank, we appreciated the opportunity to identify a partner through a collaborative process to ensure the best possible outcome for our customers, employees, and our communities. With Old National, we have confidence we found a great fit.”\n\n**The Otto Bremer Trust** The Otto Bremer Trust (the “Trust”) is a private charitable trust based in St. Paul, Minnesota. It currently holds a majority ownership stake in Bremer. Established in 1944, the Trust works to combine finance and philanthropy in service of the community. Since its inception, the Trust has made more than $1.1 billion in grants and program-related investments to more than 4,200 organizations.\n\nUpon closing of this transaction, the Trust will have an approximate 11% ownership stake in Old National and a Trustee of the Otto Bremer Trust will join the Old National Board of Directors.\n\nThe Otto Bremer Trust commented: “All of us at the Otto Bremer Trust are excited that the Bremer Bank legacy of investing in people, places and opportunities continues with one of the most community-minded banks in the nation. This partnership expands the scope of what can be accomplished for and within our communities – civically, socially and economically.”\n\n**The partnership transaction includes 70 total banking centers in Minnesota, North Dakota and Wisconsin**\n\n48 branches in Minnesota, including:\n\n  * 18 locations in the Twin Cities region\n  * 5 locations in the Rochester region\n  * 7 locations in the Alexandria region\n  * 4 locations in the St. Cloud region\n\n\n\n14 branches in North Dakota, including: \n\n  * 6 locations in the Grand Forks region\n  * 7 locations in the Fargo region\n\n\n\n8 branches in Wisconsin, including:\n\n  * 1 location in Appleton\n  * 1 location in Eau Claire\n\n\n\nUnder the terms of the definitive merger agreement, each outstanding share of Bremer common stock will be converted into the right to receive 4.182 shares of Old National common stock plus $26.22 in cash, valuing the transaction at approximately $1,401 million, or $116.76 per share, based on Old National’s closing stock price on November 22, 2024. The definitive merger agreement has been unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of Bremer and Old National. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals, including the approval of Bremer shareholders. The transaction is anticipated to close in the middle of 2025.\n\nCiti served as exclusive financial advisor to Old National, and Squire Patton Boggs (US) LLP acted as legal counsel.\n\nJ.P. Morgan served as financial advisor for Bremer, and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz acted as legal counsel.\n\nKeefe, Bruyette & Woods, _A Stifel Company_ served as financial advisor for the Otto Bremer Trust, and Sullivan & Cromwell LLP acted as legal counsel.CONFERENCE CALL AND WEBCASTOld National will hold a conference call and live webcast at 8:00 a.m. Central Time on Monday, November 25, 2024, to discuss the acquisition of Bremer.

Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the outlook and expectations of Old National and Bremer, respectively, with respect to the proposed transaction, the strategic benefits and financial benefits of the proposed transaction, including the expected impact of the proposed transactions on the combined company’s future financial performance (including anticipated accretion to earnings per share, the tangible book value earn-back period and other operating and return metrics), the timing of the closing of the proposed transaction, and the ability to successfully integrate the combined businesses. Such statements are often characterized by the use of qualified words (and their derivatives) such as “may,” “will,” “anticipate,” “could,” “should,” “would,” “believe,” “contemplate,” “expect,” “estimate,” “continue,” “plan,” “project” and “intend,” as well as words of similar meaning or other statements concerning opinions or judgment of Old National or Bremer or their respective management about future events. Forward-looking statements are based on assumptions as of the time they are made and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that are difficult to predict with regard to timing, extent, likelihood and degree of occurrence, which could cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such risks, uncertainties and assumptions include, among others, the following:\n\n  * the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the right of one or both of the parties to terminate the merger agreement;\n  * the failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals (and the risk that such approvals may result in the imposition of conditions that could adversely affect the combined company or the expected benefits of the proposed transaction) and the possibility that the proposed transaction does not close when expected or at all because required regulatory approvals, the approval by Bremer’s shareholders, or other approvals and the other conditions to closing are not received or satisfied on a timely basis or at all;\n  * the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against Old National or Bremer;\n  * the possibility that the anticipated benefits of the proposed transaction, including anticipated cost savings and strategic gains, are not realized when expected or at all, including as a result of changes in, or problems arising from, general economic and market conditions, interest and exchange rates, monetary policy, laws and regulations and their enforcement, and the degree of competition in the geographic and business areas in which Old National and Bremer operate;\n  * the possibility that the integration of the two companies may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected;\n  * the impact of purchase accounting with respect to the proposed transaction, or any change in the assumptions used regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to determine their fair value and credit marks;\n  * the possibility that the proposed transaction may be more expensive or take longer to complete than anticipated, including as a result of unexpected factors or events;\n  * the diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business operations and opportunities;\n  * potential adverse reactions of Old National’s or Bremer’s customers or changes to business or employee relationships, including those resulting from the announcement or completion of the proposed transaction;\n  * a material adverse change in the financial condition of Old National or Bremer;\n  * changes in Old National’s share price before closing;\n  * risks relating to the potential dilutive effect of shares of Old National’s common stock to be issued in the proposed transaction;\n  * general competitive, economic, political and market conditions;\n  * major catastrophes such as earthquakes, floods or other natural or human disasters, including infectious disease outbreaks; and\n  * other factors that may affect future results of Old National or Bremer, including, among others, changes in asset quality and credit risk; the inability to sustain revenue and earnings growth; changes in interest rates; deposit flows; inflation; customer borrowing, repayment, investment and deposit practices; the impact, extent and timing of technological changes; capital management activities; and other actions of the Federal Reserve Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and legislative and regulatory actions and reforms.\n\n\n\nThese factors are not necessarily all of the factors that could cause Old National, Bremer, or the combined company’s actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by any of the forward-looking statements. Other factors, including unknown or unpredictable factors, also could harm Old National’s, Bremer’s, or the combined company’s results.Although each of Old National and Bremer believes that its expectations with respect to forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions within the bounds of its existing knowledge of its business and operations, there can be no assurance that actual results of Old National or Bremer will not differ materially from any projected future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Additional factors that could cause results to differ materially from those described above can be found in Old National’s most recent annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (and which is available at <https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/707179/000070717924000006/onb-20231231.htm>), quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and other documents subsequently filed by Old National with the Securities Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The actual results anticipated may not be realized or, even if substantially realized, they may not have the expected consequences to or effects on Old National, Bremer or each of their respective businesses or operations. Investors are cautioned not to rely too heavily on any such forward-looking statements. Old National and Bremer urge you to consider all of these risks, uncertainties and other factors carefully in evaluating all such forward-looking statements made by Old National and Bremer. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and Old National and Bremer undertake no obligation to update or clarify these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except to the extent required by applicable law.\n\n**No Offer or Solicitation**\n\nThis press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities or the solicitation of any vote or approval with respect to the proposed transaction between Old National and Bremer. No offer of securities shall be made except by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and no offer to sell or solicitation of an offer to buy shall be made in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of such jurisdiction.\n\n**Important Additional Information about the Transaction and Where to Find It**\n\nIn connection with the proposed transaction, Old National intends to file with the SEC a Registration Statement on Form S-4 (the “Registration Statement”) to register the shares of Old National capital stock to be issued in connection with the proposed transaction.

More than 1,200 companies participated in this year’s Military Friendly® survey.\n\nResults for the 2025 recognitions, published by G.I.

They work together to create sustainable programs for transitioning veterans while providing team members who are military veterans – and their family members and supporters – with education, resources, and networking opportunities. A mentoring program at ONB also pairs veterans with a member of the Executive Leadership Team, providing valuable work/life insights to both parties.\n\nFrom hiring and career advancement to customer service and charitable investment, Military Friendly® Companies lead the way in the categories of Recruitment, New Hire Retention, Employee Turnover, and Promotion and Advancement of veterans and military employees.\n\n“We salute these exemplary employers who raise the bar and understand that hiring military personnel is not merely an act of goodwill, but a testament to a standard that truly embodies sound business wisdom,” said Kayla Lopez, Senior Director of Military Partnerships at Military Friendly®. “Their steadfast commitment to integrating military personnel into their workforce not only reflects their compassion, but also underscores their business acumen.”\n\nOld National will be showcased among the 2025 Military Friendly® Employers in the Winter issue of G.I.

In 2024, Points of Light named Old National one of \"The Civic 50\" - an honor reserved for the 50 most\ncommunity-minded companies in the United States.\nUSE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThe Company's accounting and reporting policies conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") and\ngeneral practices within the banking industry. As a supplement to GAAP, the Company provides non-GAAP performance\nresults, which the Company believes are useful because they assist investors in assessing the Company's operating\nperformance. Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as the\nreconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found in the tables at the end of this release.\nThe Company presents EPS, the efficiency ratio, return on average common equity, return on average tangible common\nequity, and net income applicable to common shares, all adjusted for certain notable items. These items include merger-\nrelated charges associated with completed and pending acquisitions, separation expense, debt securities gains/losses,\nCECL Day 1 non-PCD provision expense, distribution of excess pension assets expense, FDIC special assessment expense,\ngain on sale of Visa Class B restricted shares, contract termination charges, expenses related to the tragic April 10, 2023\nevent at our downtown Louisville location (\"Louisville expenses\"), and property optimization charges. Management\nbelieves excluding these items from EPS, the efficiency ratio, return on average common equity, and return on average\ntangible common equity may be useful in assessing the Company's underlying operational performance since these\nitems do not pertain to its core business operations and their exclusion may facilitate better comparability between\nperiods. Management believes that excluding merger-related charges from these metrics may be useful to the Company,\n3\nas well as analysts and investors, since these expenses can vary significantly based on the size, type, and structure of\neach acquisition. Additionally, management believes excluding these items from these metrics may enhance\ncomparability for peer comparison purposes.\nIncome tax expense, provision for credit losses, and the certain notable items listed above are excluded from the\ncalculation of pre-provision net revenues, adjusted due to the fluctuation in income before income tax and the level of\nprovision for credit losses required. Management believes adjusted pre-provision net revenues may be useful in\nassessing the Company's underlying operating performance and their exclusion may facilitate better comparability\nbetween periods and for peer comparison purposes.\nThe Company presents adjusted noninterest expense, which excludes merger-related charges associated with\ncompleted and pending acquisitions, separation expense, distribution of excess pension assets expense, FDIC special\nassessment expense, contract termination charges, Louisville expenses, and property optimization charges, as well as\nadjusted noninterest income, which excludes debt securities gains/losses and the gain on sale of Visa Class B restricted\nshares. Management believes that excluding these items from noninterest expense and noninterest income may be\nuseful in assessing the Company’s underlying operational performance as these items either do not pertain to its core\nbusiness operations or their exclusion may facilitate better comparability between periods and for peer comparison\npurposes.\nThe tax-equivalent adjustment to net interest income and net interest margin recognizes the income tax savings when\ncomparing taxable and tax-exempt assets. Interest income and yields on tax-exempt securities and loans are presented\nusing the current federal income tax rate of 21%. Management believes that it is standard practice in the banking\nindustry to present net interest income and net interest margin on a fully tax-equivalent basis and that it may enhance\ncomparability for peer comparison purposes.\nIn management's view, tangible common equity measures are capital adequacy metrics that may be meaningful to the\nCompany, as well as analysts and investors, in assessing the Company's use of equity and in facilitating comparisons with\npeers. These non-GAAP measures are valuable indicators of a financial institution's capital strength since they eliminate\nintangible assets from stockholders' equity and retain the effect of accumulated other comprehensive loss in\nstockholders' equity.\nAlthough intended to enhance investors' understanding of the Company's business and performance, these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures\nmay differ from those used by other financial institutions to assess their business and performance. See the following\nreconciliations in the \"Non-GAAP Reconciliations\" section for details on the calculation of these measures to the extent\npresented herein.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis communication contains certain \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities\nLitigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”), notwithstanding that such statements are not specifically identified as such.

          "content": "3rd Quarter 2024\nFinancial Review\nOctober 22, 2024\nForward-Looking Statements\nThese materials contain certain \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”), notwithstanding\nthat such statements are not specifically identified as such. In addition, certain statements may be contained in our future filings with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (“SEC”), in press releases, and in oral and written statements made by us that are not statements of historical fact and constitute forward-looking\nstatements within the meaning of the Act. These statements include, but are not limited to, descriptions of Old National’s financial condition, results of operations,\nasset and credit quality trends, profitability and business plans or opportunities. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as\n\"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"contemplate,\" \"continue,\" \"could,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"may,\" \"outlook,\" \"plan,\" \"potential,\" \"predict,\" \"should,\" “would,” and \"will,\"\nand other words of similar meaning. These forward-looking statements express management’s current expectations or forecasts of future events and, by their\nnature, are subject to risks and uncertainties. There are a number of factors that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those in such\nstatements, including, but not limited to: competition; government legislation, regulations and policies; the ability of Old National to execute its business plan;\nunanticipated changes in our liquidity position, including but not limited to changes in our access to sources of liquidity and capital to address our liquidity needs;\nchanges in economic conditions and economic and business uncertainty which could materially impact credit quality trends and the ability to generate loans and\ngather deposits; inflation and governmental responses to inflation, including increasing interest rates; market, economic, operational, liquidity, credit, and interest\nrate risks associated with our business; our ability to successfully manage our credit risk and the sufficiency of our allowance for credit losses; the expected cost\nsavings, synergies and other financial benefits from the merger (the “Merger”) between Old National and CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. (“CapStar”) not being\nrealized within the expected time frames and costs or difficulties relating to integration matters being greater than expected; potential adverse reactions or changes\nto business or employee relationships, including those resulting from the completion of the Merger; the potential impact of future business combinations on our\nperformance and financial condition, including our ability to successfully integrate the businesses and the success of revenue-generating and cost reduction\ninitiatives; failure or circumvention of our internal controls; operational risks or risk management failures by us or critical third parties, including without limitation with\nrespect to data processing, information systems, cybersecurity, technological changes, vendor issues, business interruption, and fraud risks; significant changes in\naccounting, tax or regulatory practices or requirements; new legal obligations or liabilities; disruptive technologies in payment systems and other services\ntraditionally provided by banks; failure or disruption of our information systems; computer hacking and other cybersecurity threats; the effects of climate change on\nOld National and its customers, borrowers, or service providers; political and economic uncertainty and instability; the impacts of pandemics, epidemics and other\ninfectious disease outbreaks; other matters discussed in these materials; and other factors identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and other filings with the SEC. These forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of these materials and are not guarantees of\nfuture results, performance or outcomes, and Old National does not undertake an obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect events or\nconditions after the date of these materials.\n2\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company's accounting and reporting policies conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") and general practices within the banking industry. As\na supplement to GAAP, the Company provides non-GAAP performance results, which the Company believes are useful because they assist investors in assessing the\nCompany's operating performance. Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as the reconciliation to the\ncomparable GAAP financial measure, can be found in the appendix to this financial review.\nThe Company presents EPS, the efficiency ratio, return on average common equity, return on average tangible common equity, and net income applicable to common\nshares, all adjusted for certain notable items. These items include merger-related charges associated with completed and pending acquisitions, separation expense, current\nexpected credit loss (“CECL”) Day 1 non-PCD provision expense, debt securities gains/losses, distribution of excess pension assets expense, FDIC special assessment\nexpense, gain on sale of Visa Class B restricted shares, contract termination charges, expenses related to the tragic April 10, 2023 event at our downtown Louisville\nlocation (\"Louisville expenses\"), and property optimization charges. Management believes excluding these items from EPS, the efficiency ratio, return on average common\nequity, and return on average tangible common equity may be useful in assessing the Company's underlying operational performance since these items do not pertain to its\ncore business operations and their exclusion may facilitate better comparability between periods. Management believes that excluding merger-related charges from these\nmetrics may be useful to the Company, as well as analysts and investors, since these expenses can vary significantly based on the size, type, and structure of each\nacquisition. Additionally, management believes excluding these items from these metrics may enhance comparability for peer comparison purposes.\nThe Company presents adjusted noninterest expense, which excludes merger-related charges, separation expense, distribution of excess pension assets expense, FDIC\nspecial assessment expense, contract termination charges, Louisville expenses, property optimization charges, as well as adjusted noninterest income, which excludes\ndebt securities gains/losses and the gain on sale of Visa Class B restricted shares and . Management believes that excluding these items from noninterest expense and\nnoninterest income may be useful in assessing the Company’s underlying operational performance as these items either do not pertain to its core business operations or\ntheir exclusion may facilitate better comparability between periods and for peer comparison purposes.\nThe tax-equivalent adjustment to net interest income and net interest margin recognizes the income tax savings when comparing taxable and tax-exempt assets. Interest\nincome and yields on tax-exempt securities and loans are presented using the current federal income tax rate of 21%. Management believes that it is standard practice in\nthe banking industry to present net interest income and net interest margin on a fully tax-equivalent basis and that it may enhance comparability for peer comparison\npurposes.\nIn management's view, tangible common equity measures are capital adequacy metrics that may be meaningful to the Company, as well as analysts and investors, in\nassessing the Company's use of equity and in facilitating comparisons with peers. These non-GAAP measures are valuable indicators of a financial institution's capital\nstrength since they eliminate intangible assets from stockholders' equity and retain the effect of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders' equity.\nAlthough intended to enhance investors' understanding of the Company's business and performance, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an\nalternative to GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from those used by other financial institutions to assess their business and performance.\nSee the following reconciliations in the \"Non-GAAP Reconciliations\" section for details on the calculation of these measures to the extent presented herein.\n3\nStrong Third-Quarter 2024 Highlights\nKey Performance Drivers\nReported Adjusted1\n▪ Granular, peer-leading deposit franchise\nEPS $0.44 $0.46\n• Core deposits up 10.1% annualized\n• NIB deposits grew nearly $100 million\nNet Income $140 $147\n• Low total deposit costs of 225 bps\nReturn on Average Assets 1.08% 1.13%\n▪ Total loans2 up 2.7% annualized due to\ndisciplined loan growth\nReturn on Average TCE1 16.0% 16.8%\n▪ Net interest income and margin performance in-\nEfficiency Ratio1 53.8% 51.2%\nline with expectations\nTangible common book value1 $11.97\n▪ Noninterest income up 7.9% driven by growth in\nTotal Deposit Growth primary fee businesses\n(annualized) 8.5%\n▪ Disciplined expense management reflected in\nTotal Cost of Deposits 225 bps efficiency ratio1 of 53.8%;

          "content": "Exhibit 99.1\n3rd Quarter 2024\nInvestment Thesis\nNovember 6, 2024\nExecutive Summary\nSlides 5 —1 4\nForward-Looking Statements\nThese materials contain certain \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”), notwithstanding\nthat such statements are not specifically identified as such. In addition, certain statements may be contained in our future filings with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (“SEC”), in press releases, and in oral and written statements made by Old National Bancorp and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (“Old National,” “ONB,”\nor the “Company”) that are not statements of historical fact and constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Act. These statements include, but\nare not limited to, descriptions of Old National’s financial condition, results of operations, asset and credit quality trends, profitability and business plans or\nopportunities. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"contemplate,\" \"continue,\" \"could,\" \"estimate,\"\n\"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"may,\" \"outlook,\" \"plan,\" \"potential,\" \"predict,\" \"should,\" “would,” and \"will,\" and other words of similar meaning. These forward-looking statements\nexpress management’s current expectations or forecasts of future events and, by their nature, are subject to risks and uncertainties. There are a number of factors\nthat could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those in such statements, including, but not limited to: competition; government legislation,\nregulations and policies; the ability of Old National to execute its business plan; unanticipated changes in our liquidity position, including but not limited to changes\nin our access to sources of liquidity and capital to address our liquidity needs; changes in economic conditions and economic and business uncertainty which could\nmaterially impact credit quality trends and the ability to generate loans and gather deposits; inflation and governmental responses to inflation, including increasing\ninterest rates; market, economic, operational, liquidity, credit, and interest rate risks associated with our business; our ability to successfully manage our credit risk\nand the sufficiency of our allowance for credit losses; the expected cost savings, synergies and other financial benefits from the merger (the “Merger”) between Old\nNational and CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. (“CapStar”) not being realized within the expected time frames and costs or difficulties relating to integration matters\nbeing greater than expected; potential adverse reactions or changes to business or employee relationships, including those resulting from the completion of the\nMerger; the potential impact of future business combinations on our performance and financial condition, including our ability to successfully integrate the\nbusinesses and the success of revenue-generating and cost reduction initiatives; failure or circumvention of our internal controls; operational risks or risk\nmanagement failures by us or critical third parties, including without limitation with respect to data processing, information systems, cybersecurity, technological\nchanges, vendor issues, business interruption, and fraud risks; significant changes in accounting, tax or regulatory practices or requirements; new legal obligations\nor liabilities; disruptive technologies in payment systems and other services traditionally provided by banks; failure or disruption of our information systems;\ncomputer hacking and other cybersecurity threats; the effects of climate change on Old National and its customers, borrowers, or service providers; political and\neconomic uncertainty and instability; the impacts of pandemics, epidemics and other infectious disease outbreaks; other matters discussed in these materials; and\nother factors identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and other filings with the SEC. These forward-looking statements\nare made only as of the date of these materials and are not guarantees of future results, performance or outcomes, and Old National does not undertake an\nobligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect events or conditions after the date of these materials.\n3\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company's accounting and reporting policies conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") and general practices within the banking industry. As\na supplement to GAAP, the Company provides non-GAAP performance results, which the Company believes are useful because they assist investors in assessing the\nCompany's operating performance. Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as the reconciliation to the\ncomparable GAAP financial measure, can be found in the appendix (the “Appendix for Non-GAAP reconciliation”) to this financial review.\nThe Company presents earnings per share (“EPS”), the efficiency ratio, return on average common equity, return on average tangible common equity, and net income\napplicable to common shares, all adjusted for certain notable items. These items include merger-related charges associated with completed and pending acquisitions,\nseparation expense, current expected credit loss (“CECL”) Day 1 non-purchased credit deteriorated (“non-PCD”) provision expense, debt securities gains/losses,\ndistribution of excess pension assets expense, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) special assessment expense, gain on sale of Visa Class B restricted shares,\ncontract termination charges, expenses related to the tragic April 10, 2023 event at our downtown Louisville location (\"Louisville expenses\"), and property optimization\ncharges. Management believes excluding these items from EPS, the efficiency ratio, return on average common equity, and return on average tangible common equity may\nbe useful in assessing the Company's underlying operational performance since these items do not pertain to its core business operations and their exclusion may facilitate\nbetter comparability between periods. Management believes that excluding merger-related charges from these metrics may be useful to the Company, as well as analysts\nand investors, since these expenses can vary significantly based on the size, type, and structure of each acquisition. Additionally, management believes excluding these\nitems from these metrics may enhance comparability for peer comparison purposes.\nThe Company presents adjusted noninterest expense, which excludes merger-related charges, separation expense, distribution of excess pension assets expense, FDIC\nspecial assessment expense, contract termination charges, Louisville expenses, property optimization charges, as well as adjusted noninterest income, which excludes\ndebt securities gains/losses and the gain on sale of Visa Class B restricted shares. Management believes that excluding these items from noninterest expense and\nnoninterest income may be useful in assessing the Company’s underlying operational performance as these items either do not pertain to its core business operations or\ntheir exclusion may facilitate better comparability between periods and for peer comparison purposes.\nThe tax-equivalent adjustment to net interest income and net interest margin recognizes the income tax savings when comparing taxable and tax-exempt assets. Interest\nincome and yields on tax-exempt securities and loans are presented using the current federal income tax rate of 21%. Management believes that it is standard practice in\nthe banking industry to present net interest income and net interest margin on a fully tax-equivalent basis and that it may enhance comparability for peer comparison\npurposes.\nIn management's view, tangible common equity measures are capital adequacy metrics that may be meaningful to the Company, as well as analysts and investors, in\nassessing the Company's use of equity and in facilitating comparisons with peers. These non-GAAP measures are valuable indicators of a financial institution's capital\nstrength since they eliminate intangible assets from stockholders' equity and retain the effect of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders' equity.\nAlthough intended to enhance investors' understanding of the Company's business and performance, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an\nalternative to GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from those used by other financial institutions to assess their business and performance.\nSee the following reconciliations in the \"Non-GAAP Reconciliations\" section in the appendix for details on the calculation of these measures to the extent presented herein.\n4\nCorporate Strategy\nOld National’s primary strategic objective is to be a top quartile performing “basic bank” that is a primary,\ntrusted partner to our clients in the communities we serve, and a highly respected, highly valued\nemployer that continually empowers our team members to grow, develop and succeed.\nExecute with Relentless Focus Quality, Low-Cost\nand Win in our Key Markets Deposit Base\nDrive Long-\nGranular & Diversified Term\nProven Acquirer\nLoan Portfolio\nShareholder\nValue\nDiversified Revenue\nStrong Credit Culture\nStreams\n5\nSnapshot of Old National\n1\nSummary\nCompany Description\nHeadquarters Evansville, IN • 6th largest commercial bank headquartered in\nMidwest - top 30 banking company based in the\nMarket Cap $6,111\nU.S. by assets\nP/ TBV 160 % • 280 branches and 359 ATMs\nDividend Yield 2.9 %\nLTM Average Daily Volume (Actual) 2,017,766\nTotal Assets $53,602 Key Financial Metrics\nWealth Assets Under Management $31,359\nCost of Total Deposits 225 bps\nLoan-to-Deposit Ratio2 89%\nPrice / Tangible Book Value $11.97\nLoan Mix2 Deposit Mix Efficiency Ratio As Reported/ Adjusted3 53.8% / 51.2%\nNet Charge-Offs / Average Loans,\nexcluding PCD 0.16%\nConsumer\n8% 30-89 Day Delinquent Loans 0.25%\nNon-Performing Loans / Total Loans 1.22%\nTime\nCRE Non- Money 19%\nTangible Common Equity to Tangible Assets 7.4%\nResidential Owner Market\nReal Estate Occupied 26% ROATCE As Reported / Adjusted3 16.0% / 16.8%\n19% 32%\nDemand\nSavings 24%\n12%\nC&I NOW\n29% 19%\nCRE Owner\nOccupied\n12%\n$ in millions, except as noted; Financial data as of or for the quarter ended 9/30/2024, except as noted 1 Market data as of 11/5/2024\n2 Includes loans held for sale 3 Non-GAAP financial measures that management believes is useful in evaluating the financial results of the\nCompany - see Appendix for Non-GAAP reconciliation\nP / TBV - price to tangible book value PCD - purchased credit deteriorated ROATCE - return on average tangible common equity\n6\nLTM - last twelve months\nThe Best of Offense and Defense\nOFFENSE DEFENSE\nTop quartile 3Q2024 Quality, peer-leading deposit franchise\nfinancial metrics\n• Growth in total deposits of 8.5% annualized\n• 16.8% Adj.

As a supplement to GAAP, the Company provides non-GAAP performance\nresults, which the Company believes are useful because they assist investors in assessing the Company's operating\nperformance. Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as the\nreconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found in the tables at the end of this release.\nThe Company presents EPS, the efficiency ratio, return on average common equity, return on average tangible common\nequity, and net income applicable to common shares, all adjusted for certain notable items. These items include merger-\nrelated charges associated with completed and pending acquisitions, separation expense, debt securities gains/losses,\nCECL Day 1 non-PCD provision expense, distribution of excess pension assets expense, FDIC special assessment expense,\ngain on sale of Visa Class B restricted shares, contract termination charges, expenses related to the tragic April 10, 2023\nevent at our downtown Louisville location (\"Louisville expenses\"), and property optimization charges. Management\nbelieves excluding these items from EPS, the efficiency ratio, return on average common equity, and return on average\ntangible common equity may be useful in assessing the Company's underlying operational performance since these\nitems do not pertain to its core business operations and their exclusion may facilitate better comparability between\nperiods. Management believes that excluding merger-related charges from these metrics may be useful to the Company,\n3\nas well as analysts and investors, since these expenses can vary significantly based on the size, type, and structure of\neach acquisition. Additionally, management believes excluding these items from these metrics may enhance\ncomparability for peer comparison purposes.\nIncome tax expense, provision for credit losses, and the certain notable items listed above are excluded from the\ncalculation of pre-provision net revenues, adjusted due to the fluctuation in income before income tax and the level of\nprovision for credit losses required. Management believes adjusted pre-provision net revenues may be useful in\nassessing the Company's underlying operating performance and their exclusion may facilitate better comparability\nbetween periods and for peer comparison purposes.\nThe Company presents adjusted noninterest expense, which excludes merger-related charges associated with\ncompleted and pending acquisitions, separation expense, distribution of excess pension assets expense, FDIC special\nassessment expense, contract termination charges, Louisville expenses, and property optimization charges, as well as\nadjusted noninterest income, which excludes debt securities gains/losses and the gain on sale of Visa Class B restricted\nshares. Management believes that excluding these items from noninterest expense and noninterest income may be\nuseful in assessing the Company’s underlying operational performance as these items either do not pertain to its core\nbusiness operations or their exclusion may facilitate better comparability between periods and for peer comparison\npurposes.\nThe tax-equivalent adjustment to net interest income and net interest margin recognizes the income tax savings when\ncomparing taxable and tax-exempt assets. Interest income and yields on tax-exempt securities and loans are presented\nusing the current federal income tax rate of 21%. Management believes that it is standard practice in the banking\nindustry to present net interest income and net interest margin on a fully tax-equivalent basis and that it may enhance\ncomparability for peer comparison purposes.\nIn management's view, tangible common equity measures are capital adequacy metrics that may be meaningful to the\nCompany, as well as analysts and investors, in assessing the Company's use of equity and in facilitating comparisons with\npeers. These non-GAAP measures are valuable indicators of a financial institution's capital strength since they eliminate\nintangible assets from stockholders' equity and retain the effect of accumulated other comprehensive loss in\nstockholders' equity.\nAlthough intended to enhance investors' understanding of the Company's business and performance, these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures\nmay differ from those used by other financial institutions to assess their business and performance. See the following\nreconciliations in the \"Non-GAAP Reconciliations\" section for details on the calculation of these measures to the extent\npresented herein.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis communication contains certain \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities\nLitigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”), notwithstanding that such statements are not specifically identified as such.

As\na supplement to GAAP, the Company provides non-GAAP performance results, which the Company believes are useful because they assist investors in assessing the\nCompany's operating performance. Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as the reconciliation to the\ncomparable GAAP financial measure, can be found in the appendix to this financial review.\nThe Company presents EPS, the efficiency ratio, return on average common equity, return on average tangible common equity, and net income applicable to common\nshares, all adjusted for certain notable items. These items include merger-related charges associated with completed and pending acquisitions, separation expense, current\nexpected credit loss (“CECL”) Day 1 non-PCD provision expense, debt securities gains/losses, distribution of excess pension assets expense, FDIC special assessment\nexpense, gain on sale of Visa Class B restricted shares, contract termination charges, expenses related to the tragic April 10, 2023 event at our downtown Louisville\nlocation (\"Louisville expenses\"), and property optimization charges. Management believes excluding these items from EPS, the efficiency ratio, return on average common\nequity, and return on average tangible common equity may be useful in assessing the Company's underlying operational performance since these items do not pertain to its\ncore business operations and their exclusion may facilitate better comparability between periods. Management believes that excluding merger-related charges from these\nmetrics may be useful to the Company, as well as analysts and investors, since these expenses can vary significantly based on the size, type, and structure of each\nacquisition. Additionally, management believes excluding these items from these metrics may enhance comparability for peer comparison purposes.\nThe Company presents adjusted noninterest expense, which excludes merger-related charges, separation expense, distribution of excess pension assets expense, FDIC\nspecial assessment expense, contract termination charges, Louisville expenses, property optimization charges, as well as adjusted noninterest income, which excludes\ndebt securities gains/losses and the gain on sale of Visa Class B restricted shares and . Management believes that excluding these items from noninterest expense and\nnoninterest income may be useful in assessing the Company’s underlying operational performance as these items either do not pertain to its core business operations or\ntheir exclusion may facilitate better comparability between periods and for peer comparison purposes.\nThe tax-equivalent adjustment to net interest income and net interest margin recognizes the income tax savings when comparing taxable and tax-exempt assets. Interest\nincome and yields on tax-exempt securities and loans are presented using the current federal income tax rate of 21%. Management believes that it is standard practice in\nthe banking industry to present net interest income and net interest margin on a fully tax-equivalent basis and that it may enhance comparability for peer comparison\npurposes.\nIn management's view, tangible common equity measures are capital adequacy metrics that may be meaningful to the Company, as well as analysts and investors, in\nassessing the Company's use of equity and in facilitating comparisons with peers. These non-GAAP measures are valuable indicators of a financial institution's capital\nstrength since they eliminate intangible assets from stockholders' equity and retain the effect of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders' equity.\nAlthough intended to enhance investors' understanding of the Company's business and performance, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an\nalternative to GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from those used by other financial institutions to assess their business and performance.\nSee the following reconciliations in the \"Non-GAAP Reconciliations\" section for details on the calculation of these measures to the extent presented herein.\n3\nStrong Third-Quarter 2024 Highlights\nKey Performance Drivers\nReported Adjusted1\n▪ Granular, peer-leading deposit franchise\nEPS $0.44 $0.46\n• Core deposits up 10.1% annualized\n• NIB deposits grew nearly $100 million\nNet Income $140 $147\n• Low total deposit costs of 225 bps\nReturn on Average Assets 1.08% 1.13%\n▪ Total loans2 up 2.7% annualized due to\ndisciplined loan growth\nReturn on Average TCE1 16.0% 16.8%\n▪ Net interest income and margin performance in-\nEfficiency Ratio1 53.8% 51.2%\nline with expectations\nTangible common book value1 $11.97\n▪ Noninterest income up 7.9% driven by growth in\nTotal Deposit Growth primary fee businesses\n(annualized) 8.5%\n▪ Disciplined expense management reflected in\nTotal Cost of Deposits 225 bps efficiency ratio1 of 53.8%;

          "content": "Exhibit 99.1\n3rd Quarter 2024\nInvestment Thesis\nNovember 6, 2024\nExecutive Summary\nSlides 5 —1 4\nForward-Looking Statements\nThese materials contain certain \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”), notwithstanding\nthat such statements are not specifically identified as such. In addition, certain statements may be contained in our future filings with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (“SEC”), in press releases, and in oral and written statements made by Old National Bancorp and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (“Old National,” “ONB,”\nor the “Company”) that are not statements of historical fact and constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Act. These statements include, but\nare not limited to, descriptions of Old National’s financial condition, results of operations, asset and credit quality trends, profitability and business plans or\nopportunities. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"contemplate,\" \"continue,\" \"could,\" \"estimate,\"\n\"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"may,\" \"outlook,\" \"plan,\" \"potential,\" \"predict,\" \"should,\" “would,” and \"will,\" and other words of similar meaning. These forward-looking statements\nexpress management’s current expectations or forecasts of future events and, by their nature, are subject to risks and uncertainties. There are a number of factors\nthat could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those in such statements, including, but not limited to: competition; government legislation,\nregulations and policies; the ability of Old National to execute its business plan; unanticipated changes in our liquidity position, including but not limited to changes\nin our access to sources of liquidity and capital to address our liquidity needs; changes in economic conditions and economic and business uncertainty which could\nmaterially impact credit quality trends and the ability to generate loans and gather deposits; inflation and governmental responses to inflation, including increasing\ninterest rates; market, economic, operational, liquidity, credit, and interest rate risks associated with our business; our ability to successfully manage our credit risk\nand the sufficiency of our allowance for credit losses; the expected cost savings, synergies and other financial benefits from the merger (the “Merger”) between Old\nNational and CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. (“CapStar”) not being realized within the expected time frames and costs or difficulties relating to integration matters\nbeing greater than expected; potential adverse reactions or changes to business or employee relationships, including those resulting from the completion of the\nMerger; the potential impact of future business combinations on our performance and financial condition, including our ability to successfully integrate the\nbusinesses and the success of revenue-generating and cost reduction initiatives; failure or circumvention of our internal controls; operational risks or risk\nmanagement failures by us or critical third parties, including without limitation with respect to data processing, information systems, cybersecurity, technological\nchanges, vendor issues, business interruption, and fraud risks; significant changes in accounting, tax or regulatory practices or requirements; new legal obligations\nor liabilities; disruptive technologies in payment systems and other services traditionally provided by banks; failure or disruption of our information systems;\ncomputer hacking and other cybersecurity threats; the effects of climate change on Old National and its customers, borrowers, or service providers; political and\neconomic uncertainty and instability; the impacts of pandemics, epidemics and other infectious disease outbreaks; other matters discussed in these materials; and\nother factors identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and other filings with the SEC. These forward-looking statements\nare made only as of the date of these materials and are not guarantees of future results, performance or outcomes, and Old National does not undertake an\nobligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect events or conditions after the date of these materials.\n3\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company's accounting and reporting policies conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") and general practices within the banking industry. As\na supplement to GAAP, the Company provides non-GAAP performance results, which the Company believes are useful because they assist investors in assessing the\nCompany's operating performance. Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as the reconciliation to the\ncomparable GAAP financial measure, can be found in the appendix (the “Appendix for Non-GAAP reconciliation”) to this financial review.\nThe Company presents earnings per share (“EPS”), the efficiency ratio, return on average common equity, return on average tangible common equity, and net income\napplicable to common shares, all adjusted for certain notable items. These items include merger-related charges associated with completed and pending acquisitions,\nseparation expense, current expected credit loss (“CECL”) Day 1 non-purchased credit deteriorated (“non-PCD”) provision expense, debt securities gains/losses,\ndistribution of excess pension assets expense, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) special assessment expense, gain on sale of Visa Class B restricted shares,\ncontract termination charges, expenses related to the tragic April 10, 2023 event at our downtown Louisville location (\"Louisville expenses\"), and property optimization\ncharges. Management believes excluding these items from EPS, the efficiency ratio, return on average common equity, and return on average tangible common equity may\nbe useful in assessing the Company's underlying operational performance since these items do not pertain to its core business operations and their exclusion may facilitate\nbetter comparability between periods. Management believes that excluding merger-related charges from these metrics may be useful to the Company, as well as analysts\nand investors, since these expenses can vary significantly based on the size, type, and structure of each acquisition. Additionally, management believes excluding these\nitems from these metrics may enhance comparability for peer comparison purposes.\nThe Company presents adjusted noninterest expense, which excludes merger-related charges, separation expense, distribution of excess pension assets expense, FDIC\nspecial assessment expense, contract termination charges, Louisville expenses, property optimization charges, as well as adjusted noninterest income, which excludes\ndebt securities gains/losses and the gain on sale of Visa Class B restricted shares. Management believes that excluding these items from noninterest expense and\nnoninterest income may be useful in assessing the Company’s underlying operational performance as these items either do not pertain to its core business operations or\ntheir exclusion may facilitate better comparability between periods and for peer comparison purposes.\nThe tax-equivalent adjustment to net interest income and net interest margin recognizes the income tax savings when comparing taxable and tax-exempt assets. Interest\nincome and yields on tax-exempt securities and loans are presented using the current federal income tax rate of 21%. Management believes that it is standard practice in\nthe banking industry to present net interest income and net interest margin on a fully tax-equivalent basis and that it may enhance comparability for peer comparison\npurposes.\nIn management's view, tangible common equity measures are capital adequacy metrics that may be meaningful to the Company, as well as analysts and investors, in\nassessing the Company's use of equity and in facilitating comparisons with peers. These non-GAAP measures are valuable indicators of a financial institution's capital\nstrength since they eliminate intangible assets from stockholders' equity and retain the effect of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders' equity.\nAlthough intended to enhance investors' understanding of the Company's business and performance, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an\nalternative to GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from those used by other financial institutions to assess their business and performance.\nSee the following reconciliations in the \"Non-GAAP Reconciliations\" section in the appendix for details on the calculation of these measures to the extent presented herein.\n4\nCorporate Strategy\nOld National’s primary strategic objective is to be a top quartile performing “basic bank” that is a primary,\ntrusted partner to our clients in the communities we serve, and a highly respected, highly valued\nemployer that continually empowers our team members to grow, develop and succeed.\nExecute with Relentless Focus Quality, Low-Cost\nand Win in our Key Markets Deposit Base\nDrive Long-\nGranular & Diversified Term\nProven Acquirer\nLoan Portfolio\nShareholder\nValue\nDiversified Revenue\nStrong Credit Culture\nStreams\n5\nSnapshot of Old National\n1\nSummary\nCompany Description\nHeadquarters Evansville, IN • 6th largest commercial bank headquartered in\nMidwest - top 30 banking company based in the\nMarket Cap $6,111\nU.S. by assets\nP/ TBV 160 % • 280 branches and 359 ATMs\nDividend Yield 2.9 %\nLTM Average Daily Volume (Actual) 2,017,766\nTotal Assets $53,602 Key Financial Metrics\nWealth Assets Under Management $31,359\nCost of Total Deposits 225 bps\nLoan-to-Deposit Ratio2 89%\nPrice / Tangible Book Value $11.97\nLoan Mix2 Deposit Mix Efficiency Ratio As Reported/ Adjusted3 53.8% / 51.2%\nNet Charge-Offs / Average Loans,\nexcluding PCD 0.16%\nConsumer\n8% 30-89 Day Delinquent Loans 0.25%\nNon-Performing Loans / Total Loans 1.22%\nTime\nCRE Non- Money 19%\nTangible Common Equity to Tangible Assets 7.4%\nResidential Owner Market\nReal Estate Occupied 26% ROATCE As Reported / Adjusted3 16.0% / 16.8%\n19% 32%\nDemand\nSavings 24%\n12%\nC&I NOW\n29% 19%\nCRE Owner\nOccupied\n12%\n$ in millions, except as noted; Financial data as of or for the quarter ended 9/30/2024, except as noted 1 Market data as of 11/5/2024\n2 Includes loans held for sale 3 Non-GAAP financial measures that management believes is useful in evaluating the financial results of the\nCompany - see Appendix for Non-GAAP reconciliation\nP / TBV - price to tangible book value PCD - purchased credit deteriorated ROATCE - return on average tangible common equity\n6\nLTM - last twelve months\nThe Best of Offense and Defense\nOFFENSE DEFENSE\nTop quartile 3Q2024 Quality, peer-leading deposit franchise\nfinancial metrics\n• Growth in total deposits of 8.5% annualized\n• 16.8% Adj.
