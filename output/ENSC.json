(NASDAQ:ENSC) (\"Ensysce\" or the \"Company\"), a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company developing innovative solutions for severe pain relief while reducing the potential for opioid abuse and overdose, today reported financial and operational results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\nDr. Lynn Kirkpatrick, Chief Executive Officer of Ensysce, commented, \"Our team has made significant progress in the third quarter, and we have line of sight to meaningful clinical initiatives to close out the year. The highlight of the third quarter was NIH's recognition of the potential value provided by our overdose protection technology MPAR®, by awarding Ensysce with a $14 million multi-year grant to further the clinical development of PF614-MPAR. The support from the NIH allows the completion of a second Phase 1b trial, PF614-MPAR-102. We believe the data from this study will cement PF614-MPAR as the first opioid with oral overdose protection, a game-changer for those suffering with severe pain while mitigating potential abuse and overdose.\"\n\nDr. Kirkpatrick continued, \"We also built on FDA feedback from our End of Phase 2 meeting in February to complete our Phase 3 protocol and have submitted it to the FDA. We expect FDA feedback by the end of November to allow us to complete plans to execute the study over the coming year. Our August financing transaction that raised $5 million in gross proceeds allows us to advance to clinical site selection for our pivotal Phase 3 trial for PF614, and the $14 million MPAR® grant has allowed us to rapidly initiate our second trial for PF614-MPAR. We anticipate the results from these clinical studies will continue to build on our prior positive safety data to bring our innovative and premium pain products to market. Lastly, we are applying our TAAP and MPAR technology to our opioid use disorder program and look forward to moving the lead agent into clinical development in the coming years.\"\n\n**TAAP TM (Opioid Abuse Deterrent Program) Update**\n\nOur lead product, PF614, is a Trypsin-Activated Abuse Protection (TAAPTM) extended-release oxycodone and a potential \"next generation\" analgesic for severe pain. The Company's TAAPTM technology is designed to control release, be highly resistant to tampering, and reduce abuse through a unique chemical modification. PF614's TAAPTM modification makes it inactive until it is swallowed and exposed to the body's own trypsin in the small intestine to activate or \"switch on\" to release oxycodone.\n\nDuring the third quarter, the Company submitted to the FDA for regulatory review the protocol and statistical analysis plan for its anticipated final Phase 3 study, PF614-301. The study is entitled \"A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-and Active-Controlled Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of PF614 for the Treatment of Moderate to Severe Pain after Abdominoplasty\".\n\n**MPAR® (Opioid Abuse Deterrent and Overdose Protection Program) Update**\n\nPF614-MPAR, designed to treat severe pain with added oral overdose protection, is a combination product of the TAAPTM prodrug PF614 with a trypsin inhibitor. MPAR® (Multi-Pill Abuse Resistance) reduces or \"switches off\" the release of the opioid only in an overdose situation, providing an additional layer of protection to Ensysce's TAAP™ medications. The clinical data from the first clinical trial, PF614-101, demonstrated that the MPAR® technology reduces release and absorption of oxycodone from PF614 when consumed in more than a prescribed dose, leading to the FDA's Breakthrough Therapy designation in January of this year.\n\nDuring the third quarter, the Company received approval from the Investigational Review Board (\"IRB\") of the PF614-MPAR-102 protocol, ‘A Single and Multiple Dose Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics of Oxycodone and PF614 when PF614 capsule is Co‑Administered with Nafamostat as a combination Immediate Release solution and Extended-Release Capsule Formulation in Healthy Subjects.' The Site Initiation Visit has been undertaken and the study is on track to initiate subject dosing this quarter. To execute this study, Ensysce has continued its collaboration with Quotient Sciences to use their Translational Pharmaceutics® platform to perfect the drug product. As reported in August, the Company received a $14 million multi-year grant from the NIH, National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) to fund this clinical study as well as the necessary non-clinical studies to support an NDA (New Drug Application) for PF614-MPAR.\n\n**Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) Program Update**\n\nThe Company recently announced the selection of its lead OUD drug candidate PF9001 that has been designed using Ensysce's TAAPTM platform. The intent of the program is to reduce both the abuse profile and the cardiovascular side effects associated with traditional methadone OUD treatments. The program is finalizing required studies supported by a multi-year Helping to End Addiction Long-Term (HEAL) award of up to $15 million granted by the NIH and NIDA and anticipates advancing to Investigational New Drug (IND) enabling studies in the coming year.\n\n**Q3 2024 Financial Results**\n\n**Cash -** Cash and cash equivalents were $4.2 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $1.1 million as of December 31, 2023. A key driver for the increase in cash was cumulative net proceeds of $8.5 million from equity financings in February and August 2024.\n\n**Stockholders' Equity -** Stockholders' equity was $6.6 million as of September 30, 2024, a level compliant with the $2.5 million stockholders' equity requirement set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1).\n\n**Federal Grants -** Funding under federal grants totaled $3.4 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $0.4 million in the comparable year ago quarter. The increase is due to the timing of research activities eligible for funding, with increased activities under the OUD grant following the selection of a lead drug candidate in June. Funding under the current phase of the OUD grant was completed in August 2024. Also contributing to the increase is the recently awarded MPAR grant, with payments for clinical activities for PF614-MPAR initiated during the quarter. With the completion of the OUD grant, funding under federal grants is expected to decline in coming quarters from the level of the third quarter of 2024.\n\n**Research & Development Expenses -** R&D expenses were $1.7 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $1.9 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease of $0.2 million was primarily the result of reduced external research and development costs related to clinical and pre-clinical programs for PF614 in the 2024 period. Increased activities on the OUD and MPAR programs are expected to result in higher research and development expenses in coming quarters.\n\n**General & Administrative Expenses - **G&A expenses were $1.1 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $1.2 million for the third quarter of 2023, a slight decrease of $0.1 million. G&A expenses are expected to approximate current levels in the coming quarters.\n\n**Other Income (Expense) -** Total other income (expense), net, was consistent with income of $17,023 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to income of $16,508 for the same period of 2023.\n\n**Net Income (Loss) -** Net income attributable to common stockholders for the third quarter of 2024 was $0.7 million compared to a net loss of $2.7 million for the third quarter of 2023. The Company recorded net income in the third quarter due to the timing of federal grant funding received, with the completion of funding under the OUD grant and the start of funding under the MPAR grant both occurring during the quarter. With only the MPAR grant moving forward, net income for the third quarter is expected to be a one-time event and we do not anticipate net income in coming quarters. As a clinical stage biotech company, our continued research and development efforts toward regulatory approvals for our product candidates are expected to result in losses for the foreseeable future.\n\n**About Ensysce Biosciences**\n\nEnsysce Biosciences is a clinical-stage company using its proprietary technology platforms to develop safer prescription drugs.

(NASDAQ:ENSC) (\"Ensysce\" or \"Company\"), a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company developing innovative solutions for severe pain relief while reducing the potential for opioid abuse and overdose, today announced that Dr. Lynn Kirkpatrick, Chief Executive Officer of Ensysce, will present at the 18th Annual Pain Therapeutics Summit taking place on October 28 and 29, 2024 in Boston, MA.\n\nDr. Kirkpatrick's presentation \"When All You Have is a Hammer ... A New Approach to Soften the Blow\" will be held on Monday, October 28th at 1:00 PM Eastern Time.\n\nIn this session, Dr. Kirkpatrick will review the proliferation of new analgesic entrants that have promised opioid-like efficacy but to date have not delivered. The result has been opioid mistrust and unfortunately, a reduction in access for those who depend on opioid pain relief for a decent quality of life. Instead of turning away from these effective analgesics, Ensysce embraced their efficacy by introducing new TAAP™ and MPAR® classes of opioids. The lead agents, PF614 and PF614-MPAR, are expected to provide a novel option for high-risk patients delivering exquisite pain relief yet with advantages over currently used Abuse Deterrent Formulation (ADF) opioid products. TAAP-modified opioids reduce multiple forms of abuse and only release the opioid when taken orally and exposed to trypsin in the gut. MPAR applies another layer of safety resulting in oral overdose protection by adding a trypsin inhibitor to each of the TAAP products. Dr. Kirkpatrick will present clinical data demonstrating these unique qualities of TAAP and MPAR and supporting their added benefits over the ADF class.\n\nEnsysce's commitment to the Annual Pain Therapeutics Summit is also represented by Dr. William Schmidt, Chief Medical Officer of Ensysce, who will serve as Chairperson for the second consecutive year. Dr. Schmidt will provide opening remarks on Monday, October 28th and Tuesday, October 29th. Dr. Schmidt has specialized in providing advice on preclinical and clinical studies of novel analgesic drugs throughout his career. Dr. Schmidt is the Parliamentarian and a Past President of the Eastern Pain Association. He received the John J. Bonica award for the development of new analgesics and his sustained contributions to the educational efforts of the Eastern Pain Association in 2014.\n\nThe Annual Pain Therapeutics Summit is a widely recognized arena for leaders in the fields of advanced medicine and science, academia and government to come together and discuss the latest advances in the quest to develop novel pain therapies. The summit will present thoughtful insight from key industry leaders and academic researchers concerning cutting edge drug discovery science, preclinical development trends, analysis of key clinical-stage pain therapies and newly marketed products. The agenda for this year's event includes a wide variety of topics in the field of pain research, such as the development of novel therapeutics, biomarkers associated with pain states, and clinical trial design considerations. Additionally, the event offers panel discussions on key issues facing pain research today from ethical considerations to funding challenges and beyond. The event is a prominent gathering of experts dedicated to improving the lives of those suffering from chronic pain.

(NASDAQ:ENSC) (\"Ensysce\" or the \"Company\"), a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company developing innovative solutions for severe pain relief while reducing the potential for opioid abuse and overdose, today reported financial and operational results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\nDr. Lynn Kirkpatrick, Chief Executive Officer of Ensysce, commented, \"Our team has made significant progress in the third quarter, and we have line of sight to meaningful clinical initiatives to close out the year. The highlight of the third quarter was NIH's recognition of the potential value provided by our overdose protection technology MPAR®, by awarding Ensysce with a $14 million multi-year grant to further the clinical development of PF614-MPAR. The support from the NIH allows the completion of a second Phase 1b trial, PF614-MPAR-102. We believe the data from this study will cement PF614-MPAR as the first opioid with oral overdose protection, a game-changer for those suffering with severe pain while mitigating potential abuse and overdose.\"\n\nDr. Kirkpatrick continued, \"We also built on FDA feedback from our End of Phase 2 meeting in February to complete our Phase 3 protocol and have submitted it to the FDA. We expect FDA feedback by the end of November to allow us to complete plans to execute the study over the coming year. Our August financing transaction that raised $5 million in gross proceeds allows us to advance to clinical site selection for our pivotal Phase 3 trial for PF614, and the $14 million MPAR® grant has allowed us to rapidly initiate our second trial for PF614-MPAR. We anticipate the results from these clinical studies will continue to build on our prior positive safety data to bring our innovative and premium pain products to market. Lastly, we are applying our TAAP and MPAR technology to our opioid use disorder program and look forward to moving the lead agent into clinical development in the coming years.\"\n\n**TAAP TM (Opioid Abuse Deterrent Program) Update**\n\nOur lead product, PF614, is a Trypsin-Activated Abuse Protection (TAAPTM) extended-release oxycodone and a potential \"next generation\" analgesic for severe pain. The Company's TAAPTM technology is designed to control release, be highly resistant to tampering, and reduce abuse through a unique chemical modification. PF614's TAAPTM modification makes it inactive until it is swallowed and exposed to the body's own trypsin in the small intestine to activate or \"switch on\" to release oxycodone.\n\nDuring the third quarter, the Company submitted to the FDA for regulatory review the protocol and statistical analysis plan for its anticipated final Phase 3 study, PF614-301. The study is entitled \"A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-and Active-Controlled Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of PF614 for the Treatment of Moderate to Severe Pain after Abdominoplasty\".\n\n**MPAR® (Opioid Abuse Deterrent and Overdose Protection Program) Update**\n\nPF614-MPAR, designed to treat severe pain with added oral overdose protection, is a combination product of the TAAPTM prodrug PF614 with a trypsin inhibitor. MPAR® (Multi-Pill Abuse Resistance) reduces or \"switches off\" the release of the opioid only in an overdose situation, providing an additional layer of protection to Ensysce's TAAP™ medications. The clinical data from the first clinical trial, PF614-101, demonstrated that the MPAR® technology reduces release and absorption of oxycodone from PF614 when consumed in more than a prescribed dose, leading to the FDA's Breakthrough Therapy designation in January of this year.\n\nDuring the third quarter, the Company received approval from the Investigational Review Board (\"IRB\") of the PF614-MPAR-102 protocol, ‘A Single and Multiple Dose Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics of Oxycodone and PF614 when PF614 capsule is Co‑Administered with Nafamostat as a combination Immediate Release solution and Extended-Release Capsule Formulation in Healthy Subjects.' The Site Initiation Visit has been undertaken and the study is on track to initiate subject dosing this quarter. To execute this study, Ensysce has continued its collaboration with Quotient Sciences to use their Translational Pharmaceutics® platform to perfect the drug product. As reported in August, the Company received a $14 million multi-year grant from the NIH, National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) to fund this clinical study as well as the necessary non-clinical studies to support an NDA (New Drug Application) for PF614-MPAR.\n\n**Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) Program Update**\n\nThe Company recently announced the selection of its lead OUD drug candidate PF9001 that has been designed using Ensysce's TAAPTM platform. The intent of the program is to reduce both the abuse profile and the cardiovascular side effects associated with traditional methadone OUD treatments. The program is finalizing required studies supported by a multi-year Helping to End Addiction Long-Term (HEAL) award of up to $15 million granted by the NIH and NIDA and anticipates advancing to Investigational New Drug (IND) enabling studies in the coming year.\n\n**Q3 2024 Financial Results**\n\n**Cash -** Cash and cash equivalents were $4.2 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $1.1 million as of December 31, 2023. A key driver for the increase in cash was cumulative net proceeds of $8.5 million from equity financings in February and August 2024.\n\n**Stockholders' Equity -** Stockholders' equity was $6.6 million as of September 30, 2024, a level compliant with the $2.5 million stockholders' equity requirement set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1).\n\n**Federal Grants -** Funding under federal grants totaled $3.4 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $0.4 million in the comparable year ago quarter. The increase is due to the timing of research activities eligible for funding, with increased activities under the OUD grant following the selection of a lead drug candidate in June. Funding under the current phase of the OUD grant was completed in August 2024. Also contributing to the increase is the recently awarded MPAR grant, with payments for clinical activities for PF614-MPAR initiated during the quarter. With the completion of the OUD grant, funding under federal grants is expected to decline in coming quarters from the level of the third quarter of 2024.\n\n**Research & Development Expenses -** R&D expenses were $1.7 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $1.9 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease of $0.2 million was primarily the result of reduced external research and development costs related to clinical and pre-clinical programs for PF614 in the 2024 period. Increased activities on the OUD and MPAR programs are expected to result in higher research and development expenses in coming quarters.\n\n**General & Administrative Expenses - **G&A expenses were $1.1 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $1.2 million for the third quarter of 2023, a slight decrease of $0.1 million. G&A expenses are expected to approximate current levels in the coming quarters.\n\n**Other Income (Expense) -** Total other income (expense), net, was consistent with income of $17,023 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to income of $16,508 for the same period of 2023.\n\n**Net Income (Loss) -** Net income attributable to common stockholders for the third quarter of 2024 was $0.7 million compared to a net loss of $2.7 million for the third quarter of 2023. The Company recorded net income in the third quarter due to the timing of federal grant funding received, with the completion of funding under the OUD grant and the start of funding under the MPAR grant both occurring during the quarter. With only the MPAR grant moving forward, net income for the third quarter is expected to be a one-time event and we do not anticipate net income in coming quarters. As a clinical stage biotech company, our continued research and development efforts toward regulatory approvals for our product candidates are expected to result in losses for the foreseeable future.\n\n**About Ensysce Biosciences**\n\nEnsysce Biosciences is a clinical-stage company using its proprietary technology platforms to develop safer prescription drugs.
