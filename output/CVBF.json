This represented a $2.8 million, or 2.50%, increase from the second quarter of 2024, and a $9.8 million, or 7.90%, decrease from the third quarter of 2023. The quarter-over-quarter increase in net interest income was primarily due to a $7.0 million increase in interest income resulting from a $513 million average increase in our interest-earning balances due from the Federal Reserve, partially offset by a $3.8 million increase in interest on deposits. The decline in net interest income compared to the third quarter of 2023 was primarily due to a 26 basis point decline in net interest margin.\n\n**Net Interest Margin** Our tax equivalent net interest margin was 3.05% for both the second and third quarters of 2024, compared to 3.31% for the third quarter of 2023. Our cost of funds compared to the second quarter of 2024 increased nine basis points, which was offset by a six basis point increase in our interest-earning asset yield. The six basis point increase in our interest-earning asset yield was due to a five basis point increase in loan yields and funds on deposit at the Federal Reserve increasing as a percentage of earnings assets to 8.2%, from 4.8% in the prior quarter. Average funds held at the Federal Reserve of $1.22 billion, grew by $513 million from the second quarter of 2024, earning 5.4% on average for the third quarter. Our cost of funds increased in the third quarter to 1.47%, as our cost of deposits and customer repurchase agreements increased by 14 basis points to 1.01%. The cost of interest-bearing non-maturity deposits increased from the prior quarter by 22 basis points. On average, borrowings decreased by $121 million compared to the second quarter, while continuing to have an average cost of 4.77%. The 26 basis point decrease in net interest margin compared to the third quarter of 2023, was primarily the result of a 55 basis point increase in cost of funds. This increase in cost of funds from the prior year quarter was the result of a 46 basis point increase in the cost of deposits and an increase in the level of borrowings, which grew on average by $411 million. A 25 basis point increase in earning asset yields over the prior year quarter partially offset the increase in funding costs. The higher earning asset yields, included higher loan yields, which grew from 5.07% for the third quarter of 2023 to 5.31% for the third quarter of 2024. The higher earning asset yield was also the result of the increase in average funds held at the Federal Reserve, which grew from 3.1% of earning assets in the third quarter of 2023 to 8.2% in the third quarter of 2024.\n\n**Earning Assets and Deposits** On average, total earning assets grew by $262 million, or 1.79%, quarter-over-quarter. This growth includes the $513 million increase in average funds on deposit at the Federal Reserve. Investment securities and loans declined on average by $126.9 million and $126.3 million, respectively, when compared to the second quarter of 2024. The decline in investment securities includes the impact of selling approximately $300 million of AFS securities during the third quarter. Compared to the third quarter of 2023, the mix of assets changed modestly, with the average balance of investment securities decreasing by $462.6 million, declining from 37% to 34% of total earning assets. Conversely, the average amount of funds held at the Federal Reserve increased by $748.8 million, growing from 3.1% of total earning assets in the third quarter of 2023 to 8.2% for the third quarter of 2024. Noninterest-bearing deposits declined on average by $28.4 million, or 0.40%, from the second quarter of 2024 and interest-bearing deposits and customer repurchase agreements increased on average by $279.2 million. Compared to the third quarter of 2023, total deposits and customer repurchase agreements declined on average by $503.7 million, or 3.90%, including a decline of $688 million, or 8.8%, in noninterest-bearing deposits. Non-maturity interest-bearing deposits and customer repurchase agreements decreased by $247.5 million on average, while time deposits grew on average by $431.9 million. On average, noninterest-bearing deposits were 59.10% of total deposits during the most recent quarter, compared to 60.20% for the second quarter of 2024 and 62.09% for the third quarter of 2023.\n\n**Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n**SELECTED FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS**| **September 30, 2024**| **June 30, 2024**| **September 30, 2023**  \n _(Dollars in thousands)_  \nYield on average investment securities (TE)| 2.67| %| 2.71| %| 2.64| %  \nYield on average loans| 5.31| %| 5.26| %| 5.07| %  \nYield on average earning assets (TE)| 4.43| %| 4.37| %| 4.18| %  \nCost of deposits| 0.98| %| 0.88| %| 0.52| %  \nCost of funds| 1.47| %| 1.38| %| 0.92| %  \nNet interest margin (TE)| 3.05| %| 3.05| %| 3.31| %  \n_**Average Earning Asset Mix**_| **Avg**| **% of Total**| **Avg**| **% of Total**| **Avg**| **% of Total**  \nTotal investment securities| $| 5,080,033| 34.01| %| $| 5,206,959| 35.49| %| $| 5,542,590| 37.20| %  \nInterest-earning deposits with other institutions| 1,232,551| 8.25| %| 716,916| 4.89| %| 473,391| 3.18| %  \nLoans| 8,605,270| 57.61| %| 8,731,587| 59.51| %| 8,862,462| 59.48| %  \nTotal interest-earning assets| 14,935,866| 14,673,474| 14,900,003  \n  \n**Provision for Credit Losses** There was no provision for credit losses in the third and second quarter of 2024, compared to $2.0 million in provision in the third quarter of 2023. Net recoveries for the third quarter of 2024 were $156,000, compared to net charge-offs $31,000 in the prior quarter. Allowance for credit losses represented 0.97% of gross loans at September 30, 2024, compared to 0.95% at June 30, 2024.\n\n**Noninterest Income** Noninterest income was $12.8 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared with $14.4 million for the second quarter of 2024 and $14.3 million for the third quarter of 2023. During the third quarter of 2024, the Bank executed sale-leaseback transactions with the sale of two buildings, which operate as Banking Centers, and were simultaneously leased back, resulting in a pre-tax net gain of $9.1 million. The gains on selling the buildings were offset by realizing a pre-tax net loss of $11.6 million on the sale of $312 million of AFS securities. Third quarter income from Bank Owned Life Insurance (“BOLI”) increased by $557,000 from the second quarter of 2024 and increased by $2 million compared to the third quarter of 2023. We experienced $320,000 in death benefits that exceeded the asset value on certain policies in the third quarter of 2024, compared to no death benefits in the second quarter of 2024 and no death benefits in the third quarter of 2023. The year-over-year increase of $2 million in BOLI income was primarily due to the restructuring and enhancements in BOLI policies during the fourth quarter of 2023. Trust and investment service fees grew by 4.0% or $137,000 compared to the prior quarter and by 9.8% or $319,000 compared to the third quarter of 2023. \n\n**Noninterest Expense** Noninterest expense for the third quarter of 2024 was $58.8 million, compared to $56.5 million for the second quarter of 2024 and $55.0 million for the third quarter of 2023. The $2.3 million quarter-over-quarter increase included a $1.2 million increase in staff related expense, as annual salary increases took effect in July. The $690,000 quarter-over-quarter increase in regulatory assessments was due to the $700,000 accrual adjustment in the second quarter of 2024 related the FDIC special assessment. There was a $750,000 recapture of provision for unfunded loan commitments in the third quarter of 2024, compared to a $500,000 recapture of provision in the second quarter of 2024 and $900,000 recaptured in the third quarter of 2023. Occupancy and equipment expense grew by $432,000 or 7%, compared to the prior quarter, including the impact of the two buildings that were sold and leased back during the third quarter.\n\nThe $3.8 million increase in noninterest expense year-over-year included increased staff related expenses of $1.9 million, or 5.48%. Professional services increased $738,000, including a $627,000 increase in legal expense year-over-year. Occupancy and equipment expense increased by $586,000, or 10.43% and software expense increased $258,000, or 7% year-over-year. As a percentage of average assets, noninterest expense was 1.42% for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 1.40% for the second quarter of 2024 and 1.33% for the third quarter of 2023. The efficiency ratio for the third quarter of 2024 was 46.53%, compared to 45.10% for the second quarter of 2024 and 39.99% for the third quarter of 2023. \n\n**Income Taxes** Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 26.25%, compared with 28.20% for the same period of 2023. Our estimated annual effective tax rate can vary depending upon the level of tax-advantaged income from municipal securities and BOLI, as well as available tax credits.\n\n**BALANCE SHEET HIGHLIGHTS**\n\n**Assets** The Company reported total assets of $15.4 billion at September 30, 2024. This represented a decrease of $748.3 million, or 4.63%, from total assets of $16.15 billion at June 30, 2024.

The decrease in assets included a $549.9 million decrease in investment securities, and a $328.4 million decrease in net loans, partially offset by a $142.9 million increase in interest-earning balances due from the Federal Reserve.\n\nTotal assets at September 30, 2024 decreased by $499.8 million, or 3.14%, from total assets of $15.90 billion at September 30, 2023. The decrease in assets was primarily due to a $491.8 million decrease in investment securities and a $299.0 million decrease in net loans, partially offset by an increase of $188.6 million in interest-earning balances due from the Federal Reserve and a $57.1 million increase in the cash surrender value of BOLI.\n\n**Sale-Leaseback Transaction** During the third quarter of 2024, the Bank executed sale-leaseback transactions and sold two buildings, that are utilized as Banking Centers, for an aggregate sale price of $17 million.

The Bank also recorded Right of Use (“ROU”) assets and corresponding operating lease liabilities each totaling $11.2 million.\n\n**Investment Securities and BOLI** Total investment securities were $4.87 billion at September 30, 2024, a decrease of $549.9 million, or 10.14% from December 31, 2023, and a decrease of $491.8 million, or 9.17%, from $5.36 billion at September 30, 2023. \n\nAt September 30, 2024, investment securities available-for-sale (“AFS”) totaled $2.47 billion, inclusive of a pre-tax net unrealized loss of $367.7 million. AFS securities decreased by $280.2 million from the prior quarter end, by $490.5 million, or 16.59%, from December 31, 2023 and decreased by $407.6 million, or 14.19%, from $2.87 billion at September 30, 2023. Pre-tax unrealized loss decreased by $120.2 million from the end of the prior quarter, and declined by $82.1 million from December 31, 2023 and by $260.7 million from September 30, 2023.\n\nConcurrent with the sale-leaseback transactions during the third quarter of 2024, the Bank sold AFS securities with a book value of $312 million, resulting in a net pre-tax loss of $11.6 million.\n\nAt September 30, 2024, investment securities held-to-maturity (“HTM”) totaled $2.41 billion, a decrease of $24.6 million from the prior quarter end, a $59.4 million, or 2.41% decline from December 31, 2023, and a decrease of $84.2 million, or 3.38%, from September 30, 2023.\n\nCombined, the AFS and HTM investments in mortgage backed securities (“MBS”) and collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMO”) totaled $3.82 billion or approximately 78% of the total investment securities at September 30, 2024. Virtually all of our MBS and CMO are issued or guaranteed by government or government sponsored enterprises, which have the implied guarantee of the U.S. Government. In addition, at September 30, 2024, we had $552.6 million of Government Agency securities that represent approximately 11.3% of the total investment securities.\n\nOur combined AFS and HTM municipal securities totaled $485.7 million as of September 30, 2024, or 10% of our total investment portfolio. These securities are located in 35 states. Our largest concentrations of holdings by state, as a percentage of total municipal bonds, are located in Texas at 16.09%, Minnesota at 11.07%, and California at 9.71%.\n\nAt September 30, 2024, the Company had $316.6 million of Bank Owned Life insurance (“BOLI”), compared to $308.7 million at December 31, 2023 and $259.5 million at September 30, 2023. The $57.1 million increase in value of BOLI, when compared to September 30, 2023, was primarily due to a restructuring of the Company’s life insurance policies at the end of 2023, including a $4.5 million write-down in value on surrender policies that was offset by a $10.9 million enhancement to cash surrender values, as well as additional policy purchases totaling $41 million. This restructuring has increased returns on our BOLI policies resulting in additional non-taxable noninterest income in 2024.\n\n**Loans** Total loans and leases, at amortized cost, of $8.57 billion at September 30, 2024 decreased by $109.3 million, or 1.26%, from June 30, 2024.

The decrease in total loans included decreases of $165.9 million in commercial real estate loans, $70.5 million in dairy & livestock and agribusiness loans, $52.0 million in construction loans, and $33.4 million in commercial and industrial loans.\n\nTotal loans and leases, at amortized cost, decreased by $305.1 million, or 3.44%, from September 30, 2023. The $305.1 million decrease included decreases of $224.4 million in commercial real estate loans, $48.3 million in construction loans, $13.1 million in SBA loans, $9.0 million in dairy & livestock and agribusiness loans, and $8.0 million in municipal lease financings.\n\n**Asset Quality** During the third quarter of 2024, we experienced credit charge-offs of $26,000 and total recoveries of $182,000, resulting in net recoveries of $156,000. The allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) totaled $82.9 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $82.8 million at June 30, 2024 and $89.0 million at September 30, 2023. At September 30, 2024, ACL as a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding was 0.97%. This compares to 0.95% at June 30, 2024 and 0.98% at December 31, 2023 and 1.00% at September 30, 2023.\n\nNonperforming loans, defined as nonaccrual loans, including modified loans on nonaccrual, plus loans 90 days past due and accruing interest, and nonperforming assets, defined as nonperforming plus OREO, are highlighted below.\n\n**Nonperforming Assets and Delinquency Trends**| **September 30,2024**| **June 30,2024**| **September 30,2023**  \n---|---|---|---  \n**Nonperforming loans**|  _(Dollars in thousands)_  \nCommercial real estate| $| 18,794| $| 21,908| $| 3,655  \nSBA| 151| 337| 1,050  \nCommercial and industrial| 2,825| 2,712| 4,672  \nDairy & livestock and agribusiness| 143| -| 243  \nSFR mortgage| -| -| 339  \nConsumer and other loans| -| -| 4  \n**Total**| **$**| **21,913**| **$**| **24,957**| **$**| **9,963**| [1]  \n**% of Total loans**| **0.26**| **%**| **0.29**| **%**| **0.11**| **%**  \n**OREO**  \nCommercial real estate| $| -| $| -| $| -  \nCommercial and industrial| 647| 647| -  \nSFR mortgage| -| -| -  \n**Total**| **$**| **647**| **$**| **647**| **$**| **-**  \n**Total nonperforming assets**| **$**| **22,560**| **$**| **25,604**| **$**| **9,963**  \n**% of Nonperforming assets to total assets**| **0.15**| **%**| **0.16**| **%**| **0.06**| **%**  \n**Past due 30-89 days (accruing)**  \nCommercial real estate| $| 30,701| $| 43| $| 136  \nSBA| -| -| -  \nCommercial and industrial| 64| 103| -  \nDairy & livestock and agribusiness| -| -| -  \nSFR mortgage| -| -| -  \nConsumer and other loans| -| -| -  \n**Total**| **$**| **30,765**| **$**| **146**| **$**| **136**  \n**% of Total loans**| **0.36**| **%**| **0.00**| **%**| **0.00**| **%**  \n**Classified Loans**| **$**| **124,606**| **$**| **124,728**| **$**| **92,246**  \n[1] Includes $2.6 million of nonaccrual loans past due 30-89 days.  \n  \nThe $3.0 million decrease in nonperforming loans from June 30, 2024 was primarily due to the payoff of one nonperforming commercial real estate loans totaling $2.3 million and $1.4 million in paydowns of nonperforming commercial real estate loans associated with two relationships. Past due loans grew to more than $30 million on September 30, 2024. Classified loans are loans that are graded “substandard” or worse. Classified loans decreased $122,000 quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to a $668,000 net decrease in classified commercial real estate loans, which included the payoff of 4 loans totaling $11.5 million that were partially offset by the addition of six classified commercial real estate loans in the third quarter of 2024. Classified dairy & livestock and agribusiness loans declined by $3.5 million due to paydowns and classified commercial and industrial loans increased $3.5 million primarily due to the addition of one classified commercial and industrial loan.\n\n**Deposits & Customer Repurchase Agreements**Deposits of $12.07 billion and customer repurchase agreements of $394.5 million totaled $12.47 billion at September 30, 2024. This represented a net increase of $407.9 million compared to June 30, 2024. Total deposits at September 30, 2024 included $400 million in brokered time deposits. Total deposits and customer repurchase agreements increased $761.7 million, or 6.51%, when compared to $11.71 billion at December 31, 2023 partially due to the growth in brokered deposits, and decreased $161.3 million, or 1.28% when compared to $12.63 billion at September 30, 2023.\n\nNoninterest-bearing deposits were $7.14 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of $46.7 million, or 0.66%, when compared to $7.09 billion at June 30, 2024. Noninterest-bearing deposits decreased by $69.4 million, or 0.96% when compared to $7.21 billion at December 31, 2023, and decreased by $449.8 million, or 5.93% when compared to $7.59 billion at September 30, 2023. At September 30, 2024, noninterest-bearing deposits were 59.12% of total deposits, compared to 60.13% at June 30, 2024, 63.03% at December 31, 2023, and 61.39% at September 30, 2023.\n\n**Borrowings** As of September 30, 2024, total borrowings consisted of $500 million of FHLB advances. The FHLB advances include maturities of $300 million, at an average cost of approximately 4.73%, maturing in May of 2026, and $200 million, at a cost of 4.27% maturing in May of 2027.

We engaged in no stock repurchases during the first nine months of 2024. Our tangible book value per share at September 30, 2024 was $10.17.\n\nOur capital ratios under the revised capital framework referred to as Basel III remain well-above regulatory standards. \n\n**CVB Financial Corp.
