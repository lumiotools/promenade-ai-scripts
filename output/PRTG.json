(“Portage” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: PRTG), a clinical-stage immuno-oncology company with a portfolio of novel multi-targeted therapies for use as monotherapy and in combination, today reported its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n“We are continuing to explore multiple strategic alternatives to further unlock shareholder value. These may include finding a partner for one or more of our assets, a sale of our company, a merger, restructurings (both in and out of court), a company wind down, further financing efforts, or other strategic actions,” said Dr. Ian Walters, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Portage. “The ADPORT-601 trial is paused for further patient accrual pending additional financial resources, and we are analyzing the data. We also continue our collaborations with numerous experts to further understand the biology and utility of our product candidates,” continued Dr. Walters.\n\n**Financial Results for the Quarter Ended September 30, 2024**\n\nThe Company incurred a net loss of approximately $1.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 (the “Fiscal 2025 Quarter”), compared to a net loss of approximately $5.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 (the “Fiscal 2024 Quarter”), representing a $3.8 million decrease quarter-over-quarter.\n\nOperating expenses, including research and development (“R&D”) costs and general and administrative (“G&A”) expenses, were $1.6 million in the Fiscal 2025 Quarter, down from $5.9 million in the Fiscal 2024 Quarter, a decrease of $4.3 million, as detailed below.\n\nR&D costs decreased by approximately $3.5 million, or approximately 83%, from approximately $4.2 million in the Fiscal 2024 Quarter to approximately $0.7 million in the Fiscal 2025 Quarter. The decrease was primarily attributable to the winding down of clinical trial costs (principally CRO-related), which decreased by approximately $1.6 million, from $2.0 million in the Fiscal 2024 Quarter to $0.4 million in the Fiscal 2025 Quarter, as activities ramped down throughout the period since we made the decision to pause enrollment in our sponsored clinical trials in the third and fourth quarters of Fiscal 2024. Manufacturing-related costs decreased by $0.9 million, from $1.0 million in the Fiscal 2024 Quarter to $0.029 million in the Fiscal 2025 Quarter. These decreases reflect the winding down of clinical activity and manufacturing-related costs resulting from our decision to discontinue our sponsored clinical trial for the iNKT program and pause further patient accrual to our sponsored adenosine program. R&D non-cash share-based compensation expense decreased from $0.4 million in the Fiscal 2024 Quarter to nil in the Fiscal 2025 Quarter. Payroll-related expenses decreased by $0.1 million, from $0.37 million in the Fiscal 2024 Quarter to $0.24 million in the Fiscal 2025 Quarter, due to the resignation of two employees in January 2024. Additionally, consulting fees decreased by approximately $0.2 million from $0.25 million in the Fiscal 2024 Quarter to $0.03 million in the Fiscal 2025 Quarter, to reflect the decrease in activity period-over-period. Finally, licensing fees decreased by approximately $0.1 million due to licensing fees paid to the licensor of certain intellectual property utilized in the iNKT clinical trial in Fiscal 2024 Quarter compared to nil in Fiscal 2025 Quarter as the iNKT clinical trial was discontinued in the latter half of Fiscal 2024.\n\nG&A expenses decreased by approximately $0.8 million, or approximately 48%, from approximately $1.7 million in the Fiscal 2024 Quarter to approximately $0.9 million in the Fiscal 2025 Quarter. Professional fees decreased by $0.4 million, from $0.8 million in the Fiscal 2024 Quarter to $0.4 million in the Fiscal 2025 Quarter. Payroll-related expenses decreased by $0.1 million from $0.2 million in the Fiscal 2024 Quarter to $0.1 million in the Fiscal 2025 Quarter. The decrease in professional fees and payroll-related expenses is due to the accrual of the monthly fees and payments for the entire second quarter in the first quarter for a consultant and employee in connection with certain Retention Agreements entered into on July 22, 2024. Additionally, G&A non-cash share-based compensation expense decreased by $0.2 million due to the continued vesting of stock options, partially offset by recording all share-based compensation expense as G&A expenses as the result of the discontinuation of the iNKT trial and the pause of further patient accrual in the adenosine program. Finally, directors’ fees decreased by $0.1 million in the Fiscal 2025 Quarter, compared to the Fiscal 2024 Quarter, as all directors, except for two directors who resigned in April 2024, waived their fees in the Fiscal 2025 Quarter.\n\nThe primary reasons for the quarter-over-quarter differences in the Company’s pre-tax items of income and expense were the $0.9 million net gain from the settlement and release of obligations and liabilities under the Master Services Agreement between iOx and Parexel partially offset to some extent by the $0.7 million non-cash loss from the change in the fair value of certain warrants accounted for as liabilities, issued in connection with a private placement offering in October 2023, both in the Fiscal 2025 Quarter, and a non-cash loss from the increase in the fair value of the deferred purchase price payable to the former Tarus shareholders and the deferred obligation for the iOx milestone, totaling $0.1 million, in the Fiscal 2024 Quarter.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1.8 million and total current liabilities of approximately $0.9 million.\n\n**About Portage Biotech Inc.**\n\nPortage is a clinical-stage immuno-oncology company with a portfolio of multi-targeted therapies to extend survival and significantly improve the lives of patients with cancer.

(“Portage” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: PRTG), a clinical-stage immuno-oncology company with a portfolio of novel multi-targeted therapies for use as monotherapy and in combination, today reported its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\n“We continue to explore strategic alternatives. These may include finding a partner for one or more of our assets, a sale of our company, a merger, restructurings (both in and out of court), a company wind down, further financing efforts, or other strategic actions,” said Dr. Ian Walters, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Portage. “We are encouraged by the two advanced patients that continue on PORT-6 beyond 6 months who we continue to follow, and we plan to replace one patient in the ADPORT-601 trial who withdrew prior to dose limiting toxicity assessment for an unrelated adverse event. We also continue our collaborations with numerous experts to further understand the biology and utility of our product candidates,” continued Dr. Walters.\n\n**Financial Results for the Quarter Ended June 30, 2024**\n\nThe Company incurred a net loss of approximately $1.7 million during the three months ended June 30, 2024 (the “Fiscal 2025 Quarter”), compared to a net loss of approximately $4.2 million during the three months ended June 30, 2023 (the “Fiscal 2024 Quarter”), representing a $2.5 million decrease in net loss.\n\nOperating expenses, including research and development (“R&D”) costs and general and administrative (“G&A”) expenses, were $2.8 million in the Fiscal 2025 Quarter, down from $5.0 million in the Fiscal 2024 Quarter, a decrease of $2.2 million, as detailed below.\n\nR&D costs decreased by approximately $2.3 million, or 64%, from $3.6 million in the Fiscal 2024 Quarter, to $1.3 million in the Fiscal 2025 Quarter. This reduction was primarily due to the winding down of clinical trial costs (principally CRO-related), which decreased by $0.3 million, from $1.0 million in the Fiscal 2024 Quarter to $0.7 million in the Fiscal 2025 Quarter, as the Company paused enrollment in its sponsored clinical trials in the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024. Manufacturing-related costs decreased by $0.7 million, from $0.8 million in the Fiscal 2024 Quarter to $0.1 million in the Fiscal 2025 Quarter. These decreases reflect reduced clinical activity and manufacturing costs following the Company’s decision to discontinue the iNKT program and pause further patient accrual in the adenosine program. Additionally, R&D non-cash share-based compensation expense decreased from $0.4 million in the Fiscal 2024 Quarter to nil in the Fiscal 2025 Quarter. Payroll-related expenses also decreased by $0.2 million, from $0.5 million in the Fiscal 2024 Quarter to $0.3 million in the Fiscal 2025 Quarter, due to the resignation of two employees in January 2024. Further, in the Fiscal 2024 Quarter, the Company incurred a $0.5 million milestone payment for dosing its first adenosine patients. Consulting fees decreased by $0.1 million, from $0.2 million in the Fiscal 2024 Quarter to $0.1 million in the Fiscal 2025 Quarter, reflecting the decline in consulting-related activity. Lastly, there was a $0.1 million decrease in fees paid related to the transition of the iNKT study before its discontinuation.\n\nG&A expenses increased by $0.1 million, or 7%, from $1.4 million in the Fiscal 2024 Quarter to $1.5 million in the Fiscal 2025 Quarter. Professional fees increased by $0.1 million, from $0.5 million in the Fiscal 2024 Quarter to $0.6 million in the Fiscal 2025 Quarter, primarily due to legal fees associated with regulatory filings, corporate matters, and related audit fees. Payroll-related expenses increased by $0.4 million from $0.2 million in the Fiscal 2024 Quarter to $0.6 million in the Fiscal 2025 Quarter due to the amounts associated with retention agreements executed with an employee and a consultant. Additionally, G&A non-cash share-based compensation expense decreased by $0.2 million due to the continued vesting of stock options with higher fair values, partially offset by recording all Fiscal 2025 Quarter share-based compensation expense as G&A expenses as the result of the discontinuation of the iNKT study and the pause of further patient accrual in the adenosine program. Directors’ fees also decreased by $0.1 million in the Fiscal 2025 Quarter, as all directors, except for two who resigned in April 2024, waived their fees.\n\nThe primary reasons for the quarter-over-quarter differences in the Company’s pre-tax items of income and expense were the $1.1 million non-cash gain from the change in the fair value of certain warrants accounted for as liabilities, issued in connection with an equity offering in October 2023, in the Fiscal 2025 Quarter, and the non-cash loss from the increase in the fair value of the deferred purchase price payable to the former Tarus shareholders and the deferred obligation for the iOx milestone, totaling $1.1 million, in the Fiscal 2024 Quarter.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $3.3 million and total current liabilities of approximately $3.0 million.\n\n**About Portage Biotech Inc.** Portage is a clinical-stage immuno-oncology company with a portfolio of multi-targeted therapies to extend survival and significantly improve the lives of patients with cancer.

(“Portage” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: PRTG), a clinical-stage immuno-oncology company with a portfolio of novel multi-targeted therapies for use as monotherapy and in combination, today announced its financial results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024.\n\n“After reviewing Portage’s funding requirements, which necessitated discontinuing the clinical development of its iNKT program and pausing patient enrollment in the ADPORT-601 clinical trial of PORT-6 (adenosine 2A inhibitor) and PORT-7 (adenosine 2B inhibitor), we continue to explore strategic alternatives. These may include finding a partner for one or more of our assets, a sale of our company, a merger, restructurings (both in and out of court), a company wind down, further financing efforts, or other strategic actions,” said Dr. Ian Walters, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Portage.\n\n**Financial Results from Year Ended March 31, 2024**\n\nThe Company incurred a net loss of approximately $75.4 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 (“Fiscal 2024”), which includes approximately $60.6 million of net non-cash expenses. This compares to a net loss of approximately $104.7 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023 (“Fiscal 2023”), reflecting a decrease in net loss of $29.3 million year-over-year. The decrease was primarily due to lower non-cash losses on impairment related to the Company’s identifiable intangible assets, goodwill, and certain investments and convertible note receivable.\n\nOperating expenses, which include research and development (“R&D”) costs and general and administrative (“G&A”) expenses, were $18.2 million in Fiscal 2024, compared to $16.6 million in Fiscal 2023, an increase of $1.6 million. This increase was primarily due to additional clinical development costs related to the PORT-6 clinical trial and the iNKT clinical trial for PORT-2, prior to discontinuing the Company’s iNKT trial and pausing further enrollment in the ADPORT-601 clinical trial of PORT-6 (adenosine 2A inhibitor) and PORT-7 (adenosine 2B inhibitor).\n\nR&D costs increased by approximately $3.8 million, or about 44%, from approximately $8.7 million in Fiscal 2023 to approximately $12.5 million in Fiscal 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to clinical trial costs (principally CRO-related), which increased by approximately $2.5 million, from $2.7 million in Fiscal 2023 to $5.2 million in Fiscal 2024, as activities ramped up until the Company decided to discontinue its iNKT trial and pause patient enrollment in its ADPORT adenosine trial in the third and fourth quarters of Fiscal 2024, respectively. Manufacturing-related costs increased by $1.0 million, from $0.8 million in Fiscal 2023 to $1.8 million in Fiscal 2024, related to the iNKT and adenosine clinical trials. Payroll-related expenses decreased by $0.3 million from $1.9 million in Fiscal 2023 to $1.6 million in Fiscal 2024; the increases in salaries effective January 2023 were more than offset by the fact that no annual bonuses were incurred in Fiscal 2024. R&D non-cash share-based compensation expense decreased by $0.8 million, from $2.2 million in Fiscal 2023 to $1.4 million in Fiscal 2024. This decrease was due to the continued vesting of options granted in prior years, as well as recent grants having a lower grant date fair value. Additionally, in Fiscal 2024, the Company incurred a milestone payment of $0.5 million for dosing its first adenosine patient, an increase in consulting fees of approximately $0.4 million from $0.4 million in Fiscal 2023 to $0.8 million in Fiscal 2024 to reflect the increase in activity year-over-year, and finally, $0.5 million in fees paid with respect to the transition of the iNKT study, prior to discontinuing the study in Fiscal 2024.\n\nG&A expenses decreased by approximately $2.2 million, or about 28%, from approximately $7.9 million in Fiscal 2023 to approximately $5.7 million in Fiscal 2024. Professional fees decreased by $0.7 million, to $2.3 million in Fiscal 2024, compared to $3.0 million in Fiscal 2023, primarily due to legal fees associated with the Tarus acquisition and other regulatory filings in Fiscal 2023. Additionally, G&A non-cash share-based compensation expense decreased by $0.8 million, from $2.0 million in Fiscal 2023 to $1.2 million in Fiscal 2024. This decrease was attributable to the vesting of certain stock options granted in prior years and the lower fair value of more recent grants. Insurance expense decreased by $0.5 million, from $1.2 million in Fiscal 2023 to $0.7 million in Fiscal 2024, due to a decrease in the D&O premium year-over-year resulting from changes in the insurance markets. Directors’ fees decreased by $0.1 million in Fiscal 2024, compared to Fiscal 2023, as certain directors waived their fees for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. Finally, payroll-related expenses decreased by $0.1 million from $1.0 million in Fiscal 2023 to $0.9 million in Fiscal 2024; the increase in annual salaries effectuated in January 2023 was slightly more than offset by the fact that there were no annual bonuses incurred in Fiscal 2024.\n\nThe Company’s other pre-tax items of income and expense were substantially non-cash in nature, aggregating approximately $67.7 million in net expenses for Fiscal 2024, compared to approximately $105.9 million in net expenses for Fiscal 2023. The net losses in each year were attributed to impairments of intangible assets. The impairment in Fiscal 2024 represented the full impairment of the carrying value of in-process research and development of $57.9 million for iOx and $23.6 million for Tarus, as well as a $1.0 million loss on the impairment of the Company’s investment in Stimunity and the Stimunity convertible note. These expenses were partially offset by the non-cash gains from the decrease in the fair value of the deferred purchase price payable to the former Tarus shareholders and the deferred obligation for the iOx milestone, totaling $11.3 million.\n\nThe Company recognized a $0.7 million gain on the sale of Intensity shares, accounted for under fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI), which had a carrying value of $2.1 million and a $2.4 million loss during Fiscal 2024 from the Company’s equity financing in October 2023, representing the excess of the fair value of certain warrants over the net proceeds. Additionally, a $6.9 million non-cash gain was recognized from the change in the fair value of certain warrants accounted for as liabilities issued in connection with this equity offering.\n\nAdditionally, the Company recognized a non-cash net deferred income tax benefit of $10.5 million in Fiscal 2024, compared to a non-cash net deferred income tax benefit of $17.9 million in Fiscal 2023, a year-over-year change of $7.4 million. This benefit was primarily attributable to the tax effect of the non-cash impairment loss on IPR&D for iOx, partially offset by the derecognition of previously recognized losses.\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $5.0 million and total current liabilities of approximately $2.9 million.\n\n**About Portage Biotech Inc.**\n\nPortage is a clinical-stage immuno-oncology company advancing multi-targeted therapies to extend survival and significantly improve the lives of patients with cancer.
