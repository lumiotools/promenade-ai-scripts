(NASDAQ: ANL) (the “Company” or “Adlai Nortye”), a global clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the development of innovative targeted and immune-modulating cancer therapies, today announced its business highlights, the appointment of Roger Sawhney, M.D. to its Board of Directors and its first half financial results for the period ended June 30, 2024.\n\n“I am pleased with our team’s important progress and operational execution across our innovative pipeline of targeted and immune-modulating therapies,” said Carsten Lu, CEO and Chairman of Adlai Nortye. “We strengthened our team, by having welcoming Archie Tse, M.D., Ph.D., as the Head of Research and Development who brings critical expertise in oncology drug development, and Roger Sawhney, M.D., our newest member of our board of directors. We also shared encouraging safety and efficacy data, including one complete response for AN4005, our first-in-class oral PD-L1 inhibitor from Phase 1 study, and successfully nominated the development candidate for AN8025, a multifunctional fusion protein that serves as a T cell and APC modulator.\n\nAs we look to the second half of 2024 and beyond, we plan to present a clinical update from AN4005 which has the potential to provide a more convenient treatment option for patients as an IV-administered anti-PD-L1 therapy. Importantly, we remain highly focused on the advancement of our lead candidate, buparlisib, for the potential treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) that has progressed after prior anti-PD(L)1 treatment and remain on track to report the Phase 3 OS data in the first quarter of 2025.”\n\n**__Recent Development and Business Highlights__**\n\n**Corporate**\n\n**Archie Tse, M.D., Ph.D. appointed as Head of Research and Development.** On March 29, the Company announced the appointment of Dr. Archie Tse as Head of Research and Development.

Dr. Sawhney holds an M.D. from Harvard Medical School and a B.A. in Economics from Stanford University.\n\n**Pipeline updates AN2025 (Buparlisib)**\n\n  * The Company is conducting BURAN (NCT04338399), a randomized, open-label phase 3 trial to assess the treatment effect of once-daily buparlisib in combination with weekly paclitaxel compared to weekly paclitaxel alone in patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC that has progressed after prior anti-PD(L)1 treatment.\n  * The Company remains on track to present overall survival (OS) data in the first quarter of 2025.\n\n\n\n**AN4005**\n\n  * In an ongoing Phase 1 study (NCT04999384), the Company is investigating the safety of AN4005, its oral small-molecule PD-L1 inhibitor.\n  * The Company plans to provide a clinical update in the second half of 2024.\n  * The expansion cohort portion of the trial for IO treatment-naïve patients was initiated in July 2024.\n\n\n\n**AN8025**\n\n  * AN8025 is an in-house developed multifunctional fusion protein, which serves as a T cell and APC modulator. The Company anticipates submitting the investigational drug application (IND) in mid-2025.\n\n\n\n**AN9025**\n\n  * AN9025 is an in-house developed oral small molecule pan-RAS inhibitor. The Company anticipates submitting the IND in the second half of 2025.\n\n\n\n_**_Financial Highlights for the Six Month Period Ended June 30, 2024_**_\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Company are prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standard Board (IASB). The consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars, the Company’s functional and presentation currency.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents totaled US$98.0 million compared to US$91.5 million on December 31, 2023. Based on our current operating plan, we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our current and anticipated working capital requirements and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months.\n\nNet cash used in operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was US$28.4 million, compared to US$18.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023.\n\nResearch and development expenses decreased by 4.5% from US$27.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 to US$26.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to lower expenses associated with the development of the clinical stage programs, a result of a decrease in CRO service fees.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by 9.8% from US$5.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 to US$4.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, primarily attributable to a decrease in share-based compensation expenses resulting from the vesting schedule of certain stock options in 2024.\n\nOther income and gains increased by 852.4% from US$0.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 to US$2.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, primarily attributable to additional government grants received in 2024.\n\nFair value loss on financial liabilities at FVTPL was US$45.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, compared to nil for the six months ended June 30, 2024. Financial liabilities at FVTPL recorded for the six months ended June 30, 2023 were caused by the repurchase rights of shareholders’ investments before the company went public. The fair value loss on financial liabilities recorded for the six months ended June 30, 2023 was due to valuation changes before the company’s initial public offering (“IPO”). There will no longer be any fair value loss on financial liabilities at FVTPL after the company’s IPO, as a result of all financial liabilities at FVTPL have been converted to ordinary shares.\n\nFor the reasons described above, the Company’s net loss for the period ended June 30, 2024 decreased significantly by 64.8% from US$78.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 to US$27.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024.\n\n**__About Buparlisib (AN2025)__**\n\nBuparlisib (AN2025) is an oral pan-PI3K inhibitor that targets all class I PI3K isoforms and is active in both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. In the global phase II clinical trial for the treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), the median overall survival was as high as 10.4 months. It has received Fast-Track designation and an approval for initiating the phase III clinical study from FDA. The BURAN study investigating Buparlisib is also the first global phase III clinical trial conducted by Adlai Nortye.\n\n**__About the BURAN Study__**\n\nThe BURAN study (NCT04338399) is a randomized, open-label, multicenter phase III study to assess the treatment effect of once-daily buparlisib in combination with weekly paclitaxel compared to weekly paclitaxel alone in patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) that have progressed after prior anti–PD(L)1 monotherapy; prior anti–PD(L)1 therapy in combination with platinum-based therapy; or after sequential treatment of anti–PD(L)1 therapy, either prior to or post, platinum-based therapy.\n\n**__About AN4005__**\n\nAN4005 is an orally available, small-molecule PD-L1 inhibitor that demonstrates antitumor activity by the blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 interaction. In nonclinical studies, AN4005 has demonstrated significant pharmacological activity, target engagement and acceptable safety profiles, which support the clinical development as a potential therapy for advanced malignancies. In pharmacology studies, AN4005 was shown to functionally overcome the inhibition derived from PD-1/L1 interaction in reporter- and human PBMC (hPBMC)-based cellular assays. Small molecule PD-L1 inhibitors are expected to provide several benefits over monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), such as, allowing for oral administration, lower production costs, improved tumor penetration, and lack of immunogenicity.\n\n_**_About Adlai Nortye_**_\n\nAdlai Nortye (NASDAQ: ANL) is a global clinical-stage company focused on the development of innovative targeted and immune-modulating cancer therapies, with global R&D centers in the U.S. and China. The Company is advancing a robust oncology pipeline, with our lead candidate Buparlisib (AN2025), a pan-PI3K inhibitor, currently being evaluated in a registrational Phase 3 trial (NCT04338399) in patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) that has progressed after prior anti-PD(L)1 treatment. Additionally, we are advancing multiple drug candidates including AN4005, an oral small molecule PD-L1 inhibitor, AN8025, a multifunctional fusion protein acting as a T cell and antigen-presenting cell (“APC”) modulator, and AN9025, an oral small molecule pan-RAS inhibitor.\n\n_**_Forward-Looking Statement_**_\n\nThis announcement contains forward-looking statements.
