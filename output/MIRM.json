In PFIC, this can be serious or may lead to liver transplant or death. Your healthcare provider should do blood tests and physical exams before starting and during treatment to check your liver function. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you get any signs or symptoms of liver problems, including nausea or vomiting, skin or the white part of the eye turns yellow, dark or brown urine, pain on the right side of the stomach (abdomen), bloating in your stomach area, loss of appetite or bleeding or bruising more easily than normal. \n\n**Stomach and intestinal (gastrointestinal) problems.** LIVMARLI can cause stomach and intestinal problems, including diarrhea and stomach pain. Your healthcare provider may advise you to monitor for new or worsening stomach problems including stomach pain, diarrhea, blood in your stool or vomiting. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have any of these symptoms more often or more severely than normal for you. \n\nA condition called **Fat Soluble Vitamin (FSV) Deficiency** caused by low levels of certain vitamins (vitamin A, D, E, and K) stored in body fat is common in patients with Alagille syndrome and PFIC but may worsen during treatment. Your healthcare provider should do blood tests before starting and during treatment and may monitor for bone fractures and bleeding which have been reported as common side effects. \n\n[US Prescribing Information ](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Ffiles.mirumpharma.com%2Flivmarli%2Flivmarli-prescribinginformation.pdf%3F_ga%3D2.264585739.542484716.1646698894-2002651408.1625676440&esheet=54152828&newsitemid=20241114053418&lan=en-US&anchor=US+Prescribing+Information&index=5&md5=30882412bd8661d4b03881bf3ec4533f) [EU SmPC ](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fec.europa.eu%2Fhealth%2Fdocuments%2Fcommunity-register%2Fhtml%2Fh1704.htm&esheet=54152828&newsitemid=20241114053418&lan=en-US&anchor=EU+SmPC&index=6&md5=ab01d3fa8a04bc5e4f3ba00f434835ba) [Canadian Product Monograph](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Ffiles.mirumpharma.com%2Flivmarli%2Flivmarli-product-monograph-en.pdf&esheet=54152828&newsitemid=20241114053418&lan=en-US&anchor=Canadian+Product+Monograph&index=7&md5=46ae4ae0c609891a21910011ecaa3e81)\n\n**About Mirum Pharmaceuticals, Inc.**\n\nMirum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to transforming the treatment of rare diseases affecting children and adults.

Changes in certain liver tests are common in patients with Alagille syndrome and PFIC but can worsen during treatment. These changes may be a sign of liver injury. In PFIC, this can be serious or may lead to liver transplant or death. Your healthcare provider should do blood tests and physical exams before starting and during treatment to check your liver function. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you get any signs or symptoms of liver problems, including nausea or vomiting, skin or the white part of the eye turns yellow, dark or brown urine, pain on the right side of the stomach (abdomen), bloating in your stomach area, loss of appetite or bleeding or bruising more easily than normal. \n\n**Stomach and intestinal (gastrointestinal) problems.** LIVMARLI can cause stomach and intestinal problems, including diarrhea and stomach pain. Your healthcare provider may advise you to monitor for new or worsening stomach problems including stomach pain, diarrhea, blood in your stool or vomiting. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have any of these symptoms more often or more severely than normal for you. \n\nA condition called **Fat Soluble Vitamin (FSV) Deficiency** caused by low levels of certain vitamins (vitamin A, D, E, and K) stored in body fat is common in patients with Alagille syndrome and PFIC but may worsen during treatment.

Volixibat may offer a novel approach in the treatment of adult cholestatic diseases by blocking the recycling of bile acids, through inhibition of IBAT, thereby reducing bile acids systemically and in the liver. Volixibat is currently being evaluated in Phase 2b studies for primary sclerosing cholangitis ([VISTAS study](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fvistaspscstudy.com%2F&esheet=54151070&newsitemid=20241112481474&lan=en-US&anchor=VISTAS+study&index=7&md5=1b8e69314b1b9a1fe0e9bd6d48bc74e7)), and primary biliary cholangitis ([VANTAGE study](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fvantagepbcstudy.com%2F&esheet=54151070&newsitemid=20241112481474&lan=en-US&anchor=VANTAGE+study&index=8&md5=51cdce960d0002e6e78781e52944d733)). In June, Mirum announced positive interim results from the Phase 2b VANTAGE study showing statistically significant improvement in pruritus as well as meaningful reductions in serum bile acids and improvements in fatigue for patients treated with volixibat. No new safety signals were observed, and the most common adverse event was diarrhea with all cases mild to moderate. \n\n**About CHOLBAM® (cholic acid) capsules**\n\nThe FDA approved CHOLBAM® (cholic acid) capsules in March 2015, the first FDA-approved treatment for pediatric and adult patients with bile acid synthesis disorders due to single enzyme defects, and for adjunctive treatment of patients with peroxisome biogenesis disorder-Zellweger spectrum disorder. The effectiveness of CHOLBAM® has been demonstrated in clinical trials for bile acid synthesis disorders and the adjunctive treatment of peroxisomal disorders. An estimated 200 to 300 patients are current candidates for therapy. \n\n**CHOLBAM® (cholic acid) Indication**\n\nCHOLBAM is a bile acid indicated for \n\n  * Treatment of bile acid synthesis disorders due to single enzyme defects. \n  * Adjunctive treatment of peroxisomal disorders, including Zellweger spectrum disorders, in patients who exhibit manifestations of liver disease, steatorrhea, or complications from decreased fat-soluble vitamin absorption. \n\n\n\n**LIMITATIONS OF USE**\n\nThe safety and effectiveness of CHOLBAM on extrahepatic manifestations of bile acid synthesis disorders due to single enzyme defects or peroxisomal disorders, including Zellweger spectrum disorders, have not been established. \n\n**IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION**\n\n**WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS – Exacerbation of liver impairment**\n\nMonitor liver function and discontinue CHOLBAM in patients who develop worsening of liver function while on treatment. \n\nConcurrent elevations of serum gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) may indicate CHOLBAM overdose. \n\nDiscontinue treatment with CHOLBAM at any time if there are clinical or laboratory indicators of worsening liver function or cholestasis. \n\n**ADVERSE REACTIONS**\n\nThe most common adverse reactions (≥1%) are diarrhea, reflux esophagitis, malaise, jaundice, skin lesion, nausea, abdominal pain, intestinal polyp, urinary tract infection, and peripheral neuropathy. \n\nPlease see full [Prescribing Information ](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcholbam.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2022%2F10%2FCHOLBAM-Prescribing-Information-2022-10.pdf&esheet=54151070&newsitemid=20241112481474&lan=en-US&anchor=Prescribing+Information&index=9&md5=5bab43adf9756e226ba7f65006037cbd) for additional Important Safety Information. \n\n**About Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis**\n\nCerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare, progressive and underdiagnosed disorder of cholesterol metabolism affecting many parts of the body. In people with CTX, the body is unable to break down cholesterol properly causing toxins (e.g., cholestanol and bile alcohols) to build up throughout the body over time. The disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive genetic manner. Signs and symptoms of CTX include neonatal cholestasis (jaundice or bile flow interruption), chronic diarrhea, the development of bilateral cataracts before the age of 18, development of tendon xanthomas (fatty deposits in the tendons) during teenage years or later, and neurologic deterioration. The types, combinations and severity of symptoms can be different from person to person making diagnosis challenging and often delayed. \n\n**About chenodiol tablets**\n\nChenodiol tablets is another name for chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA). CDCA is a naturally occurring bile acid that was originally approved for the treatment of people with radiolucent stones in the gallbladder. More recently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted chenodiol orphan drug designation for cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). CTX is a rare progressive disorder that can affect the brain, spinal cord, tendons, eyes and arteries. Chenodiol is not yet indicated for the treatment of CTX but has received a medical necessity determination in the U.S. by the FDA. \n\n**About Mirum Pharmaceuticals, Inc.**\n\nMirum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to transforming the treatment of rare diseases affecting children and adults.

Your healthcare provider should do blood tests before starting and during treatment and may monitor for bone fractures and bleeding which have been reported as common side effects. \n\n[US Prescribing Information ](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Ffiles.mirumpharma.com%2Flivmarli%2Flivmarli-prescribinginformation.pdf%3F_ga%3D2.264585739.542484716.1646698894-2002651408.1625676440&esheet=54151070&newsitemid=20241112481474&lan=en-US&anchor=US+Prescribing+Information&index=4&md5=5a1421f0d024adf7aefddb94c4e5d8db) [EU SmPC ](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fec.europa.eu%2Fhealth%2Fdocuments%2Fcommunity-register%2Fhtml%2Fh1704.htm&esheet=54151070&newsitemid=20241112481474&lan=en-US&anchor=EU+SmPC&index=5&md5=ba7cd3eed0d76cd10601fde1cee3e70c) [Canadian Product Monograph](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Ffiles.mirumpharma.com%2Flivmarli%2Flivmarli-product-monograph-en.pdf&esheet=54151070&newsitemid=20241112481474&lan=en-US&anchor=Canadian+Product+Monograph&index=6&md5=f958b2eee5a6977aafa96ebc3d95248f)\n\n**About Volixibat**\n\nVolixibat is an oral, minimally absorbed agent designed to selectively inhibit the ileal bile acid transporter (IBAT). Volixibat may offer a novel approach in the treatment of adult cholestatic diseases by blocking the recycling of bile acids, through inhibition of IBAT, thereby reducing bile acids systemically and in the liver. Volixibat is currently being evaluated in Phase 2b studies for primary sclerosing cholangitis ([VISTAS study](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fvistaspscstudy.com%2F&esheet=54151070&newsitemid=20241112481474&lan=en-US&anchor=VISTAS+study&index=7&md5=1b8e69314b1b9a1fe0e9bd6d48bc74e7)), and primary biliary cholangitis ([VANTAGE study](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fvantagepbcstudy.com%2F&esheet=54151070&newsitemid=20241112481474&lan=en-US&anchor=VANTAGE+study&index=8&md5=51cdce960d0002e6e78781e52944d733)). In June, Mirum announced positive interim results from the Phase 2b VANTAGE study showing statistically significant improvement in pruritus as well as meaningful reductions in serum bile acids and improvements in fatigue for patients treated with volixibat. No new safety signals were observed, and the most common adverse event was diarrhea with all cases mild to moderate. \n\n**About CHOLBAM® (cholic acid) capsules**\n\nThe FDA approved CHOLBAM® (cholic acid) capsules in March 2015, the first FDA-approved treatment for pediatric and adult patients with bile acid synthesis disorders due to single enzyme defects, and for adjunctive treatment of patients with peroxisome biogenesis disorder-Zellweger spectrum disorder. The effectiveness of CHOLBAM® has been demonstrated in clinical trials for bile acid synthesis disorders and the adjunctive treatment of peroxisomal disorders. An estimated 200 to 300 patients are current candidates for therapy. \n\n**CHOLBAM® (cholic acid) Indication**\n\nCHOLBAM is a bile acid indicated for \n\n  * Treatment of bile acid synthesis disorders due to single enzyme defects. \n  * Adjunctive treatment of peroxisomal disorders, including Zellweger spectrum disorders, in patients who exhibit manifestations of liver disease, steatorrhea, or complications from decreased fat-soluble vitamin absorption. \n\n\n\n**LIMITATIONS OF USE**\n\nThe safety and effectiveness of CHOLBAM on extrahepatic manifestations of bile acid synthesis disorders due to single enzyme defects or peroxisomal disorders, including Zellweger spectrum disorders, have not been established. \n\n**IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION**\n\n**WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS – Exacerbation of liver impairment**\n\nMonitor liver function and discontinue CHOLBAM in patients who develop worsening of liver function while on treatment. \n\nConcurrent elevations of serum gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) may indicate CHOLBAM overdose. \n\nDiscontinue treatment with CHOLBAM at any time if there are clinical or laboratory indicators of worsening liver function or cholestasis. \n\n**ADVERSE REACTIONS**\n\nThe most common adverse reactions (≥1%) are diarrhea, reflux esophagitis, malaise, jaundice, skin lesion, nausea, abdominal pain, intestinal polyp, urinary tract infection, and peripheral neuropathy. \n\nPlease see full [Prescribing Information ](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcholbam.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2022%2F10%2FCHOLBAM-Prescribing-Information-2022-10.pdf&esheet=54151070&newsitemid=20241112481474&lan=en-US&anchor=Prescribing+Information&index=9&md5=5bab43adf9756e226ba7f65006037cbd) for additional Important Safety Information. \n\n**About Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis**\n\nCerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare, progressive and underdiagnosed disorder of cholesterol metabolism affecting many parts of the body. In people with CTX, the body is unable to break down cholesterol properly causing toxins (e.g., cholestanol and bile alcohols) to build up throughout the body over time. The disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive genetic manner. Signs and symptoms of CTX include neonatal cholestasis (jaundice or bile flow interruption), chronic diarrhea, the development of bilateral cataracts before the age of 18, development of tendon xanthomas (fatty deposits in the tendons) during teenage years or later, and neurologic deterioration. The types, combinations and severity of symptoms can be different from person to person making diagnosis challenging and often delayed. \n\n**About chenodiol tablets**\n\nChenodiol tablets is another name for chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA). CDCA is a naturally occurring bile acid that was originally approved for the treatment of people with radiolucent stones in the gallbladder. More recently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted chenodiol orphan drug designation for cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). CTX is a rare progressive disorder that can affect the brain, spinal cord, tendons, eyes and arteries. Chenodiol is not yet indicated for the treatment of CTX but has received a medical necessity determination in the U.S. by the FDA. \n\n**About Mirum Pharmaceuticals, Inc.**\n\nMirum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to transforming the treatment of rare diseases affecting children and adults.

Changes in certain liver tests are common in patients with Alagille syndrome and PFIC but can worsen during treatment. These changes may be a sign of liver injury. In PFIC, this can be serious or may lead to liver transplant or death. Your healthcare provider should do blood tests and physical exams before starting and during treatment to check your liver function. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you get any signs or symptoms of liver problems, including nausea or vomiting, skin or the white part of the eye turns yellow, dark or brown urine, pain on the right side of the stomach (abdomen), bloating in your stomach area, loss of appetite or bleeding or bruising more easily than normal. \n\n**Stomach and intestinal (gastrointestinal) problems.** LIVMARLI can cause stomach and intestinal problems, including diarrhea and stomach pain. Your healthcare provider may advise you to monitor for new or worsening stomach problems including stomach pain, diarrhea, blood in your stool or vomiting. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have any of these symptoms more often or more severely than normal for you. \n\nA condition called **Fat Soluble Vitamin (FSV) Deficiency** caused by low levels of certain vitamins (vitamin A, D, E, and K) stored in body fat is common in patients with Alagille syndrome and PFIC but may worsen during treatment. Your healthcare provider should do blood tests before starting and during treatment and may monitor for bone fractures and bleeding which have been reported as common side effects. \n\n[US Prescribing Information ](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Ffiles.mirumpharma.com%2Flivmarli%2Flivmarli-prescribinginformation.pdf%3F_ga%3D2.264585739.542484716.1646698894-2002651408.1625676440&esheet=54151070&newsitemid=20241112481474&lan=en-US&anchor=US+Prescribing+Information&index=4&md5=5a1421f0d024adf7aefddb94c4e5d8db) [EU SmPC ](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fec.europa.eu%2Fhealth%2Fdocuments%2Fcommunity-register%2Fhtml%2Fh1704.htm&esheet=54151070&newsitemid=20241112481474&lan=en-US&anchor=EU+SmPC&index=5&md5=ba7cd3eed0d76cd10601fde1cee3e70c) [Canadian Product Monograph](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Ffiles.mirumpharma.com%2Flivmarli%2Flivmarli-product-monograph-en.pdf&esheet=54151070&newsitemid=20241112481474&lan=en-US&anchor=Canadian+Product+Monograph&index=6&md5=f958b2eee5a6977aafa96ebc3d95248f)\n\n**About Volixibat**\n\nVolixibat is an oral, minimally absorbed agent designed to selectively inhibit the ileal bile acid transporter (IBAT). Volixibat may offer a novel approach in the treatment of adult cholestatic diseases by blocking the recycling of bile acids, through inhibition of IBAT, thereby reducing bile acids systemically and in the liver. Volixibat is currently being evaluated in Phase 2b studies for primary sclerosing cholangitis ([VISTAS study](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fvistaspscstudy.com%2F&esheet=54151070&newsitemid=20241112481474&lan=en-US&anchor=VISTAS+study&index=7&md5=1b8e69314b1b9a1fe0e9bd6d48bc74e7)), and primary biliary cholangitis ([VANTAGE study](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fvantagepbcstudy.com%2F&esheet=54151070&newsitemid=20241112481474&lan=en-US&anchor=VANTAGE+study&index=8&md5=51cdce960d0002e6e78781e52944d733)). In June, Mirum announced positive interim results from the Phase 2b VANTAGE study showing statistically significant improvement in pruritus as well as meaningful reductions in serum bile acids and improvements in fatigue for patients treated with volixibat. No new safety signals were observed, and the most common adverse event was diarrhea with all cases mild to moderate. \n\n**About CHOLBAM® (cholic acid) capsules**\n\nThe FDA approved CHOLBAM® (cholic acid) capsules in March 2015, the first FDA-approved treatment for pediatric and adult patients with bile acid synthesis disorders due to single enzyme defects, and for adjunctive treatment of patients with peroxisome biogenesis disorder-Zellweger spectrum disorder. The effectiveness of CHOLBAM® has been demonstrated in clinical trials for bile acid synthesis disorders and the adjunctive treatment of peroxisomal disorders. An estimated 200 to 300 patients are current candidates for therapy. \n\n**CHOLBAM® (cholic acid) Indication**\n\nCHOLBAM is a bile acid indicated for \n\n  * Treatment of bile acid synthesis disorders due to single enzyme defects. \n  * Adjunctive treatment of peroxisomal disorders, including Zellweger spectrum disorders, in patients who exhibit manifestations of liver disease, steatorrhea, or complications from decreased fat-soluble vitamin absorption. \n\n\n\n**LIMITATIONS OF USE**\n\nThe safety and effectiveness of CHOLBAM on extrahepatic manifestations of bile acid synthesis disorders due to single enzyme defects or peroxisomal disorders, including Zellweger spectrum disorders, have not been established. \n\n**IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION**\n\n**WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS – Exacerbation of liver impairment**\n\nMonitor liver function and discontinue CHOLBAM in patients who develop worsening of liver function while on treatment. \n\nConcurrent elevations of serum gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) may indicate CHOLBAM overdose. \n\nDiscontinue treatment with CHOLBAM at any time if there are clinical or laboratory indicators of worsening liver function or cholestasis. \n\n**ADVERSE REACTIONS**\n\nThe most common adverse reactions (≥1%) are diarrhea, reflux esophagitis, malaise, jaundice, skin lesion, nausea, abdominal pain, intestinal polyp, urinary tract infection, and peripheral neuropathy. \n\nPlease see full [Prescribing Information ](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcholbam.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2022%2F10%2FCHOLBAM-Prescribing-Information-2022-10.pdf&esheet=54151070&newsitemid=20241112481474&lan=en-US&anchor=Prescribing+Information&index=9&md5=5bab43adf9756e226ba7f65006037cbd) for additional Important Safety Information. \n\n**About Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis**\n\nCerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare, progressive and underdiagnosed disorder of cholesterol metabolism affecting many parts of the body. In people with CTX, the body is unable to break down cholesterol properly causing toxins (e.g., cholestanol and bile alcohols) to build up throughout the body over time. The disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive genetic manner. Signs and symptoms of CTX include neonatal cholestasis (jaundice or bile flow interruption), chronic diarrhea, the development of bilateral cataracts before the age of 18, development of tendon xanthomas (fatty deposits in the tendons) during teenage years or later, and neurologic deterioration. The types, combinations and severity of symptoms can be different from person to person making diagnosis challenging and often delayed. \n\n**About chenodiol tablets**\n\nChenodiol tablets is another name for chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA). CDCA is a naturally occurring bile acid that was originally approved for the treatment of people with radiolucent stones in the gallbladder. More recently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted chenodiol orphan drug designation for cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). CTX is a rare progressive disorder that can affect the brain, spinal cord, tendons, eyes and arteries. Chenodiol is not yet indicated for the treatment of CTX but has received a medical necessity determination in the U.S. by the FDA. \n\n**About Mirum Pharmaceuticals, Inc.**\n\nMirum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to transforming the treatment of rare diseases affecting children and adults.

Changes in certain liver tests are common in patients with Alagille syndrome and PFIC but can worsen during treatment. These changes may be a sign of liver injury. In PFIC, this can be serious or may lead to liver transplant or death. Your healthcare provider should do blood tests and physical exams before starting and during treatment to check your liver function. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you get any signs or symptoms of liver problems, including nausea or vomiting, skin or the white part of the eye turns yellow, dark or brown urine, pain on the right side of the stomach (abdomen), bloating in your stomach area, loss of appetite or bleeding or bruising more easily than normal. \n\n**Stomach and intestinal (gastrointestinal) problems.** LIVMARLI can cause stomach and intestinal problems, including diarrhea and stomach pain. Your healthcare provider may advise you to monitor for new or worsening stomach problems including stomach pain, diarrhea, blood in your stool or vomiting. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have any of these symptoms more often or more severely than normal for you. \n\nA condition called **Fat Soluble Vitamin (FSV) Deficiency** caused by low levels of certain vitamins (vitamin A, D, E, and K) stored in body fat is common in patients with Alagille syndrome and PFIC but may worsen during treatment. Your healthcare provider should do blood tests before starting and during treatment and may monitor for bone fractures and bleeding which have been reported as common side effects. \n\n[US Prescribing Information ](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Ffiles.mirumpharma.com%2Flivmarli%2Flivmarli-prescribinginformation.pdf%3F_ga%3D2.264585739.542484716.1646698894-2002651408.1625676440&esheet=54152828&newsitemid=20241114053418&lan=en-US&anchor=US+Prescribing+Information&index=5&md5=30882412bd8661d4b03881bf3ec4533f) [EU SmPC ](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fec.europa.eu%2Fhealth%2Fdocuments%2Fcommunity-register%2Fhtml%2Fh1704.htm&esheet=54152828&newsitemid=20241114053418&lan=en-US&anchor=EU+SmPC&index=6&md5=ab01d3fa8a04bc5e4f3ba00f434835ba) [Canadian Product Monograph](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Ffiles.mirumpharma.com%2Flivmarli%2Flivmarli-product-monograph-en.pdf&esheet=54152828&newsitemid=20241114053418&lan=en-US&anchor=Canadian+Product+Monograph&index=7&md5=46ae4ae0c609891a21910011ecaa3e81)\n\n**About Mirum Pharmaceuticals, Inc.**\n\nMirum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to transforming the treatment of rare diseases affecting children and adults.
