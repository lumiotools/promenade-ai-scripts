(“Teknova” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: TKNO), a leading producer of critical reagents for the discovery, development, and commercialization of novel therapies, vaccines, and molecular diagnostics, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n“Our year-on-year double-digit revenue growth in the third quarter gives us confidence that we have put Teknova on track for long-term success,” said Stephen Gunstream, President and Chief Executive Officer at Teknova. “We believe the difficult decisions we made to reduce expenses and raise modest amounts of capital, while retaining our core strategy, are now beginning to bear fruit. We remain confident that we’ll finish the back half of 2024 with double-digit revenue growth and look to build on this momentum as we enter 2025.”\n\n“During the third quarter of 2024, we continued to deliver improved results on several key metrics over the second quarter of 2024, as we again managed our operating expenses and capital expenditures to plan. We typically see revenue soften in the fourth quarter, primarily due to fewer business days, and are thus maintaining our full-year outlook of $35-38 million of revenue while lowering our free cash outflow outlook from less than $18 million to less than $16 million,” explained Matt Lowell, Teknova’s Chief Financial Officer.\n\n**Corporate and Financial Updates**\n\n  * Third quarter 2024 total revenue of $9.6 million was up 17% compared to $8.2 million in the third quarter 2023\n  * Total cash and short-term investments were $31.7 million and gross debt was $12.1 million at the end of the third quarter 2024\n  * Recorded $2.8 million in non-recurring, non-cash charges related to the disposal of expired inventory and write down of excess inventory created in the second half of 2022 when we increased production in anticipation of persistent high demand. Excluding this $2.8 million charge, gross margin would have been 29.8% in the third quarter 2024\n\n\n\n**Revenue for the Third Quarter and Year-to-Date**\n\n**For the Three Months EndedSeptember 30,**| **For the Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,**  \n---|---  \n**(Dollars in thousands)**| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nLab Essentials| $| 7,161| $| 7,274| $| 22,065| $| 22,112  \nClinical Solutions| 1,964| 597| 5,247| 5,859  \nOther| 451| 298| 1,168| 846  \nTotal revenue| $| 9,576| $| 8,169| $| 28,480| $| 28,817  \n  \n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nTotal revenue for the third quarter 2024 was $9.6 million, up 17% compared to $8.2 million in the third quarter 2023. Lab Essentials revenue was $7.2 million in the third quarter 2024, largely unchanged from $7.3 million in the third quarter 2023. Clinical Solutions revenue was $2.0 million in the third quarter 2024, up 229% compared to $0.6 million in the third quarter 2023.\n\nGross profit for the third quarter 2024 was $0.1 million, compared to $1.5 million in the third quarter 2023. Gross margin for the third quarter 2024 was 0.9%, compared to 18.0% in the third quarter 2023. The decrease in gross profit percentage was attributable to a $2.8 million in non-recurring, non-cash charges related to the disposal of expired inventory and write down of excess inventory created in the second half of 2022 when we increased production in anticipation of persistent high demand. Excluding this $2.8 million charge, gross margin would have been 29.8% in the third quarter 2024, resulting in an increase in the gross profit percentage primarily driven by higher Clinical Solutions revenue coupled with reduced headcount.\n\nOperating expenses for the third quarter 2024 were $7.5 million, compared to $10.2 million in the third quarter 2023. Excluding the non-recurring charges of $0.4 million recorded in the third quarter of 2023 and related to the write-off of at-the-market facility costs, operating expenses were down $2.3 million. The decrease was driven primarily by reduced headcount and spending, in particular on professional fees.\n\nNet loss for the third quarter 2024 was $7.6 million, or negative $0.15 per diluted share, compared to $10.2 million, or negative $0.34 per diluted share, for the third quarter 2023.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the third quarter 2024 was negative $5.0 million, compared to negative $5.5 million for the third quarter 2023. Excluding the $2.8 million charge, Adjusted EBITDA would have been negative $2.2 million. Free Cash Flow was negative $2.4 million for the third quarter 2024, compared to negative $5.4 million for the third quarter 2023. A full reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is included at the end of this release.\n\n**Reiterates 2024 Outlook**\n\nTeknova is reiterating its fiscal 2024 outlook for revenue while lowering its anticipated free cash outflow. The Company continues to anticipate total revenue of $35 million to $38 million for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024 (“2024”), which now assumes roughly 2% growth in Lab Essentials. The Company lowers anticipated free cash outflow from less than $18 million to less than $16 million for 2024.\n\n**Upcoming Investor Conference Attendance**\n\nStephens Annual Investment Conference (Nashville, TN)Wednesday, November 20, 2024\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast**\n\nTeknova will host a webcast and conference call on Thursday, November 7, 2024, beginning at 5:30 p.m. Eastern Time.

Since 1996, Teknova has been innovating the manufacture of critical reagents for the life sciences industry to accelerate the discovery and development of novel therapies that will help people live longer, healthier lives. We offer fully customizable solutions for every stage of the workflow, supporting industry leaders in cell and gene therapy, molecular diagnostics, and synthetic biology. Our fast turnaround of high-quality agar plates, microbial culture media, buffers, reagents, and water helps our customers scale seamlessly from RUO to GMP. Headquartered in Hollister, California, with over 200,000 square feet of state-of-the-art facilities, Teknova’s modular manufacturing platform was designed by our team of scientists, engineers, and quality control experts to efficiently produce the foundational ingredients for the discovery and commercialization of novel therapies.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThis press release contains financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Teknova uses the following non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the performance of its business and the effectiveness of its business strategies: (a) Adjusted EBITDA and (b) Free Cash Flow.\n\nTeknova defines Adjusted EBITDA as net loss adjusted for interest income (expense), net, provision for (benefit from) income taxes, depreciation expense, amortization of intangible assets, and stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA reflects further adjustments to eliminate the impact of certain items, including certain non-cash and other items that Teknova does not consider representative of its ongoing operating performance.\n\nTeknova defines Free Cash Flow as cash used in operating activities plus purchases of property, plant, and equipment.\n\nTeknova provides Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow in this press release because Teknova believes that analysts, investors, and other interested parties frequently use these measures to evaluate companies in Teknova’s industry and that such measures facilitate comparisons on a consistent basis across reporting periods. Teknova also believes such measures are helpful in highlighting trends in Teknova’s operating results because they exclude items that are not indicative of Teknova’s core operating performance. Investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or as superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures presented by Teknova may be different from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\n\nA full reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is included at the end of this release.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nStatements in this press release about future expectations, plans, and prospects, as well as any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts, may constitute “forward-looking statements.” These statements include, but are not limited to, statements relating to Teknova’s anticipated total revenue, including our expectations for 2024 revenue and free cash outflow guidance, expected growth in Lab Essentials and Clinical Solutions, and other statements about Teknova’s business prospects, including about the Company’s profitability, strategy of managing operating expenses, and long-term growth strategy. The words, without limitation, “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “target,” “will,” “would,” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these or similar identifying words. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations and beliefs and are subject to risks and uncertainties, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond Teknova’s control and could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those described in the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, demand for Teknova’s products (including the potential delay to or pausing of customer orders); Teknova’s assessment of fundamental indicators of future demand across its target customer base; Teknova’s cash flows and revenue growth rate; Teknova’s supply chain, sourcing, manufacturing, and warehousing; inventory management; risks related to global economic and marketplace uncertainties, including those related to the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East; reliance on a limited number of customers for a high percentage of Teknova’s revenue; potential acquisitions and integration of other companies; and other factors discussed in the “Risk Factors” section of Teknova’s most recent periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including in Teknova’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC, all of which you may obtain for free on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. Although Teknova believes that the expectations reflected in its forward-looking statements are reasonable, Teknova does not know whether its expectations will prove correct. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof, even if subsequently made available by Teknova on its website or otherwise. Teknova does not undertake any obligation to update, amend, or clarify these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws.\n\n**Investor Contact** Matt LowellChief Financial Officermatt.lowell@teknova.com+1 831-637-1100\n\n**Media Contact** Jennifer HenrySenior Vice President,

(“Teknova” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: TKNO), a leading producer of critical reagents for the discovery, development, and commercialization of novel therapies, vaccines, and molecular diagnostics, today announced financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\n“We delivered solid results across the board in the first half of 2024,” said Stephen Gunstream, President and Chief Executive Officer at Teknova. “I’m particularly encouraged by the progress we’ve made onboarding new clinical customers, now up to 43, a 26% increase in the past six months. I believe these customers, combined with an improved backdrop in biotech funding, put us in a strong position as we look towards 2025 and beyond,” he added.\n\n“During the second quarter of 2024, we delivered improved results over the first quarter of 2024, as we again managed our operating expenses and capital expenditures to plan. We are cautiously optimistic around the timing of further market recovery and are thus maintaining our full-year outlook of $35-38 million of revenue and free cash outflow of less than $18 million,” explained Matt Lowell, Teknova’s Chief Financial Officer. “We are very pleased with the $15.4 million equity capital raise we completed a month ago, which we believe provides sufficient liquidity to bridge the company through to cash flow positive,” he added.\n\n**Corporate and Financial Updates**\n\n  * Second quarter 2024 total revenue of $9.6 million was down 17% compared to $11.5 million in the second quarter 2023. Second quarter 2024 total revenue was up 3% sequentially and up 9% from the second quarter 2023 when adjusted to exclude revenue from a single, large Clinical Solutions order during that time\n  * Cash position of $18.6 million and gross debt of $12.1 million at the end of the second quarter 2024\n  * Raised $15.4 million of equity capital through a private placement offering in July 2024, which we believe provides sufficient liquidity to bridge the company through to cash flow positive\n  * Launched two new offerings to provide customers with increased product customization options: Express-TekSM Production, to expedite manufacturing and delivery for critical customer reagents, and a new manufacturing grade, RUO+, to provide a seamless and cost-effective option for customers as they transition from RUO to GMP\n\n\n\n**Revenue for the Second Quarter and Year-to-Date**\n\n**For the Three Months Ended June 30,**| **For the Six Months Ended June 30,**  \n---|---  \n**(Dollars in thousands)**| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nLab Essentials| $| 7,638| $| 7,581| $| 14,904| $| 14,838  \nClinical Solutions| 1,565| 3,653| 3,283| 5,262  \nOther| 411| 293| 717| 548  \nTotal revenue| $| 9,614| $| 11,527| $| 18,904| $| 20,648  \n  \n**Second Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nTotal revenue for the second quarter 2024 was $9.6 million, down 17% compared to $11.5 million in the second quarter 2023. Lab Essentials revenue was $7.6 million in the second quarter 2024, flat compared to $7.6 million in the second quarter 2023. Clinical Solutions revenue was $1.6 million in the second quarter 2024, down 57% compared to $3.7 million in the second quarter 2023.\n\nGross profit for the second quarter 2024 was $2.8 million, compared to $5.1 million in the second quarter 2023. Gross margin for the second quarter 2024 was 29.2%, compared to 43.9% in the second quarter 2023. The decrease in gross profit percentage was primarily driven by lower Clinical Solutions revenue and increased overhead costs, largely depreciation expense following the completion of our new manufacturing facility in the prior year, partially offset by reduced headcount.\n\nOperating expenses for the second quarter 2024 were $7.9 million, compared to $12.1 million in the second quarter 2023. Excluding the non-recurring charges of $2.2 million recorded in the second quarter of 2023 and related to the impairment of certain long-lived assets, operating expenses were down $2.0 million. The decrease was driven primarily by reduced headcount and spending, in particular on professional fees.\n\nNet loss for the second quarter 2024 was $5.4 million, or negative $0.13 per diluted share, compared to $7.2 million, or negative $0.25 per diluted share, for the second quarter 2023.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the second quarter 2024 was negative $2.6 million, compared to negative $2.3 million for the second quarter 2023. Free Cash Flow was negative $3.0 million for the second quarter 2024, compared to negative $6.2 million for the second quarter 2023. A full reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is included at the end of this release.\n\n**Reiterates 2024 Outlook**\n\nTeknova is reiterating its fiscal 2024 outlook for revenue and free cash outflow. The Company continues to anticipate total revenue of $35 million to $38 million for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024 (“2024”), which now assumes roughly 5% growth in Lab Essentials and the remaining dollar revenue from Clinical Solutions. The Company also continues to anticipate free cash outflow of less than $18 million for 2024.\n\n**Upcoming Investor Conference Attendance**\n\nSidoti Micro Cap Conference (Virtual)August 15, 2024 (1:45 p.m. Eastern Time)\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast**\n\nTeknova will host a webcast and conference call on Tuesday, August 13, 2024, beginning at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time.

Since 1996, Teknova has been innovating the manufacture of critical reagents for the life sciences industry to accelerate the discovery and development of novel therapies that will help people live longer, healthier lives. We offer fully customizable solutions for every stage of the workflow, supporting industry leaders in cell and gene therapy, molecular diagnostics, and synthetic biology. Our fast turnaround of high-quality agar plates, microbial culture media, buffers, reagents, and water helps our customers scale seamlessly from RUO to GMP. Headquartered in Hollister, California, with over 200,000 square feet of state-of-the-art facilities, Teknova’s modular manufacturing platform was designed by our team of scientists, engineers, and quality control experts to efficiently produce the foundational ingredients for the discovery and commercialization of novel therapies.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThis press release contains financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Teknova uses the following non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the performance of its business and the effectiveness of its business strategies: (a) Adjusted EBITDA and (b) Free Cash Flow.\n\nTeknova defines Adjusted EBITDA as net loss adjusted for interest income (expense), net, provision for (benefit from) income taxes, depreciation expense, amortization of intangible assets, and stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA reflects further adjustments to eliminate the impact of certain items, including certain non-cash and other items that Teknova does not consider representative of its ongoing operating performance.\n\nTeknova defines Free Cash Flow as cash used in operating activities plus purchases of property, plant, and equipment.\n\nTeknova provides Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow in this press release because Teknova believes that analysts, investors, and other interested parties frequently use these measures to evaluate companies in Teknova’s industry and that such measures facilitate comparisons on a consistent basis across reporting periods. Teknova also believes such measures are helpful in highlighting trends in Teknova’s operating results because they exclude items that are not indicative of Teknova’s core operating performance. Investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or as superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures presented by Teknova may be different from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\n\nA full reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is included at the end of this release.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nStatements in this press release about future expectations, plans, and prospects, as well as any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts, may constitute “forward-looking statements.” These statements include, but are not limited to, statements relating to Teknova’s anticipated total revenue, including our expectations for 2024 revenue and free cash outflow guidance, expected growth in Lab Essentials and Clinical Solutions, and other statements about Teknova’s business prospects, including about the Company’s profitability, strategy of managing operating expenses, and long-term growth strategy. The words, without limitation, “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “target,” “will,” “would,” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these or similar identifying words. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations and beliefs and are subject to risks and uncertainties, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond Teknova’s control and could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those described in the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, demand for Teknova’s products (including the potential delay to or pausing of customer orders); Teknova’s assessment of fundamental indicators of future demand across its target customer base; Teknova’s cash flows and revenue growth rate; Teknova’s supply chain, sourcing, manufacturing, and warehousing; inventory management; risks related to global economic and marketplace uncertainties, including those related to the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East; reliance on a limited number of customers for a high percentage of Teknova’s revenue; potential acquisitions and integration of other companies; and other factors discussed in the “Risk Factors” section of Teknova’s most recent periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including in Teknova’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC, all of which you may obtain for free on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. Although Teknova believes that the expectations reflected in its forward-looking statements are reasonable, Teknova does not know whether its expectations will prove correct. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof, even if subsequently made available by Teknova on its website or otherwise. Teknova does not undertake any obligation to update, amend, or clarify these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws.\n\n**Investor Contact** Matt LowellChief Financial Officermatt.lowell@teknova.com+1 831-637-1100\n\n**Media Contact** Jennifer HenrySenior Vice President,
