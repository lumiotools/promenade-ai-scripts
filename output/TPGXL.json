TPG will invest in Demopolis through TPG NEXT, its strategy focused on seeding and scaling the next generation of investment firms by providing growth capital and operational and investment support. \n\nFounded in 2022, Demopolis seeks to make control and growth equity investments in high-quality, lower middle market software companies, with a focus on B2B technology.

The firm is founded by Tim Greenfield, who serves as Managing Partner of the firm and is supported by a core team that has invested together for more than a decade. \n\n“As operators, business builders, and investors, we have seen first-hand what goes into growing and scaling a successful technology business. This perspective allows the Demopolis team to be genuine, long-term thought partners in helping tech companies reach their full potential,” said Greenfield. “TPG shares our collaborative culture, and we believe we will benefit greatly from the firm’s longstanding commitment to investment excellence, early footprint in private equity, and deep sector expertise.” \n\n“Tim and his team bring a unique combination of professional experiences that position Demopolis as a partner of choice to management teams and founders,” said Pamela Pavkov, Managing Partner of TPG NEXT. “Their distinct approach has resulted in strong success previously as an independent sponsor, and we’re excited to work together in this next stage of growth to support and scale the Demopolis platform.” \n\nThrough its partnership with TPG, Demopolis will gain access to a suite of strategic and operational capabilities to support the firm’s expansion, including areas such as capital formation, capital markets, investment sourcing, and diligence.

Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “seeks,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects” and similar references to future periods, or by the inclusion of forecasts or projections. Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements we make regarding the outlook for our future business and financial performance, estimated operational metrics, business strategy and plans and objectives of management for future operations, including, among other things, statements regarding expected growth, future capital expenditures, fund performance, dividends and dividend policy, and debt service obligations.\n\nForward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, by their nature, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. As a result, our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by any forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include the inability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of Angelo Gordon; unexpected costs related to the integration of the Angelo Gordon business and operations; our ability to manage growth and execute our business plan; and regional, national or global political, economic, business, competitive, market and regulatory conditions, among various other risks discussed in the Company’s SEC filings.\n\nFor the reasons described above, we caution you against relying on any forward-looking statements, which should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements included elsewhere in this document and risk factors discussed from time to time in the Company’s filings with the SEC, which can be found at the SEC’s website at [http://www.sec.gov](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sec.gov&esheet=54146361&newsitemid=20241103293879&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sec.gov&index=3&md5=77b8921371ced409f520ccfcc7363d1b). Any forward-looking statement in this document speaks only as of the date of this document. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement after the date of this document, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law. No recipient should, therefore, rely on these forward-looking statements as representing the views of the Company or its management as of any date subsequent to the date of the document.\n\nThis document does not constitute an offer of any TPG Fund.\n\n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20241103293879r1&sid=acqr8&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\nView source version on [businesswire.com](http://businesswire.com): [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241103293879/en/](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241103293879/en/)\n\n**Shareholders** Gary Stein 212-601-4750 shareholders@tpg.com\n\n**Media** Luke Barrett 415-743-1550 media@tpg.com\n\nSource: TPG Inc.\n\nRequest Email Alerts\n\n[](#)\n"
