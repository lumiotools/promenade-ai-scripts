(Profound) and its subsidiaries (together, the Company) were incorporated\nunder the Ontario Business Corporations Act on July 16, 2014. The Company is a medical technology\ncompany developing treatments to ablate the prostate gland, uterine fibroids, osteoid osteoma and\nnerves for palliative pain relief for patients with metastatic bone disease.\nThe Company’s registered address is 2400 Skymark Avenue, Unit 6, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada,\nL4W 5K5.\n2 Summary of material accounting policies and basis of preparation\nBasis of preparation\nThe Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with International\nFinancial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IFRS\nAccounting Standards), applicable to the preparation of interim condensed consolidated financial\nstatements, including International Accounting Standards (IAS) 34, Interim Financial Reporting. These\ninterim condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars and should be read\nin conjunction with the Company’s annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023,\nwhich were prepared in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards.\nThese interim condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the\naccounting policies as set out in the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements for the year\nended December 31, 2023. The presentation of these interim condensed consolidated financial\nstatements is consistent with the presentation of the annual consolidated financial statements. The\nBoard of Directors approved these consolidated financial statements on May 9, 2024. These\nconsolidated financial statements comply with IFRS Accounting Standards.\nThe interim condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared on a going concern basis\nunder the historical cost convention. The fair values of cash, trade and other receivables, accounts\npayable and accrued liabilities and lease liabilities approximate their carrying values, due to their\nrelatively short periods to maturity. The fair value of the long-term debt approximates its carrying\namount as it has a floating interest rate.\nAccounting standards adopted during the year\nBeginning on January 1, 2024, the Company adopted certain IFRS Accounting Standards and\namendments:\n Classification of liabilities as current or non-current (Amendments to IAS1)\n Non-current liabilities with covenants (Amendments to IAS1).\nThe adoption of these amendments did not have a material impact on the interim condensed\nconsolidated financial statements.\n(1)\nProfound Medical Corp.\nNotes to Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\nMarch 31, 2024\nIn USD (000s)\n3 Trade and other receivables\nThe trade and other receivables balance comprises the following:\nMarch 31, December 31,\n2024 2023\n$ $\nTrade receivables, gross 6,557 7,145\nLoss allowance (74) (76)\nLess amortized cost adjustment (239) (315)\nTrade receivables, net 6,244 6,754\nTax receivables 66 414\nOther receivables 200 120\nTotal trade and other receivables 6,510 7,288\nThe Company applies the simplified approach to provide for expected credit losses prescribed by IFRS\n9, which permits the use of the lifetime expected loss provision for all trade receivables. Trade\nreceivables past due represents amounts not collected beyond the customer’s contractual terms. At\nMarch 31, 2024 there were $967 of trade receivables that were past due (December 31, 2023 - $648).\nManagement continually reviews the future cash flows used in the calculation of the amortized cost of\nits trade and other receivables. Due to access to customer locations, certain gross trade receivables\ntotalling $3,737 are expected to have a longer repayment term due to the payment term being based\non installation of the device. The Company recognized $69 net interest income for the three months\nended March 31, 2024 ($39 for the three months ended March 31, 2023).\n4 Inventory\nMarch 31, December 31,\n2024 2023\n$ $\nFinished goods 4,781 4,646\nRaw materials 2,210 2,351\nInventory provision (15) (8)\nTotal inventory 6,976 6,989\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2024, $523 (three months ended March 31, 2023 - $476)\nof inventory was recognized in cost of sales. The Company increased its inventory provision by $7\nduring the three months ended March 31, 2024 (three months ended March 31, 2023 – $6).

The lease agreement ends on\nSeptember 30, 2026 with the rights to extend for another 5 years, which is not reasonably certain.\n8 Long-term debt\nOn November 3, 2022, the Company signed a term loan agreement with CIBC Innovation Banking\n(CIBC) to provide a secured loan for total gross proceeds of C$10,000 maturing on November 3, 2027\nwith an interest rate based on prime plus 2% (CIBC Loan). The Company was required to make interest\nonly payments until October 31, 2023 and monthly repayments of C$208 plus accrued interest\ncommenced on October 31, 2023. All obligations of the Company under the CIBC Loan are guaranteed\nby current and future subsidiaries of the Company and include security of first priority interests in the\nassets of the Company and its subsidiaries. Initially, the Company had financial covenants in relation\nto the CIBC loan where unrestricted cash is at all times greater than EBITDA for the most recent six-\nmonth period, reported on a monthly basis and that revenue for any fiscal quarter must be 15% greater\nthan revenue for the same fiscal quarter in the prior fiscal year, reported on a quarterly basis.\nOn September 26, 2023 an amendment to the CIBC Loan resulted in a change to the financial\ncovenants. The amended covenants are that unrestricted cash must at all times be greater of: (i) to\nthe extent EBITDA is negative for such period, EBITDA for the most recent nine-month period or (ii)\n$7,500, reported on a monthly basis; and that recurring revenue for any fiscal quarter must be 15%\ngreater than recurring revenue for the same fiscal quarter in the prior fiscal year, reported on a quarterly\nbasis. The Company is compliant with the first covenant whereby unrestricted cash is at all times\ngreater than EBITDA for the most recent nine-month period ended March 31, 2024. However, the\nCompany is in breach with the second covenant whereby recurring revenue for any fiscal quarter must\nbe 15% greater than recurring revenue for the same fiscal quarter in the prior fiscal year as at March\n31, 2024. The loan is classified as current since CIBC has the right to demand the repayment of the\nloan. If CIBC demands repayment of the loan, the Company has sufficient cash to cover the repayment\nof the loan and would have $34,517 cash remaining.\n(4)\nProfound Medical Corp.\nNotes to Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\nMarch 31, 2024\nIn USD (000s)\nOn May 3, 2024, the Company received a waiver from CIBC and an amendment to the CIBC Loan\nwhich resulted in an amendment to the financial covenants. The amended covenants are that the\nrecurring revenue covenant shall not be tested for any fiscal quarter in the 2024 fiscal year so long as\nunrestricted cash is no less than 2.5 multiplied by the principal amount of outstanding CIBC Loan at\nall times.\nMarch 31, December 31,\n2024 2023\n$ $\nBalance  Beginning of period 7,104 7,174\nInterest and accretion expense 169 727\nForeign exchange (168) 115\nRepayment (623) (912)\nBalance  End of period 6,482 7,104\nLess: Current portion 6,482 2,104\nLong-term portion - 5,000\n9 Lease liabilities\nMarch 31, December 31,\n2024 2023\n$ $\nBalance – Beginning of Period 837 1,056\nRepayments (73) (292)\nForeign exchange (18) 30\nInterest and accretion expense 8 43\nBalance – End of Period 754 837\nLess: Current portion 253 259\nLong-term portion 501 578\n10 Share capital\nCommon shares\nThe Company is authorized to issue an unlimited number of common shares.\nIssued and outstanding (with no par value)\nMarch 31, December 31,\n2024 2023\n$ $\n24,428,899 (December 31, 2023 – 21,370,565) common\nshares 232,763 217,393\n(5)\nProfound Medical Corp.\nNotes to Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\nMarch 31, 2024\nIn USD (000s)\nOn January 2, 2024, the Company closed a public offering, resulting in the issuance of 2,666,667\ncommon shares at a price of $7.50, for gross proceeds of $20,000 ($18,238, net of transaction costs).\nOn January 16, 2024, the Company closed a non-brokered private placement, resulting in the issuance\nof 391,667 common shares at a price of $7.50, for gross proceeds of $2,938 ($2,841, net of transaction\ncosts).\nOn September 6, 2023, the Company entered into an at-the-market equity program (ATM Program),\nunder which the Company may from time to time in its sole discretion, issue and sell through its\nsecurities dealers acting as agents up to $30,000 of common shares.

The Company is exposed to credit risk on its cash and trade and\nother receivable balances. The Company’s cash management policies include ensuring cash is\ndeposited in Canadian chartered banks.\nThe Company applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses, which uses\na lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables. To measure the expected credit losses,\ntrade receivables are grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due.\nAt March 31, 2024, the expected loss rates are based on comparable company payment profiles of\nsales over a period of 36 months before March 31, 2024 and the corresponding historical credit losses\nexperienced within this period. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current information on\nmacroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables.\nThe loss allowance as at March 31, 2024 for trade receivables is as follows:\n2024\n0–30 31-60 61-90 90+\nCurrent days days days days Total\nExpected loss rate 0.84% 1.42% 1.35% 2.46% 3.62%\nGross carrying amount 5,590 265 89 - 613 6,557\nLoss allowance 47 4 1 - 22 74\nForeign currency risk\nForeign currency risk occurs as a result of foreign exchange rate fluctuations between the time a\ntransaction is recorded and the time it is settled.\nThe Company purchases goods and services denominated in foreign currencies and, accordingly, is\nsubject to foreign currency risk. The Company’s financial instruments denominated in foreign\ncurrencies are shown below in US dollars.\nMarch 31, 2024\nUS Canadian Chinese\ndollars Euro dollars renminbi Total\n$ $ $ $ $\nCash 38,002 606 2,391 181 41,180\nTrade and other receivables 4,364 1,880 266 - 6,510\nAccounts payable and\naccrued liabilities (622) (400) (1,836) (17) (2,875)\nLease liabilities - - (754) - (754)\nLong-term debt - - (6,482) - (6,482)\n(9)\nProfound Medical Corp.\nNotes to Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\nMarch 31, 2024\nIn USD (000s)\nAs at March 31, 2024, if foreign exchange rates had been 5% higher, with all other variables held\nconstant, loss and comprehensive loss would have been $208 higher, mainly as a result of the\ntranslation of foreign currency denominated cash, trade and other receivables, accounts payable and\naccrued liabilities, lease liabilities and long-term debt. The Company does not use derivatives to\nreduce exposure to foreign currency risk.\nLiquidity risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk the Company may encounter difficulties in meeting its financial liability\nobligations as they come due. The Company has a planning and budgeting process in place to help\ndetermine the funds required to support the Company’s normal operating requirements on an ongoing\nbasis.\nThe Company controls liquidity risk through management of working capital, cash flows and the\navailability and sourcing of financing. The Company’s ability to accomplish all of its future strategic\nplans is dependent on obtaining additional financing or executing other strategic options; however,\nthere is no assurance the Company will achieve these objectives.\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s significant contractual, undiscounted cash flows\nrelated to its financial liabilities following the receipt of a waiver in relation to the covenant breach on\nthe CIBC loan.\n2024\nFuture Between\nCarrying cash Less than 1 year and\namount flows 1 year 5 years\n$ $ $ $\nAccounts payable and accrued\nliabilities 2,875 2,875 2,875 -\nLease liabilities 754 810 291 519\nLong-term debt 6,482 7,874 2,565 5,309\n10,111 11,559 5,731 5,828\n15 Loss per share\nThe following table shows the calculation of basic and diluted loss per share:\nThree months Three months\nended ended\nMarch 31, March 31,\n2024 2023\nNet loss for the period $6,199 $6,741\nWeighted average number of common shares 24,295,749 20,922,209\nBasic and diluted loss per share $0.26 $0.32\n(10)\nProfound Medical Corp.\nNotes to Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\nMarch 31, 2024\nIn USD (000s)\nThe computation of diluted loss per share is equal to the basic loss per share due to the anti-dilutive\neffect of the share options, RSUs and DSUs.

(Profound) and its subsidiaries (together, the Company) were incorporated\nunder the Ontario Business Corporations Act on July 16, 2014. The Company is a medical technology\ncompany developing treatments to ablate the prostate gland, uterine fibroids, osteoid osteoma and\nnerves for palliative pain relief for patients with metastatic bone disease.\nThe Company’s registered address is 2400 Skymark Avenue, Unit 6, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada,\nL4W 5K5.\n2 Summary of material accounting policies and basis of preparation\nBasis of preparation\nThe Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with International\nFinancial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IFRS\nAccounting Standards), applicable to the preparation of interim condensed consolidated financial\nstatements, including International Accounting Standards (IAS) 34, Interim Financial Reporting. These\ninterim condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars and should be read\nin conjunction with the Company’s annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023,\nwhich were prepared in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards.\nThese interim condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the\naccounting policies as set out in the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements for the year\nended December 31, 2023. The presentation of these interim condensed consolidated financial\nstatements is consistent with the presentation of the annual consolidated financial statements. The\nBoard of Directors approved these consolidated financial statements on August 8, 2024. These\nconsolidated financial statements comply with IFRS Accounting Standards.\nThe interim condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared on a going concern basis\nunder the historical cost convention. The fair values of cash, trade and other receivables, accounts\npayable and accrued liabilities and lease liability approximate their carrying values, due to their\nrelatively short periods to maturity. The fair value of the long-term debt approximates its carrying\namount as it has a floating interest rate.\nAccounting standards adopted during the year\nBeginning on January 1, 2024, the Company adopted certain IFRS Accounting Standards and\namendments:\n Classification of liabilities as current or non-current (Amendments to IAS1)\n Non-current liabilities with covenants (Amendments to IAS1).\nThe adoption of these amendments did not have a material impact on the interim condensed\nconsolidated financial statements.\n(1)\nProfound Medical Corp.\nNotes to Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\nJune 30, 2024\nIn USD (000s)\nAccounting pronouncements issued but not yet effective\nThe IASB has issued classification, measurement and disclosure amendments to IFRS 9, Financial\nInstruments and IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures with an effective date for annual reporting\nperiods beginning on or after January 1, 2026. The amendments clarify the date of recognition and\nderecognition of some financial assets and liabilities and introduce a new exception for some financial\nliabilities settled through an electronic payment system. Other changes include a clarification of the\nrequirements when assessing whether a financial asset meets the solely payments of principal and\ninterest criteria and new disclosures for certain instruments with contractual terms that can change\ncash flows (including instruments where cash flows changes are linked to environment, social or\ngovernance targets).\nIFRS 18, Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements (IFRS 18) is a new standard that will\nprovide new presentation and disclosure requirements and which will replace IAS 1, Presentation of\nFinancial Statements (IAS 1). IFRS 18 introduces changes to the structure of the income statement;\nprovides required disclosures in financial statements for certain profit or loss performance measures\nthat are reported outside an entity’s financial statements; and provides enhanced principles on\naggregation and disaggregation in financial statements. Many other existing principles in IAS 1 have\nbeen maintained. IFRS 18 is effective for years beginning on or after January 1, 2027.\nThe adoption of these pronouncements are currently being assessed.\n3 Trade and other receivables\nThe trade and other receivables balance comprises the following:\nJune 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\n$ $\nTrade receivables, gross 6,961 7,145\nLoss allowance (75) (76)\nLess amortized cost adjustment (138) (315)\nTrade receivables, net 6,748 6,754\nTax receivables 210 414\nOther receivables 204 120\nTotal trade and other receivables 7,162 7,288\nThe Company applies the simplified approach to provide for expected credit losses prescribed by IFRS\n9, which permits the use of the lifetime expected loss provision for all trade receivables. Trade\nreceivables past due represents amounts not collected beyond the customer’s contractual terms. At\nJune 30, 2024 there were $746 of trade receivables that were past due (December 31, 2023 - $648).\nManagement continually reviews the future cash flows used in the calculation of the amortized cost of\nits trade and other receivables. Due to access to customer locations, certain gross trade receivables\ntotalling $3,425 are expected to have a longer repayment term due to the payment term being based\non installation of the device. The Company recognized $99 and $168 of interest income for the three\n(2)\nProfound Medical Corp.\nNotes to Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\nJune 30, 2024\nIn USD (000s)\nand six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, $40 and $79 of interest income for the three and\nsix months ended June 30, 2023).\n4 Inventory\nJune 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\n$ $\nFinished goods 4,398 4,646\nRaw materials 2,356 2,351\nInventory provision (22) (8)\nTotal inventory 6,732 6,989\nDuring the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, $751 and $1,274, respectively (three and six\nmonths ended June 30, 2023, $507 and $983) of inventory was recognized in cost of sales.

The lease agreement ends on\nSeptember 30, 2026 with the rights to extend for another 5 years, which is not reasonably certain.\n8 Long-term debt\nOn November 3, 2022, the Company signed a term loan agreement with CIBC Innovation Banking\n(CIBC) to provide a secured loan for total gross proceeds of C$10,000 maturing on November 3, 2027\nwith an interest rate based on prime plus 2% (CIBC Loan). The Company was required to make interest\n(4)\nProfound Medical Corp.\nNotes to Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\nJune 30, 2024\nIn USD (000s)\nonly payments until October 31, 2023 and monthly repayments of C$208 plus accrued interest\ncommenced on October 31, 2023. All obligations of the Company under the CIBC Loan are guaranteed\nby current and future subsidiaries of the Company and include security of first priority interests in the\nassets of the Company and its subsidiaries. Initially, the Company had financial covenants in relation\nto the CIBC loan where unrestricted cash is at all times greater than EBITDA for the most recent six-\nmonth period, reported on a monthly basis and that revenue for any fiscal quarter must be 15% greater\nthan revenue for the same fiscal quarter in the prior fiscal year, reported on a quarterly basis.\nOn September 26, 2023 an amendment to the CIBC Loan resulted in a change to the financial\ncovenants. The amended covenants are that unrestricted cash must at all times be greater of: (i) to\nthe extent EBITDA is negative for such period, EBITDA for the most recent nine-month period or (ii)\n$7,500, reported on a monthly basis; and that recurring revenue for any fiscal quarter must be 15%\ngreater than recurring revenue for the same fiscal quarter in the prior fiscal year, reported on a quarterly\nbasis.

The Company is exposed to credit risk on its cash and trade and\nother receivable balances. The Company’s cash management policies include ensuring cash is\ndeposited in Canadian chartered banks.\nThe Company applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses, which uses\na lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables. To measure the expected credit losses,\ntrade receivables are grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due.\nAt June 30, 2024, the expected loss rates are based on comparable company payment profiles of\nsales over a period of 36 months before June 30, 2024 and the corresponding historical credit losses\nexperienced within this period. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current information on\nmacroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables.\nThe loss allowance as at June 30, 2024 for trade receivables is as follows:\n2024\n0–30 31-60 61-90 90+\nCurrent days days days days Total\nExpected loss rate 0.84% 1.42% 1.35% 2.46% 3.62%\nGross carrying amount 6,214 132 42 - 573 6,961\nLoss allowance 52 2 1 - 20 75\nForeign currency risk\nForeign currency risk occurs as a result of foreign exchange rate fluctuations between the time a\ntransaction is recorded and the time it is settled.\n(9)\nProfound Medical Corp.\nNotes to Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\nJune 30, 2024\nIn USD (000s)\nThe Company purchases goods and services denominated in foreign currencies and, accordingly, is\nsubject to foreign currency risk.

The Company does not use derivatives to reduce\nexposure to foreign currency risk.\nLiquidity risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk the Company may encounter difficulties in meeting its financial liability\nobligations as they come due. The Company has a planning and budgeting process in place to help\ndetermine the funds required to support the Company’s normal operating requirements on an ongoing\nbasis.\nThe Company controls liquidity risk through management of working capital, cash flows and the\navailability and sourcing of financing. The Company’s ability to accomplish all of its future strategic\nplans is dependent on obtaining additional financing or executing other strategic options by the second\nhalf of the year ending December 31, 2025; however, there is no assurance the Company will achieve\nthese objectives.\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s significant contractual, undiscounted cash flows\nrelated to its financial liabilities.\nJune 30,\n2024\nFuture Between\nCarrying cash Less than 1 year and\namount flows 1 year 5 years\n$ $ $ $\nAccounts payable and accrued\nliabilities 2,671 2,671 2,671 -\nLease liability 685 730 288 442\nLong-term debt 5,967 7,166 2,480 4,686\n9,323 10,567 5,439 5,128\n(10)\nProfound Medical Corp.\nNotes to Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\nJune 30, 2024\nIn USD (000s)\n15 Loss per share\nThe following table shows the calculation of basic and diluted loss per share:\nThree Three\nmonths months Six months Six months\nended ended ended ended\nJune 30, June 30, June 30, June 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet loss for the period $6,919 $7,355 $13,118 $14,096\nWeighted average number of\ncommon shares 24,440,444 21,165,107 24,373,869 21,044,330\nBasic and diluted loss per share $0.28 $0.35 $0.54 $0.67\nThe computation of diluted loss per share is equal to the basic loss per share due to the anti-dilutive\neffect of the share options, RSUs and DSUs.

(Profound) and its subsidiaries (together, the Company) were incorporated\nunder the Ontario Business Corporations Act on July 16, 2014. The Company is a medical technology\ncompany developing treatments to ablate the prostate gland, uterine fibroids, osteoid osteoma and\nnerves for palliative pain relief for patients with metastatic bone disease.\nThe Company’s registered address is 2400 Skymark Avenue, Unit 6, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada,\nL4W 5K5.\n2 Summary of material accounting policies, basis of preparation and going concern\nBasis of preparation\nThe Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with International\nFinancial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IFRS\nAccounting Standards), applicable to the preparation of interim condensed consolidated financial\nstatements, including International Accounting Standards (IAS) 34, Interim Financial Reporting. These\ninterim condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars and should be read\nin conjunction with the Company’s annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023,\nwhich were prepared in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards.\nThese interim condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the\naccounting policies as set out in the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements for the year\nended December 31, 2023. The presentation of these interim condensed consolidated financial\nstatements is consistent with the presentation of the annual consolidated financial statements. The\nBoard of Directors approved these consolidated financial statements on November 7, 2024. These\nconsolidated financial statements comply with IFRS Accounting Standards.\nThe interim condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared on a going concern basis\nunder the historical cost convention. The fair values of cash, trade and other receivables, accounts\npayable and accrued liabilities and lease liability approximate their carrying values, due to their\nrelatively short periods to maturity. The fair value of the long-term debt approximates its carrying\namount as it has a floating interest rate.\nGoing concern\nThe Company is subject to a number of risks, including the successful development and marketing of\nits products and the ability to raise additional financing to support these activities. The Company\ndepends on various financing from investors or other sources of capital to fund its operations, achieve\nits business plan and the realization of its assets and liabilities in the normal course of operations.\nManagement believes that current cash balances as of September 30, 2024 will not be sufficient to\nfinance all of its planned business operations over the next year. The Company intends to seek\nadditional financing from investors or other sources of capital in order to fund its operations and\nactivities over the next year. There can be no assurance that the steps management are taking will be\nsuccessful. Considering the need for additional financing, there exists a material uncertainty that may\n(1)\nProfound Medical Corp.\nNotes to Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\nSeptember 30, 2024\nIn USD (000s)\nraise significant doubt (or raise substantial doubt as contemplated by PCAOB standards) about the\nCompany’s ability to continue as a going concern.\nThese interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern\nbasis, which asserts the Company has the ability in the near term to continue to realize its assets and\ndischarge its liabilities and commitments in a planned manner giving consideration to the above and\nexpected possible outcomes. Conversely, if the going concern assumption is not appropriate,\nadjustments to the carrying amounts of the Company's assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and\nbalance sheet classifications may be necessary, and these adjustments could be material.\nAccounting standards adopted during the year\nBeginning on January 1, 2024, the Company adopted certain IFRS Accounting Standards and\namendments:\n Classification of liabilities as current or non-current (Amendments to IAS1)\n Non-current liabilities with covenants (Amendments to IAS1).\nThe adoption of these amendments did not have a material impact on the interim condensed\nconsolidated financial statements.\nAccounting pronouncements issued but not yet effective\nThe IASB has issued classification, measurement and disclosure amendments to IFRS 9, Financial\nInstruments and IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures with an effective date for annual reporting\nperiods beginning on or after January 1, 2026. The amendments clarify the date of recognition and\nderecognition of some financial assets and liabilities and introduce a new exception for some financial\nliabilities settled through an electronic payment system. Other changes include a clarification of the\nrequirements when assessing whether a financial asset meets the solely payments of principal and\ninterest criteria and new disclosures for certain instruments with contractual terms that can change\ncash flows (including instruments where cash flows changes are linked to environment, social or\ngovernance targets).\nIFRS 18, Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements (IFRS 18) is a new standard that will\nprovide new presentation and disclosure requirements and which will replace IAS 1, Presentation of\nFinancial Statements (IAS 1). IFRS 18 introduces changes to the structure of the income statement;\nprovides required disclosures in financial statements for certain profit or loss performance measures\nthat are reported outside an entity’s financial statements; and provides enhanced principles on\naggregation and disaggregation in financial statements. Many other existing principles in IAS 1 have\nbeen maintained. IFRS 18 is effective for years beginning on or after January 1, 2027.\nDuring July 2024, the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) issued an agenda decision related to\nsegment reporting. Items are required to be disclosed if the amounts are either regularly provided to\nthe chief operating decision maker or are included in arriving at the segment measure of profit or loss\nthat is reviewed by the chief operating decision maker. The adoption of these pronouncements are\ncurrently being assessed.\n(2)\nProfound Medical Corp.\nNotes to Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\nSeptember 30, 2024\nIn USD (000s)\n3 Trade and other receivables\nThe trade and other receivables balance comprises the following:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\n$ $\nTrade receivables, gross 7,698 7,145\nLoss allowance (683) (76)\nLess amortized cost adjustment (70) (315)\nTrade receivables, net 6,945 6,754\nTax receivables 51 414\nOther receivables 34 120\nTotal trade and other receivables 7,030 7,288\nManagement periodically reviews the future cash flows used in the calculation of the amortized cost\nof its trade and other receivables. Due to limited access to customer locations, certain gross trade\nreceivables totalling $3,035 are expected to have a longer repayment term due to the payment term\nbeing based on installation of the device. The Company recognized $70 and $238 of interest income\nfor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, $40 and $119 of interest\nincome for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023).\nThe Company applies the simplified approach to provide for expected credit losses prescribed by IFRS\n9, which permits the use of the lifetime expected loss provision for all trade receivables. Trade\nreceivables past due represents amounts not collected beyond the customer’s contractual terms. At\nSeptember 30, 2024 there were $639 of trade receivables that were past due (December 31, 2023 -\n$648).\nAt September 30, 2024, the expected loss rates are based on comparable company payment profiles\nof sales over a period of 36 months before September 30, 2024 and the corresponding historical credit\nlosses experienced within this period. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current\ninformation on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables.\nThe loss allowance as at September 30, 2024 for trade receivables is as follows:\n2024\n0–30 31-60 61-90 90+\nCurrent days days days days Total\nExpected loss rate 1.55% 1.74% 1.93% 2.46% 3.62%\nGross carrying amount 4,0241 127 - - 512 4,663\nLoss allowance 62 2 - - 19 83\n1 Due to limited access to customer locations, certain gross trade receivables not included in the table above totalling $3,035\nare expected to have a longer repayment term due to the payment term being based on installation of the device and therefore\ncollection of the amount is outside the control of the Company. The Company applied a 20% expected loss rate to these gross\ntrade receivables resulting in a $600 increase in the loss allowance for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n(3)\nProfound Medical Corp.\nNotes to Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\nSeptember 30, 2024\nIn USD (000s)\n4 Inventory\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\n$ $\nFinished goods 3,997 4,646\nRaw materials 2,459 2,351\nInventory provision (21) (8)\nTotal inventory 6,435 6,989\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, $1,005 and $2,279, respectively (three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2023, $496 and $1,479) of inventory was recognized in cost\nof sales.

The Company was required to make interest\n(5)\nProfound Medical Corp.\nNotes to Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\nSeptember 30, 2024\nIn USD (000s)\nonly payments until October 31, 2023 and monthly repayments of C$208 plus accrued interest\ncommenced on October 31, 2023. All obligations of the Company under the CIBC Loan are guaranteed\nby current and future subsidiaries of the Company and include security of first priority interests in the\nassets of the Company and its subsidiaries. Initially, the Company had financial covenants in relation\nto the CIBC loan where unrestricted cash is at all times greater than EBITDA for the most recent six-\nmonth period, reported on a monthly basis and that revenue for any fiscal quarter must be 15% greater\nthan revenue for the same fiscal quarter in the prior fiscal year, reported on a quarterly basis.\nOn September 26, 2023 an amendment to the CIBC Loan resulted in a change to the financial\ncovenants. The amended covenants are that unrestricted cash must at all times be greater of: (i) to\nthe extent EBITDA is negative for such period, EBITDA for the most recent nine-month period or (ii)\n$7,500, reported on a monthly basis; and that recurring revenue for any fiscal quarter must be 15%\ngreater than recurring revenue for the same fiscal quarter in the prior fiscal year, reported on a quarterly\nbasis.\nOn May 3, 2024, a second amendment to the CIBC Loan resulted in another change to the financial\ncovenants. The amended covenants are that the recurring revenue covenant shall not be tested for\nany fiscal quarter in the 2024 fiscal year so long as unrestricted cash is no less than 2.5 multiplied by\nthe principal amount of outstanding CIBC Loan at all times. The Company is in compliance with these\nfinancial covenants as at September 30, 2024. Based on the Company’s future cash flow forecasts, if\nadditional financing or other sources of capital is not raised by the end of the second half of 2025, the\nCompany may have difficulty complying with the unrestricted cash covenant.\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\n$ $\nBalance  Beginning of period 7,104 7,174\nInterest and accretion expense 467 727\nForeign exchange (154) 115\nRepayment (1,819) (912)\nBalance  End of period 5,598 7,104\nLess: Current portion 2,200 2,104\nLong-term portion 3,398 5,000\n9 Lease liability\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\n$ $\nBalance – Beginning of Period 837 1,056\nRepayments (218) (292)\nForeign exchange (11) 30\nInterest and accretion expense 22 43\nBalance – End of Period 630 837\nLess: Current portion 265 259\nLong-term portion 365 578\n(6)\nProfound Medical Corp.\nNotes to Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\nSeptember 30, 2024\nIn USD (000s)\n10 Share capital\nCommon shares\nThe Company is authorized to issue an unlimited number of common shares.\nIssued and outstanding (with no par value)\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\n$ $\n24,661,771 (December 31, 2023 – 21,370,565) common\nshares 235,674 217,393\nOn January 2, 2024, the Company closed a public offering, resulting in the issuance of 2,666,667\ncommon shares at a price of $7.50, for gross proceeds of $20,000 ($18,238, net of transaction costs).\nOn January 16, 2024, the Company closed a non-brokered private placement, resulting in the issuance\nof 391,667 common shares at a price of $7.50, for gross proceeds of $2,938 ($2,841, net of transaction\ncosts).\n11 Share-based payments\nShare options\nCompensation expense related to share options for the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2024 was $96 and $394, respectively (three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $264\nand $972).

Readers are cautioned that while Profound believes it has accurately summarized all\nclinical studies cited in this MD&A, readers should review the full publications of the studies prior to making an investment decision in the\nCompany.\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW\nProfound (NASDAQ: PROF; TSX: PRN) is a commercial-stage medical device company focused on the development and marketing of\ncustomizable, incision-free therapeutic systems for the image guided ablation of diseased tissue utilizing its platform technologies and\nleveraging the healthcare system’s existing imaging infrastructure. Profound’s lead product (the “TULSA-PRO® system”) combines real-\ntime MRI, robotically driven transurethral sweeping-action thermal ultrasound with closed-loop temperature feedback control for the\nablation of prostate tissue. The product is comprised of one-time-use devices and durable equipment that are used in conjunction with a\ncustomer’s existing MRI scanner.\nIn August 2019, the TULSA-PRO® system received FDA clearance as a Class II device in the United States of America (“United States”\nor “US”) for thermal ablation of prescribed prostate tissue, using transurethral ultrasound ablation (“TULSA®”) based on the Company\nsponsored (“TACT”) whole gland ablation pivotal clinical study. It is also CE marked in the European Union (“EU”) for ablation of targeted\nprostate tissue (benign or malignant). The TULSA-PRO® system was approved by Health Canada in November 2019.\nProfound believes that, based on the Company’s TACT clinical data and additional studies conducted in the EU, physicians may elect to\nuse TULSA-PRO® to ablate benign or malignant prostate tissue in patients with a variety of prostate diseases. Prostate diseases include\nprostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia (“BPH”). Prostate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer affecting men.\nThe annual incidence of newly diagnosed cases in 2023 is estimated to reach 288,300 in the United States according to the American\nCancer Society and in 2020 there were approximately 475,000 newly diagnosed cases of prostate cancer in Europe, according to the\nInternational Agency for Research on Cancer. The American Cancer Society further estimates that there are approximately 5.8 million\nmen living with prostate cancer in these two geographic regions. Although ten-year survival outcomes for prostate cancer remain\nfavorable, it is still one of most common causes of cancer deaths among men. BPH is a histologic diagnosis that refers to the proliferation\nof smooth muscle and epithelial cells within the prostatic transition zone. According to the American Urological Association, BPH is nearly\nubiquitous in the aging male population with worldwide autopsy proven histological prevalence increases starting at ages 40 to 45 years,\nreaching 60% at age 60 and 80% at age 80.\nProfound initiated the commercial launch of its lead product, the TULSA-PRO® system in the United States in Q4 2019, treating the first\npatient in a non-trial setting in January 2020. On June 2, 2023, Profound Medical announced new CPT Category 1 Codes from the\nAmerican Medical Association (“AMA”) for TULSA to treat prostate diseases, which will be effective January 1, 2025. In addition, Profound\ncontinues to support additional clinical trials in the United States and abroad to further increase the body of clinical evidence that may be\nneeded particularly for reimbursement and coverage of its technologies by private and government healthcare providers. The Company\ncontinues to expand the compatibility of its TULSA-PRO® system with additional MRI brands to broaden its ability to utilize the global MRI\ninstalled base and seek regulatory approvals of its products in additional international jurisdictions.\nPage 2\nProfound Medical Corp.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023\nIn USD$ (000s)\nProfound’s second product, the Sonalleve® system, is CE marked in the EU for the treatment of uterine fibroids and adenomyotic tissue,\npalliative pain relief associated with bone metastases, treatment of osteoid osteoma, and management of benign desmoid tumors and\nhas also been approved by the regulatory bodies in China and South Korea for non-invasive treatment of uterine fibroids. In late 2020,\nSonalleve® received Humanitarian Device Exemption (“HDE”) approval from the FDA for the treatment of Osteoid Osteoma in the United\nStates. The Sonalleve® system is only compatible with certain Philips MRIs.\nProfound deploys a recurring revenue business model in the United States to market TULSA-PRO®, charging a one-time payment that\nincludes a supply of its one-time-use devices, use of the system, as well as the Company’s customer and technological support (“Genius”)\nservices that support each TULSA center. The Sonalleve® product is marketed primarily outside North America in European and Asian\ncountries, deploying a capital sales model. Outside of North America, Profound generates most of its revenues from its system sales in\nEurope and Asia, where the Company deploys a more traditional hybrid business model, charging for the system separately as a capital\nsale and an additional per patient charge for the one-time-use devices and associated Genius services.\nProfound’s Technology\nTULSA-PRO® and Sonalleve® share the common technological concept of using MRI to enable visualization by the surgeon of desired\ntissue in real time. Both products also use thermal ultrasound technology to gently heat and ablate tissue using the real-time thermometry\ncapability of the MRI.\nTULSA-PRO® delivers its ultrasound energy through a transurethral catheter, a one-time-use device that is placed in the patient’s prostate\nthrough a natural orifice. Focused ultrasound energy is then delivered by the catheter in the shape of a blade. Externally the catheter is\nconnected to a software controlled robotic manipulator that rotates up to 360-degree in a sweeping action to impart thermal energy and\nthus ablation of tissue. The real time temperature measurement of the prostate is coupled with closed loop process control that measures\nthe appropriate amount of ultrasound energy to gently heat the physician-prescribed region of prostate tissue to the target temperature\nto achieve cell kill without boiling or charring the tissue. As a measure to keep the urethra within the prostate viable, the temperature of\nthe transurethral catheter is maintained at an appropriate level by circulating water inside the catheter. Similarly, a water-cooled specially\ndesigned catheter is placed in the patient’s rectum during the ablation process to keep it protected from thermal damage during the\nprocedure. The TULSA-PRO in conjunction with its Thermal Boost module, enables surgeons to temporarily increase the ablation target\ntemperature in prostate regions where advanced stage cancer might reside, further increasing their confidence that aggressive cancer\ncells have been ablated. Profound believes that TULSA-PRO®’s controlled and relatively gentle heating process may result in lower post\nprocedural pain and complications, reduced potential of life affecting side effects, and in significantly desirable shrinkage of the prostate\nvia resorption of the dead tissue over time, which may provide a longer-term durable benefit.\nSonalleve® delivers its ultrasound energy via a disc located outside the patient. Its ultrasound energy is focused to create small cylindrical\nhot spots a certain distance into the patient. Overlapping cylinders create ablation of the physician-prescribed desired tissue. Similar to\nTULSA-PRO, Sonalleve® also provides for controlled temperature increases to achieve cell kill.\nThe physician is in charge of using the Profound devices and decides which tissue needs to be ablated to impart therapeutic effect.\nProfound believes that in the hands of trained physicians, its systems have the ability to provide customizable, incision-free ablative\ntherapies with the precision of real-time MRI visualization and thermometry, focused ultrasound and closed-loop temperature feedback\ncontrol. Profound believes that its technology offers clinicians and appropriate patients a better alternative to traditional surgical or\nradiation therapies, with respect to clinical outcomes, side effects and recovery time.\nTULSA-PRO®\nThe TULSA-PRO® system is designed to provide precise, flexible and durable ablation of a surgeon defined region of the prostate while\nactively protecting the urethra and rectum to help preserve the patient’s natural functional abilities. To date, over 3,000 global TULSA-\nPRO® procedures have been performed by more than 100 physicians at over 30 commercial and 20 clinical research sites.\nClinical Studies\nIn March 2014, Profound completed enrollment and treatment of 30 patients in the Phase I TULSA multi-jurisdictional safety and precision\nstudy. Based on the Phase I clinical trial results, in April 2016, Profound received a CE Certificate of Conformity for the TULSA-PRO®\nsystem from its notified body in the EU, and in the fourth quarter of 2016, Profound initiated a pilot commercial launch of TULSA-PRO®\nin key European markets where the CE mark is accepted.\nProfound received FDA clearance for the TULSA-PRO® system in August 2019 for transurethral ultrasound ablation of prostate tissue,\nbased on the Company’s TACT Pivotal Clinical Trial. The TACT Pivotal Clinical Trial is a prospective, open-label, single-arm pivotal\nPage 3\nProfound Medical Corp.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023\nIn USD$ (000s)\nclinical study, of 115 treatment-naïve localized prostate cancer patients across 13 research sites in the United States, Canada and\nEurope, which enrolled patients between August 2016 and February 2018.\nLocalized Prostate Cancer, Ablation Safety and Efficacy: TACT Pivotal Study\nThe TACT Pivotal Clinical Trial demonstrates that MRI-guided TULSA is a minimally invasive procedure for effective prostate cancer\nablation with a favorable side effect profile, minimal impact on quality of life and low rates of residual disease1. In the large, multi-center\nprospective study in men with predominately intermediate-risk prostate cancer, whole gland ablation sparing the urethra and apical\nsphincter with the TULSA-PRO® met its primary regulatory endpoint of prostate-specific antigen (“PSA”) reduction in 96% of men to a\nmedian nadir of 0.34 ng/ml and 0.5 ng/ml at 12 months. Median decrease in perfused prostate volume as assessed by a central radiologist\nusing 12-month MRI was 91%, from a median 37 cc to 2.8 cc. At 12 months, extensive biopsy sampling of the markedly reduced prostate\nvolume demonstrated a benefit for nearly 80% of men. There was no evidence of cancer in 65% of men and 14% had low-volume\nclinically-insignificant disease. The authors, however, noted that thermally-fixed non-viable cells can retain their apparently-malignant\ntissue morphology, confounding Gleason grading and potentially introducing false positives2. By two and five years, 7% and 21%,\nrespectively, of men sought additional treatment for their prostate cancer (prostatectomy, radiation). The study patient population, with\ntwo-thirds of those with Gleason Grade Group (GGG) ≥ 2 having either bilateral disease or at least five positive cores, allowed for\nevaluation of oncologically relevant secondary outcomes including PSA stability, post-treatment biopsy, and salvage treatment.\nNotwithstanding the limitations of comparisons between ablative and extirpative therapies, the 21% 5-year rate of salvage treatment and\n20% rate of residual clinically significant prostate cancer in intermediate-risk patients are in line with accepted rates of early failure or\nadditional intervention after standard treatments and goals for retreatment after ablative therapies. By five years, the median PSA nadir\nfurther reduced to 0.26 ng/ml. PSA reduction was durable over the extended follow-up period, from 0.53 ng/ml at one year to 0.63 ng/ml\nat five years.\nTULSA was associated with a high degree of safety and maintenance of quality-of-life, durable to five years, comparing favorably to\nradical prostatectomy and other whole-gland ablation techniques. At 12 months, 96% of men returned to baseline urinary continence,\nand 75% of potent men maintained or returned to erections sufficient for penetration, with these rates remaining stable or further improving\nto five years. A total of 12 grade 3 adverse events occurred in 8% of men, including genitourinary infection (4%), urethral stricture (2%),\nurinary retention (1.7%), urethral calculus and pain (1%), and urinoma (1%), all resolved by 12 months. There were no grade 4 events,\nrectal injuries, severe incontinence requiring surgical intervention, or severe erectile dysfunction unresponsive to medication.\nLocalized Prostate Cancer, Durability of Outcomes: Phase I Safety and Precision Study\nThe Phase I Clinical Trial demonstrates that MRI-guided TULSA is safe and precise for ablation in patients with localized prostate cancer,\nproviding spatial ablation precision of ± 1.3 mm with a well-tolerated side-effect profile and minor or no impact on urinary, erectile and\nbowel function at 12 months3. There were no grade 4 or higher adverse events, one transient attributable grade 3 event (epididymitis),\nand notably no injury to rectal or periprostatic structures. Functional outcomes, International Prostate Symptom Score (“IPSS”) and IIEF-\n15, both showed a favorable anticipated trend of initial deterioration with subsequent gradual improvement toward baseline levels.\nConsistent with the conservative whole-gland treatment plan which included a 3 mm circumferential margin expected to spare 10% viable\nprostate at the gland periphery, intra-operative MRI thermometry measured 90% thermal ablation of the prostate gland, median PSA\ndecreased 90% from 5.8 ng/ml to nadir of 0.6 ng/ml, and median prostate volume reduced by 88% on 1-year MRI. Prostate biopsy at one\nyear identified decreased cancer burden with 61% reduction in cancer length; however, attributable to the circumferential safety margin,\nclinically significant cancer in 9 of 29 men (31%), and any cancer in 16 of 29 (55%).\nFollow-up data to three and five years demonstrate durability of the outcomes, with continued treatment safety and stable quality of life,\nas well as predictable PSA and biopsy oncological outcomes based on treatment-day imaging and early PSA follow-up, without precluding\nany potential salvage therapy options4. Repeat prostate biopsy at three years demonstrated durable histological outcomes, with only one\nsubject upgrading to GGG 1 from negative at 12 months, and one subject upgrading to GGG 2 from GGG 1 at 12 months. Between one\nand five years, there were no new serious adverse events. By five years, 16 men completed protocol follow-up, three withdrew with PSA\n<0.4 ng/ml, 10 had salvage therapy without complications (six prostatectomy, three radiation and one laser ablation), and one died of an\n1 Klotz et al, “MRI-guided transurethral ultrasound ablation of prostate cancer,” The Journal of Urology, 2020\n2 Anttinen et al, “Histopathological evaluation of prostate specimens after thermal ablation may be confounded by the presence of thermally-fixed cells,”\nInternational Journal of Hyperthermia, 2019\n3 Chin et al, “Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Guided Transurethral Ultrasound Ablation of Prostate Tissue in Patients with Localized Prostate Cancer: A Prospective\nPhase 1 Clinical Trial,” European Urology, 2016; Bonekamp et al, “Twelve-month prostate volume reduction after MRI-guided transurethral ultrasound ablation of the\nprostate,” European Radiology, 2018\n4 Nair et al, “MRI-Guided Transurethral Ultrasound Ablation in Patients with Localized Prostate Cancer: Three Year Outcomes of a Prospective Phase I Study”, BJU\nInternational, 2020; Nair et al, “PD17-03 Five-Year Outcomes from a Prospective Phase I Study of MRI-Guided Transurethral Ultrasound Ablation in Men with\nLocalized Prostate Cancer”, AUA 2020 Virtual Experience, Abstract in The Journal of Urology, 2020; Hatiboglu et al, “Durability of functional outcomes after MRI-\nguided transurethral ultrasound ablation of the prostate,” JU Open Plus, 2023.\nPage 4\nProfound Medical Corp.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023\nIn USD$ (000s)\nunrelated cause. Of 16 men with complete follow-up data, five-year median PSA remained at 0.55 ng/ml. Median IPSS of 6 at baseline\nreturned to 5 by three months, and 6.5 at five years. At baseline, 9 of 16 had erections sufficient for penetration, 11 of 16 at one year,\nand 7 of 16 at five years. All 16 subjects had leak-free, pad-free continence at one and five years. Predictors of salvage therapy included\nlower ablation coverage and higher PSA nadir. At five years after TULSA, cancer specific survival is 100%, and overall survival 97%.\nBenign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH), Relief of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS): Phase I Studies\nPromising safety and feasibility of the TULSA-PRO® to relieve Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (“LUTS”) associated with BPH has been\ndemonstrated in two clinical studies showing improvements in IPSS comparable to modern minimally invasive surgical therapies5. A\nretrospective analysis of a sub-group of nine men from the Phase I localized prostate cancer study who also had LUTS (baseline IPSS ≥\n12) demonstrated significant IPSS improvement of 58% from 16.1 to 6.3 at 12 months (p=0.003), with at least a moderate (≥ 6 points)\nsymptom reduction in eight of nine patients. IPSS Quality of Life (“QoL”) improved in eight of nine patients. Erectile function (IIEF-EF)\nremained stable from 14.6 at baseline to 15.7 at 12 months. The proportion of patients with erections sufficient for penetration was\nunchanged. Full urinary continence (pad-free, leak-free) was achieved at 12 months in all patients. In five men who suffered from more\nsevere symptoms (baseline IPSS ≥ 12 and Qmax < 15 ml/s), peak urine flow rate (“Qmax”) increased from 11.6 ml/s to 22.5 ml/s at 12\nmonths. All adverse events were mild to moderate with no serious events reported.\nA prospective Phase I/II study of TULSA-PRO® for BPH has been conducted with early outcomes published in 20226. All measures of\nurinary function and quality of life improved during the initial twelve-month follow up among the first ten patients treated, while no adverse\neffects were seen on sexual and bowel functions: average IPSS decreased from 17.5 to 4.0, IPSS QoL decreased from 4.0 to 0.5, and\nQmax increased from 12.4 ml/s to 21.8 ml/s, among several other improved urinary measures. A single serious adverse event had\noccurred, abscess of the epididymis requiring drainage at two weeks post therapy. Enrollment of this study has been increased to 30\npatients.\nRadio-recurrent localized prostate cancer, Salvage TULSA (sTULSA): Phase I Study\nSalvage ablation of radio-recurrent localized prostate cancer has been evaluated in a prospective Phase I/II study of TULSA-PRO® with\nearly outcomes published in 20207. The report includes the first eleven patients from a 40-patient study, who were successfully treated,\nand discharged on the first postoperative day, with median catheterization time of seven days. Median PSA decreased from 7.6 ng/ml at\nbaseline to a nadir of 0.2 ng/ml and was 0.23 ng/ml at 12 months. At 12 months, 10/11 patients were free of any PCa in the targeted\nablation zone, confirmed with biopsy and imaging (MRI and PSMA-PET), and had low and stable PSA. Four patients had prolonged\ncatheterization and subsequent urinary tract infection, and one of these patients had upper urinary tract dilation treated with double-J-\nstents.\nPalliation of symptomatic locally advanced prostate cancer, Palliative TULSA (pTULSA): Phase I Study\nPatients with symptomatic locally advanced prostate cancer can suffer from severe urinary retention due to bladder outlet obstruction,\nintractable hematuria and frequent hospitalization. While these complications are commonly treated by palliative transurethral resection\nof the prostate (“TURP”), the improvement is often insufficient and may exclude patients who cannot discontinue anticoagulants. The\nsafety and feasibility of MRI-guided TULSA was evaluated as an alternative palliative treatment option for men suffering from symptomatic\nlocally advanced prostate cancer8. Ten patients with locally advanced prostate cancer were enrolled, half with clinical stage T4 disease\nand half with clinical T3. Prior to TULSA, all patients had continuous indwelling catheterization due to urinary retention, and 90% had\nhistory of recurrent and/or ongoing gross hematuria. Three patients had palliative TURP performed six months prior to receiving palliative\nTULSA, all of which were unsuccessful. One week after palliative TULSA, 50% of men were catheter-free. At last follow-up, 100% of men\nwere free of gross hematuria, and 80% had an improvement in catheterization, with 70% completely catheter-free. Notably, the average\nhospitalization time from local complications reduced from 7.3 to 1.4 days in the six-month period before and after palliative TULSA. All\nadverse events were related to urinary tract infections, with two patients requiring intravenous administration of antibiotics and three\npatients resolved with oral antibiotics alone. No other treatment related adverse events were recorded, with no rectal injury or fistula.\nFurther, there was no need for blood transfusions and there was no perioperative mortality.\n5 Elterman et al, “Relief of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms after MRI-Guided Transurethral Ultrasound Ablation (TULSA) for localized prostate cancer: Subgroup\nAnalyses in Patients with concurrent cancer and Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,” Journal of Endourology, 2020; Anttinen et al, “Transurethral ultrasound therapy for\nbenign prostatic obstruction in humans,” EAU 2020 Conference Presentation\n6 Viitala et al, “Magnetic resonance imaging-guided transurethral ultrasound ablation for benign prostatic hyperplasia: 12-month clinical outcomes of a phase I\nstudy,” BJU Int, 2022.\n7 Anttinen et al, “Salvage Magnetic Resonance Imaging–guided Transurethral Ultrasound Ablation for Localized Radiorecurrent Prostate Cancer: 12-Month Functional\nand Oncological Results,” European Urology Open Science, 2020.\n8 Anttinen et al, “Palliative MRI-guided transurethral ultrasound ablation for symptomatic locally advanced prostate cancer,” Scandinavian Journal of Urology, 2020\nPage 5\nProfound Medical Corp.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023\nIn USD$ (000s)\nCAPTAIN Trial\nCAPTAIN (A Comparison of TULSA Procedure vs. Radical Prostatectomy in Participants with Localized Prostate Cancer) is a prospective,\nmulti-centre randomized controlled trial of 201 patients aimed at comparing the safety and efficacy of the TULSA procedure (performed\nwith the TULSA-PRO® system) with radical prostatectomy (“RP”) in men with organ-confined, intermediate-risk, Gleason Score 7 (Grade\nGroup 2 and 3) prostate cancer. In the CAPTAIN trial, 134 patients will be randomized to receive one or two TULSA procedures and 67\npatients will be randomized to receive RP. The trial takes place primarily in the United States, with an additional two sites in Canada and\none in Europe. Of those, sixteen sites have been activated to date and are currently recruiting patients.\nRP is currently the gold-standard surgical treatment for intermediate-risk prostate cancer. RP effectively controls disease but carries risk\nof significant side effects such as long-term erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence. The TULSA procedure combines transurethral,\nrobotically-driven therapeutic ultrasound with real-time visualization of temperature and automated control of heating from magnetic\nresonance thermometry. The high spatial, thermal, and anatomic resolution of the target volume enables precise ablation of prostate\ntissue while sparing functionally important structures, potentially reducing the risk of side effects relative to RP.\nThe goal of the CAPTAIN trial is to demonstrate that the efficacy of the TULSA procedure is not inferior to RP, while demonstrating\nsuperior quality of life outcomes in patients receiving the TULSA procedure as compared to those patients receiving RP. The primary\nsafety endpoint is the proportion of patients who preserve both erectile potency and urinary continence at one year after treatment. The\nprimary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of patients who are free from any additional treatment for prostate cancer by three years after\ntreatment. Secondary endpoints include comparison of rates of complications, cost effectiveness, and timing of the return to baseline\nactivity. Long-term follow-up will be gathered for up to 10 years after treatment.\nSonalleve®\nProfound’s Sonalleve® system combines real-time MRI and thermometry with focused ultrasound delivered from the outside of the patient\nto enable customized incision-free ablation of diseased tissue. Profound acquired the Sonalleve® technology from Philips in 2017.\nThe Sonalleve® system is CE marked in the EU for the treatment of uterine fibroids, adenomyotic tissue, palliative pain treatment of bone\nmetastases, osteoid osteoma and management of benign tumors. The uterine fibroids application is also available for sale in Canada. In\n2018, the Sonalleve® system was also approved in China by the National Medical Products Administration for the non-invasive treatment\nof uterine fibroids and by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety in South Korea. Philips Oy registered Sonalleve® in several Middle East,\nNorth African, and South Asian countries. In 2020, Sonalleve® also received HDE from the US FDA for treatment of Osteoid Osteoma.\nSonalleve® Clinical Applications\nUterine Fibroids and Adenomyosis\nUterine fibroids are the most common non-cancerous tumors in women of childbearing age. Both surgical and medical treatments are\navailable, and the choice depends on number, size, and location of uterine fibroids, patient’s age and preferences, and pregnancy\nexpectations. To date, symptomatic uterine fibroids have been mostly treated with radical surgery (hysterectomy) in women who have\ncompleted childbearing, or conservative surgery (myomectomy and endometrial ablation) in women who wish to preserve fertility. Today,\nthe radiologist also has interventional options available. Minimally or non-invasive interventional radiology procedures include uterine\nartery embolization.\nThere is currently no ideal treatment for adenomyosis, and new options are needed. Drawing on experience of treatment of uterine\nfibroids, MR-High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (“MR-HIFU”) has been explored as a potential new conservative treatment and MR-HIFU\nis an early-stage, non-invasive, therapeutic technology with the potential to improve the QoL and decrease the cost of care for patients\nwith adenomyosis.\nTo achieve its current regulatory clearances, the Sonalleve® MR-HIFU System has undergone several studies and clinical trials for uterine\napplications at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Center (Toronto, Ontario), University Medical Center Utrecht (Utrecht, the Netherlands),\nNational Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD, USA), St. Luke’s Episcopal Hospital (Houston, TX, USA), University Hospital St. André\n(Bordeaux, France), Samsung Medical Center (Seoul, Korea), Peking University First Hospital Beijing (Beijing, China), First Affiliated\nHospital of Medical College of Xi’an Jiaotong University (Xi’an, China), and Turku University Hospital (Turku, Finland), amongst others.\nIn addition, a comprehensive literature review provides supportive evidence showcasing the beneficial action of MR-HIFU in uterine fibroid\nand adenomyosis therapy. These studies include the Verpalen et al. 2020, Nguyen 2020, Yeo et al. 2017, Kim et al. 2017, and Hocquelet\net al. 2017 that utilized the Sonalleve® MR-HIFU System. Specifically, the studies show impressive performance in terms of ablation\nefficiency, therapeutic efficacy, symptom reduction, and/or QoL improvement. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events\nPage 6\nProfound Medical Corp.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023\nIn USD$ (000s)\nin any of these studies, although Browne et al. 2020 describes a procedure-related major complication in the form of deep vein thrombosis\nthat was noted in one patient (0.8%) and subsequently and successfully treated with anticoagulation therapy. Minor adverse events, when\npresent, typically include 1st and 2nd degree skin burns, local swelling, cramps, leg pain, abdominal pain, buttock pain, and back pain,\nwhich are all known and anticipated adverse events of MR-HIFU therapy.\nPalliative Bone Pain Treatment\nPain caused by bone metastases is common in the event of malignancy and is inevitably associated with serious complications that may\ndeteriorate the QoL of patients and become life threatening.\nFor patients with bone metastases, clinical evaluation reports were completed in October 2020, showing significant decrease in pain\nscore and/or dosage of medication and increase in QoL are to be expected with MR-HIFU bone therapy. The randomized controlled\nPhase III study by Hurwitz et al. represents some of the most important clinical data that has been reported. In 112 subjects receiving\nMR-HIFU compared against 35 subjects receiving sham treatment, significant pain reduction at three months (decrease in worst NRS\npain ≥ 2 without increase in pain medication) was 64.3% vs. 20.0% (p<0.001), with mean Numeric Pain Scale (“NRS”) reduction of 3.6 ±\n3.1 vs. 0.7 ± 2.4 from an initial median NRS score of 7.0 in both groups. Improvement in average Brief Pain Inventory-Quality of Life at\nthree months was 2.4 points superior in the MR-HIFU group (p<0.001), representing a clinically important reduction in impairment caused\nby bone metastasis pain.\nThe clinical data above shows that patients with bone metastases can expect a statistically significant decrease in pain scores and/or in\nmedication dosage and increase in quality of life with MR-HIFU bone metastasis therapy.\nOsteoid Osteoma Treatment\nOsteoid osteoma is a relatively rare, painful bone tumor that typically occurs in the cortex of long bones, especially in children and\nadolescents, and accounts for approximately 10% of all benign bone tumors.\nCurrent osteoid osteoma treatment options include surgery and radiofrequency ablation (“RFA”), which is a less invasive option than\nsurgical resection. Although RFA can have a high success rate, the treatment is invasive and can potentially cause minor and major\ncomplications. It also exposes patients and operators to ionizing radiation associated with the CT imaging guidance.\nSonalleve® MR-HIFU provides an optimal therapy choice for osteoid osteoma which is a precise, completely non-invasive, and free from\nionizing radiation treatment. The recent studies have assessed the use of Sonalleve® MR-HIFU in treatment of osteoid osteoma, showing\na high clinical success rate and complete symptom resolution without any serious adverse effects and only few minor adverse effects\nthat promptly resolve. The Sonalleve® MR-HIFU device offers a novel, minimally invasive, MRI-guided method to treat osteoid osteoma\nsafely and effectively. A desmoid tumor, also called desmoid fibromatosis or aggressive fibromatosis, is a non-metastasizing but locally\naggressive proliferation of myofibroblasts that affects children and adults, with a peak incidence in early adulthood. Traditional\nmanagement of desmoid tumors includes observation, surgical resection, radiation, and/or chemotherapy. Observation allows\nassessment of the rate of tumor growth and may be acceptable in small, slow-growing, or asymptomatic lesions. Surgical resection is\noften a highly morbid procedure and has a high rate of recurrence even with negative margins. Radiotherapy provides somewhat improved\nlocal control rates but the morbidity from radiation, including burns, fibrosis, chronic edema, and pathologic fractures, is problematic. In\naddition, the small but finite risk of a radiation-induced malignancy is particularly troublesome in this young patient population, considering\nthe tumor being treated is benign.\nRecently, MR-HIFU has been assessed as a non-invasive therapy of desmoid tumors, showing good clinical success and even complete\ntumor eradication in some cases with low number and relative mild adverse events, which typically promptly resolve. The Sonalleve® MR-\nHIFU device offers a novel, non-invasive, MRI-guided method to treat desmoid tumors.\nThis technology is ideally suited for the treatment of desmoid tumors in a patient population that is generally young, otherwise healthy,\nand would like to avoid the morbidity of traditional surgical, radiation, and medical therapies for a benign disease. Magnetic resonance\nimaging provides visualization of critical neurovascular structures and allows sparing of these structures during therapy. While complete\nablation of a desmoid tumor may not be possible in all cases because of involvement of these structures, significant reduction in tumor\nvolume is often obtained with a corresponding improvement in pain and functional impairment. As the natural history of the disease often\ninvolves recurrence, the ability to re-treat with MR-HIFU without an upper dose limit is also an advantage. The clinical evidence to date\ndemonstrates that MR-HIFU provides a safe and effective treatment of desmoid tumors.\nPage 7\nProfound Medical Corp.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023\nIn USD$ (000s)\nBusiness Update and Sales Strategy\nProfound initiated its launch of the TULSA-PRO® system in the United States in Q4 2019 and the first patient was treated in the United\nStates in a non-clinical trial setting in January 2020. Since then, Profound’s business model has evolved to a recurring revenue model\nthat includes durable hardware usage, one-time-use devices and Profound’s Genius services, which includes necessary support for a\nproductive start-up of the practice.\nProfound has generated revenues from capital sales, one-time-use devices and related services, in the EU (principally in Germany) and\nAsia. For the period ended March 31, 2024, approximately 61%, 34% and 5% of revenues were generated in the United States, EU and\nAsia, respectively, compared to approximately 57%, 41% and 2% of revenues which were generated in the United States, EU and Asia,\nrespectively for the period ended March 31, 2023. Revenue on a quarter over quarter basis is expected to fluctuate given the Company\nis maintaining a limited European commercial effort and remains primarily focused on the US market.\nProfound’s TULSA-PRO® system is primarily marketed to early adopter physicians who specialize in treatment of prostate disease\nincluding urologists and radiologists at opinion leading hospitals. TULSA-PRO® services are available at either independent imaging\ncenters or at hospital-based imaging centers.\nHistorically, treatment of conditions such as localized prostate disease and uterine fibroids have included surgical intervention. Over time,\nsurgery has evolved from an ‘open’ technique, to laparoscopic, to robotic surgery. The motivation of surgeons behind this evolution has\nbeen to perform procedures that reduce invasiveness, improve clinical outcomes and reduce recovery times. Profound is seeking to take\nthis concept to the next level by enabling customizable, incision-free therapies for the MRI-guided ablation of diseased tissue with the\nTULSA-PRO® and Sonalleve® systems. These incision-free and radiation-free procedures offer surgeons the option of providing\npredictable and customizable procedures that eliminate invasiveness, offer the potential to improve clinical outcomes and further reduce\nhospital stays and patient recovery times.\nProfound is establishing its own direct sales and marketing teams for sales of TULSA-PRO® systems and the one-time-use devices\nrelated thereto, as well as for Sonalleve® systems in the jurisdictions where it is approved. The primary focus of Profound’s direct sales\nteam is to cultivate adoption of the TULSA-PRO® technology, support clinical customers with the TULSA-PRO® procedures and increase\nthe utilization of the systems and one-time-use devices. Profound expects to generate recurring revenues from the use of the system,\none-time-use devices, clinical support and service maintenance.\nOn January 21, 2019, the Company entered into an agreement with Siemens (the “Siemens Agreement”). Under the Siemens\nAgreement, there is a one-time fixed license fee and per annum payments calculated based on annual volume of Profound’s systems\nthat are interfaced to a Siemens MRI scanner. The initial term of the Siemens Agreement is five years and will be automatically extended\nfor successive one-year terms thereafter unless terminated earlier. The Company also obtained a non-exclusive license to Siemens\nAccess I interface software and reasonable support for the term of the Siemens Agreement.\nOn December 21, 2020, Profound signed the GE Agreement to expand provider access to TULSA-PRO®. Pursuant to the terms of the\nGE Agreement, Profound has been supplied with additional information to utilize the ExSI interface, which has allowed Profound to\ninterface with GE MRI scanners and GE is helping support the development efforts of Profound to achieve compatibility with its GE MRI\nscanners which was achieved on March 1, 2022 when the Company signed the first site agreement for a Tulsa-PRO® system interfaced\nwith a GE scanner.\nOn February 8, 2024, Profound entered into a non-exclusive collaboration with Siemens Healthineers, aimed at laying the groundwork\nfor Profound to begin marketing a complete therapeutics solution, combining its TULSA-PRO® system with the MAGNETOM Free.Max\nmagnetic resonance scanner from Siemens Healthineers, via Profound’s own sales force. Profound will continue to market TULSA-\nPRO® as a stand-alone offering, providing its customers with the flexibility to use the technology with the MR hardware of their choice.\nCompetition\nTULSA-PRO®\nThe TULSA-PRO® system is intended to ablate benign and malignant prostate tissue, however there are other treatment options for\nprostate disease. There are currently no marketed devices indicated for the treatment of prostate diseases or prostate cancer and\nProfound’s FDA indication and CE mark in the EU also do not include treatment of any particular disease or condition. However, there\nare a number of devices indicated for the destruction or removal of prostate tissue and devices indicated for use in performing surgical\nprocedures that physicians and surgeons currently utilize when treating patients with prostate disease, including prostate cancer.\nApproaches that physicians and surgeons currently use to address prostate disease include: (1) watchful waiting/active surveillance; (2)\nPage 8\nProfound Medical Corp.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023\nIn USD$ (000s)\nsimple prostatectomy; (3) radical prostatectomy (includes open, laparoscopic and robotic procedures); (4) radiation therapies including,\nexternal beam radiation therapy, brachytherapy and high dose radiation; (5) cryoablation; and (6) trans-rectal high intensity focused\nultrasound (“HIFU”). In addition, certain adjunct or less common procedures are used or are under development to address prostate\ndisease, such as androgen deprivation therapy and proton beam therapy.\nEach of the foregoing competing options have their own limitations and benefits and may only be appropriate for limited patient\npopulations. For example, active surveillance is generally recommended for patients who have been diagnosed with earlier stage, lower\nrisk, disease where the possibility of side effects from intervention may outweigh the expected benefit of the chosen procedure. For\nclinicians and patients, the gap between active surveillance and the most commonly utilized options of radical prostatectomy or radiation\ntherapy, imposes the possibility of substantial side effects, creating a need for a less invasive methodology to remove diseased prostate\ntissue that is both radiation and incision-free, provides a more favorable side-effect profile, and allows for safe and effective salvage\ntreatment options if required in the future.\nProfound believes that the flexibility of the TULSA-PRO® system may allow the Company to demonstrate its use as a tool for ablating\nbenign and malignant diseased prostate tissue with greater speed and precision than current options while minimizing potential side\neffects. Profound believes that the TULSA-PRO® system may overcome certain limitations of other devices and methodologies for\nremoving or addressing diseased prostate tissue including HIFU, such as complications associated with trans-rectal delivery and\nlimitations relating to prostate size and total ablation volume. Profound believes that a transurethral (inside out) ablation approach with\nmillimeter accuracy has advantages over HIFU in ablating the whole gland safely, as well as ablating larger prescribed treatment plans\nfor patients with multi-focal disease, BPH, and those who have prostate cancer concurrent with BPH.\nSonalleve®\nThe treatment choices for uterine fibroids usually depend on the symptoms of the patient, size of the fibroid, desire for future pregnancy\nand preference of the treating gynecologist. The most common treatment options for uterine fibroids include: (1) hormonal medications\nincluding gonadotrophin releasing hormone agonists; (2) progesterone releasing intra-uterine devices; (3) surgical procedures such as\nhysterectomy and myomectomy; and (4) uterine artery embolization. Profound believes that the Sonalleve® system may provide a\ntreatment option that is more convenient and comfortable with fewer side effects than hormonal medications or surgical procedures, such\nas hysterectomy or myomectomy.\nReimbursement\nProfound’s ability to successfully commercialize the Company’s products depends in large part on the extent to which coverage and\nadequate reimbursement for such products and related treatments or procedures will be available from government health administration\nauthorities, government and private health insurers, and other organizations or third-party payors. Pricing and reimbursement procedures\nand decisions vary from country to country. Many government health authorities and private payors condition payment on the cost-\neffectiveness of the product. Even if a device is FDA cleared or CE marked or has received other regulatory clearance or approval, there\nis no guarantee that third-party payors will reimburse providers or patients for the cost of the device and related procedures or that the\namount of such reimbursement will be adequate to cover the cost of the device. The availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement\nto hospitals and clinicians using Profound’s products therefore is important to its ability to generate revenue and Profound plans to pursue\ncoverage and reimbursement for the Company’s products in the key markets where the Company has regulatory approvals. Successful\ncommercialization of the Company’s approved products will also depend on the cost of the system and the availability of coverage and\nadequate reimbursement from third-party payors.\nAlthough Profound expects there to be an out-of-pocket market for the Company’s approved products, an out-of-pocket market alone is\nunlikely to be sufficient to support successful commercialization of the Company’s products. With sponsorship and support from multiple\nphysician specialty societies, the AMA has established three new Current Procedural Terminology (“CPT’) Category 1 codes for MRI-\nMonitored Transurethral Ultrasound Ablation (“TULSA”) of prostate tissue, performed using Profound’s TULSA-PRO system. The first\nCPT Code describes the complete TULSA procedure when furnished by a single physician, such as a urologist. The other two CPT codes\neach describe a part of the TULSA procedure when TULSA is furnished by two physicians, such as a urologist in collaboration with a\nradiologist. The three new CPT Category 1 codes and their descriptors covering the TULSA procedure will be included in a future edition\nof the CPT Codebook and will be effective on January 1, 2025. In the meantime, U.S. hospitals and Ambulatory Surgical Centers\nperforming the TULSA procedure on Medicare patients may utilize HCPCS C code, C9734, established by the U.S. Centers for Medicare\nand Medicaid Services for the Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System. Effective January 1, 2024, national average\nreimbursement to a hospital billing under C9734 is set to $12.5.\nPage 9\nProfound Medical Corp.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023\nIn USD$ (000s)\nHIGHLIGHTS\n On January 2, 2024, Profound completed an underwritten public offering for aggregate gross proceeds of $20,000 ($18,238,\nnet of transaction costs) with the issuance of 2,666,667 Common Shares at a price of $7.50 per share (the “Public Offering”).\n On January 16, 2024, Profound completed a non-brokered private placement for aggregate gross proceeds of $2,938 ($2,841,\nnet of transaction costs) with the issuance of 391,667 Common Shares at a price of $7.50 per share (the “Private Placement”).\n On February 27, 2024, Profound entered into a collaboration with Siemens Healthineers to further expand physician and patient\naccess to the TULSA procedure.\n On March 7, 2024, Profound announced the promotion of Mathieu Burtnyk, PhD, from SVP Product Leader to Chief Operating\nOfficer.\nSELECTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nThe following selected financial information as at and for the three months ended March 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, have been derived\nfrom the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with those unaudited interim\ncondensed consolidated financial statements and related notes.\nFor three months ended March 31,\n2024 2023 2022\n$ $ $\nRevenue 1,910 1,860 1,364\nOperating expenses 8,751 8,051 7,728\nNet finance expense (income) (1,322) (145) 892\nNet loss for the period 6,160 6,693 8,184\nBasic and diluted loss per share 0.26 0.32 0.40\nMarch 31, December 31,\n2024 2023\n$ $\nTotal assets 57,382 43,911\nTotal non-current financial liabilities 501 5,578\nRevenue has increased for the three months ended March 31, 2024 due to higher US sales from recurring revenue and capital sales\ncompared to the three months ended March 31, 2023.\nOperating expenses increased for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023 and\n2022 due to the continued focus of commercialization of the TULSA-PRO® within the US market based on increased selling and\ndistribution expenses.\nThe increase in net finance income for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023\nand 2022 was primarily the impact of the change in the foreign exchange rates for Profound’s foreign currency denominated cash and\ninterest income from cash held in the bank.\nThe Company reported total assets of $57,382 as at March 31, 2024 compared to $43,911 as at December 31, 2023.

The Sonalleve® product is marketed primarily outside North America in European and Asian countries deploying\none-time capital sales model with limited recurring service revenue. Outside of North America, Profound generates most of its revenues\nfrom its system sales (both TULSA-PRO® and Sonalleve®) in Europe and Asia where the Company deploys a more traditional hybrid\nbusiness model, charging for the system separately as capital and an additional per patient charge for the one-time-use devices and\nassociated Genius services. Revenue is comprised of recurring – non-capital revenue, which consists of the sale of one-time-use devices,\nlease of medical devices, procedures and services associated with extended warranties and one-time sale of capital equipment.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company recorded revenue totaling $1,910 with $428 from the one-time sale of capital\nequipment and $1,482 coming from recurring – non-capital revenue. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company recorded\nrevenue totaling $1,860 with $393 from the one-time sale of capital equipment and $1,467 from recurring – non-capital revenue. The\nincrease in revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2024, was a result of higher US sales from recurring revenue and capital sales.\nRevenue on a quarter over quarter basis is expected to fluctuate in the near term given the Company is maintaining a limited European\ncommercial effort and remains focused primarily on the US market which continues to see growth quarter over quarter.\nCost of sales\nCost of sales includes cost of finished goods, inventory provisions, warranty, freight and manufacturing overhead expenses.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company recorded cost of sales of $641, related to the sale of medical devices, capital\nand non-capital, which reflects a 66% gross profit. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company recorded cost of sales of\n$647, related to the sale of medical devices, capital and non-capital, which reflects a 65% gross profit. The gross profit was slightly higher\nin 2024 due to manufacturing operating at a higher efficiency rates based on process improvements.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses consist of three components: research and development (“R&D”), general and administrative (“G&A”) and selling\nand distribution expenses. Historically, R&D expenses have exceeded selling and distribution expenses; however, in the future Profound\nexpects selling and distribution expenses to increase as the Company further commercializes the TULSA-PRO® system in the US.\nR&D Expenses\nR&D expenses are comprised of costs incurred in performing R&D activities, including new product development, continuous product\nimprovement, investment in clinical trials and related clinical manufacturing costs, materials and supplies, salaries and benefits, consulting\nfees, patent procurement costs, and occupancy costs related to R&D activity.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024, R&D expenses were higher by $93 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023.\nClinical trial costs, travel and software costs increased by $227, $27 and $30, respectively. The increases were due to improved enrolment\nfor the CAPTAIN trial and recruitment efforts, additional travel associated with system installation and clinical trials and increased software\ncosts associated with thermal boost and artificial intelligence development software. Offsetting these amounts was a decrease in rent of\n$125 due to lower MRI time usage and a decrease of $68 to share based compensation due to few awards granted to employees.\nG&A expenses\nG&A expenses are comprised of management costs, including salaries and benefits, various management and administrative support\nfunctions, insurance and other operating and occupancy costs.\nG&A expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2024 increased by $281 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023.\nSalaries and benefits, consulting fees and travel increased by $78, $246 and $18, respectively, due to higher cost of living salary\nincreases, increased legal and accounting fees associated with annual audit and upcoming disclosure changes and increased travel for\ninvestor relations and conferences. Offsetting this amount was a decrease to insurance expense of $30 due to lower premium rates and\ndecrease to the general office expenses of $30.\nSelling and distribution expenses\nSelling and distribution expenses are comprised of business development costs related to the market development activities and\ncommercialization of the Company’s systems, including salaries and benefits, marketing support functions, occupancy costs related to\nmarketing activity and other miscellaneous marketing costs.\nPage 12\nProfound Medical Corp.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023\nIn USD$ (000s)\nSelling and distribution expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2024 were higher by $326 compared to the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2023. Salaries and benefits, consulting fees, marketing and travel increased by $176, $67, $67 and $89, respectively, due to\nincreased salesforce and commission payments, consultants engaged to assist with Veteran Affairs and military sales markets, release\nof commercial segments and marketing advertisement campaigns, and increased in-person conferences and customer meetings.\nOffsetting these amounts was a decrease of $89 to share based compensation due to few awards granted to employees.\nNet finance expense (income)\nNet finance expense (income) is primarily comprised of the following: (i) the CIBC Loan Agreement (as defined herein) accreting to the\nprincipal amount repayable and its related interest expense; (ii) the change in the fair value of the derivative liability warrants; (iii) the\nlease liability interest expense; (iv) foreign exchange gain or losses; (v) interest income; and (vi) the change in amortized cost of trade\nand other receivables.\nNet finance income for the three months ended March 31, 2024, was higher by $1,177 compared to the three months ended March 31,\n2023. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company recognized $868 of foreign exchange gain and a $69 change in\namortized cost of trade and other receivables. The Company also recognized interest income of $562, interest expense from the CIBC\nLoan Agreement of $169 and lease liability interest expense of $8. The largest fluctuation from the three months ended March 31, 2024\nversus the three months ended March 31, 2023 was the $121 increase in fair value of the derivative liability warrants, $988 increase in\nforeign exchange and $265 increase in interest income.\nNet loss\nNet loss for the three months ended March 31, 2024, was $6,199 or $0.26 per Common Share, compared to a net loss of $6,741 or $0.32\nper Common Share for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase in net loss was primarily attributed to an increase in R&D\nexpense of $93, an increase in G&A expenses of $281 and an increase in selling and distribution expenses of $326. This was offset by\nan increase in net finance income of $1,177 and an increase in gross profits of $56.\nSUMMARY OF QUARTERLY FINANCIAL RESULTS\nThe summary financial information provided below is derived from the Company’s interim financial statements for each of the last eight\nquarters that are prepared under IFRS Accounting Standards in US dollars.\n2024 2023 2022\nQ1 Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1 Q4 Q3 Q2\n$ $ $ $ $ $ $ $\nRevenue 1,910 2,009 1,728 1,602 1,860 1,257 2,035 2,025\nCost of sales 641 950 668 552 647 698 945 1,089\nGross profit 1,269 1,059 1,060 1,050 1,213 559 1,090 936\nOperating expenses 8,751 9,841 7,620 7,486 8,051 9,381 9,324 8,714\nNet finance expense\n(income) (1,322) 356 (1,014) 884 (145) 499 (3,271) (1,864)\nLoss before income\ntaxes 6,160 9,138 5,546 7,320 6,693 9,321 4,963 5,914\nIncome taxes 39 (229) 18 35 48 206 34 16\nNet loss for the period 6,199 8,909 5,564 7,355 6,741 9,527 4,997 5,930\nLoss per Common\nShare\nBasic and diluted 0.26 0.42 0.26 0.35 0.32 0.46 0.24 0.28\nThe first quarter of 2024 revenue increased compared to the majority of prior quarters as a result of higher US sales from recurring\nrevenue. Operating expenses increased against the majority of prior quarters due to additional headcount within sales and distribution\nand expenses associated with the continued TULSA-PRO® commercialization with the US market.\nPage 13\nProfound Medical Corp.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023\nIn USD$ (000s)\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023 revenue continued to increase compared to prior quarters as new sites became operational and increased\npatient procedures. Operating expenses were higher than prior quarters due to ATM offering fees as well as overall increase to the\nsalesforce.\nIn the third quarter of 2023 operating expenses were higher compared to the prior quarter due to increased consulting costs associated\nwith regulatory and foreign consultants for additional approval in other countries. In addition, there was also an increase in finance income\ndue to the US dollar and Euro foreign currency rate, triggering a foreign exchange gain.\nThe second quarter of 2023 revenue was lower compared to the prior quarter due to decreased one-time capital sales. Operating\nexpenses were lower compared to the prior quarters due to decreased share based compensation expenses and lower amortization\nexpenses as a result of intangible assets being fully amortized.\nThe first quarter of 2023 cost of sales decreased from the quarterly periods in 2022 as a result of manufacturing operating at a higher\nefficiency rate based on improvements to quality and training that were implemented in the manufacturing process.\nThe fourth quarter of 2022 revenue was lower compared to prior quarters due to decreased one-time capital sales, primarily resulting\nfrom lower capital sales than previous quarters. Operating expenses were higher due to goodwill impairment.\nThe third quarter of 2022 cost of sales decreased as a result of better yields and product quality. In addition, there was also an increase\nin finance income due to the US dollar and Euro foreign currency rates, triggering a foreign exchange gain.\nThe second quarter of 2022 revenue increased compared to the prior quarter as a result of the rise of recurring revenue from US\nprocedures. Operating expenses were higher due to the increase in headcount and software fees. In addition, there was also an increase\nin finance income due to the US dollar and Euro foreign currency rate, triggering a foreign exchange gain.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAt March 31, 2024, the Company had cash of $41,180 compared to $26,213 at December 31, 2023. Historically, the Company’s primary\nsource of cash has been financing activities, e.g., equity offerings as well as the CIBC Loan (as defined below).\nUse of Proceeds\n2024 Offering and non-brokered private placement\nThe Company received net proceeds of $21,079 from the Public Offering and Private Placement. The Company intends to use net\nproceeds from the Public Offering and Private Placement to fund the continued commercialization of the TULSA-PRO® system in the\nUnited States, the continued development and commercialization of the TULSA-PRO® system and the SONALLEVE® system globally\nand for working capital and general corporate purposes. The Company confirms that there have been no material variances in the\nestimated use of proceeds from the net proceeds of the Public Offering since the date of the Company’s prospectus supplement dated\nDecember 27, 2023. In addition, there have been no material adjustments to the cost or timing of the business objective previously\ndisclosed in such prospectus supplement.\nTotal spending as at\nMarch 31, 2024\n$\nTULSA-PRO® commercialization 3,767\nSonalleve® development and commercialization 631\nWorking capital and general corporate purposes 3,620\nTotal 8,018\nCIBC Loan\nProfound Medical Inc. (“PMI”) entered into a loan agreement with Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (“CIBC”) on November 3, 2022\n(the “CIBC Loan Agreement”), for gross proceeds of C$10,000, maturing on November 3, 2027, with an interest rate based on CIBC\nprime plus 2% (the “CIBC Loan”). The Company was required to make interest-only payments until October 31, 2023, and monthly\nrepayments on the principal of C$208 plus accrued interest commenced on October 31, 2023. All obligations of the Company under the\nPage 14\nProfound Medical Corp.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023\nIn USD$ (000s)\nCIBC Loan Agreement are guaranteed by current and future subsidiaries of the Company and included security of first priority interests\nin the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries. Initially, the Company had financial covenants in relation to the CIBC loan where\nunrestricted cash is at all times greater than EBITDA for the most recent six-month period, reported on a monthly basis and that revenue\nfor any fiscal quarter must be 15% greater than revenue for the same fiscal quarter in the prior fiscal year, reported on a quarterly basis.\nOn September 26, 2023 an amendment to the CIBC Loan resulted in an amendment to the financial covenants. The amended covenants\nare that unrestricted cash must at all times be greater of: (i) to the extent EBITDA is negative for such period, EBITDA for the most recent\nnine-month period or (ii) $7,500, reported on a monthly basis; and that recurring revenue for any fiscal quarter must be 15% greater than\nrecurring revenue for the same fiscal quarter in the prior fiscal year, reported on a quarterly basis. The Company is compliant with the\nfirst covenant whereby unrestricted cash is at all times greater than EBITDA for the most recent nine-month period ended March 31,\n2024. However, as at March 31, 2024, the Company is in breach with the second covenant whereby recurring revenue for any fiscal\nquarter must be 15% greater than recurring revenue for the same fiscal quarter in the prior fiscal year. The loan is classified as current\nsince CIBC has the right to demand the repayment of the loan. If CIBC demands repayment of the loan, the Company has sufficient cash\nto cover the repayment of the loan and would have $34,517 cash remaining.\nOn May 3, 2024, the Company received a waiver from CIBC and an amendment to the CIBC Loan which resulted in an amendment to\nthe financial covenants. The amended covenants are that the recurring revenue covenant shall not be tested for any fiscal quarter in the\n2024 fiscal year so long as unrestricted cash is no less than 2.5 multiplied by the principal amount of outstanding CIBC Loan at all times.\nCash Flow\nThe Company manages liquidity risk by monitoring actual and projected cash flows. A cash flow forecast is performed regularly to ensure\nthat the Company has sufficient cash to meet operational needs while maintaining sufficient liquidity. The Company’s cash requirements\ndepend on numerous factors, including market acceptance of the Company’s products, the resources devoted to developing and\nsupporting the products and other factors. Profound expects to continue to devote substantial resources to expand procedure adoption\nand acceptance of the Company’s products.\nThe Company may require additional capital to fund R&D activities and any significant expansion of operations. Potential sources of\ncapital could include equity and/or debt financings, development agreements or marketing agreements, the collection of revenue resulting\nfrom future commercialization activities and/or new strategic partnership agreements to fund some or all costs of development. There can\nbe no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain the capital sufficient to meet any or all of the Company’s needs. The availability\nof equity or debt financing will be affected by, among other things, the results of R&D, the Company’s ability to obtain regulatory approvals,\nthe market acceptance of the Company’s products, the state of the capital markets generally, strategic alliance agreements and other\nrelevant commercial considerations. In addition, if the Company raises additional funds by issuing equity securities, existing security\nholders will likely experience dilution, and any incurring of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could\nrequire the Company to agree to operating and financial covenants that would restrict operations. Any failure on the Company’s part to\nraise additional funds on terms favourable to the Company or at all may require the Company to significantly change or curtail current or\nplanned operations in order to conserve cash until such time, if ever, that sufficient proceeds from operations are generated, and could\nresult in the Company not being in a position to take advantage of business opportunities, in the termination or delay of clinical trials for\nits products, in curtailment of product development programs designed to identify new products, in the sale or assignment of rights to\ntechnologies, product and/or an inability to file market approval applications at all or in time to competitively market products.\nThree months ended\nMarch 31, March 31,\n2024 2023\n$ $\nCash provided by (used in) operating activities (5,098) (5,823)\nCash provided by (used in) financing activities 20,383 2,144\nForeign exchange on cash (318) 146\nNet increase (decrease) in cash 14,967 (3,533)\nPage 15\nProfound Medical Corp.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023\nIn USD$ (000s)\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $(5,098) versus $(5,823) for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2023. The principal use of the operating cash flows during this period related to improved trade and other\nreceivable collection, foreign exchange and offsetting these were increased sales and marketing efforts in the US which decreased cash.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $20,383 versus $2,144 for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2023. These cash flows relate primarily to the 2024 Offering and non-brokered private placement pursuant to\nwhich the Company received net proceeds of $21,079.\nForeign Exchange on Cash\nCash was impacted by the change in the foreign exchange rates for the Company’s foreign currency denominated cash (non-USD). The\nvalue of the Company’s currencies decreased, resulting in a decrease in the Company’s cash holdings.\nContractual obligations\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s significant contractual obligations:\nMarch 31, 2024\nCarrying Future cash Less than 1 Between 1 year\namount flows Year and 5 years\n$ $ $ $\nAccounts payables and accrued liabilities 2,875 2,875 2,875 -\nLease liabilities 7541 810 291 519\nLong-term debt 6,482 7,8742 2,565 5,309\nTotal 10,111 11,559 5,731 5,828\n1 Present value of the lease payments that are not paid, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease.\n2 Subsequent to period end, a waiver was obtained which revert the payment terms back in alignment with the CIBC agreement.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nNon-GAAP measures are not recognized measures under IFRS Accounting Standards and do not have a standardized meaning\nprescribed by IFRS Accounting Standards. These measures are defined with reference to the nearest comparable IFRS Accounting\nStandards measure such that a reconciliation to the nearest comparable IFRS Accounting Standards measure can be completed.\nAccordingly, these measures may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Profound uses non-GAAP\nmeasures in order to provide additional financial information to complement the closest IFRS Accounting Standards measures in order\nto provide investors with a further understanding of the Company’s operations from management’s perspective. Investors should not\nconsider that these non-GAAP measures are a substitute for analyses of the financial information that Profound reports under IFRS\nAccounting Standards. Profound uses these non-GAAP measures in order to provide investors with a supplemental measure of its\noperating performance and thus highlight trends in the Company’s business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on\nIFRS Accounting Standards measures.\nThe Company’s working capital (defined as current assets less current liabilities) is a non-GAAP financial measure. Working capital\nis used to fund operations and meet short-term obligations. If the Company has enough working capital, it can continue to pay its\nemployees and suppliers and meet other obligations, such as interest payments and taxes, even if it runs into cash flow challenges. The\nworking capital as at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is set forth in the table below.\nPage 16\nProfound Medical Corp.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023\nIn USD$ (000s)\nMarch 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\n$ $\nCurrent assets 55,541 41,896\nLess: Current liabilities 10,267 6,366\nWorking capital 45,274 35,530\nWorking capital increased by $9,744 with a surplus of $45,274 at March 31, 2024 compared to the surplus of $35,530 at December 31,\n2023. The change in working capital is due to an increase in current assets of $13,645, which was primarily the result of the increase in\nthe cash balance of $14,967 which was offset by decreased in trade and other receivables of $778. Current liabilities increased by $3,901\ndue to an increase in the current portion of the long-term debt caused by it being reclassified to a current liability due to the breach of a\ndebt covenant which was offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.\nCOMMITMENTS & CONTINGENCIES\nAll directors and officers of the Company are indemnified by the Company for various items including, but not limited to, all costs to settle\nlawsuits or actions due to their association with the Company, subject to certain restrictions. The Company has purchased directors’ and\nofficers’ liability insurance to mitigate the cost of any potential future lawsuits or actions. The term of the indemnification is not explicitly\ndefined but is limited to events for the period during which the indemnified party served as a director or officer of the Company. The\nmaximum amount of any potential future payment cannot be reasonably estimated but could have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany.\nThe Company has also indemnified certain lenders and underwriters in relation to certain debt and equity offerings and their respective\naffiliates and directors, officers, employees, shareholders, partners, advisers and agents and each other person, if any, controlling any of\nthe underwriters or lenders or their affiliates against certain liabilities.\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nThe Company’s financial instruments consist of cash, trade and other receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, derivative\nfinancial instruments, lease liabilities and long-term debt. The fair values of these financial instruments, approximate carrying value as a\nresult of their short-term nature. Financial assets measured at amortized cost include cash and trade and other receivables. The fair\nvalue of the long-term debt approximates its carrying amount as it has a floating interest rate.\nFinancial liabilities measured at amortized cost include accounts payable and accrued liabilities, long-term debt and lease liabilities.\nThe Company’s financial instruments are exposed to certain financial risks including credit risk, liquidity risk, currency risk and interest\nrate risk. There have been no significant changes to those risks impacting the Company since December 31, 2023, nor has there been a\nsignificant change in the composition of its financial instruments since December 31, 2023.\nRELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nKey management includes the Company’s directors and senior management team. Additional information on the senior management\nteam can be found in the Company’s AIF. The remuneration of directors and the senior management team were as follows:\nThree months ended March 31,\n2024 2023\n$ $\nSalaries and employee benefits 350 478\nDirectors’ fees 69 81\nShare-based compensation 542 777\nTotal 961 1,336\nPage 17\nProfound Medical Corp.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023\nIn USD$ (000s)\nExecutive employment agreements allow for additional payments in the event of a liquidity event, or if the executive is terminated without\ncause.\nOUTSTANDING SHARES\nAs at May 9, 2024, the date of this MD&A, the Company had the following securities outstanding:\nNumber\nCommon Shares 24,428,899\nShare purchase options 1,485,509\nDeferred Share Units 75,000\nRestricted Share Units 511,730\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nThe Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS Accounting Standards requires management to make\nestimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements,\nand the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the year. Actual results could differ from these estimates. As additional\ninformation becomes available or actual amounts are determinable, the recorded estimates are revised and reflected in operating results\nin the year in which they are determined.\nCritical accounting policies\nRevenue\nTo determine revenue recognition for arrangements the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a\ncustomer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to\nthe performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The\nCompany only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration it is entitled to in\nexchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer.\nThe Company derives its revenues primarily from the lease and sale of medical devices and the sale of certain one-time-use devices.\nCapital equipment consists of one-time revenue for the sale of capital equipment including installation fees. Recurring – non-capital\nrevenue consists of the sale of one-time-use devices, lease of medical devices, procedures and services associated with extended\nwarranties. Revenue is recognized when a contractual promise to a customer (performance obligation) has been fulfilled by transferring\ncontrol over the promised goods or services, generally at the point in time of shipment to or receipt of the products by the customer or\nwhen the services are performed. When contracts contain customer acceptance provisions, revenue is recognized on the satisfaction of\nthe specific acceptance criteria.\nThe amount of revenue to be recognized is based on the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for its goods and\nservices. For contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the consideration to which it expects to be\nentitled to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices and recognizes the related revenue when or as control\nof each individual performance obligation is transferred to customers.\nService revenue related to installation and training is recognized over the period in which the services are performed. Service revenue\nrelated to extended warranty service is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the extended warranty period covered by\nthe respective customer contract.\nPage 18\nProfound Medical Corp.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023\nIn USD$ (000s)\nCritical accounting estimates\nTrade and other receivables\nThe key judgements and estimates used in determining the amortized cost for trade and other receivables are the estimated collection\nperiod and the discount rate applied to the cash flow projections.\nDISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nDisclosure controls and procedures have been designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company is\naccumulated and communicated to the Company’s management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nThe Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Company (collectively the “Certifying Officers”) are responsible for\nestablishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (“DC&P”) and internal control over financial reporting (“ICFR”), as those\nterms are defined in National Instrument 52-109 Certification of Disclosure in Issuer’s Annual and Interim Filings.\nThe Certifying Officers have concluded that as at March 31, 2024, the Company's DC&P has been designed effectively to provide\nreasonable assurance that (a) material information relating to the Company is made known to them by others, particularly during the\nperiod in which the annual filings are being prepared; and (b) information required to be disclosed by the Company in its annual filings,\ninterim filings or other reports are filed or submitted, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in\nthe securities legislation.\nThere have been no significant changes to the Company's ICFR for the period ended March 31, 2024, which have materially affected, or\nare reasonably likely to materially affect the Company's ICFR. Based on their evaluation of these controls for the period ended March 31,\n2024, the Certifying Officers have also concluded that the Company's ICFR have been designed effectively to provide reasonable\nassurance regarding the reliability of the preparation and presentation of the financial statements for external purposes and that ICFR\nwere effective as at March 31, 2024. The Company used the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission\ncontrol framework to evaluate DC&P and ICFR.\nIt should be noted that while the Company's Certifying Officers believe that the Company's DC&P provides a reasonable level of\nassurance that they are effective, they do not expect that the disclosure controls will prevent all errors and fraud. A control system, no\nmatter how well conceived or operated, can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system\nare met.\nICFR is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the annual financial\nstatements for external reporting purposes in line with IFRS Accounting Standards. Management is responsible for establishing and\nmaintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting appropriate to the nature and size of the Company. However, any system\nof internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations and can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to annual\nfinancial statement preparation and presentation.\nENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE\nEnvironmental, social and governance (“ESG”) issues are an integral part of human life. They’ve also become a more conscious and\nexplicit part of business life, especially for public entities like Profound. The Company believes ESG sensitivities are an integral part of\ngrowing a successful, sustainable business. The importance Profound places on ESG principles stems from its foundation as a company,\nwhose mission is focused on providing customizable incision-free therapies that are flexible to treat different types of patients and can\ntreat each patient differently. ESG is embedded in the Company’s corporate strategy, which seeks to maximize long-term value by taking\na disciplined and sustainable approach to changing the paradigm of prostate cancer treatment.\nThrough Profound’s ESG plan, the Company intends to create enduring value for shareholders by:\n attracting, retaining and empowering a diverse, engaged workforce to bring unique perspectives and experiences to strategic\ndecisions;\n ensuring safe and secure workplaces for its employees and contributing to their welfare;\n caring for the environment in which the Company operates;\n strengthening relationships with shareholders by working collaboratively to achieve positive social, economic and environmental\noutcomes; and\n operating transparently.\nPage 19\nProfound Medical Corp.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023\nIn USD$ (000s)\nEnvironmental\nProfound believes in the 3Rs: reduce, reuse, recycle. Profound strives to control the waste and, in its facilities, electronic equipment,\npaper, glass, plastic and metal items, as well as hazardous waste, are recovered and recycled. Given the finite resources in the world,\nProfound believes moving towards a circular economy in which Profound reduces waste production is critical for both business and\nsociety. Recognizing the opportunity for the medical technology industry to support the transition towards lower waste and circular\nbusiness models, including by minimizing Profound’s waste footprint and exploring opportunities to reduce the volume of materials used.\nAt Profound, focusing efforts on waste minimization through a repair first strategy, and by using materials that can be recycled to increase\nthe supply of material for future reuse. The equipment that Profound provides to customers is collected, tested, repaired, or refurbished\nthen redeployed thus contributing to a circular economy. Equipment which can no longer be redeployed is brought to organizations or\nthird party vendors that partner with Profound to resell and recycle obsolete equipment.\nProfound is focused on waste reduction, waste avoidance, and waste management strategies for all materials, including plastic, metal,\nwater and cardboard. To manage the Company’s waste it segregates, recycles, and properly disposes of hazardous and non-hazardous\nmaterials and where possible, reuses materials such as alcohol and water through its recycling plan. Profound will continue managing its\nwaste and material use through clear and consistent communication of best practices throughout the Company. Profound is committed\nto environmental sustainability and prioritizes efforts to prevent pollution and to conserve, recover, and recycle materials wherever\npossible. The Company attempts to distribute documents electronically to minimize paper consumption, waste and limit the use of single-\nuse plastics. Since 2021, Profound has invested in upgrading its lighting in its manufacturing facilities by retrofitting its lighting to high-\nefficiency LED to reduce energy consumption and enhance the manufacturing facilities work environment for its employees. The Company\nplans to continue to invest in lighting where it can have a positive environmental impact and improve working conditions.\nThe repair first approach promotes reuse of existing materials and reduction of new materials (including packaging associated with\nreplacing parts), therefore avoiding waste to landfill. To further support these key areas, the Company is exploring opportunities to recycle\nglass, water and metals. In Profound’s facilities, multiple waterless urinals have been installed which save over 100,000 litres of water\nper urinal each year.\nSocial\nAs the demand for talent increases, the need for innovative attraction and retention strategies also increases. The Company recognizes\nthat in a rapidly changing environment, its employees are central to its business performance.

Readers are cautioned that while Profound believes it has accurately summarized all\nclinical studies cited in this MD&A, readers should review the full publications of the studies prior to making an investment decision in the\nCompany.\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW\nProfound (NASDAQ: PROF; TSX: PRN) is a commercial-stage medical device company focused on the development and marketing of\ncustomizable, incision-free therapeutic systems for the image guided ablation of diseased tissue utilizing its platform technologies and\nleveraging the healthcare system’s existing imaging infrastructure. Profound’s lead product (the “TULSA-PRO® system”) combines real-\ntime MRI, robotically driven transurethral sweeping-action thermal ultrasound with closed-loop temperature feedback control for the\nablation of prostate tissue. The product is comprised of one-time-use devices and durable equipment that are used in conjunction with a\ncustomer’s existing MRI scanner.\nIn August 2019, the TULSA-PRO® system received FDA clearance as a Class II device in the United States of America (“United States”\nor “US”) for thermal ablation of prescribed prostate tissue, using transurethral ultrasound ablation (“TULSA®”) based on the Company\nsponsored (“TACT”) whole gland ablation pivotal clinical study. It is also CE marked in the European Union (“EU”) for ablation of targeted\nprostate tissue (benign or malignant). The TULSA-PRO® system was approved by Health Canada in November 2019.\nProfound believes that, based on the Company’s TACT clinical data and additional studies conducted in the EU, physicians may elect to\nuse TULSA-PRO® to ablate benign or malignant prostate tissue in patients with a variety of prostate diseases. Prostate diseases include\nprostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia (“BPH”). Prostate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer affecting men.\nThe annual incidence of newly diagnosed cases in 2023 is estimated to reach 288,300 in the United States according to the American\nCancer Society and in 2020 there were approximately 475,000 newly diagnosed cases of prostate cancer in Europe, according to the\nInternational Agency for Research on Cancer. The American Cancer Society further estimates that there are approximately 5.8 million\nmen living with prostate cancer in these two geographic regions. Although ten-year survival outcomes for prostate cancer remain\nfavorable, it is still one of most common causes of cancer deaths among men. BPH is a histologic diagnosis that refers to the proliferation\nof smooth muscle and epithelial cells within the prostatic transition zone. According to the American Urological Association, BPH is nearly\nubiquitous in the aging male population with worldwide autopsy proven histological prevalence increases starting at ages 40 to 45 years,\nreaching 60% at age 60 and 80% at age 80.\nProfound initiated the commercial launch of its lead product, the TULSA-PRO® system in the United States in Q4 2019, treating the first\npatient in a non-trial setting in January 2020. On June 2, 2023, Profound Medical announced new CPT Category 1 Codes from the\nAmerican Medical Association (“AMA”) for TULSA to treat prostate diseases, which will be effective January 1, 2025. In addition, Profound\ncontinues to support additional clinical trials in the United States and abroad to further increase the body of clinical evidence that may be\nneeded particularly for reimbursement and coverage of its technologies by private and government healthcare providers. The Company\ncontinues to expand the compatibility of its TULSA-PRO® system with additional MRI brands to broaden its ability to utilize the global MRI\ninstalled base and seek regulatory approvals of its products in additional international jurisdictions.\nPage 2\nProfound Medical Corp.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023\nIn USD$ (000s)\nProfound’s second product, the Sonalleve® system, is CE marked in the EU for the treatment of uterine fibroids and adenomyotic tissue,\npalliative pain relief associated with bone metastases, treatment of osteoid osteoma, and management of benign desmoid tumors and\nhas also been approved by the regulatory bodies in China and South Korea for non-invasive treatment of uterine fibroids. In late 2020,\nSonalleve® received Humanitarian Device Exemption (“HDE”) approval from the FDA for the treatment of Osteoid Osteoma in the United\nStates. The Sonalleve® system is only compatible with certain Philips MRIs.\nProfound deploys a recurring revenue business model in the United States to market TULSA-PRO®, charging a one-time payment that\nincludes a supply of its one-time-use devices, use of the system, as well as the Company’s customer and technological support (“Genius”)\nservices that support each TULSA center. The Sonalleve® product is marketed primarily outside North America in European and Asian\ncountries, deploying a capital sales model. Outside of North America, Profound generates most of its revenues from its system sales in\nEurope and Asia, where the Company deploys a more traditional hybrid business model, charging for the system separately as a capital\nsale and an additional per patient charge for the one-time-use devices and associated Genius services.\nProfound’s Technology\nTULSA-PRO® and Sonalleve® share the common technological concept of using MRI to enable visualization by the surgeon of desired\ntissue in real time. Both products also use thermal ultrasound technology to gently heat and ablate tissue using the real-time thermometry\ncapability of the MRI.\nTULSA-PRO® delivers its ultrasound energy through a transurethral catheter, a one-time-use device that is placed in the patient’s prostate\nthrough a natural orifice. Focused ultrasound energy is then delivered by the catheter in the shape of a blade. Externally the catheter is\nconnected to a software controlled robotic manipulator that rotates up to 360-degree in a sweeping action to impart thermal energy and\nthus ablation of tissue. The real time temperature measurement of the prostate is coupled with closed loop process control that measures\nthe appropriate amount of ultrasound energy to gently heat the physician-prescribed region of prostate tissue to the target temperature\nto achieve cell kill without boiling or charring the tissue. As a measure to keep the urethra within the prostate viable, the temperature of\nthe transurethral catheter is maintained at an appropriate level by circulating water inside the catheter. Similarly, a water-cooled specially\ndesigned catheter is placed in the patient’s rectum during the ablation process to keep it protected from thermal damage during the\nprocedure. The TULSA-PRO in conjunction with its Thermal Boost module, enables surgeons to temporarily increase the ablation target\ntemperature in prostate regions where advanced stage cancer might reside, further increasing their confidence that aggressive cancer\ncells have been ablated. Profound believes that TULSA-PRO®’s controlled and relatively gentle heating process may result in lower post\nprocedural pain and complications, reduced potential of life affecting side effects, and in significantly desirable shrinkage of the prostate\nvia resorption of the dead tissue over time, which may provide a longer-term durable benefit.\nSonalleve® delivers its ultrasound energy via a disc located outside the patient. Its ultrasound energy is focused to create small cylindrical\nhot spots a certain distance into the patient. Overlapping cylinders create ablation of the physician-prescribed desired tissue. Similar to\nTULSA-PRO, Sonalleve® also provides for controlled temperature increases to achieve cell kill.\nThe physician is in charge of using the Profound devices and decides which tissue needs to be ablated to impart therapeutic effect.\nProfound believes that in the hands of trained physicians, its systems have the ability to provide customizable, incision-free ablative\ntherapies with the precision of real-time MRI visualization and thermometry, focused ultrasound and closed-loop temperature feedback\ncontrol. Profound believes that its technology offers clinicians and appropriate patients a better alternative to traditional surgical or\nradiation therapies, with respect to clinical outcomes, side effects and recovery time.\nTULSA-PRO®\nThe TULSA-PRO® system is designed to provide precise, flexible and durable ablation of a surgeon defined region of the prostate while\nactively protecting the urethra and rectum to help preserve the patient’s natural functional abilities. To date, over 3,000 global TULSA-\nPRO® procedures have been performed by more than 100 physicians at over 30 commercial and 20 clinical research sites.\nClinical Studies\nIn March 2014, Profound completed enrollment and treatment of 30 patients in the Phase I TULSA multi-jurisdictional safety and precision\nstudy. Based on the Phase I clinical trial results, in April 2016, Profound received a CE Certificate of Conformity for the TULSA-PRO®\nsystem from its notified body in the EU, and in the fourth quarter of 2016, Profound initiated a pilot commercial launch of TULSA-PRO®\nin key European markets where the CE mark is accepted.\nProfound received FDA clearance for the TULSA-PRO® system in August 2019 for transurethral ultrasound ablation of prostate tissue,\nbased on the Company’s TACT Pivotal Clinical Trial. The TACT Pivotal Clinical Trial is a prospective, open-label, single-arm pivotal\nPage 3\nProfound Medical Corp.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023\nIn USD$ (000s)\nclinical study, of 115 treatment-naïve localized prostate cancer patients across 13 research sites in the United States, Canada and\nEurope, which enrolled patients between August 2016 and February 2018.\nLocalized Prostate Cancer, Ablation Safety and Efficacy: TACT Pivotal Study\nThe TACT Pivotal Clinical Trial demonstrates that MRI-guided TULSA is a minimally invasive procedure for effective prostate cancer\nablation with a favorable side effect profile, minimal impact on quality of life and low rates of residual disease1. In the large, multi-center\nprospective study in men with predominately intermediate-risk prostate cancer, whole gland ablation sparing the urethra and apical\nsphincter with the TULSA-PRO® met its primary regulatory endpoint of prostate-specific antigen (“PSA”) reduction in 96% of men to a\nmedian nadir of 0.34 ng/ml and 0.5 ng/ml at 12 months. Median decrease in perfused prostate volume as assessed by a central radiologist\nusing 12-month MRI was 91%, from a median 37 cc to 2.8 cc. At 12 months, extensive biopsy sampling of the markedly reduced prostate\nvolume demonstrated a benefit for nearly 80% of men. There was no evidence of cancer in 65% of men and 14% had low-volume\nclinically-insignificant disease. The authors, however, noted that thermally-fixed non-viable cells can retain their apparently-malignant\ntissue morphology, confounding Gleason grading and potentially introducing false positives2. By two and five years, 7% and 21%,\nrespectively, of men sought additional treatment for their prostate cancer (prostatectomy, radiation). The study patient population, with\ntwo-thirds of those with Gleason Grade Group (GGG) ≥ 2 having either bilateral disease or at least five positive cores, allowed for\nevaluation of oncologically relevant secondary outcomes including PSA stability, post-treatment biopsy, and salvage treatment.\nNotwithstanding the limitations of comparisons between ablative and extirpative therapies, the 21% 5-year rate of salvage treatment and\n20% rate of residual clinically significant prostate cancer in intermediate-risk patients are in line with accepted rates of early failure or\nadditional intervention after standard treatments and goals for retreatment after ablative therapies. By five years, the median PSA nadir\nfurther reduced to 0.26 ng/ml. PSA reduction was durable over the extended follow-up period, from 0.53 ng/ml at one year to 0.63 ng/ml\nat five years.\nTULSA was associated with a high degree of safety and maintenance of quality-of-life, durable to five years, comparing favorably to\nradical prostatectomy and other whole-gland ablation techniques. At 12 months, 96% of men returned to baseline urinary continence,\nand 75% of potent men maintained or returned to erections sufficient for penetration, with these rates remaining stable or further improving\nto five years. A total of 12 grade 3 adverse events occurred in 8% of men, including genitourinary infection (4%), urethral stricture (2%),\nurinary retention (1.7%), urethral calculus and pain (1%), and urinoma (1%), all resolved by 12 months. There were no grade 4 events,\nrectal injuries, severe incontinence requiring surgical intervention, or severe erectile dysfunction unresponsive to medication.\nLocalized Prostate Cancer, Durability of Outcomes: Phase I Safety and Precision Study\nThe Phase I Clinical Trial demonstrates that MRI-guided TULSA is safe and precise for ablation in patients with localized prostate cancer,\nproviding spatial ablation precision of ± 1.3 mm with a well-tolerated side-effect profile and minor or no impact on urinary, erectile and\nbowel function at 12 months3. There were no grade 4 or higher adverse events, one transient attributable grade 3 event (epididymitis),\nand notably no injury to rectal or periprostatic structures. Functional outcomes, International Prostate Symptom Score (“IPSS”) and IIEF-\n15, both showed a favorable anticipated trend of initial deterioration with subsequent gradual improvement toward baseline levels.\nConsistent with the conservative whole-gland treatment plan which included a 3 mm circumferential margin expected to spare 10% viable\nprostate at the gland periphery, intra-operative MRI thermometry measured 90% thermal ablation of the prostate gland, median PSA\ndecreased 90% from 5.8 ng/ml to nadir of 0.6 ng/ml, and median prostate volume reduced by 88% on 1-year MRI. Prostate biopsy at one\nyear identified decreased cancer burden with 61% reduction in cancer length; however, attributable to the circumferential safety margin,\nclinically significant cancer in 9 of 29 men (31%), and any cancer in 16 of 29 (55%).\nFollow-up data to three and five years demonstrate durability of the outcomes, with continued treatment safety and stable quality of life,\nas well as predictable PSA and biopsy oncological outcomes based on treatment-day imaging and early PSA follow-up, without precluding\nany potential salvage therapy options4. Repeat prostate biopsy at three years demonstrated durable histological outcomes, with only one\nsubject upgrading to GGG 1 from negative at 12 months, and one subject upgrading to GGG 2 from GGG 1 at 12 months. Between one\nand five years, there were no new serious adverse events. By five years, 16 men completed protocol follow-up, three withdrew with PSA\n<0.4 ng/ml, 10 had salvage therapy without complications (six prostatectomy, three radiation and one laser ablation), and one died of an\n1 Klotz et al, “MRI-guided transurethral ultrasound ablation of prostate cancer,” The Journal of Urology, 2020\n2 Anttinen et al, “Histopathological evaluation of prostate specimens after thermal ablation may be confounded by the presence of thermally-fixed cells,”\nInternational Journal of Hyperthermia, 2019\n3 Chin et al, “Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Guided Transurethral Ultrasound Ablation of Prostate Tissue in Patients with Localized Prostate Cancer: A Prospective\nPhase 1 Clinical Trial,” European Urology, 2016; Bonekamp et al, “Twelve-month prostate volume reduction after MRI-guided transurethral ultrasound ablation of the\nprostate,” European Radiology, 2018\n4 Nair et al, “MRI-Guided Transurethral Ultrasound Ablation in Patients with Localized Prostate Cancer: Three Year Outcomes of a Prospective Phase I Study”, BJU\nInternational, 2020; Nair et al, “PD17-03 Five-Year Outcomes from a Prospective Phase I Study of MRI-Guided Transurethral Ultrasound Ablation in Men with\nLocalized Prostate Cancer”, AUA 2020 Virtual Experience, Abstract in The Journal of Urology, 2020; Hatiboglu et al, “Durability of functional outcomes after MRI-\nguided transurethral ultrasound ablation of the prostate,” JU Open Plus, 2023.\nPage 4\nProfound Medical Corp.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023\nIn USD$ (000s)\nunrelated cause. Of 16 men with complete follow-up data, five-year median PSA remained at 0.55 ng/ml. Median IPSS of 6 at baseline\nreturned to 5 by three months, and 6.5 at five years. At baseline, 9 of 16 had erections sufficient for penetration, 11 of 16 at one year,\nand 7 of 16 at five years. All 16 subjects had leak-free, pad-free continence at one and five years. Predictors of salvage therapy included\nlower ablation coverage and higher PSA nadir. At five years after TULSA, cancer specific survival is 100%, and overall survival 97%.\nBenign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH), Relief of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS): Phase I Studies\nPromising safety and feasibility of the TULSA-PRO® to relieve Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (“LUTS”) associated with BPH has been\ndemonstrated in two clinical studies showing improvements in IPSS comparable to modern minimally invasive surgical therapies5. A\nretrospective analysis of a sub-group of nine men from the Phase I localized prostate cancer study who also had LUTS (baseline IPSS ≥\n12) demonstrated significant IPSS improvement of 58% from 16.1 to 6.3 at 12 months (p=0.003), with at least a moderate (≥ 6 points)\nsymptom reduction in eight of nine patients. IPSS Quality of Life (“QoL”) improved in eight of nine patients. Erectile function (IIEF-EF)\nremained stable from 14.6 at baseline to 15.7 at 12 months. The proportion of patients with erections sufficient for penetration was\nunchanged. Full urinary continence (pad-free, leak-free) was achieved at 12 months in all patients. In five men who suffered from more\nsevere symptoms (baseline IPSS ≥ 12 and Qmax < 15 ml/s), peak urine flow rate (“Qmax”) increased from 11.6 ml/s to 22.5 ml/s at 12\nmonths. All adverse events were mild to moderate with no serious events reported.\nA prospective Phase I/II study of TULSA-PRO® for BPH has been conducted with early outcomes published in 20226. All measures of\nurinary function and quality of life improved during the initial twelve-month follow up among the first ten patients treated, while no adverse\neffects were seen on sexual and bowel functions: average IPSS decreased from 17.5 to 4.0, IPSS QoL decreased from 4.0 to 0.5, and\nQmax increased from 12.4 ml/s to 21.8 ml/s, among several other improved urinary measures. A single serious adverse event had\noccurred, abscess of the epididymis requiring drainage at two weeks post therapy. Enrollment of this study has been increased to 30\npatients.\nRadio-recurrent localized prostate cancer, Salvage TULSA (sTULSA): Phase I Study\nSalvage ablation of radio-recurrent localized prostate cancer has been evaluated in a prospective Phase I/II study of TULSA-PRO® with\nearly outcomes published in 20207. The report includes the first eleven patients from a 40-patient study, who were successfully treated,\nand discharged on the first postoperative day, with median catheterization time of seven days. Median PSA decreased from 7.6 ng/ml at\nbaseline to a nadir of 0.2 ng/ml and was 0.23 ng/ml at 12 months. At 12 months, 10/11 patients were free of any PCa in the targeted\nablation zone, confirmed with biopsy and imaging (MRI and PSMA-PET), and had low and stable PSA. Four patients had prolonged\ncatheterization and subsequent urinary tract infection, and one of these patients had upper urinary tract dilation treated with double-J-\nstents.\nPalliation of symptomatic locally advanced prostate cancer, Palliative TULSA (pTULSA): Phase I Study\nPatients with symptomatic locally advanced prostate cancer can suffer from severe urinary retention due to bladder outlet obstruction,\nintractable hematuria and frequent hospitalization. While these complications are commonly treated by palliative transurethral resection\nof the prostate (“TURP”), the improvement is often insufficient and may exclude patients who cannot discontinue anticoagulants. The\nsafety and feasibility of MRI-guided TULSA was evaluated as an alternative palliative treatment option for men suffering from symptomatic\nlocally advanced prostate cancer8. Ten patients with locally advanced prostate cancer were enrolled, half with clinical stage T4 disease\nand half with clinical T3. Prior to TULSA, all patients had continuous indwelling catheterization due to urinary retention, and 90% had\nhistory of recurrent and/or ongoing gross hematuria. Three patients had palliative TURP performed six months prior to receiving palliative\nTULSA, all of which were unsuccessful. One week after palliative TULSA, 50% of men were catheter-free. At last follow-up, 100% of men\nwere free of gross hematuria, and 80% had an improvement in catheterization, with 70% completely catheter-free. Notably, the average\nhospitalization time from local complications reduced from 7.3 to 1.4 days in the six-month period before and after palliative TULSA. All\nadverse events were related to urinary tract infections, with two patients requiring intravenous administration of antibiotics and three\npatients resolved with oral antibiotics alone. No other treatment related adverse events were recorded, with no rectal injury or fistula.\nFurther, there was no need for blood transfusions and there was no perioperative mortality.\n5 Elterman et al, “Relief of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms after MRI-Guided Transurethral Ultrasound Ablation (TULSA) for localized prostate cancer: Subgroup\nAnalyses in Patients with concurrent cancer and Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,” Journal of Endourology, 2020; Anttinen et al, “Transurethral ultrasound therapy for\nbenign prostatic obstruction in humans,” EAU 2020 Conference Presentation\n6 Viitala et al, “Magnetic resonance imaging-guided transurethral ultrasound ablation for benign prostatic hyperplasia: 12-month clinical outcomes of a phase I\nstudy,” BJU Int, 2022.\n7 Anttinen et al, “Salvage Magnetic Resonance Imaging–guided Transurethral Ultrasound Ablation for Localized Radiorecurrent Prostate Cancer: 12-Month Functional\nand Oncological Results,” European Urology Open Science, 2020.\n8 Anttinen et al, “Palliative MRI-guided transurethral ultrasound ablation for symptomatic locally advanced prostate cancer,” Scandinavian Journal of Urology, 2020\nPage 5\nProfound Medical Corp.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023\nIn USD$ (000s)\nCAPTAIN Trial\nCAPTAIN (A Comparison of TULSA Procedure vs. Radical Prostatectomy in Participants with Localized Prostate Cancer) is a prospective,\nmulti-centre randomized controlled trial of 201 patients aimed at comparing the safety and efficacy of the TULSA procedure (performed\nwith the TULSA-PRO® system) with radical prostatectomy (“RP”) in men with organ-confined, intermediate-risk, Gleason Score 7 (Grade\nGroup 2 and 3) prostate cancer. In the CAPTAIN trial, 134 patients will be randomized to receive one or two TULSA procedures and 67\npatients will be randomized to receive RP. The trial takes place primarily in the United States, with an additional two sites in Canada and\none in Europe. Of those, seventeen sites have been activated to date and are currently recruiting patients.\nRP is currently the gold-standard surgical treatment for intermediate-risk prostate cancer. RP effectively controls disease but carries risk\nof significant side effects such as long-term erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence. The TULSA procedure combines transurethral,\nrobotically-driven therapeutic ultrasound with real-time visualization of temperature and automated control of heating from magnetic\nresonance thermometry. The high spatial, thermal, and anatomic resolution of the target volume enables precise ablation of prostate\ntissue while sparing functionally important structures, potentially reducing the risk of side effects relative to RP.\nThe goal of the CAPTAIN trial is to demonstrate that the efficacy of the TULSA procedure is not inferior to RP, while demonstrating\nsuperior quality of life outcomes in patients receiving the TULSA procedure as compared to those patients receiving RP. The primary\nsafety endpoint is the proportion of patients who preserve both erectile potency and urinary continence at one year after treatment. The\nprimary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of patients who are free from any additional treatment for prostate cancer by three years after\ntreatment. Secondary endpoints include comparison of rates of complications, cost effectiveness, and timing of the return to baseline\nactivity. Long-term follow-up will be gathered for up to 10 years after treatment.\nSonalleve®\nProfound’s Sonalleve® system combines real-time MRI and thermometry with focused ultrasound delivered from the outside of the patient\nto enable customized incision-free ablation of diseased tissue. Profound acquired the Sonalleve® technology from Philips in 2017.\nThe Sonalleve® system is CE marked in the EU for the treatment of uterine fibroids, adenomyotic tissue, palliative pain treatment of bone\nmetastases, osteoid osteoma and management of benign tumors. The uterine fibroids application is also available for sale in Canada. In\n2018, the Sonalleve® system was also approved in China by the National Medical Products Administration for the non-invasive treatment\nof uterine fibroids and by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety in South Korea. Philips Oy registered Sonalleve® in several Middle East,\nNorth African, and South Asian countries. In 2020, Sonalleve® also received HDE from the US FDA for treatment of Osteoid Osteoma.\nSonalleve® Clinical Applications\nUterine Fibroids and Adenomyosis\nUterine fibroids are the most common non-cancerous tumors in women of childbearing age. Both surgical and medical treatments are\navailable, and the choice depends on number, size, and location of uterine fibroids, patient’s age and preferences, and pregnancy\nexpectations. To date, symptomatic uterine fibroids have been mostly treated with radical surgery (hysterectomy) in women who have\ncompleted childbearing, or conservative surgery (myomectomy and endometrial ablation) in women who wish to preserve fertility. Today,\nthe radiologist also has interventional options available. Minimally or non-invasive interventional radiology procedures include uterine\nartery embolization.\nThere is currently no ideal treatment for adenomyosis, and new options are needed. Drawing on experience of treatment of uterine\nfibroids, MR-High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (“MR-HIFU”) has been explored as a potential new conservative treatment and MR-HIFU\nis an early-stage, non-invasive, therapeutic technology with the potential to improve the QoL and decrease the cost of care for patients\nwith adenomyosis.\nTo achieve its current regulatory clearances, the Sonalleve® MR-HIFU System has undergone several studies and clinical trials for uterine\napplications at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Center (Toronto, Ontario), University Medical Center Utrecht (Utrecht, the Netherlands),\nNational Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD, USA), St. Luke’s Episcopal Hospital (Houston, TX, USA), University Hospital St. André\n(Bordeaux, France), Samsung Medical Center (Seoul, Korea), Peking University First Hospital Beijing (Beijing, China), First Affiliated\nHospital of Medical College of Xi’an Jiaotong University (Xi’an, China), and Turku University Hospital (Turku, Finland), amongst others.\nIn addition, a comprehensive literature review provides supportive evidence showcasing the beneficial action of MR-HIFU in uterine fibroid\nand adenomyosis therapy. These studies include the Verpalen et al. 2020, Nguyen 2020, Yeo et al. 2017, Kim et al. 2017, and Hocquelet\net al. 2017 that utilized the Sonalleve® MR-HIFU System. Specifically, the studies show impressive performance in terms of ablation\nefficiency, therapeutic efficacy, symptom reduction, and/or QoL improvement. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events\nPage 6\nProfound Medical Corp.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023\nIn USD$ (000s)\nin any of these studies, although Browne et al. 2020 describes a procedure-related major complication in the form of deep vein thrombosis\nthat was noted in one patient (0.8%) and subsequently and successfully treated with anticoagulation therapy. Minor adverse events, when\npresent, typically include 1st and 2nd degree skin burns, local swelling, cramps, leg pain, abdominal pain, buttock pain, and back pain,\nwhich are all known and anticipated adverse events of MR-HIFU therapy.\nPalliative Bone Pain Treatment\nPain caused by bone metastases is common in the event of malignancy and is inevitably associated with serious complications that may\ndeteriorate the QoL of patients and become life threatening.\nFor patients with bone metastases, clinical evaluation reports were completed in October 2020, showing significant decrease in pain\nscore and/or dosage of medication and increase in QoL are to be expected with MR-HIFU bone therapy. The randomized controlled\nPhase III study by Hurwitz et al. represents some of the most important clinical data that has been reported. In 112 subjects receiving\nMR-HIFU compared against 35 subjects receiving sham treatment, significant pain reduction at three months (decrease in worst NRS\npain ≥ 2 without increase in pain medication) was 64.3% vs. 20.0% (p<0.001), with mean Numeric Pain Scale (“NRS”) reduction of 3.6 ±\n3.1 vs. 0.7 ± 2.4 from an initial median NRS score of 7.0 in both groups. Improvement in average Brief Pain Inventory-Quality of Life at\nthree months was 2.4 points superior in the MR-HIFU group (p<0.001), representing a clinically important reduction in impairment caused\nby bone metastasis pain.\nThe clinical data above shows that patients with bone metastases can expect a statistically significant decrease in pain scores and/or in\nmedication dosage and increase in quality of life with MR-HIFU bone metastasis therapy.\nOsteoid Osteoma Treatment\nOsteoid osteoma is a relatively rare, painful bone tumor that typically occurs in the cortex of long bones, especially in children and\nadolescents, and accounts for approximately 10% of all benign bone tumors.\nCurrent osteoid osteoma treatment options include surgery and radiofrequency ablation (“RFA”), which is a less invasive option than\nsurgical resection. Although RFA can have a high success rate, the treatment is invasive and can potentially cause minor and major\ncomplications. It also exposes patients and operators to ionizing radiation associated with the CT imaging guidance.\nSonalleve® MR-HIFU provides an optimal therapy choice for osteoid osteoma which is a precise, completely non-invasive, and free from\nionizing radiation treatment. The recent studies have assessed the use of Sonalleve® MR-HIFU in treatment of osteoid osteoma, showing\na high clinical success rate and complete symptom resolution without any serious adverse effects and only few minor adverse effects\nthat promptly resolve. The Sonalleve® MR-HIFU device offers a novel, minimally invasive, MRI-guided method to treat osteoid osteoma\nsafely and effectively. A desmoid tumor, also called desmoid fibromatosis or aggressive fibromatosis, is a non-metastasizing but locally\naggressive proliferation of myofibroblasts that affects children and adults, with a peak incidence in early adulthood. Traditional\nmanagement of desmoid tumors includes observation, surgical resection, radiation, and/or chemotherapy. Observation allows\nassessment of the rate of tumor growth and may be acceptable in small, slow-growing, or asymptomatic lesions. Surgical resection is\noften a highly morbid procedure and has a high rate of recurrence even with negative margins. Radiotherapy provides somewhat improved\nlocal control rates but the morbidity from radiation, including burns, fibrosis, chronic edema, and pathologic fractures, is problematic. In\naddition, the small but finite risk of a radiation-induced malignancy is particularly troublesome in this young patient population, considering\nthe tumor being treated is benign.\nRecently, MR-HIFU has been assessed as a non-invasive therapy of desmoid tumors, showing good clinical success and even complete\ntumor eradication in some cases with low number and relative mild adverse events, which typically promptly resolve. The Sonalleve® MR-\nHIFU device offers a novel, non-invasive, MRI-guided method to treat desmoid tumors.\nThis technology is ideally suited for the treatment of desmoid tumors in a patient population that is generally young, otherwise healthy,\nand would like to avoid the morbidity of traditional surgical, radiation, and medical therapies for a benign disease. Magnetic resonance\nimaging provides visualization of critical neurovascular structures and allows sparing of these structures during therapy. While complete\nablation of a desmoid tumor may not be possible in all cases because of involvement of these structures, significant reduction in tumor\nvolume is often obtained with a corresponding improvement in pain and functional impairment. As the natural history of the disease often\ninvolves recurrence, the ability to re-treat with MR-HIFU without an upper dose limit is also an advantage. The clinical evidence to date\ndemonstrates that MR-HIFU provides a safe and effective treatment of desmoid tumors.\nPage 7\nProfound Medical Corp.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023\nIn USD$ (000s)\nBusiness Update and Sales Strategy\nProfound initiated its launch of the TULSA-PRO® system in the United States in Q4 2019 and the first patient was treated in the United\nStates in a non-clinical trial setting in January 2020. Since then, Profound’s business model has evolved to a recurring revenue model\nthat includes durable hardware usage, one-time-use devices and Profound’s Genius services, which includes necessary support for a\nproductive start-up of the practice.\nProfound has generated revenues from capital sales, one-time-use devices and related services, in the EU (principally in Germany) and\nAsia. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, approximately 55%, 22% and 23% of revenues were generated in the United States, EU\nand Asia, respectively, compared to approximately 68%, 28% and 4% of revenues which were generated in the United States, EU and\nAsia, respectively for the six months ended June 30, 2023. Revenue on a quarter over quarter basis is expected to fluctuate given the\nCompany is maintaining a limited European commercial effort and remains primarily focused on the US market.\nProfound’s TULSA-PRO® system is primarily marketed to early adopter physicians who specialize in treatment of prostate disease\nincluding urologists and radiologists at opinion leading hospitals. TULSA-PRO® services are available at either independent imaging\ncenters or at hospital-based imaging centers.\nHistorically, treatment of conditions such as localized prostate disease and uterine fibroids have included surgical intervention. Over time,\nsurgery has evolved from an ‘open’ technique, to laparoscopic, to robotic surgery. The motivation of surgeons behind this evolution has\nbeen to perform procedures that reduce invasiveness, improve clinical outcomes and reduce recovery times. Profound is seeking to take\nthis concept to the next level by enabling customizable, incision-free therapies for the MRI-guided ablation of diseased tissue with the\nTULSA-PRO® and Sonalleve® systems. These incision-free and radiation-free procedures offer surgeons the option of providing\npredictable and customizable procedures that eliminate invasiveness, offer the potential to improve clinical outcomes and further reduce\nhospital stays and patient recovery times.\nProfound is establishing its own direct sales and marketing teams for sales of TULSA-PRO® systems and the one-time-use devices\nrelated thereto, as well as for Sonalleve® systems in the jurisdictions where it is approved. The primary focus of Profound’s direct sales\nteam is to cultivate adoption of the TULSA-PRO® technology, support clinical customers with the TULSA-PRO® procedures and increase\nthe utilization of the systems and one-time-use devices. Profound expects to generate recurring revenues from the use of the system,\none-time-use devices, clinical support and service maintenance.\nOn January 21, 2019, the Company entered into an agreement with Siemens (the “Siemens Agreement”). Under the Siemens\nAgreement, there is a one-time fixed license fee and per annum payments calculated based on annual volume of Profound’s systems\nthat are interfaced to a Siemens MRI scanner. The initial term of the Siemens Agreement is five years and will be automatically extended\nfor successive one-year terms thereafter unless terminated earlier. The Company also obtained a non-exclusive license to Siemens\nAccess I interface software and reasonable support for the term of the Siemens Agreement.\nOn December 21, 2020, Profound signed the GE Agreement to expand provider access to TULSA-PRO®. Pursuant to the terms of the\nGE Agreement, Profound has been supplied with additional information to utilize the ExSI interface, which has allowed Profound to\ninterface with GE MRI scanners and GE is helping support the development efforts of Profound to achieve compatibility with its GE MRI\nscanners which was achieved on March 1, 2022 when the Company signed the first site agreement for a Tulsa-PRO® system interfaced\nwith a GE scanner.\nOn February 8, 2024, Profound entered into a non-exclusive collaboration with Siemens Healthineers, aimed at laying the groundwork\nfor Profound to begin marketing a complete therapeutics solution, combining its TULSA-PRO® system with the MAGNETOM Free.Max\nmagnetic resonance scanner from Siemens Healthineers, via Profound’s own sales force. Profound will continue to market TULSA-\nPRO® as a stand-alone offering, providing its customers with the flexibility to use the technology with the MR hardware of their choice.\nCompetition\nTULSA-PRO®\nThe TULSA-PRO® system is intended to ablate benign and malignant prostate tissue, however there are other treatment options for\nprostate disease. There are currently no marketed devices indicated for the treatment of prostate diseases or prostate cancer and\nProfound’s FDA indication and CE mark in the EU also do not include treatment of any particular disease or condition. However, there\nare a number of devices indicated for the destruction or removal of prostate tissue and devices indicated for use in performing surgical\nprocedures that physicians and surgeons currently utilize when treating patients with prostate disease, including prostate cancer.\nApproaches that physicians and surgeons currently use to address prostate disease include: (1) watchful waiting/active surveillance; (2)\nPage 8\nProfound Medical Corp.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023\nIn USD$ (000s)\nsimple prostatectomy; (3) radical prostatectomy (includes open, laparoscopic and robotic procedures); (4) radiation therapies including,\nexternal beam radiation therapy, brachytherapy and high dose radiation; (5) cryoablation; and (6) trans-rectal high intensity focused\nultrasound (“HIFU”). In addition, certain adjunct or less common procedures are used or are under development to address prostate\ndisease, such as androgen deprivation therapy and proton beam therapy.\nEach of the foregoing competing options have their own limitations and benefits and may only be appropriate for limited patient\npopulations. For example, active surveillance is generally recommended for patients who have been diagnosed with earlier stage, lower\nrisk, disease where the possibility of side effects from intervention may outweigh the expected benefit of the chosen procedure. For\nclinicians and patients, the gap between active surveillance and the most commonly utilized options of radical prostatectomy or radiation\ntherapy, imposes the possibility of substantial side effects, creating a need for a less invasive methodology to remove diseased prostate\ntissue that is both radiation and incision-free, provides a more favorable side-effect profile, and allows for safe and effective salvage\ntreatment options if required in the future.\nProfound believes that the flexibility of the TULSA-PRO® system may allow the Company to demonstrate its use as a tool for ablating\nbenign and malignant diseased prostate tissue with greater speed and precision than current options while minimizing potential side\neffects. Profound believes that the TULSA-PRO® system may overcome certain limitations of other devices and methodologies for\nremoving or addressing diseased prostate tissue including HIFU, such as complications associated with trans-rectal delivery and\nlimitations relating to prostate size and total ablation volume. Profound believes that a transurethral (inside out) ablation approach with\nmillimeter accuracy has advantages over HIFU in ablating the whole gland safely, as well as ablating larger prescribed treatment plans\nfor patients with multi-focal disease, BPH, and those who have prostate cancer concurrent with BPH.\nSonalleve®\nThe treatment choices for uterine fibroids usually depend on the symptoms of the patient, size of the fibroid, desire for future pregnancy\nand preference of the treating gynecologist. The most common treatment options for uterine fibroids include: (1) hormonal medications\nincluding gonadotrophin releasing hormone agonists; (2) progesterone releasing intra-uterine devices; (3) surgical procedures such as\nhysterectomy and myomectomy; and (4) uterine artery embolization. Profound believes that the Sonalleve® system may provide a\ntreatment option that is more convenient and comfortable with fewer side effects than hormonal medications or surgical procedures, such\nas hysterectomy or myomectomy.\nReimbursement\nProfound’s ability to successfully commercialize the Company’s products depends in large part on the extent to which coverage and\nadequate reimbursement for such products and related treatments or procedures will be available from government health administration\nauthorities, government and private health insurers, and other organizations or third-party payors. Pricing and reimbursement procedures\nand decisions vary from country to country. Many government health authorities and private payors condition payment on the cost-\neffectiveness of the product. Even if a device is FDA cleared or CE marked or has received other regulatory clearance or approval, there\nis no guarantee that third-party payors will reimburse providers or patients for the cost of the device and related procedures or that the\namount of such reimbursement will be adequate to cover the cost of the device. The availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement\nto hospitals and clinicians using Profound’s products therefore is important to its ability to generate revenue and Profound plans to pursue\ncoverage and reimbursement for the Company’s products in the key markets where the Company has regulatory approvals. Successful\ncommercialization of the Company’s approved products will also depend on the cost of the system and the availability of coverage and\nadequate reimbursement from third-party payors.\nOn July 11, 2024, it was announced that U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) has issued its proposed rules\nestablishing, for the first time, a Category 1 CPT code for the TULSA procedure, effective January 1, 2025.\nAccording to the proposed rule, TULSA will have 3 physician codes to cover how therapy is delivered depending on if there are one or\ntwo physicians involved in the procedure: 5x006 TULSA Device Management and 5x007 TULSA Treatment, when two physicians are\ninvolved in the procedure, and 5x008 TULSA Complete Procedure, when performed by a single physician. TULSA will have a 0-day\nglobal period, indicating that the payment associated with the codes will only cover the work performed on the day TULSA is performed.\nPhysicians will thereby bill for any pre or post patient visit separately using existing codes. This will provide physicians with the most\nflexibility to assess the appropriate number of visits needed by each patient and enable their safe and fast recovery. TULSA codes have\nalso been assigned to all three sites of service: Hospital Outpatient (“HOPD”), Ambulatory Surgical Center (“ASC”), and Private\nOffice/Non-Facility (“OBL”). The spectrum of the location of service will ensure patients can be treated in whatever setting they and their\nphysician believe appropriate and convenient for each patient.\nFor Hospital Payment, the proposed rule has established TULSA as a Level 6 Urology Ambulatory Payment Classification (“APC”) for\n2025 for 5x008 of $9 (National Average). For ASCs, the facility payment for 5x008 will be $7 (National Average).\nPage 9\nProfound Medical Corp.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023\nIn USD$ (000s)\nThe Proposed Rule for the Physician Fee Schedule has set the total Facility (HOPD or ASC) Relative Value Units (“RVU”) at 6.53 for\nTULSA Device Management 5x006 and 14.68 RVU for the TULSA Treatment Physician 5x007 when 2 physicians are involved in the\nTULSA procedure.

The Sonalleve® product is marketed primarily outside North America in European and Asian countries deploying\na one-time capital sales model with limited recurring service revenue. Outside of North America, Profound generates most of its revenues\nfrom its system sales (both TULSA-PRO® and Sonalleve®) in Europe and Asia where the Company deploys a more traditional hybrid\nbusiness model, charging for the system separately as capital and an additional per patient charge for the one-time-use devices and\nassociated Genius services. Revenue is comprised of recurring – non-capital revenue, which consists of the sale of one-time-use devices,\nlease of medical devices, procedures and services associated with extended warranties and one-time sale of capital equipment.\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Company recorded revenue totaling $2,233 with $773 from the one-time sale of capital\nequipment and $1,460 coming from recurring – non-capital revenue. For the three months ended June 30, 2023, the Company recorded\nrevenue totaling $1,602 with $1,602 all coming from recurring – non-capital revenue. The increase in revenue for the three months ended\nJune 30, 2024, was a result of higher capital sales. Revenue on a quarter over quarter basis is expected to fluctuate in the near term\ngiven the Company is maintaining a limited European commercial effort and remains focused primarily on the US market which continues\nto see growth quarter over quarter.\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company recorded revenue totaling $4,143 with $1,201 from the one-time sale of capital\nequipment and $2,942 from recurring – non-capital revenue, which consists of the sale of one-time-use devices, lease of medical devices,\nprocedures and services associated with extended warranties. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company recorded revenue\ntotaling $3,462 with $393 from the one-time sale of capital equipment and $3,069 from recurring – non-capital revenue, which consists of\nthe sale of one-time-use devices, lease of medical devices, procedures and services associated with extended warranties. The increase\nin revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2024, was the result of higher capital sales.\nCost of sales\nCost of sales includes cost of finished goods, inventory provisions, warranty, freight and manufacturing overhead expenses.\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Company recorded cost of sales of $795, related to the sale of medical devices, capital\nand non-capital, which reflects a 64% gross profit margin. For the three months ended June 30, 2023, the Company recorded cost of\nsales of $552, related to the sale of medical devices, capital and non-capital, which reflects a 66% gross profit margin. The gross profit\nmargin was slightly lower in 2024 due to the revenue product mix.\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company recorded cost of sales of $1,436, related to the sale of medical devices, capital\nand non-capital, which reflects a 65% gross profit margin. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company recorded a cost of\nsales of $1,199, related to the sale of medical devices, capital and non-capital, which reflects a 65% gross profit margin. The gross profit\nmargin was consistent for the two periods.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses consist of three components: research and development (“R&D”), general and administrative (“G&A”) and selling\nand distribution expenses. Historically, R&D expenses have exceeded selling and distribution expenses; however, in the future Profound\nexpects selling and distribution expenses to increase as the Company further commercializes the TULSA-PRO® system in the US.\nR&D Expenses\nR&D expenses are comprised of costs incurred in performing R&D activities, including new product development, continuous product\nimprovement, investment in clinical trials and related clinical manufacturing costs, materials and supplies, salaries and benefits, consulting\nfees, patent procurement costs, and occupancy costs related to R&D activity.\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2024, R&D expenses were higher by $1,038 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023.\nMaterial and salaries and benefits increased by $431 and $642, respectively. The increases were due to various R&D projects undertaken\nduring the period which included fixture developments, yield improvements and additional materials for clinical trials, higher headcount\nand lower reimbursement of workforce costs. Offsetting these amounts was a decrease of $36 in share based compensation due to fewer\nawards granted to employees.\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, R&D expenses were higher by $1,131 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023.\nClinical trial costs, materials and salaries and benefits increased by $214, $482 and $656, respectively. The increase in clinical trial costs\nPage 12\nProfound Medical Corp.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023\nIn USD$ (000s)\nwas due to CAPTAIN trial treatments and recruitment efforts, materials expenses were higher due to spending on R&D initiatives for\nfixture development and yield improvements and salaries increased due to higher headcount and lower reimbursement of workforce\ncosts. Offsetting these amounts was a decrease in rent of $113 due to lower MRI time usage and a decrease of $104 to share based\ncompensation due to fewer awards granted to employees.\nG&A expenses\nG&A expenses are comprised of management costs, including salaries and benefits, various management and administrative support\nfunctions, insurance and other operating and occupancy costs.\nG&A expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2024 increased by $29 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023. Salaries\nand benefits increased by $158 due to higher cost of living salary increases. Offsetting this amount was a decrease to insurance expense\nof $34 due to lower premium rates and decrease to consulting fees of $91 due to lower legal and financing fees.\nG&A expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2024 increased by $310 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023. Salaries\nand benefits and consulting fees increased by $236 and $155, respectively, due to higher cost of living salary increases and increased\nlegal and accounting fees. Offsetting these amounts was a decrease in insurance costs of $63 due to lower premium rates and decrease\nto the general office expenses of $22.\nSelling and distribution expenses\nSelling and distribution expenses are comprised of business development costs related to the market development activities and\ncommercialization of the Company’s systems, including salaries and benefits, marketing support functions, occupancy costs related to\nmarketing activity and other miscellaneous marketing costs.\nSelling and distribution expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2024 were higher by $718 compared to the three months ended\nJune 30, 2023. Salaries and benefits, consulting fees and travel increased by $493, $106 and $117, respectively, due to increased\nsalesforce and commission payments, consultants engaged to assist with Veteran Affairs and military sales markets and increased in-\nperson conferences and customer meetings.\nSelling and distribution expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2024 were higher by $1,044 compared to the six months ended June\n30, 2023.

Operating expenses were higher\ndue to the increase in headcount and lower workforce reimbursement from the European ministry of research. In addition, there was an\nincrease in finance income due to the US dollar and Euro foreign currency rate, triggering a foreign exchange gain.\nThe first quarter of 2024 revenue increased compared to the majority of prior quarters as a result of higher US sales from recurring\nrevenue. Operating expenses increased against several of the prior quarters due to additional headcount within sales and distribution\nand expenses associated with the continued TULSA-PRO® commercialization with the US market.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023 revenue continued to increase compared to prior quarters as new sites became operational and increased\npatient procedures. Operating expenses were higher than prior quarters due to ATM offering fees as well as overall increase to the\nsalesforce.\nIn the third quarter of 2023 operating expenses were higher compared to the prior quarter due to increased consulting costs associated\nwith regulatory and foreign consultants for additional approval in other countries. In addition, there was also an increase in finance income\ndue to the US dollar and Euro foreign currency rate, triggering a foreign exchange gain.\nThe second quarter of 2023 revenue was lower compared to the prior quarter due to decreased one-time capital sales. Operating\nexpenses were lower compared to the prior quarters due to decreased share based compensation expenses and lower amortization\nexpenses as a result of intangible assets being fully amortized.\nPage 14\nProfound Medical Corp.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023\nIn USD$ (000s)\nThe first quarter of 2023 cost of sales decreased from the quarterly periods in 2022 as a result of manufacturing operating at a higher\nefficiency rate based on improvements to quality and training that were implemented in the manufacturing process.\nThe fourth quarter of 2022 revenue was lower compared to prior quarters due to decreased one-time capital sales, primarily resulting\nfrom lower capital sales than previous quarters. Operating expenses were higher due to goodwill impairment.\nThe third quarter of 2022 cost of sales decreased as a result of better yields and product quality. In addition, there was also an increase\nin finance income due to the US dollar and Euro foreign currency rates, triggering a foreign exchange gain.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAt June 30, 2024, the Company had cash of $34,079 compared to $26,213 at December 31, 2023.

(“PMI”) entered into a loan agreement with Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (“CIBC”) on November 3, 2022\n(the “CIBC Loan Agreement”), for gross proceeds of C$10,000, maturing on November 3, 2027, with an interest rate based on CIBC\nprime plus 2% (the “CIBC Loan”). The Company was required to make interest-only payments until October 31, 2023, and monthly\nrepayments on the principal of C$208 plus accrued interest commenced on October 31, 2023. All obligations of the Company under the\nCIBC Loan Agreement are guaranteed by current and future subsidiaries of the Company and included security of first priority interests\nin the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries. Initially, the Company had financial covenants in relation to the CIBC loan where\nunrestricted cash is at all times greater than EBITDA for the most recent six-month period, reported on a monthly basis and that revenue\nfor any fiscal quarter must be 15% greater than revenue for the same fiscal quarter in the prior fiscal year, reported on a quarterly basis.\nOn September 26, 2023 an amendment to the CIBC Loan resulted in a change to the financial covenants. The amended covenants are\nthat unrestricted cash must at all times be greater of: (i) to the extent EBITDA is negative for such period, EBITDA for the most recent\nnine-month period or (ii) $7,500, reported on a monthly basis; and that recurring revenue for any fiscal quarter must be 15% greater than\nrecurring revenue for the same fiscal quarter in the prior fiscal year, reported on a quarterly basis. On March 31, 2024, the Company was\nin breach of the second covenant whereby revenue for any fiscal quarter must be 15% greater than revenue for the same fiscal quarter\nin the prior fiscal year. The Company received a waiver from CIBC in relation to this covenant breach.\nOn May 3, 2024, a second amendment to the CIBC Loan resulted in another amendment to the financial covenants. The amended\ncovenants are that the recurring revenue covenant shall not be tested for any fiscal quarter in the 2024 fiscal year so long as unrestricted\ncash is no less than 2.5 multiplied by the principal amount of outstanding CIBC Loan at all times. The Company is in compliance with\nthese financial covenants as at June 30, 2024.\nPage 15\nProfound Medical Corp.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023\nIn USD$ (000s)\nCash Flow\nThe Company manages liquidity risk by monitoring actual and projected cash flows. A cash flow forecast is performed regularly to ensure\nthat the Company has sufficient cash to meet operational needs while maintaining sufficient liquidity. The Company’s cash requirements\ndepend on numerous factors, including market acceptance of the Company’s products, the resources devoted to developing and\nsupporting the products and other factors. Profound expects to continue to devote substantial resources to expand procedure adoption\nand acceptance of the Company’s products.\nThe Company may require additional capital to fund R&D activities and any significant expansion of operations by the second half of the\nyear ending December 31, 2025. Potential sources of capital could include equity and/or debt financings, development agreements or\nmarketing agreements, the collection of revenue resulting from future commercialization activities and/or new strategic partnership\nagreements to fund some or all costs of development. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain the capital\nsufficient to meet any or all of the Company’s needs. The availability of equity or debt financing will be affected by, among other things,\nthe results of R&D, the Company’s ability to obtain regulatory approvals, the market acceptance of the Company’s products, the state of\nthe capital markets generally, strategic alliance agreements and other relevant commercial considerations. In addition, if the Company\nraises additional funds by issuing equity securities, existing security holders will likely experience dilution, and any incurring of\nindebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require the Company to agree to operating and financial\ncovenants that would restrict operations. Any failure on the Company’s part to raise additional funds on terms favourable to the Company\nor at all may require the Company to significantly change or curtail current or planned operations in order to conserve cash until such\ntime, if ever, that sufficient proceeds from operations are generated, and could result in the Company not being in a position to take\nadvantage of business opportunities, in the termination or delay of clinical trials for its products, in curtailment of product development\nprograms designed to identify new products, in the sale or assignment of rights to technologies, product and/or an inability to file market\napproval applications at all or in time to competitively market products.\nThree months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n$ $ $ $\nCash provided by (used in) operating activities (6,350) (5,119) (11,448) (10,942)\nCash provided by (used in) financing activities (675) - 19,708 2,144\nForeign exchange on cash (76) 1,410 (394) 1,556\nNet increase (decrease) in cash (7,101) (3,709) 7,866 (7,242)\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities for the three months ended June 30, 2024 was $(6,350) versus $(5,119) for the three\nmonths ended June 30, 2023.

These measures are defined with reference to the nearest comparable IFRS Accounting\nStandards measure such that a reconciliation to the nearest comparable IFRS Accounting Standards measure can be completed.\nAccordingly, these measures may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Profound uses non-GAAP\nmeasures in order to provide additional financial information to complement the closest IFRS Accounting Standards measures in order\nto provide investors with a further understanding of the Company’s operations from management’s perspective. Investors should not\nconsider that these non-GAAP measures are a substitute for analyses of the financial information that Profound reports under IFRS\nAccounting Standards. Profound uses these non-GAAP measures in order to provide investors with a supplemental measure of its\noperating performance and thus highlight trends in the Company’s business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on\nIFRS Accounting Standards measures.\nThe Company’s working capital (defined as current assets less current liabilities) is a non-GAAP financial measure. Working capital\nis used to fund operations and meet short-term obligations. If the Company has enough working capital, it can continue to pay its\nemployees and suppliers and meet other obligations, such as interest payments and taxes, even if it runs into cash flow challenges. The\nworking capital as at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is set forth in the table below.\nJune 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\n$ $\nCurrent assets 48,490 41,896\nLess: Current liabilities 5,629 6,366\nWorking capital 42,861 35,530\nWorking capital increased by $7,331 with a surplus of $42,861 at June 30, 2024 compared to the surplus of $35,530 at December 31,\n2023. The change in working capital is due to an increase in current assets of $6,594, which was primarily the result of the increase in\nthe cash balance of $7,866 which was offset by decreases in prepaids expenses and deposits of $889. Current liabilities decreased by\n$737 due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and current portion of the long-term debt.\nCOMMITMENTS & CONTINGENCIES\nAll directors and officers of the Company are indemnified by the Company for various items including, but not limited to, all costs to settle\nlawsuits or actions due to their association with the Company, subject to certain restrictions. The Company has purchased directors’ and\nofficers’ liability insurance to mitigate the cost of any potential future lawsuits or actions. The term of the indemnification is not explicitly\ndefined but is limited to events for the period during which the indemnified party served as a director or officer of the Company. The\nmaximum amount of any potential future payment cannot be reasonably estimated but could have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany.\nPage 17\nProfound Medical Corp.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023\nIn USD$ (000s)\nThe Company has also indemnified certain lenders and underwriters in relation to certain debt and equity offerings and their respective\naffiliates and directors, officers, employees, shareholders, partners, advisers and agents and each other person, if any, controlling any of\nthe underwriters or lenders or their affiliates against certain liabilities.\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nThe Company’s financial instruments consist of cash, trade and other receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, derivative\nfinancial instruments, lease liability and long-term debt. The fair values of these financial instruments, approximate carrying value as a\nresult of their short-term nature. Financial assets measured at amortized cost include cash and trade and other receivables. The fair\nvalue of the long-term debt approximates its carrying amount as it has a floating interest rate.\nFinancial liabilities measured at amortized cost include accounts payable and accrued liabilities, long-term debt and lease liability.\nThe Company’s financial instruments are exposed to certain financial risks including credit risk, liquidity risk, currency risk and interest\nrate risk. There have been no significant changes to those risks impacting the Company since December 31, 2023, nor has there been a\nsignificant change in the composition of its financial instruments since December 31, 2023.\nRELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nKey management includes the Company’s directors and senior management team. Additional information on the senior management\nteam can be found in the Company’s AIF. The remuneration of directors and the senior management team were as follows:\nThree months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n$ $ $ $\nSalaries and employee benefits 673 253 1,023 731\nDirectors’ fees 69 75 138 156\nShare-based compensation 485 577 1,027 1,354\nTotal 1,227 905 2,188 2,241\nExecutive employment agreements allow for additional payments in the event of a liquidity event, or if the executive is terminated without\ncause.\nOUTSTANDING SHARES\nAs at August 8, 2024, the date of this MD&A, the Company had the following securities outstanding:\nNumber\nCommon Shares 24,481,835\nShare purchase options 1,481,408\nDeferred Share Units 75,000\nRestricted Share Units 458,895\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nThe Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements.\nPage 18\nProfound Medical Corp.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023\nIn USD$ (000s)\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS Accounting Standards requires management to make\nestimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements,\nand the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the year. Actual results could differ from these estimates. As additional\ninformation becomes available or actual amounts are determinable, the recorded estimates are revised and reflected in operating results\nin the year in which they are determined.\nCritical accounting policies\nRevenue\nTo determine revenue recognition for arrangements the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a\ncustomer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to\nthe performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The\nCompany only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration it is entitled to in\nexchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer.\nThe Company derives its revenues primarily from the lease and sale of medical devices and the sale of certain one-time-use devices.\nCapital equipment consists of one-time revenue for the sale of capital equipment including installation fees. Recurring – non-capital\nrevenue consists of the sale of one-time-use devices, lease of medical devices, procedures and services associated with extended\nwarranties. Revenue is recognized when a contractual promise to a customer (performance obligation) has been fulfilled by transferring\ncontrol over the promised goods or services, generally at the point in time of shipment to or receipt of the products by the customer or\nwhen the services are performed. When contracts contain customer acceptance provisions, revenue is recognized on the satisfaction of\nthe specific acceptance criteria.\nThe amount of revenue to be recognized is based on the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for its goods and\nservices. For contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the consideration to which it expects to be\nentitled to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices and recognizes the related revenue when or as control\nof each individual performance obligation is transferred to customers.\nService revenue related to installation and training is recognized over the period in which the services are performed. Service revenue\nrelated to extended warranty service is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the extended warranty period covered by\nthe respective customer contract.\nCritical accounting estimates\nTrade and other receivables\nThe key judgements and estimates used in determining the amortized cost for trade and other receivables are the estimated collection\nperiod and the discount rate applied to the cash flow projections.\nDISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nDisclosure controls and procedures have been designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company is\naccumulated and communicated to the Company’s management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nThe Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Company (collectively the “Certifying Officers”) are responsible for\nestablishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (“DC&P”) and internal control over financial reporting (“ICFR”), as those\nterms are defined in National Instrument 52-109 Certification of Disclosure in Issuer’s Annual and Interim Filings.\nThe Certifying Officers have concluded that as at June 30, 2024, the Company's DC&P has been designed effectively to provide\nreasonable assurance that (a) material information relating to the Company is made known to them by others, particularly during the\nperiod in which the annual filings are being prepared; and (b) information required to be disclosed by the Company in its annual filings,\ninterim filings or other reports are filed or submitted, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in\nthe securities legislation.\nThere have been no significant changes to the Company's ICFR for the period ended June 30, 2024, which have materially affected, or\nare reasonably likely to materially affect the Company's ICFR. Based on their evaluation of these controls for the period ended June 30,\nPage 19\nProfound Medical Corp.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023\nIn USD$ (000s)\n2024, the Certifying Officers have also concluded that the Company's ICFR have been designed effectively to provide reasonable\nassurance regarding the reliability of the preparation and presentation of the financial statements for external purposes and that ICFR\nwere effective as at June 30, 2024. The Company used the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission control\nframework to evaluate DC&P and ICFR.\nIt should be noted that while the Company's Certifying Officers believe that the Company's DC&P provides a reasonable level of\nassurance that they are effective, they do not expect that the disclosure controls will prevent all errors and fraud. A control system, no\nmatter how well conceived or operated, can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system\nare met.\nICFR is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the annual financial\nstatements for external reporting purposes in line with IFRS Accounting Standards. Management is responsible for establishing and\nmaintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting appropriate to the nature and size of the Company. However, any system\nof internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations and can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to annual\nfinancial statement preparation and presentation.\nENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE\nEnvironmental, social and governance (“ESG”) issues are an integral part of human life. They’ve also become a more conscious and\nexplicit part of business life, especially for public entities like Profound. The Company believes ESG sensitivities are an integral part of\ngrowing a successful, sustainable business. The importance Profound places on ESG principles stems from its foundation as a company,\nwhose mission is focused on providing customizable incision-free therapies that are flexible to treat different types of patients and can\ntreat each patient differently. ESG is embedded in the Company’s corporate strategy, which seeks to maximize long-term value by taking\na disciplined and sustainable approach to changing the paradigm of prostate cancer treatment.\nThrough Profound’s ESG plan, the Company intends to create enduring value for shareholders by:\n attracting, retaining and empowering a diverse, engaged workforce to bring unique perspectives and experiences to strategic\ndecisions;\n ensuring safe and secure workplaces for its employees and contributing to their welfare;\n caring for the environment in which the Company operates;\n strengthening relationships with shareholders by working collaboratively to achieve positive social, economic and environmental\noutcomes; and\n operating transparently.\nEnvironmental\nProfound believes in the 3Rs: reduce, reuse, recycle. Profound strives to control the waste and, in its facilities, electronic equipment,\npaper, glass, plastic and metal items, as well as hazardous waste, are recovered and recycled. Given the finite resources in the world,\nProfound believes moving towards a circular economy in which Profound reduces waste production is critical for both business and\nsociety. Recognizing the opportunity for the medical technology industry to support the transition towards lower waste and circular\nbusiness models, including by minimizing Profound’s waste footprint and exploring opportunities to reduce the volume of materials used.\nAt Profound, focusing efforts on waste minimization through a repair first strategy, and by using materials that can be recycled to increase\nthe supply of material for future reuse. The equipment that Profound provides to customers is collected, tested, repaired, or refurbished\nthen redeployed thus contributing to a circular economy. Equipment which can no longer be redeployed is brought to organizations or\nthird party vendors that partner with Profound to resell and recycle obsolete equipment.\nProfound is focused on waste reduction, waste avoidance, and waste management strategies for all materials, including plastic, metal,\nwater and cardboard. To manage the Company’s waste it segregates, recycles, and properly disposes of hazardous and non-hazardous\nmaterials and where possible, reuses materials such as alcohol and water through its recycling plan. Profound will continue managing its\nwaste and material use through clear and consistent communication of best practices throughout the Company. Profound is committed\nto environmental sustainability and prioritizes efforts to prevent pollution and to conserve, recover, and recycle materials wherever\npossible. The Company attempts to distribute documents electronically to minimize paper consumption, waste and limit the use of single-\nuse plastics. Since 2021, Profound has invested in upgrading its lighting in its manufacturing facilities by retrofitting its lighting to high-\nefficiency LED to reduce energy consumption and enhance the manufacturing facilities work environment for its employees. The Company\nplans to continue to invest in lighting where it can have a positive environmental impact and improve working conditions.\nThe repair first approach promotes reuse of existing materials and reduction of new materials (including packaging associated with\nreplacing parts), therefore avoiding waste to landfill. To further support these key areas, the Company is exploring opportunities to recycle\nPage 20\nProfound Medical Corp.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023\nIn USD$ (000s)\nglass, water and metals. In Profound’s facilities, multiple waterless urinals have been installed which save over 100,000 litres of water\nper urinal each year.\nSocial\nAs the demand for talent increases, the need for innovative attraction and retention strategies also increases. The Company recognizes\nthat in a rapidly changing environment, its employees are central to its business performance. Profound’s workforce is a key driver of its\nsuccess, which is why providing a superior employee experience is one of its top priorities. This includes Profound’s commitment to\nproviding a safe and healthy workplace for all employees, consultants, and business partners. Profound does not simply consider this to\nbe its duty of care but an important business practice as it lowers costs, reduces absenteeism and turnover, increases productivity and\nquality and raises employee morale.\nIn addition to competitive salaries, Profound offers other benefits to its employees. These benefits include a range of incentives, flexible\nand home-based work options and other health-related benefits. The human resources department is responsible for promoting a wide\nrange of opportunities for innovation at work – which is a significant aspect of Profound’s corporate strategy – and for helping employees\nto nurture their personal strengths while developing as individuals. In order to be best prepared for challenges, Profound emphasizes the\nacquisition of technical expertise as part of the qualification system.\nDiversity and inclusion are long-standing core values that Profound embraces by fostering a respectful workplace where integrity, trust\nand inclusion are the norm. Profound believes that an inclusive workplace is one where everyone feels a sense of belonging, has a safe\nenvironment in which to work and develop, and shares equal opportunities for career advancement regardless of gender, skin colour,\nethnicity, religion, age, disability or sexual orientation. Profound values diversity and inclusion as together they enable a highly\ncollaborative and engaging work environment and drive innovation and the development of new ideas, which in turn directly correlates\nwith improved Company performance.\nProfound wants every employee to feel healthy, safe and productive at work. Cultivating a safe workplace helps advance the Company’s\npurpose of enabling everyone to live healthier, fuller lives. Given the increased incidence of mental illness in the workplace, Profound’s\nhealthcare coverage offers access to quality counseling services.\nArtificial intelligence is getting increasingly sophisticated at doing what humans do, but more efficiently, more quickly and at a lower cost.\nThe potential for both AI and robotics in healthcare is vast. Just like in our every-day lives, AI and robotics are increasingly a part of our\nhealthcare eco-system and a major factor for the Company. By analyzing large amounts of data in real time, AI can help improve clinical\nand nonclinical decision making, ablation planning, treatment time reduction and workflow ease of use optimization. Advances in\ntechnology are driving constant changes in the delivery of healthcare. Care providers must seek new training and education opportunities\nto adjust to this quickly evolving landscape. Artificial intelligence supports these efforts by revolutionizing the capture, storage, and\nanalysis of training video.\nArtificial intelligence has the potential to help solve some of the biggest challenges facing healthcare today, such as managing costs,\nphysician burnout, and health equity. Our AI solutions are designed to give healthcare professionals the time and tools they need to\ndeliver better care to more people around the world. The thermal boost technology enables predictable, customized ablation at the\nprostate capsule to ensure a reliable heating of the planned ablation volume. It demonstrates successful application for boosting the MRI-\nvisible lesions to ensure reliable heating to the capsule, boosting in regions with larger prostate radii and boosting if the lethal heat did\nnot initially reach the target boundary.\nGovernance\nProfound’s Board of Directors are responsible for the stewardship of the Company and for overseeing the conduct of business and the\nactivities of management. The Human Resource and Corporate Governance Committee of the board of directors of Profound is\nresponsible for providing leadership in shaping the Company’s governance policies and practices. The Audit Committee is responsible\nfor overseeing financial reporting and related internal controls, risk, independent and internal auditors, and ethics and compliance. The\ncommittees of the board of directors of Profound consist of many affluent senior leadership members within the industry that provide\nmeaningful insight and guidance. Strong and effective governance practices are part of Profound’s organizational culture. This\nencompasses sound and effective internal processes and procedures, minimizing risks, continuous enhancement of human resource\npolicies and practices, a cyber security strategy and promoting efficiency.\nThe Company holds itself to a high standard of governance and it is continually taking steps to strengthen its performance and\naccountability in critical areas. Profound’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and Whistleblower policies provide the standards for\nethical behavior throughout Profound’s business activities and reflect its commitment to conducting a culture of honesty, integrity, and\naccountability.\nPage 21\nProfound Medical Corp.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023\nIn USD$ (000s)\nAs Profound continues to work towards its mission, the Company is committed to conducting its business in a responsible and sustainable\nmanner by aspiring to develop healthy, resilient communities through its dedication to social, economic and environmental sustainability.\nBy unlocking value through its core activities, Profound remains focused on execution on all fronts including in fulfilling its commitment to\nESG best practices in the years to come.\nRISK FACTORS\nFor a detailed description of risk factors associated with the Company, refer to the “Risk Factors” section of the AIF, which is available on\nSEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca and filed as an exhibit to the 40-F, available on EDGAR at www.sec.gov.\nIn addition, the Company is exposed to a variety of financial risks in the normal course of operations, including risks relating to cash flows\nfrom operations, liquidity, capital reserves, market rate fluctuations and internal controls over financial reporting.

Profound’s lead product (the “TULSA-PRO® system”) combines real-\ntime MRI, robotically driven transurethral sweeping-action thermal ultrasound with closed-loop temperature feedback control for the\nablation of prostate tissue. The product is comprised of one-time-use devices and durable equipment that are used in conjunction with a\ncustomer’s existing MRI scanner.\nIn August 2019, the TULSA-PRO® system received FDA clearance as a Class II device in the United States of America (“United States”\nor “US”) for thermal ablation of prescribed prostate tissue, using transurethral ultrasound ablation (“TULSA®”) based on the Company\nsponsored whole gland ablation pivotal clinical study (“TACT”). It is also CE marked in the European Union (“EU”) for ablation of targeted\nprostate tissue (benign or malignant). The TULSA-PRO® system was approved by Health Canada in November 2019.\nProfound believes that, based on the Company’s TACT clinical data and additional studies conducted in the EU, physicians may elect to\nuse TULSA-PRO® to ablate benign or malignant prostate tissue in patients with a variety of prostate diseases. Prostate diseases include\nprostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia (“BPH”). Prostate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer affecting men.\nThe annual incidence of newly diagnosed cases in 2024 is estimated to reach 299,010 in the United States according to the American\nCancer Society and in 2020 there were approximately 475,000 newly diagnosed cases of prostate cancer in Europe, according to the\nInternational Agency for Research on Cancer. The American Cancer Society further estimates that there are approximately 5.8 million\nmen living with prostate cancer in these two geographic regions. Although ten-year survival outcomes for prostate cancer remain\nfavorable, it is still one of most common causes of cancer deaths among men. BPH is a histologic diagnosis that refers to the proliferation\nof smooth muscle and epithelial cells within the prostatic transition zone. According to the American Urological Association, BPH is nearly\nubiquitous in the aging male population with worldwide autopsy proven histological prevalence increases starting at ages 40 to 45 years,\nreaching 60% at age 60 and 80% at age 80.\nProfound initiated the commercial launch of its lead product, the TULSA-PRO® system in the United States in Q4 2019, treating the first\npatient in a non-trial setting in January 2020. On June 2, 2023, Profound Medical announced new Current Procedural Terminology (“CPT”)\nCategory 1 Codes from the American Medical Association (“AMA”) for TULSA to treat prostate diseases, which will be effective January\n1, 2025. In addition, Profound continues to support additional clinical trials in the United States and abroad to further increase the body\nof clinical evidence that may be needed particularly for reimbursement and coverage of its technologies by private and government\nhealthcare providers. The Company continues to expand the compatibility of its TULSA-PRO® system with additional MRI brands to\nbroaden its ability to utilize the global MRI installed base and seek regulatory approvals of its products in additional international\njurisdictions.\nPage 2\nProfound Medical Corp.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nIn USD$ (000s)\nProfound’s second product, the Sonalleve® system, is CE marked in the EU for the treatment of uterine fibroids and adenomyotic tissue,\npalliative pain relief associated with bone metastases, treatment of osteoid osteoma, and management of benign desmoid tumors and\nhas also been approved by the regulatory bodies in China and South Korea for non-invasive treatment of uterine fibroids. In late 2020,\nSonalleve® received Humanitarian Device Exemption (“HDE”) approval from the FDA for the treatment of Osteoid Osteoma in the United\nStates. The Sonalleve® system is only compatible with certain Philips MRIs.\nProfound deploys a recurring revenue business model in the United States to market TULSA-PRO®, charging a one-time payment that\nincludes a supply of its one-time-use devices, use of the system, as well as the Company’s customer and technological support (“Genius”)\nservices that support each TULSA center. The Sonalleve® product is marketed primarily outside North America in European and Asian\ncountries, deploying a capital sales model. Outside of North America, Profound generates most of its revenues from its system sales in\nEurope and Asia, where the Company deploys a more traditional hybrid business model, charging for the system separately as a capital\nsale and an additional per patient charge for the one-time-use devices and associated Genius services.\nProfound’s Technology\nTULSA-PRO® and Sonalleve® share the common technological concept of using MRI to enable visualization by the surgeon of desired\ntissue in real time. Both products also use thermal ultrasound technology to gently heat and ablate tissue using the real-time thermometry\ncapability of the MRI.\nTULSA-PRO® delivers its ultrasound energy through a transurethral catheter, a one-time-use device that is placed in the patient’s prostate\nthrough a natural orifice. Focused ultrasound energy is then delivered by the catheter in the shape of a blade. Externally the catheter is\nconnected to a software controlled robotic manipulator that rotates up to 360-degree in a sweeping action to impart thermal energy and\nthus ablation of tissue. The real time temperature measurement of the prostate is coupled with closed loop process control that measures\nthe appropriate amount of ultrasound energy to gently heat the physician-prescribed region of prostate tissue to the target temperature\nto achieve cell kill without boiling or charring the tissue. As a measure to keep the urethra within the prostate viable, the temperature of\nthe transurethral catheter is maintained at an appropriate level by circulating water inside the catheter. Similarly, a water-cooled specially\ndesigned catheter is placed in the patient’s rectum during the ablation process to keep it protected from thermal damage during the\nprocedure. The TULSA-PRO in conjunction with its Thermal Boost module, enables surgeons to temporarily increase the ablation target\ntemperature in prostate regions where advanced stage cancer might reside, further increasing their confidence that aggressive cancer\ncells have been ablated. Profound believes that TULSA-PRO®’s controlled and relatively gentle heating process may result in lower post\nprocedural pain and complications, reduced potential of life affecting side effects, and in significantly desirable shrinkage of the prostate\nvia resorption of the dead tissue over time, which may provide a longer-term durable benefit.\nSonalleve® delivers its ultrasound energy via a disc located outside the patient. Its ultrasound energy is focused to create small cylindrical\nhot spots a certain distance into the patient. Overlapping cylinders create ablation of the physician-prescribed desired tissue. Similar to\nTULSA-PRO, Sonalleve® also provides for controlled temperature increases to achieve cell kill.\nThe physician is in charge of using the Profound devices and decides which tissue needs to be ablated to impart therapeutic effect.\nProfound believes that in the hands of trained physicians, its systems have the ability to provide customizable, incision-free ablative\ntherapies with the precision of real-time MRI visualization and thermometry, focused ultrasound and closed-loop temperature feedback\ncontrol. Profound believes that its technology offers clinicians and appropriate patients a better alternative to traditional surgical or\nradiation therapies, with respect to clinical outcomes, side effects and recovery time.\nTULSA-PRO®\nThe TULSA-PRO® system is designed to provide precise, flexible and durable ablation of a surgeon defined region of the prostate while\nactively protecting the urethra and rectum to help preserve the patient’s natural functional abilities. To date, over 3,000 global TULSA-\nPRO® procedures have been performed by more than 100 physicians at over 30 commercial and 20 clinical research sites.\nClinical Studies\nIn March 2014, Profound completed enrollment and treatment of 30 patients in the Phase I TULSA multi-jurisdictional safety and precision\nstudy. Based on the Phase I clinical trial results, in April 2016, Profound received a CE Certificate of Conformity for the TULSA-PRO®\nsystem from its notified body in the EU, and in the fourth quarter of 2016, Profound initiated a pilot commercial launch of TULSA-PRO®\nin key European markets where the CE mark is accepted.\nProfound received FDA clearance for the TULSA-PRO® system in August 2019 for transurethral ultrasound ablation of prostate tissue,\nbased on the Company’s TACT Pivotal Clinical Trial. The TACT Pivotal Clinical Trial is a prospective, open-label, single-arm pivotal\nPage 3\nProfound Medical Corp.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nIn USD$ (000s)\nclinical study, of 115 treatment-naïve localized prostate cancer patients across 13 research sites in the United States, Canada and\nEurope, which enrolled patients between August 2016 and February 2018.\nLocalized Prostate Cancer, Ablation Safety and Efficacy: TACT Pivotal Study\nThe TACT Pivotal Clinical Trial demonstrates that MRI-guided TULSA is a minimally invasive procedure for effective prostate cancer\nablation with a favorable side effect profile, minimal impact on quality of life and low rates of residual disease1. In the large, multi-center\nprospective study in men with predominately intermediate-risk prostate cancer, whole gland ablation sparing the urethra and apical\nsphincter with the TULSA-PRO® met its primary regulatory endpoint of prostate-specific antigen (“PSA”) reduction in 96% of men to a\nmedian nadir of 0.34 ng/ml and 0.5 ng/ml at 12 months. Median decrease in perfused prostate volume as assessed by a central radiologist\nusing 12-month MRI was 91%, from a median 37 cc to 2.8 cc. At 12 months, extensive biopsy sampling of the markedly reduced prostate\nvolume demonstrated a benefit for nearly 80% of men. There was no evidence of cancer in 65% of men and 14% had low-volume\nclinically-insignificant disease. The authors, however, noted that thermally-fixed non-viable cells can retain their apparently-malignant\ntissue morphology, confounding Gleason grading and potentially introducing false positives2. By two and five years, 7% and 21%,\nrespectively, of men sought additional treatment for their prostate cancer (prostatectomy, radiation). The study patient population, with\ntwo-thirds of those with Gleason Grade Group (GGG) ≥ 2 having either bilateral disease or at least five positive cores, allowed for\nevaluation of oncologically relevant secondary outcomes including PSA stability, post-treatment biopsy, and salvage treatment.\nNotwithstanding the limitations of comparisons between ablative and extirpative therapies, the 21% 5-year rate of salvage treatment and\n20% rate of residual clinically significant prostate cancer in intermediate-risk patients are in line with accepted rates of early failure or\nadditional intervention after standard treatments and goals for retreatment after ablative therapies. By five years, the median PSA nadir\nfurther reduced to 0.26 ng/ml. PSA reduction was durable over the extended follow-up period, from 0.53 ng/ml at one year to 0.63 ng/ml\nat five years.\nTULSA was associated with a high degree of safety and maintenance of quality-of-life, durable to five years, comparing favorably to\nradical prostatectomy and other whole-gland ablation techniques. At 12 months, 96% of men returned to baseline urinary continence,\nand 75% of potent men maintained or returned to erections sufficient for penetration, with these rates remaining stable or further improving\nto five years. A total of 12 grade 3 adverse events occurred in 8% of men, including genitourinary infection (4%), urethral stricture (2%),\nurinary retention (1.7%), urethral calculus and pain (1%), and urinoma (1%), all resolved by 12 months. There were no grade 4 events,\nrectal injuries, severe incontinence requiring surgical intervention, or severe erectile dysfunction unresponsive to medication.\nLocalized Prostate Cancer, Durability of Outcomes: Phase I Safety and Precision Study\nThe Phase I Clinical Trial demonstrates that MRI-guided TULSA is safe and precise for ablation in patients with localized prostate cancer,\nproviding spatial ablation precision of ± 1.3 mm with a well-tolerated side-effect profile and minor or no impact on urinary, erectile and\nbowel function at 12 months3. There were no grade 4 or higher adverse events, one transient attributable grade 3 event (epididymitis),\nand notably no injury to rectal or periprostatic structures. Functional outcomes, International Prostate Symptom Score (“IPSS”) and IIEF-\n15, both showed a favorable anticipated trend of initial deterioration with subsequent gradual improvement toward baseline levels.\nConsistent with the conservative whole-gland treatment plan which included a 3 mm circumferential margin expected to spare 10% viable\nprostate at the gland periphery, intra-operative MRI thermometry measured 90% thermal ablation of the prostate gland, median PSA\ndecreased 90% from 5.8 ng/ml to nadir of 0.6 ng/ml, and median prostate volume reduced by 88% on 1-year MRI. Prostate biopsy at one\nyear identified decreased cancer burden with 61% reduction in cancer length; however, attributable to the circumferential safety margin,\nclinically significant cancer in 9 of 29 men (31%), and any cancer in 16 of 29 (55%).\nFollow-up data to three and five years demonstrate durability of the outcomes, with continued treatment safety and stable quality of life,\nas well as predictable PSA and biopsy oncological outcomes based on treatment-day imaging and early PSA follow-up, without precluding\nany potential salvage therapy options4. Repeat prostate biopsy at three years demonstrated durable histological outcomes, with only one\nsubject upgrading to GGG 1 from negative at 12 months, and one subject upgrading to GGG 2 from GGG 1 at 12 months. Between one\nand five years, there were no new serious adverse events. By five years, 16 men completed protocol follow-up, three withdrew with PSA\n<0.4 ng/ml, 10 had salvage therapy without complications (six prostatectomy, three radiation and one laser ablation), and one died of an\n1 Klotz et al, “MRI-guided transurethral ultrasound ablation of prostate cancer,” The Journal of Urology, 2020\n2 Anttinen et al, “Histopathological evaluation of prostate specimens after thermal ablation may be confounded by the presence of thermally-fixed cells,”\nInternational Journal of Hyperthermia, 2019\n3 Chin et al, “Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Guided Transurethral Ultrasound Ablation of Prostate Tissue in Patients with Localized Prostate Cancer: A Prospective\nPhase 1 Clinical Trial,” European Urology, 2016; Bonekamp et al, “Twelve-month prostate volume reduction after MRI-guided transurethral ultrasound ablation of the\nprostate,” European Radiology, 2018\n4 Nair et al, “MRI-Guided Transurethral Ultrasound Ablation in Patients with Localized Prostate Cancer: Three Year Outcomes of a Prospective Phase I Study”, BJU\nInternational, 2020; Nair et al, “PD17-03 Five-Year Outcomes from a Prospective Phase I Study of MRI-Guided Transurethral Ultrasound Ablation in Men with\nLocalized Prostate Cancer”, AUA 2020 Virtual Experience, Abstract in The Journal of Urology, 2020; Hatiboglu et al, “Durability of functional outcomes after MRI-\nguided transurethral ultrasound ablation of the prostate,” JU Open Plus, 2023.\nPage 4\nProfound Medical Corp.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nIn USD$ (000s)\nunrelated cause. Of 16 men with complete follow-up data, five-year median PSA remained at 0.55 ng/ml. Median IPSS of 6 at baseline\nreturned to 5 by three months, and 6.5 at five years. At baseline, 9 of 16 had erections sufficient for penetration, 11 of 16 at one year,\nand 7 of 16 at five years. All 16 subjects had leak-free, pad-free continence at one and five years. Predictors of salvage therapy included\nlower ablation coverage and higher PSA nadir. At five years after TULSA, cancer specific survival is 100%, and overall survival 97%.\nBenign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH), Relief of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS): Phase I Studies\nPromising safety and feasibility of the TULSA-PRO® to relieve Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (“LUTS”) associated with BPH has been\ndemonstrated in two clinical studies showing improvements in IPSS comparable to modern minimally invasive surgical therapies5. A\nretrospective analysis of a sub-group of nine men from the Phase I localized prostate cancer study who also had LUTS (baseline IPSS ≥\n12) demonstrated significant IPSS improvement of 58% from 16.1 to 6.3 at 12 months (p=0.003), with at least a moderate (≥ 6 points)\nsymptom reduction in eight of nine patients. IPSS Quality of Life (“QoL”) improved in eight of nine patients. Erectile function (IIEF-EF)\nremained stable from 14.6 at baseline to 15.7 at 12 months. The proportion of patients with erections sufficient for penetration was\nunchanged. Full urinary continence (pad-free, leak-free) was achieved at 12 months in all patients. In five men who suffered from more\nsevere symptoms (baseline IPSS ≥ 12 and Qmax < 15 ml/s), peak urine flow rate (“Qmax”) increased from 11.6 ml/s to 22.5 ml/s at 12\nmonths. All adverse events were mild to moderate with no serious events reported.\nA prospective Phase I/II study of TULSA-PRO® for BPH has been conducted with early outcomes published in 20226. All measures of\nurinary function and quality of life improved during the initial twelve-month follow up among the first ten patients treated, while no adverse\neffects were seen on sexual and bowel functions: average IPSS decreased from 17.5 to 4.0, IPSS QoL decreased from 4.0 to 0.5, and\nQmax increased from 12.4 ml/s to 21.8 ml/s, among several other improved urinary measures. A single serious adverse event had\noccurred, abscess of the epididymis requiring drainage at two weeks post therapy. Enrollment of this study has been increased to 30\npatients.\nRadio-recurrent localized prostate cancer, Salvage TULSA (sTULSA): Phase I Study\nSalvage ablation of radio-recurrent localized prostate cancer has been evaluated in a prospective Phase I/II study of TULSA-PRO® with\nearly outcomes published in 20207. The report includes the first eleven patients from a 40-patient study, who were successfully treated,\nand discharged on the first postoperative day, with median catheterization time of seven days. Median PSA decreased from 7.6 ng/ml at\nbaseline to a nadir of 0.2 ng/ml and was 0.23 ng/ml at 12 months. At 12 months, 10/11 patients were free of any PCa in the targeted\nablation zone, confirmed with biopsy and imaging (MRI and PSMA-PET), and had low and stable PSA. Four patients had prolonged\ncatheterization and subsequent urinary tract infection, and one of these patients had upper urinary tract dilation treated with double-J-\nstents.\nPalliation of symptomatic locally advanced prostate cancer, Palliative TULSA (pTULSA): Phase I Study\nPatients with symptomatic locally advanced prostate cancer can suffer from severe urinary retention due to bladder outlet obstruction,\nintractable hematuria and frequent hospitalization. While these complications are commonly treated by palliative transurethral resection\nof the prostate (“TURP”), the improvement is often insufficient and may exclude patients who cannot discontinue anticoagulants. The\nsafety and feasibility of MRI-guided TULSA was evaluated as an alternative palliative treatment option for men suffering from symptomatic\nlocally advanced prostate cancer8. Ten patients with locally advanced prostate cancer were enrolled, half with clinical stage T4 disease\nand half with clinical T3. Prior to TULSA, all patients had continuous indwelling catheterization due to urinary retention, and 90% had\nhistory of recurrent and/or ongoing gross hematuria. Three patients had palliative TURP performed six months prior to receiving palliative\nTULSA, all of which were unsuccessful. One week after palliative TULSA, 50% of men were catheter-free. At last follow-up, 100% of men\nwere free of gross hematuria, and 80% had an improvement in catheterization, with 70% completely catheter-free. Notably, the average\nhospitalization time from local complications reduced from 7.3 to 1.4 days in the six-month period before and after palliative TULSA. All\nadverse events were related to urinary tract infections, with two patients requiring intravenous administration of antibiotics and three\npatients resolved with oral antibiotics alone. No other treatment related adverse events were recorded, with no rectal injury or fistula.\nFurther, there was no need for blood transfusions and there was no perioperative mortality.\n5 Elterman et al, “Relief of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms after MRI-Guided Transurethral Ultrasound Ablation (TULSA) for localized prostate cancer: Subgroup\nAnalyses in Patients with concurrent cancer and Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,” Journal of Endourology, 2020; Anttinen et al, “Transurethral ultrasound therapy for\nbenign prostatic obstruction in humans,” EAU 2020 Conference Presentation\n6 Viitala et al, “Magnetic resonance imaging-guided transurethral ultrasound ablation for benign prostatic hyperplasia: 12-month clinical outcomes of a phase I\nstudy,” BJU Int, 2022.\n7 Anttinen et al, “Salvage Magnetic Resonance Imaging–guided Transurethral Ultrasound Ablation for Localized Radiorecurrent Prostate Cancer: 12-Month Functional\nand Oncological Results,” European Urology Open Science, 2020.\n8 Anttinen et al, “Palliative MRI-guided transurethral ultrasound ablation for symptomatic locally advanced prostate cancer,” Scandinavian Journal of Urology, 2020\nPage 5\nProfound Medical Corp.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nIn USD$ (000s)\nCAPTAIN Trial\nCAPTAIN (A Comparison of TULSA Procedure vs. Radical Prostatectomy in Participants with Localized Prostate Cancer) is a prospective,\nmulti-centre randomized controlled trial of 201 patients aimed at comparing the safety and efficacy of the TULSA procedure (performed\nwith the TULSA-PRO® system) with radical prostatectomy (“RP”) in men with organ-confined, intermediate-risk, Gleason Score 7 (Grade\nGroup 2 and 3) prostate cancer. In the CAPTAIN trial, 134 patients will be randomized to receive one or two TULSA procedures and 67\npatients will be randomized to receive RP. The trial takes place primarily in the United States, with an additional two sites in Canada and\none in Europe. Of those, eighteen sites have been activated to date and are currently recruiting patients.\nRP is currently the gold-standard surgical treatment for intermediate-risk prostate cancer. RP effectively controls disease but carries risk\nof significant side effects such as long-term erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence. The TULSA procedure combines transurethral,\nrobotically-driven therapeutic ultrasound with real-time visualization of temperature and automated control of heating from magnetic\nresonance thermometry. The high spatial, thermal, and anatomic resolution of the target volume enables precise ablation of prostate\ntissue while sparing functionally important structures, potentially reducing the risk of side effects relative to RP.\nThe goal of the CAPTAIN trial is to demonstrate that the efficacy of the TULSA procedure is not inferior to RP, while demonstrating\nsuperior quality of life outcomes in patients receiving the TULSA procedure as compared to those patients receiving RP. The primary\nsafety endpoint is the proportion of patients who preserve both erectile potency and urinary continence at one year after treatment. The\nprimary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of patients who are free from any additional treatment for prostate cancer by three years after\ntreatment. Secondary endpoints include comparison of rates of complications, cost effectiveness, and timing of the return to baseline\nactivity. Long-term follow-up will be gathered for up to 10 years after treatment.\nSonalleve®\nProfound’s Sonalleve® system combines real-time MRI and thermometry with focused ultrasound delivered from the outside of the patient\nto enable customized incision-free ablation of diseased tissue. Profound acquired the Sonalleve® technology from Philips in 2017.\nThe Sonalleve® system is CE marked in the EU for the treatment of uterine fibroids, adenomyotic tissue, palliative pain treatment of bone\nmetastases, osteoid osteoma and management of benign tumors. The uterine fibroids application is also available for sale in Canada. In\n2018, the Sonalleve® system was also approved in China by the National Medical Products Administration for the non-invasive treatment\nof uterine fibroids and by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety in South Korea. Philips Oy registered Sonalleve® in several Middle East,\nNorth African, and South Asian countries. In 2020, Sonalleve® also received HDE from the US FDA for treatment of Osteoid Osteoma.\nSonalleve® Clinical Applications\nUterine Fibroids and Adenomyosis\nUterine fibroids are the most common non-cancerous tumors in women of childbearing age. Both surgical and medical treatments are\navailable, and the choice depends on number, size, and location of uterine fibroids, patient’s age and preferences, and pregnancy\nexpectations. To date, symptomatic uterine fibroids have been mostly treated with radical surgery (hysterectomy) in women who have\ncompleted childbearing, or conservative surgery (myomectomy and endometrial ablation) in women who wish to preserve fertility. Today,\nthe radiologist also has interventional options available. Minimally or non-invasive interventional radiology procedures include uterine\nartery embolization.\nThere is currently no ideal treatment for adenomyosis, and new options are needed. Drawing on experience of treatment of uterine\nfibroids, MR-High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (“MR-HIFU”) has been explored as a potential new conservative treatment and MR-HIFU\nis an early-stage, non-invasive, therapeutic technology with the potential to improve the QoL and decrease the cost of care for patients\nwith adenomyosis.\nTo achieve its current regulatory clearances, the Sonalleve® MR-HIFU System has undergone several studies and clinical trials for uterine\napplications at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Center (Toronto, Ontario), University Medical Center Utrecht (Utrecht, the Netherlands),\nNational Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD, USA), St. Luke’s Episcopal Hospital (Houston, TX, USA), University Hospital St. André\n(Bordeaux, France), Samsung Medical Center (Seoul, Korea), Peking University First Hospital Beijing (Beijing, China), First Affiliated\nHospital of Medical College of Xi’an Jiaotong University (Xi’an, China), and Turku University Hospital (Turku, Finland), amongst others.\nIn addition, a comprehensive literature review provides supportive evidence showcasing the beneficial action of MR-HIFU in uterine fibroid\nand adenomyosis therapy. These studies include the Verpalen et al. 2020, Nguyen 2020, Yeo et al. 2017, Kim et al. 2017, and Hocquelet\net al. 2017 that utilized the Sonalleve® MR-HIFU System. Specifically, the studies show impressive performance in terms of ablation\nefficiency, therapeutic efficacy, symptom reduction, and/or QoL improvement. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events\nPage 6\nProfound Medical Corp.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nIn USD$ (000s)\nin any of these studies, although Browne et al. 2020 describes a procedure-related major complication in the form of deep vein thrombosis\nthat was noted in one patient (0.8%) and subsequently and successfully treated with anticoagulation therapy. Minor adverse events, when\npresent, typically include 1st and 2nd degree skin burns, local swelling, cramps, leg pain, abdominal pain, buttock pain, and back pain,\nwhich are all known and anticipated adverse events of MR-HIFU therapy.\nPalliative Bone Pain Treatment\nPain caused by bone metastases is common in the event of malignancy and is inevitably associated with serious complications that may\ndeteriorate the QoL of patients and become life threatening.\nFor patients with bone metastases, clinical evaluation reports were completed in October 2020, showing significant decrease in pain\nscore and/or dosage of medication and increase in QoL are to be expected with MR-HIFU bone therapy. The randomized controlled\nPhase III study by Hurwitz et al. represents some of the most important clinical data that has been reported. In 112 subjects receiving\nMR-HIFU compared against 35 subjects receiving sham treatment, significant pain reduction at three months (decrease in worst NRS\npain ≥ 2 without increase in pain medication) was 64.3% vs. 20.0% (p<0.001), with mean Numeric Pain Scale (“NRS”) reduction of 3.6 ±\n3.1 vs. 0.7 ± 2.4 from an initial median NRS score of 7.0 in both groups. Improvement in average Brief Pain Inventory-Quality of Life at\nthree months was 2.4 points superior in the MR-HIFU group (p<0.001), representing a clinically important reduction in impairment caused\nby bone metastasis pain.\nThe clinical data above shows that patients with bone metastases can expect a statistically significant decrease in pain scores and/or in\nmedication dosage and increase in quality of life with MR-HIFU bone metastasis therapy.\nOsteoid Osteoma Treatment\nOsteoid osteoma is a relatively rare, painful bone tumor that typically occurs in the cortex of long bones, especially in children and\nadolescents, and accounts for approximately 10% of all benign bone tumors.\nCurrent osteoid osteoma treatment options include surgery and radiofrequency ablation (“RFA”), which is a less invasive option than\nsurgical resection. Although RFA can have a high success rate, the treatment is invasive and can potentially cause minor and major\ncomplications. It also exposes patients and operators to ionizing radiation associated with the CT imaging guidance.\nSonalleve® MR-HIFU provides an optimal therapy choice for osteoid osteoma which is a precise, completely non-invasive, and free from\nionizing radiation treatment. The recent studies have assessed the use of Sonalleve® MR-HIFU in treatment of osteoid osteoma, showing\na high clinical success rate and complete symptom resolution without any serious adverse effects and only few minor adverse effects\nthat promptly resolve. The Sonalleve® MR-HIFU device offers a novel, minimally invasive, MRI-guided method to treat osteoid osteoma\nsafely and effectively. A desmoid tumor, also called desmoid fibromatosis or aggressive fibromatosis, is a non-metastasizing but locally\naggressive proliferation of myofibroblasts that affects children and adults, with a peak incidence in early adulthood. Traditional\nmanagement of desmoid tumors includes observation, surgical resection, radiation, and/or chemotherapy. Observation allows\nassessment of the rate of tumor growth and may be acceptable in small, slow-growing, or asymptomatic lesions. Surgical resection is\noften a highly morbid procedure and has a high rate of recurrence even with negative margins. Radiotherapy provides somewhat improved\nlocal control rates but the morbidity from radiation, including burns, fibrosis, chronic edema, and pathologic fractures, is problematic. In\naddition, the small but finite risk of a radiation-induced malignancy is particularly troublesome in this young patient population, considering\nthe tumor being treated is benign.\nRecently, MR-HIFU has been assessed as a non-invasive therapy of desmoid tumors, showing good clinical success and even complete\ntumor eradication in some cases with low number and relative mild adverse events, which typically promptly resolve. The Sonalleve® MR-\nHIFU device offers a novel, non-invasive, MRI-guided method to treat desmoid tumors.\nThis technology is ideally suited for the treatment of desmoid tumors in a patient population that is generally young, otherwise healthy,\nand would like to avoid the morbidity of traditional surgical, radiation, and medical therapies for a benign disease. Magnetic resonance\nimaging provides visualization of critical neurovascular structures and allows sparing of these structures during therapy. While complete\nablation of a desmoid tumor may not be possible in all cases because of involvement of these structures, significant reduction in tumor\nvolume is often obtained with a corresponding improvement in pain and functional impairment. As the natural history of the disease often\ninvolves recurrence, the ability to re-treat with MR-HIFU without an upper dose limit is also an advantage. The clinical evidence to date\ndemonstrates that MR-HIFU provides a safe and effective treatment of desmoid tumors.\nPage 7\nProfound Medical Corp.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nIn USD$ (000s)\nBusiness Update and Sales Strategy\nProfound initiated its launch of the TULSA-PRO® system in the United States in Q4 2019 and the first patient was treated in the United\nStates in a non-clinical trial setting in January 2020. Since then, Profound’s business model has evolved to a recurring revenue model\nthat includes durable hardware usage, one-time-use devices and Profound’s Genius services, which includes necessary support for a\nproductive start-up of the practice.\nProfound has generated revenues from capital sales, one-time-use devices and related services, in the EU (principally in Germany) and\nAsia. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 64%, 17% and 19% of revenues were generated in the United\nStates, EU and Asia, respectively, compared to approximately 69%, 27% and 4% of revenues which were generated in the United States,\nEU and Asia, respectively for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Revenue on a quarter over quarter basis is expected to\nfluctuate given the Company is maintaining a limited European commercial effort and remains primarily focused on the US market.\nProfound’s TULSA-PRO® system is primarily marketed to early adopter physicians who specialize in treatment of prostate disease\nincluding urologists and radiologists at opinion leading hospitals. TULSA-PRO® services are available at either independent imaging\ncenters or at hospital-based imaging centers.\nHistorically, treatment of conditions such as localized prostate disease and uterine fibroids have included surgical intervention. Over time,\nsurgery has evolved from an ‘open’ technique, to laparoscopic, to robotic surgery. The motivation of surgeons behind this evolution has\nbeen to perform procedures that reduce invasiveness, improve clinical outcomes and reduce recovery times. Profound is seeking to take\nthis concept to the next level by enabling customizable, incision-free therapies for the MRI-guided ablation of diseased tissue with the\nTULSA-PRO® and Sonalleve® systems. These incision-free and radiation-free procedures offer surgeons the option of providing\npredictable and customizable procedures that eliminate invasiveness, offer the potential to improve clinical outcomes and further reduce\nhospital stays and patient recovery times.\nProfound is establishing its own direct sales and marketing teams for sales of TULSA-PRO® systems and the one-time-use devices\nrelated thereto, as well as for Sonalleve® systems in the jurisdictions where it is approved. The primary focus of Profound’s direct sales\nteam is to cultivate adoption of the TULSA-PRO® technology, support clinical customers with the TULSA-PRO® procedures and increase\nthe utilization of the systems and one-time-use devices. Profound expects to generate recurring revenues from the use of the system,\none-time-use devices, clinical support and service maintenance.\nOn January 21, 2019, the Company entered into an agreement with Siemens (the “Siemens Agreement”). Under the Siemens\nAgreement, there is a one-time fixed license fee and per annum payments calculated based on annual volume of Profound’s systems\nthat are interfaced to a Siemens MRI scanner. The initial term of the Siemens Agreement is five years and will be automatically extended\nfor successive one-year terms thereafter unless terminated earlier. The Company also obtained a non-exclusive license to Siemens\nAccess I interface software and reasonable support for the term of the Siemens Agreement.\nOn December 21, 2020, Profound signed the GE Agreement to expand provider access to TULSA-PRO®. Pursuant to the terms of the\nGE Agreement, Profound has been supplied with additional information to utilize the ExSI interface, which has allowed Profound to\ninterface with GE MRI scanners and GE is helping support the development efforts of Profound to achieve compatibility with its GE MRI\nscanners which was achieved on March 1, 2022 when the Company signed the first site agreement for a Tulsa-PRO® system interfaced\nwith a GE scanner.\nOn February 8, 2024, Profound entered into a non-exclusive collaboration with Siemens Healthineers, aimed at laying the groundwork\nfor Profound to begin marketing a complete therapeutics solution, combining its TULSA-PRO® system with the MAGNETOM Free.Max\nmagnetic resonance scanner from Siemens Healthineers, via Profound’s own sales force. Profound will continue to market TULSA-\nPRO® as a stand-alone offering, providing its customers with the flexibility to use the technology with the MR hardware of their choice.\nCompetition\nTULSA-PRO®\nThe TULSA-PRO® system is intended to ablate benign and malignant prostate tissue, however there are other treatment options for\nprostate disease. There are currently no marketed devices indicated for the treatment of prostate diseases or prostate cancer and\nProfound’s FDA indication and CE mark in the EU also do not include treatment of any particular disease or condition. However, there\nare a number of devices indicated for the destruction or removal of prostate tissue and devices indicated for use in performing surgical\nprocedures that physicians and surgeons currently utilize when treating patients with prostate disease, including prostate cancer.\nApproaches that physicians and surgeons currently use to address prostate disease include: (1) watchful waiting/active surveillance; (2)\nPage 8\nProfound Medical Corp.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nIn USD$ (000s)\nsimple prostatectomy; (3) radical prostatectomy (includes open, laparoscopic and robotic procedures); (4) radiation therapies including,\nexternal beam radiation therapy, brachytherapy and high dose radiation; (5) cryoablation; and (6) trans-rectal high intensity focused\nultrasound (“HIFU”). In addition, certain adjunct or less common procedures are used or are under development to address prostate\ndisease, such as androgen deprivation therapy and proton beam therapy.\nEach of the foregoing competing options have their own limitations and benefits and may only be appropriate for limited patient\npopulations. For example, active surveillance is generally recommended for patients who have been diagnosed with earlier stage, lower\nrisk, disease where the possibility of side effects from intervention may outweigh the expected benefit of the chosen procedure. For\nclinicians and patients, the gap between active surveillance and the most commonly utilized options of radical prostatectomy or radiation\ntherapy, imposes the possibility of substantial side effects, creating a need for a less invasive methodology to remove diseased prostate\ntissue that is both radiation and incision-free, provides a more favorable side-effect profile, and allows for safe and effective salvage\ntreatment options if required in the future.\nProfound believes that the flexibility of the TULSA-PRO® system may allow the Company to demonstrate its use as a tool for ablating\nbenign and malignant diseased prostate tissue with greater speed and precision than current options while minimizing potential side\neffects. Profound believes that the TULSA-PRO® system may overcome certain limitations of other devices and methodologies for\nremoving or addressing diseased prostate tissue including HIFU, such as complications associated with trans-rectal delivery and\nlimitations relating to prostate size and total ablation volume. Profound believes that a transurethral (inside out) ablation approach with\nmillimeter accuracy has advantages over HIFU in ablating the whole gland safely, as well as ablating larger prescribed treatment plans\nfor patients with multi-focal disease, BPH, and those who have prostate cancer concurrent with BPH.\nSonalleve®\nThe treatment choices for uterine fibroids usually depend on the symptoms of the patient, size of the fibroid, desire for future pregnancy\nand preference of the treating gynecologist. The most common treatment options for uterine fibroids include: (1) hormonal medications\nincluding gonadotrophin releasing hormone agonists; (2) progesterone releasing intra-uterine devices; (3) surgical procedures such as\nhysterectomy and myomectomy; and (4) uterine artery embolization. Profound believes that the Sonalleve® system may provide a\ntreatment option that is more convenient and comfortable with fewer side effects than hormonal medications or surgical procedures, such\nas hysterectomy or myomectomy.\nReimbursement\nProfound’s ability to successfully commercialize the Company’s products depends in large part on the extent to which coverage and\nadequate reimbursement for such products and related treatments or procedures will be available from government health administration\nauthorities, government and private health insurers, and other organizations or third-party payors. Pricing and reimbursement procedures\nand decisions vary from country to country. Many government health authorities and private payors condition payment on the cost-\neffectiveness of the product. Even if a device is FDA cleared or CE marked or has received other regulatory clearance or approval, there\nis no guarantee that third-party public or private payors will reimburse providers or patients for the cost of the device and related\nprocedures or that the amount of such reimbursement will be adequate to cover the cost of the device and related procedures. The\navailability of coverage and adequate reimbursement to hospitals and physicians using Profound’s products therefore is important to its\nability to generate revenue and Profound plans to pursue coverage and reimbursement for the Company’s products in the key markets\nwhere the Company has regulatory approvals. Successful commercialization of the Company’s approved products will also depend on\nthe cost of the system and the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from payors.\nOn November 4, 2024, it was announced that U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) has issued its Final Rule\nestablishing, for the first time, a Category 1 CPT code for the TULSA procedure, effective January 1, 2025.\nAccording to the Final Rule, TULSA will have three codes to cover how therapy is delivered depending on if there are one or two physicians\ninvolved in the procedure: CPT 51721 TULSA Device Management and CPT 55881 TULSA Treatment, when two physicians are involved\nin the procedure, and CPT 55882 TULSA Complete Procedure, when performed by a single physician. All three TULSA codes will have\na 0-day global period, indicating that the payment associated with the codes will only cover the work performed on the day TULSA is\nperformed. Physicians will thereby bill for any pre- or post-procedure patient visits separately using existing evaluation and management\n(E/M) codes. This will provide physicians with the most flexibility to assess the appropriate number of visits needed by each patient and\nenable their safe and fast recovery.\nUniquely for prostate treatment modalities, TULSA codes have been assigned to all three sites of service: Hospital Outpatient (“HOPD”),\nAmbulatory Surgical Center (“ASC”), and Private Office/Non-Facility (“OBL”). The spectrum of the location of service will ensure TULSA\npatients can be treated in a number of settings.\nPage 9\nProfound Medical Corp.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nIn USD$ (000s)\nFor Hospital Payment, the Final Rule has established TULSA CPT 55882 as a Level 7 Urology Ambulatory Payment Classification (“APC”)\nfor 2025 of $12,992 (Medicare National Average). For ASCs, the facility payment for CPT 55882 will be $10,728 (Medicare National\nAverage). This represents increases of approximately 41% and 49% for hospitals and ASCs, respectively, over TULSA payments\npreviously set in the Proposed Rule announced in July 2024 and is also 25% higher than the Final Rule for robotic radical proctectomy,\na mainstream treatment modality for prostate cancer, and 41% higher than the 2025 payment classification for benign prostatic\nhyperplasia (“BPH”) treatments.\nThe Final Rule for the Physician Fee Schedule has set the total Facility (HOPD or ASC) Relative Value Units (“RVU”) at 6.47 for CPT\n51721 TULSA Device Management and 14.56 RVU for CPT 55881 TULSA Treatment, when 2 physicians are involved in the TULSA\nprocedure. If one physician performs the complete TULSA procedure, the RVU is 17.91 for CPT 55882.\nThe Proposed Rule for Physician fee schedule for Non-Facility (OBL or Private Office) has set RVU at 16.25 for CPT 51721 TULSA\nDevice Management and 263.05 RVU for CPT 55881 TULSA Treatment, when 2 physicians are involved in the TULSA procedure. If one\nphysician performs the complete TULSA procedure, the RVU is 272.21 for CPT 55882.\nAs noted above, the TULSA procedure will have a 0-day Global Period, meaning that all post-operative visits are billed separately. This\nis distinct from all other comparable prostate treatments which are 90-day Global Period and therefore include bundled payments for all\npost-operative visits performed in the first 90 days. The typical range of post-operative office visits would be approximately 9-11 total\nRVUs in the first 90-days.\nThe below tables summarize the proposed rule Codes, RVUs and Facility Dollar Amounts.\nFacility Fee Schedule:\nCPT Code Description APC 5377: Level 7 APC: ASC\nUrology-HOPD\n55882 TULSA Complete Procedure $12,992.421 $10,728.001\n1 Amounts are exact, not in thousands.\nPhysician Fee Schedule:\nCPT Code Description Physician Total RVU Typical 90-Day Physician Total RVU with typical 90-day\nFollow-up Follow-Up\nFacility Non- Facility Non-Facility (OBL)\n(HOPD, Facility\n(HOPD, ASC)\nASC) (OBL)\n51721 TULSA Device 6.47 16.25 9.37 - 11.61 15.84 - 18.08 25.62 – 27.86\nManagement\n55881 TULSA 14.56 263.05 n/a 14.56 263.05\nTreatment\n51721 & Procedure 21.03 279.30 9.37 - 11.61 30.40 - 32.66 288.67 – 290.91\n55881 Total Total\n(Two\nPhysician)\n55882 TULSA 17.91 272.21 9.37 - 11.61 27.28 - 29.52 281.58 - 283.82\nComplete\nProcedure\n(One\nPhysician)\nPage 10\nProfound Medical Corp.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nIn USD$ (000s)\nHIGHLIGHTS\n On July 11, 2024, Profound announced Category 1 CPT codes proposed CY2025 rule for TULSA to treat prostate diseases.\n On September 16, 2024, Profound announced PRO-Talk Live!

The Sonalleve® product is marketed primarily outside North America in European and Asian countries deploying\na one-time capital sales model with limited recurring service revenue. Outside of North America, Profound generates most of its revenues\nfrom its system sales (both TULSA-PRO® and Sonalleve®) in Europe and Asia where the Company deploys a more traditional hybrid\nbusiness model, charging for the system separately as capital and an additional per patient charge for the one-time-use devices and\nassociated Genius services. Revenue is comprised of recurring – non-capital revenue, which consists of the sale of one-time-use devices,\nlease of medical devices, procedures and services associated with extended warranties and one-time sale of capital equipment.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded revenue totaling $2,832 with $179 from the one-time sale of\ncapital equipment and $2,653 coming from recurring – non-capital revenue. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the\nCompany recorded revenue totaling $1,728 with all $1,728 coming from recurring – non-capital revenue. The increase in revenue for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024, was a result of higher capital and disposable sales. Revenue on a quarter over quarter basis\nis expected to fluctuate in the near term given the Company is maintaining a limited European commercial effort and remains focused\nprimarily on the US market which continues to see growth quarter over quarter.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded revenue totaling $6,975 with $1,380 from the one-time sale of\ncapital equipment and $5,595 from recurring – non-capital revenue, which consists of the sale of one-time-use devices, lease of medical\ndevices, procedures and services associated with extended warranties. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company\nrecorded revenue totaling $5,190 with $393 from the one-time sale of capital equipment and $4,797 from recurring – non-capital revenue.\nThe increase in revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was the result of higher capital and disposable sales.\nCost of sales\nCost of sales includes cost of finished goods, inventory provisions, warranty, freight and manufacturing overhead expenses.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded cost of sales of $1,026, related to the sale of medical devices,\ncapital and non-capital, which reflects a 64% gross profit margin. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded\ncost of sales of $668, related to the sale of medical devices, non-capital, which reflects a 61% gross profit margin. The gross profit margin\nwas higher in 2024 due to higher capital sales.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded cost of sales of $2,462, related to the sale of medical devices,\ncapital and non-capital, which reflects a 65% gross profit margin. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded\na cost of sales of $1,867, related to the sale of medical devices, capital and non-capital, which reflects a 64% gross profit margin. The\ngross profit margin was slightly higher due to the higher number of capital sales.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses consist of three components: research and development (“R&D”), general and administrative (“G&A”) and selling\nand distribution expenses. Historically, R&D expenses have exceeded selling and distribution expenses; however, in the future Profound\nexpects selling and distribution expenses to increase as the Company further commercializes the TULSA-PRO® system in the US.\nR&D Expenses\nR&D expenses are comprised of costs incurred in performing R&D activities, including new product development, continuous product\nimprovement, investment in clinical trials and related clinical manufacturing costs, materials and supplies, salaries and benefits, consulting\nfees, patent procurement costs, and occupancy costs related to R&D activity.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, R&D expenses were higher by $739 compared to the three months ended September\n30, 2023. Clinical trial costs, material and salaries and benefits increased by $173, $168 and $504, respectively. The increases were due\nto increased CAPTAIN trial treatments and clinical trial recruitment efforts, various R&D projects undertaken during the period which\nincluded fixture developments, yield improvements and additional materials for clinical trials, higher headcount and lower reimbursement\nof workforce costs. Offsetting these amounts was a decrease of $36 in share based compensation due to fewer awards granted to\nemployees, a decrease of $26 in travel due to lower service calls and repairs and an overall decrease to the general office expense of\n$53.\nPage 12\nProfound Medical Corp.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nIn USD$ (000s)\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, R&D expenses were higher by $1,870 compared to the nine months ended September\n30, 2023. Clinical trial costs, materials, consulting fees and salaries and benefits increased by $387, $649, $76 and $1,160, respectively.\nThe increase in clinical trial costs was due to CAPTAIN trial treatments and clinical trial recruitment efforts, materials expenses were\nhigher due to spending on R&D initiatives for fixture development and yield improvements, consulting fees increased due to microbiology\nand Medical Device Regulatory audits and salaries increased due to higher headcount and lower reimbursement of workforce costs.\nOffsetting these amounts was a decrease in rent of $94 due to lower MRI time usage, a decrease of $146 to share based compensation\ndue to fewer awards granted to employees and an overall decrease to the general office expense of $144.\nG&A expenses\nG&A expenses are comprised of management costs, including salaries and benefits, various management and administrative support\nfunctions, insurance and other operating and occupancy costs.\nG&A expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by $1,701 compared to the three months ended September\n30, 2023. Salaries and benefits, consulting fees, software, office expenses, expected credit loss and bad debt expense increased by\n$290, $274, $130, $111, $608 and $390, respectively, due to higher cost of living salary increases, increased legal and accounting fees\nassociated with the expected loss of Emerging Growth Company status in the United States, increased hosting, license and user costs,\ncoupled with the increase in number of users, the overall increase in general expenses and bad debt expense associated with one\ncustomer. Offsetting this amount was a decrease to insurance expense of $41 due to lower premium rates and decrease to share based\ncompensation of $48 due to fewer awards granted to employees.\nG&A expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by $2,011 compared to the nine months ended September 30,\n2023. Salaries and benefits, consulting fees, software, expected credit loss and bad debt expense increased by $526, $428, $162, $607\nand $390, respectively, due to higher cost of living salary increases increased legal and accounting fees associated with the expected\nloss of Emerging Growth Company status in the United States, increased hosting, license and user costs, coupled with the increase in\nnumber of users and bad debt expense associated with one customer. Offsetting these amounts was a decrease in insurance costs of\n$103 due to lower premium rates.\nSelling and distribution expenses\nSelling and distribution expenses are comprised of business development costs related to the market development activities and\ncommercialization of the Company’s systems, including salaries and benefits, marketing support functions, occupancy costs related to\nmarketing activity and other miscellaneous marketing costs.\nSelling and distribution expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were higher by $734 compared to the three months\nended September 30, 2023. Salaries and benefits, consulting fees, marketing expenses, travel and general office expenses increased\nby $37, $83, $377, $181 and $75, respectively, due to increased salesforce and commission payments, consultants engaged to assist\nwith sales and marketing efforts, increased in-person conferences, meetings and largest event hosted, Pro-Talk Live, coupled with an\nincrease to the general office expenses.\nSelling and distribution expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were higher by $1,778 compared to the nine months\nended September 30, 2023.

The largest fluctuation from the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 versus the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was the $1,188 increase in foreign exchange gain, $232\nchange in fair value of the derivative liability warrants and a $150 increase in interest income attributed to the increase in cash balance\nand the prime rate.\nNet loss\nNet loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was $9,364 or $0.38 per Common Share, compared to a net loss of $5,564 or\n$0.26 per Common Share for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net loss was primarily attributed to an increase\nin R&D expense of $739, an increase in G&A expenses of $1,701, an increase in selling and distribution expenses of $734 and an\nincrease in net financing cost of $1,213. This was offset by an increase in gross profits of $746.\nNet loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was $22,482 or $0.92 per Common Share, compared to a net loss of $19,660\nor $0.93 per Common Share for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net loss was primarily attributed to an\nincrease in R&D expense of $1,870, an increase in G&A expenses of $2,011 and an increase in selling and distribution expenses of\n$1,778. This was offset by an increase in net finance income of $1,782 and an increase in gross profits of $1,190.\nSUMMARY OF QUARTERLY FINANCIAL RESULTS\nThe summary financial information provided below is derived from the Company’s interim financial statements for each of the last eight\nquarters that are prepared under IFRS Accounting Standards in US dollars.\n2024 2023 2022\nQ3 Q2 Q1 Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1 Q4\n$ $ $ $ $ $ $ $\nRevenue 2,832 2,233 1,910 2,009 1,728 1,602 1,860 1,257\nCost of sales 1,026 795 641 950 668 552 647 698\nGross profit 1,806 1,438 1,269 1,059 1,060 1,050 1,213 559\nOperating expenses 10,794 9,271 8,751 9,841 7,620 7,486 8,051 9,381\nNet finance\nexpenses/(income) 199 (934) (1,322) 356 (1,014) 884 (145) 499\nLoss before income\ntaxes 9,187 6,899 6,160 9,138 5,546 7,320 6,693 9,321\nIncome taxes 177 20 39 (229) 18 35 48 206\nNet loss for the period 9,364 6,919 6,199 8,909 5,564 7,355 6,741 9,527\nLoss per common share\nBasic and diluted 0.38 0.28 0.26 0.42 0.26 0.35 0.32 0.46\nThe third quarter of 2024 revenue continued to increase compared to prior quarters as patient procedures and capital equipment sales\nincreased. In addition, there was an increase in net finance costs due to the US dollar and Euro foreign currency rates, triggering a foreign\nexchange loss.\nThe second quarter of 2024 revenue increased compared to the prior quarter as a result of capital sales. Operating expenses were higher\ndue to the increase in headcount and lower workforce reimbursement from the European ministry of research. In addition, there was an\nincrease in finance income due to the US dollar and Euro foreign currency rate, triggering a foreign exchange gain.\nThe first quarter of 2024 revenue increased compared to the majority of prior quarters as a result of higher US sales from recurring\nrevenue. Operating expenses increased against several of the prior quarters due to additional headcount within sales and distribution\nand expenses associated with the continued TULSA-PRO® commercialization with the US market.\nPage 14\nProfound Medical Corp.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nIn USD$ (000s)\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023 revenue continued to increase compared to prior quarters as new sites became operational and increased\npatient procedures. Operating expenses were higher than prior quarters due to ATM offering fees as well as overall increase to the\nsalesforce.\nIn the third quarter of 2023 operating expenses were higher compared to the prior quarter due to increased consulting costs associated\nwith regulatory and foreign consultants for additional approval in other countries. In addition, there was also an increase in finance income\ndue to the US dollar and Euro foreign currency rate, triggering a foreign exchange gain.\nThe second quarter of 2023 revenue was lower compared to the prior quarter due to decreased one-time capital sales. Operating\nexpenses were lower compared to the prior quarters due to decreased share based compensation expenses and lower amortization\nexpenses as a result of intangible assets being fully amortized.\nThe first quarter of 2023 cost of sales decreased from the quarterly periods in 2022 as a result of manufacturing operating at a higher\nefficiency rate based on improvements to quality and training that were implemented in the manufacturing process.\nThe fourth quarter of 2022 revenue was lower compared to prior quarters due to decreased one-time capital sales, primarily resulting\nfrom lower capital sales than previous quarters. Operating expenses were higher due to goodwill impairment.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAt September 30, 2024, the Company had cash of $27,123 compared to $26,213 at December 31, 2023. Historically, the Company’s\nprimary source of cash has been financing activities, e.g., equity offerings as well as the CIBC Loan (as defined below).\nGoing Concern\nThe Company is subject to a number of risks, including the successful development and marketing of its products and the ability to raise\nadditional financing to support these activities. The Company depends on various financing from investors or other sources of capital to\nfund its operations, achieve its business plan and the realization of its assets and liabilities in the normal course of operations.\nManagement believes that current cash balances as of September 30, 2024 will not be sufficient to finance all of its planned business\noperations over the next year. The Company intends to seek additional financing from investors or other sources of capital in order to\nfund its operations and activities over the next year. There can be no assurance that the steps management are taking will be successful.\nConsidering the need for additional financing, there exists a material uncertainty that may raise significant doubt (or raise substantial\ndoubt as contemplated by PCAOB standards) about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.\nThese interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which asserts the Company\nhas the ability in the near term to continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities and commitments in a planned manner giving\nconsideration to the above and expected possible outcomes. Conversely, if the going concern assumption is not appropriate, adjustments\nto the carrying amounts of the Company's assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and balance sheet classifications may be necessary,\nand these adjustments could be material.\nUse of Proceeds\n2024 Offering and non-brokered private placement\nThe Company received net proceeds of $21,079 from the Public Offering and Private Placement. The Company intends to use net\nproceeds from the Public Offering and Private Placement to fund the continued commercialization of the TULSA-PRO® system in the\nUnited States, the continued development and commercialization of the TULSA-PRO® system and the SONALLEVE® system globally\nand for working capital and general corporate purposes. The Company confirms that there have been no material variances in the\nestimated use of proceeds from the net proceeds of the Public Offering since the date of the Company’s prospectus supplement dated\nDecember 27, 2023. In addition, there have been no material adjustments to the cost or timing of the business objective previously\ndisclosed in such prospectus supplement.\nPage 15\nProfound Medical Corp.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nIn USD$ (000s)\nTotal spending as at\nSeptember 30, 2024\n$\nTULSA-PRO® commercialization 11,660\nSonalleve® development and commercialization 1,951\nWorking capital and general corporate purposes 7,468\nTotal 21,079\nCIBC Loan\nProfound Medical Inc. (“PMI”) entered into a loan agreement with Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (“CIBC”) on November 3, 2022\n(the “CIBC Loan Agreement”), for gross proceeds of C$10,000, maturing on November 3, 2027, with an interest rate based on CIBC\nprime plus 2% (the “CIBC Loan”). The Company was required to make interest-only payments until October 31, 2023, and monthly\nrepayments on the principal of C$208 plus accrued interest commenced on October 31, 2023. All obligations of the Company under the\nCIBC Loan Agreement are guaranteed by current and future subsidiaries of the Company and include security of first priority interests in\nthe assets of the Company and its subsidiaries. Initially, the Company had financial covenants in relation to the CIBC loan where\nunrestricted cash is at all times greater than EBITDA for the most recent six-month period, reported on a monthly basis and that revenue\nfor any fiscal quarter must be 15% greater than revenue for the same fiscal quarter in the prior fiscal year, reported on a quarterly basis.\nOn September 26, 2023 an amendment to the CIBC Loan resulted in a change to the financial covenants. The amended covenants are\nthat unrestricted cash must at all times be greater of: (i) to the extent EBITDA is negative for such period, EBITDA for the most recent\nnine-month period or (ii) $7,500, reported on a monthly basis; and that recurring revenue for any fiscal quarter must be 15% greater than\nrecurring revenue for the same fiscal quarter in the prior fiscal year, reported on a quarterly basis.\nOn May 3, 2024, a second amendment to the CIBC Loan resulted in another amendment to the financial covenants. The amended\ncovenants are that the recurring revenue covenant shall not be tested for any fiscal quarter in the 2024 fiscal year so long as unrestricted\ncash is no less than 2.5 multiplied by the principal amount of outstanding CIBC Loan at all times. The Company is in compliance with\nthese financial covenants as at September 30, 2024. Based on the Company’s future cash flow forecasts, if additional financing or other\nsources of capital is not raised by the end of the second half of 2025, the Company may have difficulty complying with the unrestricted\ncash covenant.\nCash Flow\nThe Company manages liquidity risk by monitoring actual and projected cash flows. A cash flow forecast is performed regularly to ensure\nthat the Company has sufficient cash to meet operational needs while maintaining sufficient liquidity. The Company’s cash requirements\ndepend on numerous factors, including market acceptance of the Company’s products, the resources devoted to developing and\nsupporting the products and other factors. Profound expects to continue to devote substantial resources to expand procedure adoption\nand acceptance of the Company’s products.\nThe Company may require additional capital to fund R&D activities and any significant expansion of operations by the second half of the\nyear ending December 31, 2025. Potential sources of capital could include equity and/or debt financings, development agreements or\nmarketing agreements, the collection of revenue resulting from future commercialization activities and/or new strategic partnership\nagreements to fund some or all costs of development. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain the capital\nsufficient to meet any or all of the Company’s needs. The availability of equity or debt financing will be affected by, among other things,\nthe results of R&D, the Company’s ability to obtain regulatory approvals, the market acceptance of the Company’s products, the state of\nthe capital markets generally, strategic alliance agreements and other relevant commercial considerations. In addition, if the Company\nraises additional funds by issuing equity securities, existing security holders will likely experience dilution, and any incurring of\nindebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require the Company to agree to operating and financial\ncovenants that would restrict operations. Any failure on the Company’s part to raise additional funds on terms favourable to the Company\nor at all may require the Company to significantly change or curtail current or planned operations in order to conserve cash until such\ntime, if ever, that sufficient proceeds from operations are generated, and could result in the Company not being in a position to take\nadvantage of business opportunities, in the termination or delay of clinical trials for its products, in curtailment of product development\nprograms designed to identify new products, in the sale or assignment of rights to technologies, product and/or an inability to file market\napproval applications at all or in time to competitively market products.\nPage 16\nProfound Medical Corp.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nIn USD$ (000s)\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n$ $ $ $\nCash provided by (used in) operating activities (6,363) (4,338) (17,811) (15,280)\nCash provided by (used in) financing activities (665) (189) 19,043 1,955\nForeign exchange on cash 72 (1,123) (322) 433\nNet increase (decrease) in cash (6,956) (5,650) 910 (12,892)\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $(6,363) versus $(4,338) for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2023.

The primary change of the operating cash flows during this period related to increased\nheadcount, consulting expenses and marketing efforts in the US.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $(665) versus $(189) for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. These cash flows relate to monthly payments of the long-term debt and lease liability.\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $19,043 versus $1,955 for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023. These cash flows relate primarily to the 2024 Offering and non-brokered private placement\npursuant to which the Company received net proceeds of $21,079.\nForeign Exchange on Cash\nCash was impacted by the change in the foreign exchange rates for the Company’s foreign currency denominated cash (non-USD). The\nvalue of the Company’s currencies decreased, resulting in a decrease in the Company’s cash holdings.\nContractual obligations\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s significant contractual obligations:\nSeptember 30, 2024\nCarrying Future cash Less than 1 Between 1 year\namount flows Year and 5 years\n$ $ $ $\nAccounts payables and accrued liabilities 3,396 3,396 3,396 -\nLease liability 6301 667 292 375\nLong-term debt 5,598 6,622 2,444 4,178\nTotal 9,624 10,685 6,132 4,553\n1 Present value of the lease payments that are not paid, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nNon-GAAP measures are not recognized measures under IFRS Accounting Standards and do not have a standardized meaning\nprescribed by IFRS Accounting Standards. These measures are defined with reference to the nearest comparable IFRS Accounting\nStandards measure such that a reconciliation to the nearest comparable IFRS Accounting Standards measure can be completed.\nAccordingly, these measures may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Profound uses non-GAAP\nmeasures in order to provide additional financial information to complement the closest IFRS Accounting Standards measures in order\nto provide investors with a further understanding of the Company’s operations from management’s perspective. Investors should not\nconsider that these non-GAAP measures are a substitute for analyses of the financial information that Profound reports under IFRS\nPage 17\nProfound Medical Corp.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nIn USD$ (000s)\nAccounting Standards. Profound uses these non-GAAP measures in order to provide investors with a supplemental measure of its\noperating performance and thus highlight trends in the Company’s business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on\nIFRS Accounting Standards measures.\nThe Company’s working capital (defined as current assets less current liabilities) is a non-GAAP financial measure. Working capital\nis used to fund operations and meet short-term obligations. If the Company has enough working capital, it can continue to pay its\nemployees and suppliers and meet other obligations, such as interest payments and taxes, even if it runs into cash flow challenges. The\nworking capital as at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is set forth in the table below.\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\n$ $\nCurrent assets 40,884 41,896\nLess: Current liabilities 6,677 6,366\nWorking capital 34,207 35,530\nWorking capital decreased by $1,323 with a surplus of $34,207 as at September 30, 2024 compared to the surplus of $35,530 at\nDecember 31, 2023. The change in working capital is due to a decrease in current assets of $1,012, which was primarily the result of the\nincrease in the cash balance of $910 which was offset by decreases in prepaids expenses and deposits of $1,110 and a decrease in\ninventory of $554. Current liabilities increased by $311 due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and current portion\nof the long-term debt.\nCOMMITMENTS & CONTINGENCIES\nAll directors and officers of the Company are indemnified by the Company for various items including, but not limited to, all costs to settle\nlawsuits or actions due to their association with the Company, subject to certain restrictions. The Company has purchased directors’ and\nofficers’ liability insurance to mitigate the cost of any potential future lawsuits or actions. The term of the indemnification is not explicitly\ndefined but is limited to events for the period during which the indemnified party served as a director or officer of the Company. The\nmaximum amount of any potential future payment cannot be reasonably estimated but could have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany.\nThe Company has also indemnified certain lenders and underwriters in relation to certain debt and equity offerings and their respective\naffiliates and directors, officers, employees, shareholders, partners, advisers and agents and each other person, if any, controlling any of\nthe underwriters or lenders or their affiliates against certain liabilities.\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nThe Company’s financial instruments consist of cash, trade and other receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, derivative\nfinancial instruments and lease liability. The fair values of these financial instruments, approximate carrying value as a result of their short-\nterm nature. Financial assets measured at amortized cost include cash and trade and other receivables. The fair value of the long-term\ndebt approximates its carrying amount as it has a floating interest rate.\nFinancial liabilities measured at amortized cost include accounts payable and accrued liabilities, long-term debt and lease liability.\nThe Company’s financial instruments are exposed to certain financial risks including credit risk, liquidity risk, currency risk and interest\nrate risk. There have been no significant changes to those risks impacting the Company since December 31, 2023, nor has there been a\nsignificant change in the composition of its financial instruments since December 31, 2023.\nRELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nKey management includes the Company’s directors and senior management team.

Actual results could differ from these estimates. As additional\ninformation becomes available or actual amounts are determinable, the recorded estimates are revised and reflected in operating results\nin the year in which they are determined.\nCritical accounting policies\nRevenue\nTo determine revenue recognition for arrangements the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a\ncustomer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to\nthe performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The\nCompany only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration it is entitled to in\nexchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer.\nThe Company derives its revenues primarily from the lease and sale of medical devices and the sale of certain one-time-use devices.\nCapital equipment consists of one-time revenue for the sale of capital equipment including installation fees. Recurring – non-capital\nrevenue consists of the sale of one-time-use devices, lease of medical devices, procedures and services associated with extended\nwarranties. Revenue is recognized when a contractual promise to a customer (performance obligation) has been fulfilled by transferring\ncontrol over the promised goods or services, generally at the point in time of shipment to or receipt of the products by the customer or\nwhen the services are performed. When contracts contain customer acceptance provisions, revenue is recognized on the satisfaction of\nthe specific acceptance criteria.\nPage 19\nProfound Medical Corp.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nIn USD$ (000s)\nThe amount of revenue to be recognized is based on the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for its goods and\nservices. For contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the consideration to which it expects to be\nentitled to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices and recognizes the related revenue when or as control\nof each individual performance obligation is transferred to customers.\nService revenue related to installation and training is recognized over the period in which the services are performed. Service revenue\nrelated to extended warranty service is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the extended warranty period covered by\nthe respective customer contract.\nCritical accounting estimates\nTrade and other receivables\nThe key judgements and estimates used in determining the amortized cost for trade and other receivables are the estimated collection\nperiod and the discount rate applied to the cash flow projections.\nDISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nDisclosure controls and procedures have been designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company is\naccumulated and communicated to the Company’s management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nThe Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Company (collectively the “Certifying Officers”) are responsible for\nestablishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (“DC&P”) and internal control over financial reporting (“ICFR”), as those\nterms are defined in National Instrument 52-109 Certification of Disclosure in Issuer’s Annual and Interim Filings.\nThe Certifying Officers have concluded that as at September 30, 2024, the Company's DC&P has been designed effectively to provide\nreasonable assurance that (a) material information relating to the Company is made known to them by others, particularly during the\nperiod in which the annual filings are being prepared; and (b) information required to be disclosed by the Company in its annual filings,\ninterim filings or other reports are filed or submitted, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in\nthe securities legislation.\nThere have been no significant changes to the Company's ICFR for the period ended September 30, 2024, which have materially affected,\nor are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company's ICFR. Based on their evaluation of these controls for the period ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Certifying Officers have also concluded that the Company's ICFR have been designed effectively to provide\nreasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the preparation and presentation of the financial statements for external purposes and\nthat ICFR were effective as at September 30, 2024. The Company used the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission control framework to evaluate DC&P and ICFR.\nIt should be noted that while the Company's Certifying Officers believe that the Company's DC&P provides a reasonable level of\nassurance that they are effective, they do not expect that the disclosure controls will prevent all errors and fraud. A control system, no\nmatter how well conceived or operated, can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system\nare met.\nICFR is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the annual financial\nstatements for external reporting purposes in line with IFRS Accounting Standards. Management is responsible for establishing and\nmaintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting appropriate to the nature and size of the Company. However, any system\nof internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations and can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to annual\nfinancial statement preparation and presentation.\nENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE\nEnvironmental, social and governance (“ESG”) issues are an integral part of human life. They’ve also become a more conscious and\nexplicit part of business life, especially for public entities like Profound. The Company believes ESG sensitivities are an integral part of\ngrowing a successful, sustainable business. The importance Profound places on ESG principles stems from its foundation as a company,\nwhose mission is focused on providing customizable incision-free therapies that are flexible to treat different types of patients and can\ntreat each patient differently. ESG is embedded in the Company’s corporate strategy, which seeks to maximize long-term value by taking\na disciplined and sustainable approach to changing the paradigm of prostate cancer treatment.\nThrough Profound’s ESG plan, the Company intends to create enduring value for shareholders by:\nPage 20\nProfound Medical Corp.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nIn USD$ (000s)\n attracting, retaining and empowering a diverse, engaged workforce to bring unique perspectives and experiences to strategic\ndecisions;\n ensuring safe and secure workplaces for its employees and contributing to their welfare;\n caring for the environment in which the Company operates;\n strengthening relationships with shareholders by working collaboratively to achieve positive social, economic and environmental\noutcomes; and\n operating transparently.\nEnvironmental\nProfound believes in the 3Rs: reduce, reuse, recycle. Profound strives to control the waste and, in its facilities, electronic equipment,\npaper, glass, plastic and metal items, as well as hazardous waste, are recovered and recycled. Given the finite resources in the world,\nProfound believes moving towards a circular economy in which Profound reduces waste production is critical for both business and\nsociety. Recognizing the opportunity for the medical technology industry to support the transition towards lower waste and circular\nbusiness models, including by minimizing Profound’s waste footprint and exploring opportunities to reduce the volume of materials used.\nAt Profound, focusing efforts on waste minimization through a repair first strategy, and by using materials that can be recycled to increase\nthe supply of material for future reuse. The equipment that Profound provides to customers is collected, tested, repaired, or refurbished\nthen redeployed thus contributing to a circular economy. Equipment which can no longer be redeployed is brought to organizations or\nthird party vendors that partner with Profound to resell and recycle obsolete equipment.\nProfound is focused on waste reduction, waste avoidance, and waste management strategies for all materials, including plastic, metal,\nwater and cardboard. To manage the Company’s waste it segregates, recycles, and properly disposes of hazardous and non-hazardous\nmaterials and where possible, reuses materials such as alcohol and water through its recycling plan. Profound will continue managing its\nwaste and material use through clear and consistent communication of best practices throughout the Company. Profound is committed\nto environmental sustainability and prioritizes efforts to prevent pollution and to conserve, recover, and recycle materials wherever\npossible. The Company attempts to distribute documents electronically to minimize paper consumption, waste and limit the use of single-\nuse plastics. Since 2021, Profound has invested in upgrading its lighting in its manufacturing facilities by retrofitting its lighting to high-\nefficiency LED to reduce energy consumption and enhance the manufacturing facilities work environment for its employees. The Company\nplans to continue to invest in lighting where it can have a positive environmental impact and improve working conditions.\nThe repair first approach promotes reuse of existing materials and reduction of new materials (including packaging associated with\nreplacing parts), therefore avoiding waste to landfill. To further support these key areas, the Company is exploring opportunities to recycle\nglass, water and metals. In Profound’s facilities, multiple waterless urinals have been installed which save over 100,000 litres of water\nper urinal each year.\nSocial\nAs the demand for talent increases, the need for innovative attraction and retention strategies also increases. The Company recognizes\nthat in a rapidly changing environment, its employees are central to its business performance. Profound’s workforce is a key driver of its\nsuccess, which is why providing a superior employee experience is one of its top priorities. This includes Profound’s commitment to\nproviding a safe and healthy workplace for all employees, consultants, and business partners. Profound does not simply consider this to\nbe its duty of care but an important business practice as it lowers costs, reduces absenteeism and turnover, increases productivity and\nquality and raises employee morale.\nIn addition to competitive salaries, Profound offers other benefits to its employees. These benefits include a range of incentives, flexible\nand home-based work options and other health-related benefits. The human resources department is responsible for promoting a wide\nrange of opportunities for innovation at work – which is a significant aspect of Profound’s corporate strategy – and for helping employees\nto nurture their personal strengths while developing as individuals. In order to be best prepared for challenges, Profound emphasizes the\nacquisition of technical expertise as part of the qualification system.\nDiversity and inclusion are long-standing core values that Profound embraces by fostering a respectful workplace where integrity, trust\nand inclusion are the norm.

Just like in our every-day lives, AI and robotics are increasingly a part of our\nhealthcare eco-system and a major factor for the Company. By analyzing large amounts of data in real time, AI can help improve clinical\nand nonclinical decision making, ablation planning, treatment time reduction and workflow ease of use optimization. Advances in\ntechnology are driving constant changes in the delivery of healthcare. Care providers must seek new training and education opportunities\nto adjust to this quickly evolving landscape. Artificial intelligence supports these efforts by revolutionizing the capture, storage, and\nanalysis of training video.\nArtificial intelligence has the potential to help solve some of the biggest challenges facing healthcare today, such as managing costs,\nphysician burnout, and health equity. Our AI solutions are designed to give healthcare professionals the time and tools they need to\ndeliver better care to more people around the world. The thermal boost technology enables predictable, customized ablation at the\nprostate capsule to ensure a reliable heating of the planned ablation volume. It demonstrates successful application for boosting the MRI-\nvisible lesions to ensure reliable heating to the capsule, boosting in regions with larger prostate radii and boosting if the lethal heat did\nnot initially reach the target boundary.\nGovernance\nProfound’s Board of Directors are responsible for the stewardship of the Company and for overseeing the conduct of business and the\nactivities of management.

All time references in\nthis Circular are references to Toronto time. Unless otherwise stated, all references to “$” are to United States dollars\nand references to “C$” are to Canadian dollars.\nAPPOINTMENT AND REVOCATION OF PROXIES\nRegistered Shareholders\nAppointment of Proxies\nThose Shareholders who wish to be represented at the Meeting by proxy must complete and deliver a proper\nform of proxy to TSX Trust Company (the “Transfer Agent”) either by mail or courier, to 100 Adelaide Street\nWest, Suite 301, Toronto, Ontario, M5H 4H1 or via the internet at www.voteproxyonline.com.\nThe persons named as proxyholders in the form of proxy accompanying this Circular are designated by management\nof the Corporation and are representatives of the Corporation’s management for the Meeting. A Shareholder who\nwishes to appoint some other person (who need not be a Shareholder) to attend and act for and on such\nShareholder’s behalf at the Meeting other than the management nominees designated in the form of proxy may\ndo so by either: (i) crossing out the names of the management nominees AND legibly printing the other person’s\nname in the blank space provided in the accompanying form of proxy; or (ii) completing another valid form of\nproxy. In either case, the completed form of proxy must be delivered to the Transfer Agent at the place and within the\ntime specified herein for the deposit of proxies. A Shareholder who appoints a proxy who is someone other than the\nmanagement representatives named in the form of proxy should notify the nominee of the appointment, obtain the\nnominee’s consent to act as proxy and provide instructions on how the Common Shares are to be voted. The nominee\n1\nshould bring personal identification to the Meeting. In any case, the form of proxy should be dated and executed by\nthe Shareholder or an attorney authorized in writing, with proof of such authorization attached (where an attorney\nexecuted the proxy form).\nIn order to validly appoint a proxy, the form of proxy must be received by the Transfer Agent (the address is stated\nabove or in the form of proxy) by 10:00 a.m. (Toronto time) on Monday May 13, 2024, or if the Meeting is adjourned\nor postponed, at least 48 hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, prior to any such adjournment or\npostponement. After such time, the Chair of the Meeting may accept or reject a form of proxy delivered to him in his\ndiscretion but is under no obligation to accept or reject any particular late form of proxy.\nRevocation of a Proxy\nA Shareholder who has validly given a proxy may revoke it for any matter upon which a vote has not already been\ncast by the proxyholder appointed therein. In addition to revocation in any other manner permitted by law, a proxy\nmay be revoked with an instrument in writing signed and delivered to either the registered office of the Corporation\nor the Transfer Agent, 100 Adelaide Street West, Suite 301, Toronto, Ontario, M5H 4H1, at any time up to and\nincluding the last business day preceding the date of the Meeting, or any postponement or adjournment thereof at\nwhich the proxy is to be used, or deposited with the Chair of such Meeting on the day of the Meeting, or any\nadjournment or postponement thereof. The document used to revoke a proxy must be in writing and completed and\nsigned by the Shareholder or his or her attorney authorized in writing or, if the Shareholder is a corporation, under its\ncorporate seal or by an officer or attorney thereof duly authorized.\nSignature on Proxies\nThe form of proxy must be executed by the Shareholder or his or her duly appointed attorney authorized in writing or,\nif the Shareholder is a corporation, by a duly authorized officer whose title must be indicated. A form of proxy signed\nby a person acting as attorney or in some other representative capacity should indicate that person’s capacity\n(following his or her signature) and should be accompanied by the appropriate instrument evidencing qualification\nand authority to act (unless such instrument has been previously filed with the Corporation).\nVoting of Proxies\nEach Shareholder may instruct his, her or its proxy how to vote his, her or its Common Shares by completing the\nblanks on the form of proxy.\nThe Common Shares represented by the enclosed form of proxy will be voted or withheld from voting on any\nmotion, by ballot or otherwise, in accordance with any indicated instructions. If a Shareholder specifies a choice\nwith respect to any matter to be acted upon, the Common Shares will be voted accordingly. In the absence of\nsuch direction, such Common Shares will be voted FOR the resolutions described in the form of proxy and\nbelow.\nThe accompanying form of proxy confers discretionary authority upon the persons named therein to vote on any\namendments or variations to matters identified in the Notice and with respect to such other business or matters which\nmay properly come before the Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. As of the date hereof,\nmanagement of the Corporation knew of no such amendments or variations or other matters to come before the\nMeeting.\nBeneficial (Non-Registered) Shareholders\nThe information set forth in this section is of importance to many Shareholders, as a substantial number of\nShareholders do not hold Common Shares in their own name. Shareholders who hold their Common Shares\nthrough depositories (e.g. CDS & Co., the registration name for CDS Clearing and Depository Services Inc.), brokers,\nintermediaries, trustees or other persons, or who otherwise do not hold their Common Shares in their own name\n(referred to in this Circular as “Beneficial Shareholders”) should note that only proxies deposited by Shareholders\nwho are registered Shareholders (that is, shareholders whose names appear on the records maintained by the Transfer\nAgent as registered holders of Common Shares) will be recognized and acted upon at the Meeting.\n2\nWithout specific instructions, brokers (or their agents and nominees) are prohibited from voting shares for the broker’s\nclients. Subject to the following discussion in relation to NOBOs (as defined herein), the Corporation does not know\nfor whose benefit the Common Shares registered in the name of CDS & Co., a broker or another nominee, are held.\nThere are two categories of Beneficial Shareholders for the purposes of applicable securities regulatory policy in\nrelation to the mechanism of dissemination to Beneficial Shareholders of proxy-related materials and other\nsecurityholder materials and to request voting instructions from such Beneficial Shareholders. Non-objecting\nbeneficial owners (“NOBOs”) are Beneficial Shareholders who have advised their intermediary (such as brokers or\nother nominees) that they do not object to their intermediary disclosing ownership information to the Corporation,\nconsisting of their name, address, e-mail address, securities holdings and preferred language of communication.\nSecurities legislation restricts the use of that information to matters strictly relating to the affairs of the\nCorporation. Objecting beneficial owners (“OBOs”) are Beneficial Shareholders who have advised their\nintermediary that they object to their intermediary disclosing such ownership information to the Corporation.\nIn accordance with the requirements of NI 54-101, the Corporation is sending the Notice, this Circular and a voting\ninstruction form or a form of proxy, as applicable (collectively, the “Meeting Materials”), directly to NOBOs and\nindirectly, through intermediaries, to OBOs. NI 54-101 permits the Corporation, in its discretion, to obtain a list of its\nNOBOs from intermediaries and use such NOBO list for the purpose of distributing the Meeting Materials directly to,\nand seeking voting instructions directly from, such NOBOs. As a result, the Corporation is entitled to deliver Meeting\nMaterials to Beneficial Shareholders in two manners: (a) directly to NOBOs and indirectly through intermediaries to\nOBOs; or (b) indirectly to all Beneficial Shareholders through intermediaries. In accordance with the requirements of\nNI 54-101, the Corporation is sending the Meeting Materials directly to NOBOs and indirectly, through intermediaries,\nto OBOs. The Corporation will pay the fees and expenses of intermediaries for their services in delivering Meeting\nMaterials to OBOs in accordance with NI 54-101.\nThe Corporation has used a NOBO list to send the Meeting Materials directly to those NOBOs whose names appear\non that list. If the Corporation has sent these materials directly to a NOBO, such NOBO’s name and address and\ninformation about its holdings of Common Shares have been obtained from the intermediary holding such shares on\nthe NOBO’s behalf in accordance with applicable securities regulatory requirements. As a result, any NOBO of the\nCorporation can expect to receive a voting instruction form from the Transfer Agent. NOBOs should complete and\nreturn the voting instruction form to the Transfer Agent in the envelope provided. The Transfer Agent will tabulate\nthe results of voting instruction forms received from NOBOs and will provide appropriate instructions at the Meeting\nwith respect to the shares represented by such voting instruction forms.\nApplicable securities regulatory policy requires intermediaries, on receipt of Meeting Materials that seek voting\ninstructions from Beneficial Shareholders indirectly, to seek voting instructions from Beneficial Shareholders in\nadvance of shareholders’ meetings on Form 54-101F7 – Request for Voting Instructions Made by Intermediary\n(“Form 54-101F7”). Every intermediary has its own mailing procedures and provides its own return instructions,\nwhich should be carefully followed by Beneficial Shareholders in order to ensure that their Common Shares are voted\nat the Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. Often, the form of proxy supplied to a Beneficial\nShareholder by its broker is identical to the form of proxy provided to registered Shareholders; however, its purpose\nis limited to instructing the registered Shareholder how to vote on behalf of the Beneficial Shareholder. Beneficial\nShareholders who wish to appear in person and vote at the Meeting should be appointed as their own representatives\nat the Meeting in accordance with the directions of their intermediaries and Form 54-101F7. Beneficial Shareholders\ncan also write the name of someone else whom they wish to attend at the Meeting and vote on their behalf. Unless\nprohibited by law, the person whose name is written in the space provided in Form 54-101F7 will have full authority\nto present matters to the Meeting and vote on all matters that are presented at the Meeting, even if those matters are\nnot set out in Form 54-101F7 or this Circular.\nThe majority of brokers now delegate responsibility for obtaining instructions from clients to Broadridge Financial\nSolutions, Inc. (“Broadridge”). Broadridge typically mails a voting instruction form in lieu of the form of proxy.\nBeneficial Shareholders are requested to complete and return the voting instruction form to Broadridge by mail or\nfacsimile. Broadridge will then provide aggregate voting instructions to the Transfer Agent, which tabulates the results\nand provides appropriate instructions respecting the voting of shares to be represented at the Meeting or any\nadjournment or postponement thereof. By choosing to send the Meeting Materials to NOBOs directly, the Corporation\n(and not the intermediary holding Common Shares on your behalf) has assumed responsibility for (i) delivering these\n3\nmaterials to you; and (ii) executing your proper voting instructions. Please return your voting instructions as specified\nin the request for voting instructions.\nAll references to Shareholders in this Circular and the accompanying form of proxy and Notice are to registered\nShareholders unless specifically stated otherwise.\nVOTING SECURITIES AND PRINCIPAL HOLDERS OF VOTING SECURITIES\nShareholders of record as of April 5, 2024 are entitled to receive notice of and to attend and vote at the Meeting. As\nat the date hereof, the Corporation has 24,428,899 issued and outstanding Common Shares. Each Common Share\nentitles the holder to one vote in respect of any matter that may come before the Meeting.\nPursuant to the by-laws of the Corporation, a quorum is present at the Meeting if two or more voting persons are\npresent in person and authorized to cast in the aggregate not less than 10% of the total number of votes attaching to\nall Common Shares.\nTo the knowledge of the directors and officers of the Corporation, as at the date hereof, no person or corporation\nbeneficially owns, directly or indirectly, or exercises control or direction over, more than 10% of the issued and\noutstanding Common Shares other than:\nNumber of Common Shares Percent of Outstanding\nName Owned or Controlled Common Shares\nGagnon Securities LLC 2,891,423 11.8%\nINDEBTEDNESS OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS\nNo directors or officers of the Corporation, nor any proposed nominee for election as a director of the Corporation,\nnor any associate or affiliate of any one of them, is or was indebted, directly or indirectly, to the Corporation or its\nsubsidiaries at any time since the beginning of the last completed financial year of the Corporation.\nINTEREST OF INFORMED PERSONS IN MATERIAL TRANSACTIONS\nExcept as disclosed in this Circular, no director or officer of the Corporation, nor any proposed nominee for election\nas a director of the Corporation, nor any other insider of the Corporation, nor any associate or affiliate of any one of\nthem, has or has had, at any time since the beginning of the last completed financial year of the Corporation, any\nmaterial interest, direct or indirect, in any transaction or proposed transaction that has materially affected or would\nmaterially affect the Corporation.\nMATTERS TO BE CONSIDERED AT THE MEETING\nFinancial Statements\nThe audited financial statements of the Corporation and the auditors’ report thereon as at and for the financial year\nended December 31, 2023 (the “Financial Statements”) will be placed before the Shareholders at the Meeting, but\nno vote by the Shareholders with respect thereto is required or proposed to be taken in respect of the Financial\nStatements. The Financial Statements were audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP of Toronto, Ontario and are\navailable under the Corporation’s profile on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca.\nElection of Directors\nAt the Meeting, Shareholders are required to elect the directors of the Corporation to hold office until the next annual\nmeeting of Shareholders or until the successors of such directors are elected or appointed. Shareholders will be asked\nto vote on the election of six directors at the Meeting, as further described below. There are currently six directors of\nthe Corporation.\n4\nThe persons designated as proxyholders in the accompanying form of proxy (absent contrary directions) intend\nto vote FOR the election of the directors as set forth above. The Corporation does not contemplate that any of such\nnominees will be unable to serve as directors; however, if for any reason any of the proposed nominees do not stand\nfor election or are unable to serve as such, proxies held by the persons designated as proxyholders in the accompanying\nform of proxy will be voted for another nominee in their discretion unless the Shareholder has specified in his or her\nform of proxy that his or her Common Shares are to be withheld from voting in the election of directors.\nThe Board has adopted a policy that entitles each Shareholder to vote for each nominee on an individual basis. In\naddition, the Board has adopted a policy stipulating that if the votes in favour of the election of a director nominee at\nthe Meeting represent less than a majority (50% + 1 vote) of the Common Shares voted and withheld, the nominee\nshall, immediately following the Meeting, submit his or her resignation to the Board for consideration. The Human\nResources and Corporate Governance Committee shall consider and recommend to the Board whether or not to accept\nthe resignation. The Board will accept the resignation absent exceptional circumstances which would warrant the\napplicable director continuing to serve on the Board. The Board will determine whether or not to accept the resignation\nwithin 90 days following the applicable annual meeting. A press release disclosing the Board’s determination (and the\nreasons for rejecting the resignation, if applicable) shall be issued promptly following such determination. The\nnominee will not participate in any Human Resources and Corporate Governance Committee or Board deliberations\non the resignation offer. The policy does not apply in circumstances involving contested elections.\nThe following table sets forth the name of each of the persons proposed to be nominated for election as a director of\nthe Corporation, all positions and offices in the Corporation presently held by such nominees, the nominees’\nmunicipality, province or state and country of residence, principal occupation within the five preceding years, the\nperiod during which the nominees have served as directors, and the number and percentage of Common Shares and\noptions to purchase Common Shares (“Options”) beneficially owned by the nominees, directly or indirectly, or over\nwhich control or direction is exercised.\nNumber and Number and\nPositions with Percentage of Percentage\nthe Corporation Common Shares of Options\nand Date First Beneficially Beneficially\nAppointed to the Owned or Owned or\nName, Age and Residence Board Principal Occupation Controlled Controlled\nArun Menawat Chief Executive Chief Executive Officer and 425,296 574,060\nAge: 69 Officer and Director of the Corporation 1.99% 28.1%\nBonita Springs, Florida, Director (since August 2016).\nUSA June 4, 2015\nBrian Ellacott(2) Director Chief Executive Officer 68,000 48,300\nAge: 67 June 14, 2018 Belmont Medical 0.32% 2.36%\nSanibel Island, Florida, Technologies, a medical\nUSA device company (since 2017).\nCynthia Lavoie(1) Director President and Managing 6,000 35,000\nAge: 57 March 2, 2021 Director of AllosteRx Capital 0.03% 1.71%\nGloucester, Ontario, Management (Canada) Inc.\nCanada (since 2018).

In considering compensation awards, the Human Resources and Corporate\nGovernance Committee has considered the skill level of its executives as well as comparable levels of compensation\nfor individuals with similar capabilities and experience. In regard to Profound’s current executive compensation\narrangements, the Human Resources and Corporate Governance Committee has considered such factors as Profound’s\ncurrent financial situation, the estimated financial situation of Profound in the mid-term and the need to attract and\nretain the key executives necessary for Profound’s long-term success. The Human Resources and Corporate\nGovernance Committee has determined that at this stage of Profound it is appropriate that compensation be in the\nform of base salary, Options, a potential bonus award and certain benefits plans.\n8\nProfound has established a Human Resources and Corporate Governance Committee, comprised of three independent\ndirectors, currently, Arthur Rosenthal (Chair), Brian Ellacott and Kris Shah. The Human Resources and Corporate\nGovernance Committee oversees the Corporation’s remuneration policies and practices. The principal responsibilities\nof the Human Resources and Corporate Governance Committee include:\n(a) with respect to human resources: (i) assist the Board in ensuring that the necessary policies and processes are\nin place by which all employees of the Corporation, with special attention to the executive group, will be\nfairly and competitively compensated; and (ii) produce a report on executive compensation for inclusion in\nthe Corporation’s proxy statement as required by applicable rules and regulations; and\n(b) with respect to corporate governance: (i) identify individuals qualified to become Board members, and\nrecommend that the Board select the director nominees for the next annual meeting of shareholders; and (ii)\ndevelop and recommend to the Board the corporate governance guidelines and processes applicable to the\nCorporation, review these guidelines and processes at least annually and recommend changes to the Board.\nA copy of the Human Resources and Corporate Governance Committee’s charter is available on Profound’s website\nat https://profoundmedical.com/investors/#governance.\nCompensation Philosophy and Objectives of Compensation Programs\nThe executive compensation program adopted by Profound and applied to its executive officers is designed to:\n(a) attract and retain qualified and experienced executives who have international business and operations\nexperience and will contribute to the success of Profound;\n(b) ensure that the compensation of the executive officers provides a competitive base compensation package,\nwith additional compensation to reward success and create a strong link between corporate performance and\ncompensation; and\n(c) motivate executive officers to enhance long term shareholder value, with current compensation being\nweighted toward at-risk long-term incentives in the form of Options and restricted share units (“RSUs”) so\nas to foster alignment with the interests of the Shareholders.\nThe goals of the compensation program are to attract and retain the most qualified people with relevant experience, to\nmotivate and reward such individuals on a short term and long-term basis, and to create alignment between corporate\nperformance and compensation. The Human Resources and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board intend\nthat the total cash components of compensation (base salary plus annual cash bonus) target the median of a benchmark\ngroup in comparable industries with similar market capitalization (the “Compensation Peer Group”).\nAggregate compensation (including annual cash bonus and equity-based compensation) payable to each NEO (as\ndefined below) is based on the achievement of certain performance goals. Performance goals are established annually\nand designed to align with the Corporation’s strategic objectives. As described in greater detail below, performance\ngoals affect equity-based compensation grants and annual cash bonuses.\nProfound does not believe that its compensation programs encourage excessive or inappropriate risk taking as: (i)\nemployees receive both fixed and variable compensation, and the fixed (salary) portion provides a steady income\nregardless of Common Share value which allows employees to focus on the business; (ii) the Share Option Plan\nencourages a long term perspective due to the vesting provisions of the options (see “Share Option Plan” below); and\n(iii) annual bonus is earned only if short-term objectives of the Corporation are achieved. Profound believes that the\ncompensation program is appropriately structured and balanced to motivate its executives and reward the achievement\nof annual performance goals, as well as the achievement of long term growth in shareholder value. NEOs and directors\nare not permitted to purchase financial instruments, including, for greater certainty, prepaid variable forward contracts,\nequity swaps, collars, or units of exchange funds, that are designed to hedge or offset a decrease in market value of\nequity securities granted as compensation or held, directly or indirectly, by the NEO or director.\n9\nAligning Management and Shareholders\nThe Corporation’s compensation program seeks to align management interests with Shareholder interests through\nboth short-term and long-term incentives linking compensation to performance. The short-term incentive is an annual\ncash bonus which is linked to individual performance and the Corporation’s performance. Further, long-term\nincentives of Option grants comprise a significant portion of overall compensation for the Corporation’s NEOs (as\ndefined herein). The Human Resources and Corporate Governance Committee believes this is appropriate because it\ncreates a direct correlation between variations in the Corporation’s share price (which is based in part on the\nCorporation’s financial performance) and the compensation of its NEOs, thereby aligning the interests of the\nCorporation’s executives and Shareholders.\nClawback Policy\nThe Corporation has adopted a clawback policy which applies to cash bonus awards made, and RSUs granted, to the\nNEOs and any other individuals as determined by the Board from time to time. Under the clawback policy, a clawback\nmay be triggered if an NEO is indicted for or convicted of an act involving gross negligence, fraud, theft, dishonesty\nor willful misconduct. Among other remedial actions, the enforcement of the clawback policy may involve forfeiture\nor cancellation of unpaid cash bonus awards or unvested RSUs and recoupment of the value of such awards. The\nHuman Resources and Corporate Governance Committee will continue to keep this policy under review as part of its\nregular risk review.\nCompensation Peer Group\nIn reviewing and approving the Corporation’s 2023 compensation program, the Human Resources and Corporate\nGovernance Committee considered the recommendations of the CEO, which were based upon public disclosure\ninformation available for the Compensation Peer Group. The Human Resources and Corporate Governance\nCommittee retained the services of Radford, a business unit of Aon Hewitt, as its external independent compensation\nadvisor to review the Corporation’s executive compensation program. In 2022, Radford assembled a benchmark peer\ngroup report to serve as a comparator for compensation purposes. The selection criteria for the comparator companies\nwere based on revenue, market capitalization, business focus and headcount. Radford was paid executive\ncompensation related fees of $11,800 in 2023 and $13,800 in 2022 and no other fees in such years. Radford was\noriginally retained in 2017.\nWith the assistance of Radford’s benchmark peer group report, the following 2023 Compensation Peer Group was\nestablished. There were no changes to the Compensation Peer Group from that in 2022.\nCompensation Peer Group\nAnika Therapeutics Inc. Apollo Endosurgery, Inc.\nAvedro, Inc. Avita Medical Inc.\nEkso Bionics Holdings Inc. Helius Medical Technologies Inc.\nPulse Biosciences Inc. RTI Surgical, Inc.\nSenseonics Holdings Inc. Shockwave Medical Inc.\nSI-BONE Inc. Transmedics, Inc.\nViewray Inc. Viveve Medical Inc.\nBase Salary\nBase salary is intended to reflect an executive officer’s position within the corporate structure, his or her years of\nexperience and level of responsibility, and salary norms in the sector and the general marketplace. As such, decisions\nwith respect to base salary levels for executive officers are not based on objective identifiable performance measures\nbut for the most part are determined by reference to competitive market information for similar roles and levels of\nresponsibility, as well as more subjective performance factors such as leadership, commitment, accountability,\nindustry experience and contribution. The Corporation’s view is that a competitive base salary is a necessary element\nfor retaining qualified executive officers, as it creates a meaningful incentive for individuals to remain at Profound\nand not be unreasonably susceptible to recruiting efforts by the Corporation’s competitors.\n10\nIn determining the base salary of the Named Executive Officers (as defined herein), the Board considered: (i)\nrecruiting and retaining executives critical to the success of Profound and the enhancement of shareholder value; (ii)\nproviding fair and competitive compensation; (iii) balancing the interests of management and Shareholders; and (iv)\nrewarding performance, both on an individual basis and with respect to operations in general.\nLong-term Incentives\nLong-term incentives, in the form of Options, are intended to align the interests of Profound’s directors and its\nexecutive officers with those of the Shareholders, to provide a long-term incentive that rewards these individuals for\ntheir contribution to the creation of shareholder value and to reduce the cash compensation Profound would otherwise\nhave to pay. The Share Option Plan is administered by the Board. In establishing the number of Options to be granted\nto any particular executive officer, reference was made to the number of Options granted to officers of other companies\ninvolved in similar businesses. The Board also considers previous grants of Options and the overall number of Options\nthat are outstanding relative to the number of outstanding Common Shares in determining whether to make any new\ngrants of Options and the size and terms of any such grants, as well as the performance of the executive officer as\ndemonstrated through his or her level of effort, time, responsibility, ability, experience, level of commitment and\nperformance goals in determining the level of incentive stock option compensation.\nBonus Awards\nThe Board will consider whether it is appropriate and in the best interests of the Corporation to award a discretionary\ncash bonus to executive officers for the most recently completed financial year and if so, in what amount. A cash\nbonus may be awarded to reward performance that has led to increased value for Shareholders through property\nacquisitions or divestitures, the formation of new strategic or joint venture relationships and/or capital raising efforts.\nQuantitative performance objectives include the achievement of the Corporation’s revenue target, departmental and\nindividual goals, which may be quantitative or qualitative in nature. These have been established for each individual\nexecutive officer by the Board with alignment of such corporate/individual goals with the CEO and include objectives\nsuch as research and product development, company productivity, revenue growth and long-term strategic guidance\nof the Corporation. These corporate, departmental and individual goals form the basis for the review of the executive\nofficers and the determination of cash bonuses at the end of each year with the Board. These awards are reviewed\nyearly to ensure that corporate performance metrics and individual goals are consistent from year to year.\nBonus award payments are based on the following assessment of:\n(a) whether or not the executive officers have successfully met or exceeded the established corporate,\ndepartmental and individual performance metrics and goals;\n(b) the executive officers’ decisions and actions and whether or not they are aligned with the Corporation’s long-\nterm growth strategy and have created value for Shareholders;\n(c) whether any near-term goals and objectives were not met because the executive officers made decisions in\nthe best long-term interests of the Corporation or due to factors outside of the executive officers’ control;\nand/or\n(d) additional initiatives undertaken by the executive officers, which were not contemplated in the initial\nobjectives.\nThe following targets, as a percentage of base salary, were approved for each NEO for the fiscal year ending\nDecember 31, 2023:\nPosition Target\nCEO 65%\nOther NEOs 20 - 50%\n11\nBenefits Plans\nThe Named Executive Officers are entitled to life insurance, health and dental benefits.\nPerformance Graph\nThe following graph illustrates the cumulative return to Shareholders of a $100 investment in Common Shares from\nDecember 31, 2018 to December 31, 2023, as compared to the cumulative total return on the Standard & Poor’s/TSX\nIndex and Standard & Poor’s/Nasdaq Composite Index for the same period, assuming the reinvestment of cash\ndistributions and/or dividends.\nDecember December December December December December\n31, 2018 31, 2019 31, 2020 31, 2021 31, 2022 31, 2023\n$ $ $ $ $ $\nProfound Medical 100.00 268.18 476.18 259.27 263.27 201.82\nS&P/TSX Composite Index 100.00 119.14 121.72 148.18 135.35 146.33\nNasdaq Composite Index 100.00 135.23 194.24 235.80 157.74 226.24\n500.00\n400.00\n300.00\n200.00\n100.00\n-\n31-Dec-18 31-Dec-19 31-Dec-20 31-Dec-21 31-Dec-22 31-Dec-23\nS&P/TSX Composite Index NASDAQ Profound Medical Corporation\nThe trend shown in the above graph does not necessarily correspond to the Corporation’s trend of compensation for\nthe NEOs (as defined herein) for the period disclosed above.

The Share Option Plan was originally adopted by the Board on June 4, 2015, and then\namended and restated on December 8, 2016 and again on July 13, 2018.\nThe amendments made on July 13, 2018 were as follows: (i) inclusion of the Insider Participation Limits (as defined\nherein); (ii) removal of TSX Venture Exchange (“TSXV”) required participation limits since the Corporation was no\nlonger listed on the TSXV; (iii) clarification to the share reserve since the Corporation was listed on the TSX and\npursuant to the Share Option Plan, the reserve changed from a fixed number to a fixed percentage as described below;\n(iv) inclusion of an additional amendment to the list of amendments that require Shareholder approval (being removing\nor exceeding the Insider Participation Limits); and (v) other amendments of a housekeeping nature.\nThe Share Option Plan provides that the Board may from time to time, in its discretion, grant to directors, officers,\nemployees, consultants and any other person or entity engaged to provide ongoing services to the Corporation non-\ntransferable Options, provided that the maximum number of Common Shares reserved for issuance under the Share\nOption Plan is equal to 13% of the issued and outstanding shares in the capital of the Corporation at the time of any\nOption grant. If any Option is exercised, cancelled, expired, surrendered or otherwise terminated for any reason, the\nnumber of Common Shares in respect of which the Option is exercised, cancelled, expired, surrendered or otherwise\nterminated, as the case may be, will again be available for purchase pursuant to Options granted under the plan. As at\nDecember 31, 2023, 1,474,809 Options have been granted under the Share Option Plan, which represents 6.9% of the\nissued and outstanding Common Shares of the Corporation as at December 31, 2023. As at December 31, 2023,\n1,218,581 Options are available for grant under the Share Option Plan, which represents 5.7% of the issued and\noutstanding shares in the capital of the Corporation as at December 31, 2023.\nThe aggregate number of Common Shares that may be (i) issued to insiders of the Corporation within any one-year\nperiod, or (ii) issuable to insiders of the Corporation at any time, in each case, under the Share Option Plan alone or\nwhen combined with all other security-based compensation arrangements of the Corporation, cannot exceed 10% of\nthe outstanding Common Shares (the “Insider Participation Limits”).\nThe Board shall determine the exercise price of the Options, provided that, it cannot be less than the Market Price of\nthe Common Shares on the date of grant. For the purposes of the Share Option Plan, “Market Price” means the\nvolume-weighted average price of the Common Shares on the stock exchange where the majority of trading volume\nand value of the Common Shares occurs, for the five trading days immediately preceding the relevant date on which\nthe Market Price is to be determined.\nThe expiry date for an Option shall not be later than the 10th anniversary of the date an Option is granted, subject to\nthe expiry date falling with a corporate blackout period or within 5 business days following the expiry of such a\nblackout period, in which case the expiry date will be extended to the 10th business day following the expiry of the\nblackout period.\nUnless otherwise specified by the Board, each Option generally vests and becomes exercisable as to 1/4 on the first\nanniversary of the date of grant and as to 1/36 on the first day of each calendar month thereafter. The Board has the\ndiscretion to permit accelerated vesting of Options.\nThe Corporation does not provide any financial assistance to optionees to facilitate the purchase of Common Shares\nissued pursuant to the exercise of Options under the Share Option Plan. Options granted under the Share Option Plan\nare not transferable or assignable (except to an optionee’s estate) and no Options may be exercised by anyone other\nthan the optionee or his or her legal representative during the lifetime of the optionee.\nThe Share Option Plan contains the following provisions regarding the exercise and cancellation of Options following\na change in the employment status of an optionee. In the event of:\n(a) an optionee’s retirement, the optionee will continue to participate in the plan and each Option that has vested\nor that vests within 12 months following the retirement date continues to be exercisable until the earlier of\n19\nthe Option’s expiry date and the date that is 12 months from the retirement date, and any Options that have\nnot been exercised by such time will immediately expire and be cancelled;\n(b) an optionee’s death or disability, each vested Option is exercisable until the earlier of the Option’s expiry\ndate and 6 months following the date of death or disability, as applicable, and any Options that have not been\nexercised by such time will immediately expire and be cancelled;\n(c) a termination without cause for an employee optionee, or the termination by the Corporation or an affiliate\nof a consulting agreement or arrangement (other than for breach) or the death or disability of a consultant,\neach vested Option is exercisable until the earlier of the Option’s expiry date and 90 days following the date\nof termination, death or disability, as applicable, and any Options that have not been exercised by such time\nwill immediately expire and be cancelled;\n(d) a termination for cause or resignation of an employee optionee, or the termination by the Corporation or an\naffiliate of a consulting agreement or arrangement (for breach) or the voluntary termination by the consultant,\nall Options (whether vested or unvested) terminate on the date of termination or resignation, as applicable;\nand\n(e) a director (who is not an employee or consultant) ceases to hold office, each vested Option is exercisable\nuntil the earlier of the Option’s expiry date and 60 days following the cessation date, and any Options that\nhave not been exercised by such time will immediately expire and be cancelled.\nThe Board may from time to time, without notice and without Shareholder approval, amend, modify, change, suspend\nor terminate the Share Option Plan or any Options granted thereunder as it, in its discretion determines appropriate,\nprovided, however, that no such amendment, modification, change, suspension or termination of the Share Option\nPlan or any Option granted thereunder may materially impair any rights of an optionee or materially increase any\nobligations of an optionee under the plan without the consent of the optionee, unless the Board determines such\nadjustment is required or desirable in order to comply with any applicable securities laws or stock exchange\nrequirements. Amendments that can be made by the Board without Shareholder approval include, but are not limited\nto, housekeeping amendments, amendments to comply with applicable law or stock exchange rules, amendments\nnecessary for Options to qualify for favorable treatment under applicable tax laws, amendments to the vesting\nprovisions of the Share Option Plan or any Option, amendments to include or modify a cashless exercise feature,\namendments to the termination or early termination provisions of the Share Option Plan or any Option, and\namendments necessary to suspend or terminate the Share Option Plan. Shareholder approval is required for the\nfollowing amendments to be made to the Share Option Plan:\n(a) increase to the number of Common Shares reserved for issuance under the Share Option Plan, except pursuant\nto the provisions in the plan that permit the Board to make equitable adjustments in the event of transactions\naffecting the Corporation or its capital;\n(b) reduce the exercise price of an Option, except pursuant to the provisions in the plan that permit the Board to\nmake equitable adjustments in the event of transactions affecting the Corporation or its capital;\n(c) extend the term of an Option beyond the original expiry date, except where an expiry date would have fallen\nwithin a blackout period or within 5 business days following the expiry of such a blackout period;\n(d) permit an Option to be exercisable beyond 10 years from its date of grant, except where an expiry date would\nhave fallen within a blackout period;\n(e) permit Options to be transferred other than for normal estate settlement purposes;\n(f) remove or exceeds the Insider Participation Limits;\n(g) permit awards, other than the Options, to be granted under the Share Option Plan; or\n(h) delete or reduce the range of amendments which require Shareholder approval.\n20\nAs required by section 613 of the TSX Company Manual, the Corporation’s annual burn rate, which represents the\nnumber of Options granted under the Share Option Plan divided by the weighted average number of Common Shares\noutstanding as at the end of a fiscal year, was 10.2% in 2021, 7.3% in 2022 and 6.9% in 2023.\nDescription of the Corporation’s LTIP\nOn May 20, 2020, the Shareholders approved the adoption of the LTIP. The LTIP is an incentive-based equity\ncompensation plan that provides for the grant of RSUs and DSUs.\nThe RSUs may be granted to any director, officer, employee or consultant of the Corporation or any of its affiliates\nand any such person’s personal holding company, as designated by the Board in a resolution (the “RSU Participants”)\nupon the terms and conditions set forth in a grant agreement. The DSUs may be granted to any director of the\nCorporation who has been designated by the Corporation for participation in the LTIP and who has agreed to\nparticipate in the LTIP (the “DSU Participants”, together with the RSU Participants, the “Participants”), upon the\nterms and conditions set forth in a grant agreement. Subject to Board approval, once each fiscal year, a DSU Participant\nmay elect to be paid up to 100% of this or her annual board retainer in the form of DSUs, with the remaining balance\n(if any) being paid in cash.\nThe LTIP was amended and restated by the Board on April 3, 2023, with respect to the revisions to the LTIP’s\namendment provision intended to more closely track the TSX amendment provision requirements and governance\nbest practices (as further described below). Other than the revisions to the amendment provision, none of the\namendments made to the LTIP required Shareholder approval. The amendments made to the LTIP that did not require\nShareholder approval include decreasing the maximum number of Common Shares issuable pursuant to the LTIP\nfrom 13% of the outstanding Common Shares to 4.9% of the outstanding Common Shares, provided that, the\nmaximum number of Common Shares which may be reserved for issuance pursuant to all of the Corporation's security-\nbased compensation arrangements shall not in the aggregate exceed 13% of the issued and outstanding Common\nShares including new non-employee director participation limits, including a new default vesting schedule for DSUs,\npermitting DSU Participants holding vested DSUs to elect settlement timing (subject to certain restrictions), providing\nthe Corporation with the ability to elect whether vested DSUs are settled in Common Shares or cash, including a\nclawback provision, and other amendments of an administrative or “housekeeping” nature. These amendments do not\nrequire Shareholder approval because of the LTIP’s amendment provision that allows these amendments to be made\nwithout Shareholder approval.\nThe LTIP is intended to advance the interests of the Corporation by: (i) providing Participants with additional\nincentives; (ii) rewarding the performance of the Participants through the issuance of the Units; (iii) increasing the\nproprietary interest of the Participants in the success of the Corporation; (iv) encouraging the Participants to remain\nwith the Corporation or its affiliates; and (v) attracting new directors, employees, officers and consultants to the\nCorporation or its affiliates.\nThe LTIP will be administered by the Board and the Human Resources and Corporate Governance Committee. The\nBoard is responsible for, among other things, granting the RSUs to the RSU Participants, granting the DSUs to the\nDSU Participants, determining the terms of such grants, and interpreting the LTIP and all agreements entered into\nthereunder. Pursuant to the LTIP, the number of RSUs (including fractional RSUs) granted at any particular time will\nbe calculated by dividing (i) the dollar amount of such grant by (ii) the market value of a Common Share on the\napplicable grant date, which is equal to the volume weighted average trading price of all Common Shares traded on\nthe TSX (or other exchange where the Common Shares are listed) for the five (5) trading days immediately preceding\nsuch date (the “Market Value”). The number of DSUs (including fractional DSUs) granted at any particular time will\nbe calculated by dividing (i) the dollar amount of such grant by (ii) the Market Value of a Common Share on the\napplicable grant date.\nThe RSUs will vest 1/3 on each of the first, second and third anniversary dates of the original grant, provided that the\nRSU Participant is continuously employed by or in service with the Corporation, or any of its affiliates, until the\nrespective vesting date. The Board would have the option to add any performance-based vesting criteria at its\ndiscretion. After the RSUs have vested, a Canadian RSU Participant may deliver a settlement notice to the Corporation\nin respect of any or all vested RSUs it desires to settle. U.S. RSU Participants must settle any vested RSUs within 70\ndays after such RSUs vested unless otherwise specified in the grant agreement. The Corporation may elect to settle\nthe vested RSUs in cash, in Common Shares issued from treasury, or a combination thereof. Since the form of\n21\nsettlement (i.e. cash and/or Common Shares) is at the option of the Corporation, all RSUs must settle no later than\nDecember 31 in the third calendar year following the year in which the services giving rise to the RSUs were rendered.\nDSUs granted prior to April 3, 2023 and any DSUs that a director elects to receive in lieu of annual cash board retainers\nwill vest on the DSU termination date, which is the date on which the DSU Participant ceases to be a director and, if\napplicable, an employee of the Corporation for any reason. DSUs granted on or after April 3, 2023 will vest 1/3 on\neach of the first, second and third anniversary dates of the original grant, provided that the DSU Participant is\ncontinuously in service with the Corporation, or any of its affiliates, until the respective vesting date.\nAfter the DSUs have vested and following a DSU Participant ceasing to hold all positions with the Corporation, a\nParticipant may elect when to settle the Participant’s vested DSUs (subject to certain restrictions) and the Corporation\nwill elect to settle such DSUs in such DSU Participant’s notional account for cash, Common Shares issued from\ntreasury, or a combination thereof. U.S. DSU Participant’s shall settle any vested DSUs within 70 days on the date\nfrom such DSU Participant incurs a “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A of U.S. Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986.\nThe maximum number of Common Shares which may be reserved for issuance under the LTIP cannot exceed 4.9%\nof the issued and outstanding Common Shares from time to time on a non-diluted basis (representing an aggregate of\n1,047,158 Common Shares as at December 31, 2023), provided that the Board may make appropriate adjustments in\nthe Common Shares issuable or amounts payable to preclude a dilution or enlargement of the benefits under the LTIP\nas a result of a consolidation, share split or similar change in the capital structure of the Corporation, subject to any\nrequired approval by any stock exchange or regulatory authority. As at December 31, 2023, an aggregate of 568,396\nUnits, representing approximately 2.7% of the issued and outstanding Common Shares, are outstanding under the\nLTIP. As at December 31, 2023, an aggregate of 478,761 Units, representing approximately 2.2% of the issued and\noutstanding Common Shares, are available for grant under the LTIP.\nCertain other restrictions on grants apply, including that: (i) the number of Common Shares issuable to insiders (as a\ngroup), at any time, under the LTIP and any other security-based compensation arrangements, including the Share\nOption Plan, shall not exceed 10% of the Corporation’s issued and outstanding Common Shares; (ii) the number of\nCommon Shares issued to insiders (as a group), within a one-year period, under the LTIP and any other security-based\ncompensation arrangements cannot exceed 10% of the Corporation’s issued and outstanding Common Shares; and\n(iii) the Corporation is prohibited from granting to any individual non-employee director of the Corporation more than\n$150,000 worth of awards under any security-based compensation arrangement of the Corporation (with no more than\n$100,000 attributable to stock options) annually based on the grant date fair value of the Units, other than in respect\nof awards granted to non-employee directors in lieu of cash fees on a value for value basis.\nUnder the LTIP, the Corporation will not provide financial assistance to Participants in connection with the settlement\nof Units by Participants. Except as the Board may otherwise determine, if a RSU Participant ceases to be a RSU\nParticipant for any reason, including, without limitation, as a result of his or her resignation, voluntary or involuntary\ntermination (including with or without cause), retirement, disability, or death, any unvested RSUs held by such RSU\nParticipant shall expire. Each DSU Participant is entitled to terminate his or her participation in the LTIP by filing a\ntermination notice with the designated officer of the Corporation. Thereafter, any portion of such DSU Participant’s\nannual board retainer payable and all subsequent annual board retainers shall be paid in cash.\nIn no event may the rights or interests of a Participant under the LTIP be assigned, encumbered, pledged, transferred\nor alienated in any way, except to the extent that certain rights may pass to a beneficiary or legal representative upon\ndeath of a Participant, by will or by the laws of succession and distribution.\nAny Unit which is subject to recovery, cancellation, forfeiture, revocation or recoupment under applicable laws, stock\nexchange listing requirements or policies adopted by the Corporation, including the Corporation’s clawback policy,\nwill be subject to such deductions, cancellations, forfeitures, revocations, recoupments and clawbacks as may be\nrequired pursuant to such laws, stock exchange listing requirements or policies.\nIn the event of a change of control, merger, amalgamation, arrangement, business combination or other transaction\npursuant to which the Common Shares of the Corporation are converted into, or exchanged for, other property, whether\nin the form of securities of another entity, cash or otherwise, any surviving or acquiring company must, (i) assume\nany Unit outstanding under the LTIP on substantially the same economic terms and conditions as the LTIP; or (ii)\n22\nsubstitute or replace restricted share units and deferred share units, as applicable for those RSUs and DSUs outstanding\nunder the LTIP on substantially the same economic terms and conditions. In the event any surviving or acquiring\ncompany neglects or refuses (as determined by the Board, acting reasonably) to assume any Units or to substitute or\nreplace similar restricted share units and deferred share units, as applicable, for those outstanding RSUs and DSUs in\nconnection with a such an event, then with respect to any Units held by Participants, the vesting of such Units will\nautomatically accelerate and be fully vested. Additionally, the Board may, in its discretion: (a) terminate, conditionally\nor otherwise and on such terms as it sees fit, the RSUs not settled following successful completion of such event; and\n(b) accelerate, conditionally or otherwise and on such terms as it sees fit, the vesting of Units or otherwise modify the\nterms of the Units to assist the Participants to obtain the advantage of holding Common Shares during the event.\nIn the event of a potential change of control following a take-over bid, the Board may, in its discretion, conditionally\nor otherwise and on such terms as it sees fit, accelerate the vesting of all of a Participant’s unvested Units to a date\nprior to the expiry date of such take-over bid or offer, such that all of a Participant’s Units will immediately vest at\nsuch time. In such event, all RSUs so vested may be settled conditionally or otherwise, from such date until their\nrespective expiry date so as to permit the Participant to tender the Common Shares received upon such settlement\npursuant to the take-over bid or offer.\nThe Board may make certain amendments to the LTIP or to any Unit outstanding thereunder without seeking\nshareholder approval, including, but not limited to, housekeeping amendments, amendments to comply with\napplicable law or stock exchange rules, amendments necessary for Units to qualify for favorable treatment under\napplicable tax laws, amendments to the vesting provisions of the LTIP or any Unit, amendments to the termination or\nearly termination provisions of the LTIP or any Unit, and amendments necessary to suspend or terminate the LTIP.\nOnly the following types of amendments will not be able to be made without obtaining shareholder approval:\n increasing the number of Common Shares reserved for issuance under the LTIP (other than as a result of a\nshare split or similar change in the capital structure of the Corporation);\n permitting awards to be transferred or assigned other than for normal estate settlement purposes;\n permitting the introduction or reintroduction of non-employee directors as participants on a discretionary\nbasis or increasing limits previously imposed on non-employee director participation;\n removing or exceeding the participation limits on insiders;\n amendments which delete or reduce the range of amendments which require approval by the Shareholders;\nand\n amendments required to be approved by shareholders under applicable laws or the rules, regulations and\npolicies of any stock exchange on which the Common Shares are listed.\nAs required by section 613 of the TSX Company Manual, the Corporation’s annual burn rate, which represents the\nnumber of Units granted under the LTIP divided by the weighted average number of Common Shares outstanding as\nat the end of a fiscal year, was 1.1% in 2021, 2.4% in 2022 and 2.7% in 2023.\nSecurities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans\nThe following table sets forth the securities of the Corporation that are authorized for issuance under the Share Option\nPlan and the LTIP as at the end of the Corporation’s most recently completed financial year.\n23\nNumber of securities to Weighted-average Number of securities\nbe issued upon exercise of exercise price of remaining available for\noutstanding options, outstanding options, future issuance under\nPlan Category warrants and rights warrants and rights equity compensation plans\nEquity compensation plans C$16.19 per\n2,778,173 734,968\napproved by securityholders Common Share\nEquity compensation plans\nnot approved by Nil Nil Nil\nsecurityholders\nC$16.19 per\nTotal 2,778,173 734,968\nCommon Share\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nThe Board is committed to a high standard of corporate governance practices. The Board believes that this\ncommitment is not only in the best interests of the Shareholders but that it also promotes effective decision making at\nthe Board level. The Board is of the view that its approach to corporate governance is appropriate and continues to\nwork to align with the recommendations currently in effect and contained in National Policy 58-201 - Corporate\nGovernance Guidelines which are addressed below.\nBoard Mandate\nThe Board has responsibility for the stewardship of the Corporation. The Board has adopted a written mandate for the\nBoard (the “Mandate”) to confirm and enhance the Board’s ongoing duty and responsibility for stewardship of the\nCorporation, a copy of which is available on the Corporation’s website at www.profoundmedical.com. and attached\nhereto as Schedule “A”. The Board is ultimately responsible for supervising the management of the business and\naffairs of the Corporation and, in doing so, is required to act in the best interests of the Corporation. The Board\ngenerally discharges its responsibilities either directly or through the Audit Committee and the Human Resources and\nCorporate Governance Committee. Specific responsibilities of the Board set out in the Mandate include:\n(a) Appointing Management – including approval of the Chief Executive Officer, the compensation of the\nexecutive officers and the oversight of succession planning programs;\n(b) Board Organization – including responding to recommendations received from the Human Resources and\nCorporate Governance Committee, but the Board retains the responsibility for managing its own affairs;\n(c) Strategic Planning – including the review and approval of the Corporation’s business, financial and strategic\nplans on at least an annual basis;\n(d) Monitoring of Financial Performance and Other Financial Reporting Matters – including the review of the\nCorporation’s ongoing financial performance and results of operations and review and approval of the\nCorporation’s audited and interim consolidated financial statements and management’s discussion and\nanalysis of financial conditions and results of operations;\n(e) Risk Management – including the identification of the Corporation’s principal business risks and the\nimplementation of appropriate systems to effectively monitor and manage such risks;\n(f) Policies and Procedures – including the approval and monitoring of all policies and procedures including\nthose related to corporate governance, ethics and confidentiality;\n(g) Communication and Reporting – including the oversight of the timely and accurate disclosure of financial\nreports and other material corporate developments; and\n24\n(h) Other Responsibilities – including those related to position descriptions, orientation and continuing\neducation, nomination of directors and Board evaluations and matters in respect of any disposition, material\ncommitment or venture, or significant expenditure in either monetary or business terms.\nComposition of the Board\nDirector Independence\nBrian Ellacott, Cynthia Lavoie, Murielle Lortie, Arthur Rosenthal and Kris Shah are all “independent” as such term\nis defined by National Instrument 58-101 – Disclosure of Corporate Governance Practices. Arun Menawat is non-\nindependent as he is the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation. Each of the independent directors has no direct\nor indirect material relationship with the Corporation, including any business or other relationship, which could\nreasonably be expected to interfere with the director’s ability to act with a view to the best interests of the Corporation\nor which could reasonably be expected to interfere with the exercise of the director’s independent judgment.\nIf the Chairman is not independent, the independent directors may select one of their members to be appointed lead\nindependent director of the Board (“Lead Independent Director”) for such term as the independent directors may\ndetermine. The Lead Independent Director is responsible for chairing meetings of the independent directors and\nseeking to ensure that the Board is able to carry out its role.\nDr. Arun Menawat acts as Chairman of the Board. Since Dr. Menawat is not independent, Brian Ellacott has been\nappointed Lead Independent Director of the Board.\nThe table below shows the current Board and committee membership.\nCommittees\nHuman Resources and\nCorporate Governance\nYear Appointed Audit Committee\nIndependent Board Members\nBrian Ellacott 2018 - Member\nCynthia Lavoie 2021 Member -\nMurielle Lortie 2020 Chair -\nArthur Rosenthal 2018 Member Chair\nKris Shah 2022 - Member\nNot Independent – Management\nArun Menawat (Chairman) 2015 - -\nMeetings of Independent Directors\nThe entire complement of independent directors on the Board and each of the committees meet regularly without\nmanagement present. The Chairman of the Board conducts these sessions at Board meetings and the Chair of each\ncommittee conducts them at committee meetings. During the last financial year ended December 31, 2023, there were\neight such meetings of the independent directors.\nChairman of the Board\nDr. Arun Menawat is the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation and as a result does not meet the Board’s\nindependence standards. The primary functions of the Chairman are to facilitate the operations and deliberations of\nthe Board and the satisfaction of the Board’s responsibilities under its Mandate. The Chairman’s key responsibilities\ninclude duties relating to providing overall leadership to the Board, chairing board and Shareholder meetings, acting\nas a liaison between management, the members of the Board and the Chairs of the various committees of the Board,\n25\nand communicating with Shareholders and regulators. The responsibilities of the Chairman are reviewed by the\nHuman Resources and Corporate Governance Committee and considered by the Board for approval each year.\nDirector Term Limits and Other Mechanics of Board Renewal\nThe Board has not established any term limits for directors, as the Board takes the view that term limits are an arbitrary\nmechanism for removing directors which can result in valuable, experienced directors being forced to leave the Board\nsolely because of length of service. The Board’s priorities continue to be ensuring the appropriate skill sets are present\namongst the Board to optimize the benefit to the Corporation. The Board conducts annual evaluations of the individual\ndirectors, the committees of the Board and the Chairman of the Board, which are overseen by the Human Resources\nand Corporate Governance Committee, to ensure these objectives are met. See “Board Assessments”.\nBoard Meetings\nThe Board holds a minimum of one regular quarterly meeting and a corporate strategy session each year, as well as\nadditional meetings as required. An in camera session of the directors is held at each regularly scheduled Board and\ncommittee meeting, as demeed necessary, so that the independent members of the Board have an opportunity to meet\nwithout the presence of management members of the Board.\nMeeting Attendance\nBoard Meetings Attended in 2023 Committee Meetings Attended in 2023\nName No. % No. %\nArun Menawat 6 of 6 100% - -\nBrian Ellacott 6 of 6 100% 2 of 2(3) 100%\nKenneth Galbraith(1) 1 of 2 50% 2 of 3(2)(3) 67%\nCynthia Lavoie 6 of 6 100% 4 of 4(2) 100%\nMurielle Lortie 6 of 6 100% 4 of 4(2) 100%\nArthur Rosenthal 6 of 6 100% 4 of 4(2)(3) 100%\nKris Shah 6 of 6 100% 1 of 1(3) 100%\nNotes:\n(1) Mr. Galbraith ceased being a member of the Board on May 17, 2023.\n(2) Audit Committee.\n(3) Human Resources and Corporate Governance Committee.\nOrientation and Continuing Education\nPursuant to the Mandate, it is the responsibility of the Board to provide an orientation program for new directors and\nongoing educational opportunities for all directors. New directors are expected to participate in an initial information\nsession on the Corporation in the presence of its senior executive officers to learn about, among other things, the\nbusiness of the Corporation, its financial situation and its strategic planning. All directors will receive a record of\npublic information about the Corporation, as well as other relevant corporate and business information including\ncorporate governance practices of the Corporation, the structure of the Board and its standing committees, its corporate\norganization, the charters of the Board and its standing committees, the Code (as defined herein) and other relevant\ncorporate policies.\nContinuing education opportunities are directed at enabling individual directors to maintain or enhance their skills and\nabilities as directors, as well as ensuring that their knowledge and understanding of the Corporation’s affairs remains\ncurrent. Directors are kept informed as to matters which may impact the Corporation’s operations through regular\nreports and presentations at Board and committee meetings.\n26\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics\nThe Corporation has adopted a written Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the “Code”) for directors, officers and\nemployees. The objective of the Code is to provide guidelines for maintaining the integrity, reputation, honesty,\nobjectivity and impartiality of the Corporation and its subsidiaries. The Code addresses compliance with laws,\nconflicts of interest, corporate opportunity, confidentiality, fair dealing with customers, suppliers, competitors, officers\nand employees, protection and proper use of company assets and accounting complaints. The Board has the ultimate\nresponsibility for the stewardship of the Code and is responsible for considering any request for waivers from the\nCode. Any waiver of the Code’s provisions is subject to the disclosure and other provisions of applicable securities\nlaws and the applicable rules of any and all securities exchanges on which the securities of the Corporation are listed\nand posted for trading. A copy of the Code is available on the Corporation’s website at www.profoundmedical.com.\nThe Board monitors compliance with the Code and reviews it on at least an annual basis to determine whether updates\nare appropriate. Where a director or officer has any interest in or a perceived conflict involving a contract or business\nrelationship with the Corporation, that director or officer is excluded from all discussions and deliberations regarding\nthe contract or relationship and such director abstains from voting in respect thereof. Directors and executive officers\nhave disclosed to the Corporation all directorships held by such member and the existence and nature of any interests\nthat could result in a conflict situation with the Corporation.\nThe Board has also adopted a whistleblower policy (the “Whistleblower Policy”) relating to the reporting of\ninappropriate activity to encourage and promote a culture of ethical business conduct. The Whistleblower Policy is\nintended to encourage and facilitate the reporting of questionable accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing\nmatters.\nNomination of Directors\nThe Human Resources and Corporate Governance Committee has the responsibility for reviewing the composition of\nthe Board by taking into account, among other things, its size and the particular competencies and skills of its\nmembers. The Human Resources and Corporate Governance Committee, in consultation with the Chairman of the\nBoard and Chief Executive Officer, will then identify potential Board nominees and recommend such nominees for\nelection as directors based on the competencies and skills each new member possesses in the context of the needs of\nthe Corporation. The Board as a whole is then responsible for nominating new directors. The Human Resources and\nCorporate Governance Committee is composed entirely of independent directors.\nThe Board seeks nominees that have the following characteristics: (i) a track record in general business management;\n(ii) special expertise in an area of strategic interest to the Corporation; (iii) the ability to devote time; and (iv) support\nfor the Corporation’s mission and strategic objectives.\nWhile the Corporation has not adopted a written policy relating to the identification and nomination of women\ndirectors, it recognizes that diversity is an economic driver of competitiveness for companies and it strives to promote\nan environment and culture conducive to the appointment of well qualified persons so that there is appropriate diversity\nto maximize the achievement of corporate goals. Gender of a potential candidate is one component in the overall list\nof factors the Human Resources and Corporate Governance Committee considers when selecting candidates for\nexecutive officer and senior manager appointments, and membership on the Board and its committees. The Human\nResources and Corporate Governance Committee is of the opinion that if gender was the overriding factor governing\nthe selection of Board nominees, it could unduly restrict the Board’s ability to select the most appropriate nominees\nand candidates. The Corporation has not adopted targets regarding women on the Board or women in executive officer\nand senior management positions as it does not believe that such targets are necessary at this time given the size of\nthe Board and that the director nomination process recognizes the benefits of diversity. There are currently two women\non the Board.\nDirector and Executive Compensation\nThe Human Resources and Corporate Governance Committee oversees the remuneration policies and practices of the\nCorporation. The principal responsibilities of the Human Resources and Corporate Governance Committee include:\n(i) considering the Corporation’s overall remuneration strategy and, where information is available, verifying the\nappropriateness of existing remuneration levels using external sources for comparison; (ii) comparing the nature and\namount of the Corporation’s directors’ and executive officers’ compensation to performance against goals set for the\nyear while considering relevant comparative information, independent expert advice and the financial position of the\nCorporation, and (iii) making recommendations to the Board in respect of director and executive officer remuneration\n27\nmatters, with the overall objective of ensuring maximum Shareholder benefit from the retention of high quality board\nand executive team members.\nBoard Assessments\nThe Board is responsible for ensuring that there is a process in place for annually evaluating the effectiveness and\ncontribution of the Chief Executive Officer, the Board, the committees of the Board, the Chairman of the Board and\nthe individual directors based on their applicable terms of reference or position description.\nThe objective of the assessments is to ensure the continued effectiveness of the Board in the execution of its\nresponsibilities and to contribute to a process of continuing improvement. In addition to any other matters the Board\ndeems relevant, the assessments may consider in the case of the Board or a committee, the applicable terms of\nreference, the applicable position descriptions, as well as the competencies and skills each individual director is\nexpected to bring to the Board.\nThe Human Resources and Corporate Governance Committee annually reviews and makes recommendations to the\nBoard on the method and content of such evaluations and oversees the evaluation process.\nBoard Committees\nThe Board has two standing committees, being the Audit Committee and the Human Resources and Corporate\nGovernance Committee. Below is a description of the committees and their current membership.\nAudit Committee\nThe Audit Committee oversees the accounting and financial reporting practices and procedures of the Corporation’s\nfinancial statements. The principal responsibilities of the Audit Committee include: (i) the integrity of the consolidated\nfinancial statements of the Corporation; (ii) the Corporation’s compliance with legal and regulatory requirements; (iii)\nthe public accountants’ qualifications and independence; and (iv) the performance of the Corporation’s internal audit\nfunction and public accountants. The Audit Committee shall oversee the preparation of and review the report required\nby the rules of any and all securities regulatory bodies to which the Corporation is subject to be included in the\nCorporation’s annual proxy statement.

The Board has not developed written position descriptions for the Chair of each\ncommittee of the Board. The Board believes that the charters of the Audit Committee and the Human Resources and\nCorporate Governance Committee adequately delineate the roles of the Chairs of such committees.

Only independent members may serve on any of the foregoing committees of the\nBoard. In addition to these regular committees, the Board may appoint ad hoc committees periodically to address\ncertain issues of a more short-term nature. Each of the standing committees of the Board will have its own charter.\nThe charter will set forth the responsibilities of each committee, procedures of the committee and how the committee\nwill report to the Board.\nDirectors must fulfill their responsibilities consistent with their fiduciary duty to the Company in compliance with all\napplicable laws and regulations.

GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE BUSINESS\n2.1 Overview\nProfound (NASDAQ: PROF; TSX: PRN) is a commercial-stage medical device company focused on the\ndevelopment and marketing of customizable, incision-free therapeutic systems for the image guided\nablation of diseased tissue utilizing its platform technologies and leveraging the healthcare system’s\nexisting imaging infrastructure. Profound’s lead product (the “TULSA-PRO system”) combines real-time\nMRI, robotically driven transurethral sweeping-action thermal ultrasound with closed-loop temperature\nfeedback control for the ablation of prostate tissue. The product is comprised of one-time-use devices and\ndurable equipment that are used in conjunction with a customer’s existing MRI scanner.\nIn August 2019, the TULSA-PRO system received FDA clearance as a Class II device in the United\nStates for thermal ablation of prescribed prostate tissue, using transurethral ultrasound ablation\n(“TULSA”) based on the Company sponsored (“TACT”) whole gland ablation pivotal clinical study. It is\nalso CE marked in the European Union (“EU”) for ablation of targeted prostate tissue (benign or\nmalignant). The TULSA-PRO system was approved by Health Canada in November 2019.\nProfound is deploying primarily a recurring revenue business model in the United States to market\nTULSA-PRO, charging a one-time payment that includes the supply of its one-time-use devices, use of\nthe system as well as the Company’s customer and technological support services (“Genius Services”)\nthat support each TULSA center with clinical and patient recruitment. Historically, Profound generated the\nmajority of its revenues from the limited commercialization of its systems in Europe and Asia and\ndeployed a more traditional hybrid pricing model, in that the Company charged for the durable device\nseparately as capital and an additional per patient charge for the one-time-use devices and associated\nGenius Services.\nProfound’s second product, the Sonalleve system, is CE marked in the EU for ablation of uterine fibroids\nand adenomyotic tissue, palliative pain relief associated with bone metastases, treatment of osteoid\nosteoma, and management of benign desmoid tumors and has also been approved by the regulatory\nbody in China and South Korea for non-invasive treatment of uterine fibroids. The Sonalleve system is\ncompatible only with certain Philips MRI’s.\n2.2 Three-Year History\nFiscal 2024 Highlights\nOn January 2, 2024, Profound completed an underwritten public offering, resulting in the issuance\n2,666,667 common shares at a price of $7.50 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of $20,000,000\n($18,238,000, net of transaction costs).\nOn January 16, 2024, Profound completed a non-brokered private placement, resulting in the issuance\n391,667 common shares at a price of $7.50 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of $2,938,000\n($2,841,000, net of transaction costs).\nFiscal 2023 Highlights\nOn March 7, 2023, Profound confirmed its current procedural terminology (“CPT®”) Category 1 application\nfor TULSA for the CPT® Editorial Panel Meeting on May 4-6, 2023.\nOn May 1, 2023, TULSA procedure was featured in the Scientific Program at the American Urological\nAssociation 2023 annual meeting.\nOn June 2, 2023, Profound Medical announced new CPT Category 1 Codes from the AMA for TULSA to\ntreat prostate diseases.\nOn September 6, 2023, Profound announced an At-The-Market offering of up to $30,000,000.\nOn September 25, 2023, Profound received US FDA 510(K) clearance for the TULSA-PRO thermal\nboost.\nFiscal 2022 Highlights\nOn January 18, 2022, Profound announced that the first patients had been treated in the Level 1\n“CAPTAIN” trial.\nOn March 1, 2022, Profound confirmed the TULSA-PRO system’s new compatibility with GE Healthcare’s\n3T MRI scanners, and signed the first site agreement for a TULSA-PRO® system interfaced with a GE\nscanner.\nOn May 17, 2022, Profound announced that multiple clinical presentations and product demonstrations\nwere performed at the American Urological Association’s 2022 Annual Meeting.\nOn September 2, 2022, Profound announced that it had withdrawn its CPT® Category 1 application for\nTransurethral Ultrasound Ablation (“TULSA”) from the September 2022 CPT® Editorial Panel Meeting,\nand the Company anticipates an updated application, which will include 2022 utilization data.\nOn September 15, 2022, Profound announced changes to its management structure to support continued\ngrowth of the Company, including the appointment of Abbey Goodman as Chief Commercial Officer – US\nand Hartmut Warnken as Chief Commercial Officer – Outside US.\nOn September 26, 2022, four-year follow-up data from Profound’s TACT pivotal clinical trial confirmed\ndurable and stable positive trends following treatment with TULSA PRO® of men with localized prostate\ncancer.\nOn November 3, 2022, Profound entered into the CIBC Loan Agreement and closed on a secured term\nloan with CIBC for gross total proceeds of C$10 million, maturing on November 3, 2027 with an interest\nrate based on CIBC’s prime rate plus 2%.\nFiscal 2021 Highlights\nOn March 3, 2021, Profound announced the appointment of Cynthia Lavoie to its board of directors.\nOn May 19, 2021, Profound announced the voting results from the 2021 Annual General Meeting of\nShareholders and management changes.\nITEM 3. NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS\n3.1 General\nWe are a commercial-stage medical device company focused on the development and marketing of\ncustomizable, incision-free therapeutic systems for the ablation of diseased tissue utilizing our platform\ntechnologies. Our lead product, the TULSA-PRO system, combines real-time MRI, robotically-driven\ntransurethral sweeping action/thermal ultrasound and closed-loop temperature feedback control to ablate\nwhole gland or physician defined region of malignant of benign prostate tissue. The TULSA-PRO system\nhas shown in clinical and commercial settings to be an effective tool for physicians who are treating\nprostate diseases including cancer and other conditions such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (“BPH”).\nIn August 2019, the TULSA-PRO system received FDA clearance as a Class II device in the United\nStates for thermal ablation of prescribed prostate tissue, using TULSA based on the Company’s TACT\nwhole gland ablation pivotal study. It is also CE Marked in the EU for ablation of targeted prostate tissue\n(benign or malignant). The TULSA-PRO system was approved by Health Canada in November 2019.\nOur Sonalleve system is CE Marked in the EU for ablation of uterine fibroids and adenomyotic tissue,\npalliative pain relief associated with bone metastases, treatment of osteoid osteoma, and management of\nbenign desmoid tumors and is also approved in China and South Korea for non-invasive treatment of\nuterine fibroids. In November 2020, the Sonalleve system received HDE approval from the FDA for\ntreatment of osteoid osteoma.\nOur systems are designed to be used with MRI scanners and are currently compatible with certain MRI\nscanners manufactured by Philips, Siemens and GE Healthcare. To date, we have primarily generated\nrevenues from the commercialization of our systems in the EU and Asia and from the introduction of\nTULSA in the United States in Q1, 2020. We continue to pursue additional regulatory approvals in\ninternational jurisdictions and invest in research and development and in clinical studies designed to\nincrease the body of evidence necessary to support customer coverage and reimbursement by third-party\npayors, including government programs and private health insurance plans in order to increase\ncommercial adoption of its products. We may also consider synergistic strategic acquisitions to expand\nthe applications of our platform technology and expand our commercial footprint.\nProfound’s business model in the United States is based primarily upon recurring revenues, charging a\none-time fee that includes a supply of one-time-use devices, use of the TULSA-PRO and its ‘Profound\nGenius Services’ that are designed to help practitioners come up to speed on productive use of the\nTULSA-PRO technology upon installation. In other international markets, Profound continues to deploy a\nbusiness model that consists of two components - sales of durable goods and one-time-use devices for\neach patient treated.\nOur financial strategy to date has been to raise sufficient funds through securities offerings and bank\nfinancings to fund specific programs within a focused budget, and following FDA clearance of our TULSA-\nPRO system received in August 2019, commercialization in the United States. As our commercialization\nefforts increase and/or further program development costs increase, we may need to raise additional\ncapital. See Item 4, “Risk Factors” for more information.\nOur Technology Platform\nBased on the Company’s TACT clinical data and additional studies conducted in the EU, we believe\nphysicians may elect to use TULSA-PRO to ablate benign or malignant prostate tissue in patients with a\nvariety of prostate diseases, including prostate cancer and BPH. Prostate cancer is one of the most\ncommon types of cancer affecting men. The annual incidence of newly diagnosed cases in 2023 is\nestimated to reach 288,300 in the United States according to the American Cancer Society. The\nAmerican Cancer Society further estimates that there are currently 5.8 million men living with prostate\ncancer in these two geographic regions. Although ten-year survival outcomes for prostate cancer remain\nfavorable, it is still one of most common causes of cancer deaths among men. BPH is a histologic\ndiagnosis that refers to the proliferation of smooth muscle and epithelial cells within the prostatic transition\nzone. According to the American Urological Association, BPH is nearly ubiquitous in the aging male\npopulation with worldwide autopsy proven histological prevalence increases starting at ages 40 to 45\nyears, reaching 60% at age 60 and 80% at age 80.\nTULSA-PRO delivers its ultrasound energy through a transurethral catheter, a one-time-use device that is\nplaced in the patient’s prostate through a natural orifice. Focused ultrasound energy is then delivered by\nthe catheter in the shape of a blade. Externally the catheter is connected to a software controlled robotic\nmanipulator that rotates up to 360-degree in a sweeping action to impart thermal energy and thus ablation\nof tissue. The real time temperature measurement of the prostate is coupled with closed loop process\ncontrol that measures the appropriate amount of ultrasound energy to gently heat the physician-\nprescribed region of prostate tissue to the target temperature to achieve cell kill without boiling or charring\nthe tissue. As a measure to keep the urethra within the prostate viable, the temperature of the\ntransurethral catheter is maintained at an appropriate level by circulating water inside the catheter.\nSimilarly, a water-cooled specially designed catheter is placed in the patient’s rectum during the ablation\nprocess to keep it protected from thermal damage during the procedure. The TULSA-PRO in conjunction\nwith its Thermal Boost module, enables surgeons to temporarily increase the ablation target temperature\nin prostate regions where advanced stage cancer might reside, further increasing their confidence that\naggressive cancer cells have been ablated. Profound believes that TULSA-PRO’s controlled and\nrelatively gentle heating process may result in lower post procedural pain and complications, reduced\npotential of life affecting side effects, and in significantly desirable shrinkage of the prostate via resorption\nof the dead tissue over time, which may provide a longer-term durable benefit.\nSonalleve delivers its ultrasound energy via a disc located outside the patient. Its ultrasound energy is\nfocused to create small cylindrical hot spots a certain distance into the patient. Overlapping cylinders\ncreate ablation of the physician-prescribed desired tissue. Similar to TULSA-PRO, Sonalleve also\nprovides for controlled temperature increases to achieve cell kill.\nThe physician is in charge of using the Profound devices and decides which tissue needs to be ablated to\nimpart therapeutic effect. Profound believes that in the hands of trained physicians, its systems have the\nability to provide customizable, incision-free ablative therapies with the precision of real-time MRI\nvisualization and thermometry, focused ultrasound and closed-loop temperature feedback control.\nProfound believes that its technology offers clinicians and appropriate patients a better alternative to\ntraditional surgical or radiation therapies, with respect to clinical outcomes, side effects and recovery time.\n3.2 Products\nTULSA-PRO\nClinical Studies\nIn March 2014, Profound completed enrollment and treatment of 30 patients in the Phase I TULSA multi-\njurisdictional safety and precision study. Based on the Phase I clinical trial results, in April 2016, Profound\nreceived a CE Certificate of Conformity for the TULSA-PRO system from our Notified Body in the EU, and\nin the fourth quarter of 2016, Profound initiated a pilot commercial launch of TULSA-PRO in key\nEuropean markets where the CE Mark is accepted.\nProfound received FDA clearance for the TULSA-PRO system in August 2019 for transurethral\nultrasound ablation of prostate tissue, based on the Company’s TACT Pivotal Clinical Trial. The TACT\nPivotal Clinical Trial is a prospective, open-label, single-arm pivotal clinical study, of 115 treatment-naïve\nlocalized prostate cancer patients across 13 research sites in the United States, Canada and Europe,\nwhich enrolled patients between August 2016 and February 2018.\nLocalized Prostate Cancer, Ablation Safety and Efficacy: TACT Pivotal Study\nThe TACT Pivotal Clinical Trial demonstrates that MRI-guided TULSA is a minimally invasive procedure\nfor effective prostate cancer ablation with a favorable side effect profile, minimal impact on quality of life\nand low rates of residual disease1. In the large, multi-center prospective study in men with predominately\nintermediate-risk prostate cancer, whole gland ablation sparing the urethra and apical sphincter with the\nTULSA-PRO met its primary regulatory endpoint of prostate-specific antigen (“PSA”) reduction in 96% of\nmen to a median nadir of 0.34 ng/ml and 0.5 ng/ml at 12 months. Median decrease in perfused prostate\nvolume as assessed by a central radiologist using 12-month MRI was 91%, from a median 37 cc to 2.8\ncc. At 12 months, extensive biopsy sampling of the markedly reduced prostate volume demonstrated a\nbenefit for nearly 80% of men. There was no evidence of cancer in 65% of men and 14% had low-volume\nclinically-insignificant disease. The authors, however, noted that thermally-fixed non-viable cells can\nretain their apparently-malignant tissue morphology, confounding Gleason grading and potentially\nintroducing false positives2. By two and five years, 7% and 21%, respectively, of men sought additional\ntreatment for their prostate cancer (prostatectomy, radiation). The study patient population, with two-thirds\nof those with Gleason Grade Group (GGG) ≥ 2 having either bilateral disease or at least five positive\ncores, allowed for evaluation of oncologically relevant secondary outcomes including PSA stability, post-\ntreatment biopsy, and salvage treatment. Notwithstanding the limitations of comparisons between ablative\nand extirpative therapies, the 21% 5-year rate of salvage treatment and 20% rate of residual clinically\nsignificant prostate cancer in intermediate-risk patients are in line with accepted rates of early failure or\nadditional intervention after standard treatments and goals for retreatment after ablative therapies. By five\nyears, the median PSA nadir further reduced to 0.26 ng/ml. PSA reduction was durable over the extended\nfollow-up period, from 0.53 ng/ml at one year to 0.63 ng/ml at five years.\nTULSA was associated with a high degree of safety and maintenance of quality-of-life, durable to five\nyears, comparing favorably to radical prostatectomy and other whole-gland ablation techniques. At 12\nmonths, 96% of men returned to baseline urinary continence, and 75% of potent men maintained or\nreturned to erections sufficient for penetration, with these rates remaining stable or further improving to\nfive years. A total of 12 grade 3 adverse events occurred in 8% of men, including genitourinary infection\n(4%), urethral stricture (2%), urinary retention (1.7%), urethral calculus and pain (1%), and urinoma (1%),\nall resolved by 12 months. There were no grade 4 events, rectal injuries, severe incontinence requiring\nsurgical intervention, or severe erectile dysfunction unresponsive to medication.\nPhase I Studies\nLocalized Prostate Cancer, Durability of Outcomes: Phase I Safety and Precision Study\nThe Phase I Clinical Trial demonstrates that MRI-guided TULSA is safe and precise for ablation in\npatients with localized prostate cancer, providing spatial ablation precision of ± 1.3 mm with a well-\ntolerated side-effect profile and minor or no impact on urinary, erectile and bowel function at 12 months3.\nThere were no grade 4 or higher adverse events, one transient attributable grade 3 event (epididymitis),\nand notably no injury to rectal or periprostatic structures. Functional outcomes, International Prostate\nSymptom Score (“IPSS”) and IIEF-15, both showed a favorable anticipated trend of initial deterioration\n1 Klotz et al, “MRI-guided transurethral ultrasound ablation of prostate cancer,” The Journal of Urology, 2020\n2 Anttinen et al, “Histopathological evaluation of prostate specimens after thermal ablation may be confounded by the presence of\nthermally-fixed cells,” International Journal of Hyperthermia, 2019\n3 Chin et al, “Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Guided Transurethral Ultrasound Ablation of Prostate Tissue in Patients with Localized\nProstate Cancer: A Prospective Phase 1 Clinical Trial,” European Urology, 2016; Bonekamp et al, “Twelve-month prostate\nvolume reduction after MRI-guided transurethral ultrasound ablation of the prostate,” European Radiology, 2018\nwith subsequent gradual improvement toward baseline levels. Consistent with the conservative whole-\ngland treatment plan which included a 3 mm circumferential margin expected to spare 10% viable\nprostate at the gland periphery, intra-operative MRI thermometry measured 90% thermal ablation of the\nprostate gland, median PSA decreased 90% from 5.8 ng/ml to nadir of 0.6 ng/ml, and median prostate\nvolume reduced by 88% on 1-year MRI. Prostate biopsy at one year identified decreased cancer burden\nwith 61% reduction in cancer length; however, attributable to the circumferential safety margin, clinically\nsignificant cancer in 9 of 29 men (31%), and any cancer in 16 of 29 (55%).\nFollow-up data to three and five years demonstrate durability of the outcomes, with continued treatment\nsafety and stable quality of life, as well as predictable PSA and biopsy oncological outcomes based on\ntreatment-day imaging and early PSA follow-up, without precluding any potential salvage therapy\noptions4. Repeat prostate biopsy at three years demonstrated durable histological outcomes, with only\none subject upgrading to GGG 1 from negative at 12 months, and one subject upgrading to GGG 2 from\nGGG 1 at 12 months. Between one and five years, there were no new serious adverse events. By five\nyears, 16 men completed protocol follow-up, three withdrew with PSA <0.4 ng/ml, 10 had salvage therapy\nwithout complications (six prostatectomy, three radiation and one laser ablation), and one died of an\nunrelated cause. Of 16 men with complete follow-up data, five-year median PSA remained at 0.55 ng/ml.\nMedian IPSS of 6 at baseline returned to 5 by three months, and 6.5 at five years. At baseline, 9 of 16\nhad erections sufficient for penetration, 11 of 16 at one year, and 7 of 16 at five years. All 16 subjects had\nleak-free, pad-free continence at one and five years. Predictors of salvage therapy included lower\nablation coverage and higher PSA nadir. At five years after TULSA, cancer specific survival is 100%, and\noverall survival 97%.\nBenign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH), Relief of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS): Phase I\nStudies\nPromising safety and feasibility of the TULSA-PRO® to relieve Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (“LUTS”)\nassociated with BPH has been demonstrated in two clinical studies showing improvements in IPSS\ncomparable to modern minimally invasive surgical therapies5. A retrospective analysis of a sub-group of\nnine men from the Phase I localized prostate cancer study who also had LUTS (baseline IPSS ≥ 12)\ndemonstrated significant IPSS improvement of 58% from 16.1 to 6.3 at 12 months (p=0.003), with at least\na moderate (≥ 6 points) symptom reduction in eight of nine patients. IPSS Quality of Life (“QoL”)\nimproved in eight of nine patients. Erectile function (IIEF-EF) remained stable from 14.6 at baseline to\n15.7 at 12 months. The proportion of patients with erections sufficient for penetration was unchanged. Full\nurinary continence (pad-free, leak-free) was achieved at 12 months in all patients. In five men who\nsuffered from more severe symptoms (baseline IPSS ≥ 12 and Qmax < 15 ml/s), peak urine flow rate\n(“Qmax”) increased from 11.6 ml/s to 22.5 ml/s at 12 months. All adverse events were mild to moderate\nwith no serious events reported.\nA prospective Phase I/II study of TULSA-PRO® for BPH has been conducted with early outcomes\npublished in 20226. All measures of urinary function and quality of life improved during the initial twelve-\nmonth follow up among the first ten patients treated, while no adverse effects were seen on sexual and\nbowel functions: average IPSS decreased from 17.5 to 4.0, IPSS QoL decreased from 4.0 to 0.5, and\nQmax increased from 12.4 ml/s to 21.8 ml/s, among several other improved urinary measures. A single\nserious adverse event had occurred, abscess of the epididymis requiring drainage at two weeks post\ntherapy. Enrollment of this study has been increased to 30 patients.\n4 Nair et al, “MRI-Guided Transurethral Ultrasound Ablation in Patients with Localized Prostate Cancer: Three Year Outcomes of a\nProspective Phase I Study”, BJU International, 2020; Nair et al, “PD17-03 Five-Year Outcomes from a Prospective Phase I\nStudy of MRI-Guided Transurethral Ultrasound Ablation in Men with Localized Prostate Cancer”, AUA 2020 Virtual Experience,\nAbstract in The Journal of Urology, 2020; Hatiboglu et al, “Durability of functional outcomes after MRI-guided transurethral\nultrasound ablation of the prostate,” JU Open Plus, 2023.\n5 Elterman et al, “Relief of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms after MRI-Guided Transurethral Ultrasound Ablation (TULSA) for\nlocalized prostate cancer: Subgroup Analyses in Patients with concurrent cancer and Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,” Journal of\nEndourology, 2020; Anttinen et al, “Transurethral ultrasound therapy for benign prostatic obstruction in humans,” EAU 2020\nConference Presentation\n6 Viitala et al, “Magnetic resonance imaging-guided transurethral ultrasound ablation for benign prostatic hyperplasia: 12-month\nclinical outcomes of a phase I study,” BJU Int, 2022.\nRadio-recurrent localized prostate cancer, Salvage TULSA (sTULSA): Phase I Study\nSalvage ablation of radio-recurrent localized prostate cancer has been evaluated in a prospective Phase\nI/II study of TULSA-PRO with early outcomes published in 20207. The report includes the first eleven\npatients from a 40-patient study, who were successfully treated, and discharged on the first postoperative\nday, with median catheterization time of seven days. Median PSA decreased from 7.6 ng/ml at baseline\nto a nadir of 0.2 ng/ml and was 0.23 ng/ml at 12 months. At 12 months, 10/11 patients were free of any\nPCa in the targeted ablation zone, confirmed with biopsy and imaging (MRI and PSMA-PET), and had\nlow and stable PSA. Four patients had prolonged catheterization and subsequent urinary tract infection,\nand one of these patients had upper urinary tract dilation treated with double-J-stents.\nPalliation of symptomatic locally advanced prostate cancer, Palliative TULSA (pTULSA): Phase I\nStudy\nPatients with symptomatic locally advanced prostate cancer can suffer from severe urinary retention due\nto bladder outlet obstruction, intractable hematuria and frequent hospitalization. While these\ncomplications are commonly treated by palliative transurethral resection of the prostate (“TURP”), the\nimprovement is often insufficient and may exclude patients who cannot discontinue anticoagulants. The\nsafety and feasibility of MRI-guided TULSA was evaluated as an alternative palliative treatment option for\nmen suffering from symptomatic locally advanced prostate cancer8. Ten patients with locally advanced\nprostate cancer were enrolled, half with clinical stage T4 disease and half with clinical T3. Prior to TULSA,\nall patients had continuous indwelling catheterization due to urinary retention, and 90% had history of\nrecurrent and/or ongoing gross hematuria. Three patients had palliative TURP performed six months prior\nto receiving palliative TULSA, all of which were unsuccessful. One week after palliative TULSA, 50% of\nmen were catheter-free. At last follow-up, 100% of men were free of gross hematuria, and 80% had an\nimprovement in catheterization, with 70% completely catheter-free. Notably, the average hospitalization\ntime from local complications reduced from 7.3 to 1.4 days in the six-month period before and after\npalliative TULSA. All adverse events were related to urinary tract infections, with two patients requiring\nintravenous administration of antibiotics and three patients resolved with oral antibiotics alone. No other\ntreatment related adverse events were recorded, with no rectal injury or fistula. Further, there was no\nneed for blood transfusions and there was no perioperative mortality.\nCAPTAIN trial\nCAPTAIN (A Comparison of TULSA Procedure vs. Radical Prostatectomy in Participants with Localized\nProstate Cancer) is a prospective, multi-centre randomized controlled trial of 201 patients aimed at\ncomparing the safety and efficacy of the TULSA procedure (performed with the TULSA-PRO® system)\nwith radical prostatectomy (“RP”) in men with organ-confined, intermediate-risk, Gleason Score 7 (Grade\nGroup 2 and 3) prostate cancer. In the CAPTAIN trial, 134 patients will be randomized to receive one or\ntwo TULSA procedures and 67 patients will be randomized to receive RP. The trial takes place primarily\nin the United States, with additional two sites in Canada and one in Europe. Of those, sixteen sites have\nbeen activated to date and are currently recruiting patients.\nRP is currently the gold-standard surgical treatment for intermediate-risk prostate cancer. RP effectively\ncontrols disease but carries risk of significant side effects such as long-term erectile dysfunction and\nurinary incontinence. The TULSA procedure combines transurethral, robotically-driven therapeutic\nultrasound with real-time visualization of temperature and automated control of heating from magnetic\nresonance thermometry. The high spatial, thermal, and anatomic resolution of the target volume enables\nprecise ablation of prostate tissue while sparing functionally important structures, potentially reducing the\nrisk of side effects relative to RP.\n7 Anttinen et al, “Salvage Magnetic Resonance Imaging–guided Transurethral Ultrasound Ablation for Localized Radiorecurrent\nProstate Cancer: 12-Month Functional and Oncological Results,” European Urology Open Science, 2020.\n8 Anttinen et al, “Palliative MRI-guided transurethral ultrasound ablation for symptomatic locally advanced prostate cancer,”\nScandinavian Journal of Urology, 2020\nThe goal of the CAPTAIN trial is to demonstrate that the efficacy of the TULSA procedure is not inferior to\nRP, while demonstrating superior quality of life outcomes in patients receiving the TULSA procedure as\ncompared to those patients receiving RP. The primary safety endpoint is the proportion of patients who\npreserve both erectile potency and urinary continence at one year after treatment. The primary efficacy\nendpoint is the proportion of patients who are free from any additional treatment for prostate cancer by\nthree years after treatment. Secondary endpoints include comparison of rates of complications, cost\neffectiveness, and timing of the return to baseline activity. Long-term follow-up will be gathered for up to\n10 years after treatment.\nSonalleve\nProfound’s Sonalleve system combines real-time MRI and thermometry with focused ultrasound delivered\nfrom the outside of the patient to enable precise and incision-free ablation of diseased tissue. Profound\nacquired the Sonalleve technology from Philips in 2017.\nThe Sonalleve system is CE marked in the EU for ablation of uterine fibroids and adenomyotic tissue,\npalliative pain relief associated with bone metastases, treatment of osteoid osteoma, and management of\nbenign desmoid tumors. The uterine fibroids application is also available for sale in Canada. In 2018, the\nSonalleve system was also approved in China and South Korea by the National Medical Products\nAdministration for the non-invasive treatment of uterine fibroids. Philips Oy registered Sonalleve in\nseveral Middle East, and South East Asian countries. In 2020 Sonalleve also received HDE from the U.S.\nFDA for treatment of Osteoid Osteoma.\nSonalleve Clinical Applications\nUterine Fibroids and Adenomyosis\nUterine fibroids (“UFs”) are the most common non-cancerous tumors in women of childbearing age. Both\nsurgical and medical treatments are available and the choice depends on number, size, and location of\nUFs, patient’s age and preferences, and pregnancy expectations. To date, symptomatic UFs have been\nmostly treated with radical surgery (hysterectomy) in women who have completed childbearing, or\nconservative surgery (myomectomy and endometrial ablation) in women who wish to preserve fertility.\nToday, the radiologist also has interventional options available. Minimally or non-invasive interventional\nradiology procedures include uterine artery embolization.\nThere is currently no ideal treatment for adenomyosis, and new options are needed. Drawing on\nexperience of treatment of uterine fibroids, MR-HIFU has been explored as a potential new conservative\ntreatment and MR-HIFU is an early-stage, non-invasive, therapeutic technology with the potential to\nimprove the quality of life and decrease the cost of care for patients with adenomyosis.\nTo achieve its current regulatory clearances, the Sonalleve MR-HIFU System has undergone several\nstudies and clinical trials for uterine applications at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre (Toronto,\nOntario), University Medical Center Utrecht (Utrecht, the Netherlands), University Hospital St. André\n(Bordeaux, France), Samsung Medical Center (Seoul, Korea), Peking University First Hospital Beijing\n(Beijing, China), First Affiliated Hospital of Medical College of Xi'an Jiaotong University (Xi'an, China),\nTurku University Hospital (Turku, Finland), National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD, USA), St. Luke’s\nEpiscopal Hospital (Houston, TX, USA), and others.\nIn addition, a comprehensive literature review provides supportive evidence showcasing the beneficial\naction of MR-HIFU in uterine fibroid and adenomyosis therapy. These studies include the Verpalen et al.\n2020, Nguyen 2020, Yeo et al. 2017, Kim et al. 2017, and Hocquelet et al. 2017 that utilized the\nSonalleve MR-HIFU system. Specifically, the studies show impressive performance in terms of ablation\nefficiency, therapeutic efficacy, symptom reduction, and/or QoL improvement. There were no treatment-\nrelated serious adverse events in any of these studies, although Browne et al. 2020 describes a\nprocedure-related major complication in the form of deep vein thrombosis that was noted in one patient\n(0.8%) and subsequently and successfully treated with anticoagulation therapy. Minor adverse events,\nwhen present, typically include 1st and 2nd degree skin burns, local swelling, cramps, leg pain,\nabdominal pain, buttock pain, and back pain, which are all known and anticipated adverse events of MR-\nHIFU therapy.\nPalliative Bone Pain Treatment\nPain caused by bone metastases are common in the event of malignancy and are inevitably associated\nwith serious complications that may deteriorate the QoL of patients and become life threatening.\nFor patients with bone metastases, clinical evaluation reports (GCP-10277 Rev. B) were completed in\nOctober, 2020 showing significant decrease in pain score, dosage of medication, or quality of life are to\nbe expected with MR-HIFU bone therapy. The randomized controlled Phase III study by Hurwitz et al.\nrepresents some of the most important clinical data that has been reported. In 112 subjects receiving MR-\nHIFU compared against 35 subjects receiving sham treatment, significant pain reduction at 3 months\n(decrease in worst NRS pain ≥ 2 without increase in pain medication) was 64.3% vs. 20.0% (p<0.001),\nwith mean NRS reduction of 3.6 ± 3.1 vs. 0.7 ± 2.4 from an initial median NRS score of 7.0 in both\ngroups. Improvement in average BPI-QoL at 3 months was 2.4 points superior in the MR-HIFU group\n(p<0.001), representing a clinically important reduction in impairment caused by bone metastasis pain.\nThe clinical data show that patients with bone metastases can expect a statistically significant decrease in\npain scores and/or in medication dosage and increase in quality of life with MR-HIFU bone metastasis\ntherapy.\nOsteoid Osteoma Treatment\nOsteoid osteoma is a relative rare, painful bone tumor that typically occurs in the cortex of long bones,\nespecially in children and adolescents, and accounts for approximately 10% of all benign bone tumors.\nCurrent osteoid osteoma treatment options include surgery and radiofrequency ablation, which is a less\ninvasive option than surgical resection. Although RFA can have a high success rate, the treatment is\ninvasive and can potentially cause minor and major complications. It also exposes patients and operators\nto ionizing radiation associated with the CT imaging guidance.\nSonalleve MR-HIFU provides an optimal therapy choice for osteoid osteoma which is a precise,\ncompletely non-invasive, and free from ionizing radiation treatment.\nThe recent studies have assessed the use of Sonalleve MR-HIFU in treatment of osteoid osteoma,\nshowing a high clinical success rate and complete symptom resolution without any serious adverse\neffects and only few minor adverse effects that promptly resolve. The Sonalleve MR-HIFU device offers a\nnovel, minimally invasive, MRI-guided method to treat osteoid osteoma safely and effectively. A desmoid\ntumor, also called desmoid fibromatosis or aggressive fibromatosis, is a non-metastasizing but locally\naggressive proliferation of myofibroblasts that affects children and adults, with a peak incidence in early\nadulthood. Traditional management of desmoid tumors includes observation, surgical resection, radiation,\nand/or chemotherapy. Observation allows assessment of the rate of tumor growth and may be acceptable\nin small, slow-growing, or asymptomatic lesions. Surgical resection is often a highly morbid procedure\nand has a high rate of recurrence even with negative margins. Radiotherapy provides somewhat\nimproved local control rates but the morbidity from radiation, including burns, fibrosis, chronic edema, and\npathologic fractures, is problematic. In addition, the small but finite risk of a radiation-induced malignancy\nis particularly troublesome in this young patient population, considering the tumor being treated is benign.\nRecently, MR-HIFU has been assessed as a non-invasive therapy of desmoid tumors, showing good\nclinical success and even complete tumor eradication in some cases with low number and relative mild\nadverse events, which typically promptly resolve. The Sonalleve MR-HIFU device offers a novel, non-\ninvasive, MRI-guided method to treat desmoid tumors.\nThis technology is ideally suited for the treatment of desmoid tumors in a patient population that is\ngenerally young, otherwise healthy, and would like to avoid the morbidity of traditional surgical, radiation,\nand medical therapies for a benign disease. Magnetic resonance imaging provides visualization of critical\nneurovascular structures and allows sparing of these structures during therapy. While complete ablation\nof a desmoid tumor may not be possible in all cases because of involvement of these structures,\nsignificant reduction in tumor volume is often obtained with a corresponding improvement in pain and\nfunctional impairment. As the natural history of the disease often involves recurrence, the ability to re-\ntreat with MR-HIFU without an upper dose limit is also an advantage. The clinical evidence to date\ndemonstrates that MR-HIFU provides a safe and effective treatment of desmoid tumors.\n3.3 Business Strategy\nProfound initiated its launch of the TULSA-PRO system in the United States in Q4 2019 and the first\npatient was treated in the United States in a non-clinical trial setting in January 2020. Since then,\nProfound’s business model has evolved to a recurring revenue model that includes durable hardware\nusage, one-time-use devices and Profound’s Genius service, which includes necessary support for a\nproductive start-up of the practice.\nProfound generates revenues from capital sales, one-time-use devices and related services, in the EU\n(principally in Germany) and Asia. For the year ended December 31, 2023, approximately 71%, 26% and\n3% of revenues were generated in the United States, EU and Asia, respectively, compared to\napproximately 51%, 27% and 22% of revenues were generated in the United States, EU and Asia,\nrespectively for the year ended December 31, 2022. Revenue on a quarter over quarter basis is expected\nto fluctuate given the Company maintaining a limited European commercial effort and remains primarily\nfocused on the U.S. market.\nOn January 10, 2020, Profound announced the signing of its first-ever US multi-site imaging center\nagreement for TULSA-PRO with RadNet, Inc., an owner and operator of outpatient imaging centers,\npursuant to which Profound will install TULSA-PRO systems at three RadNet imaging centers in the\ngreater Los Angeles.\nProfound’s TULSA-PRO system is primarily marketed to early adopter physicians who specialize in\ntreatment of prostate disease including urologists and radiologists at opinion leading hospitals. TULSA-\nPRO services are available at either independent imaging centers or at hospital-based imaging centers.\nHistorically treatment of conditions such as localized prostate disease and uterine fibroids have included\nsurgical intervention. Over time, surgery has evolved from an ‘open’ technique, to laparoscopic, to robotic\nsurgery. The motivation of surgeons behind this evolution has been to perform procedures that reduce\ninvasiveness, improve clinical outcomes and reduce recovery times. Profound is now taking this concept\nto the next level by enabling customizable, incision-free therapies for the MRI-guided ablation of diseased\ntissue with the TULSA-PRO and Sonalleve systems. These incision-free and radiation-free procedures\noffer surgeons the option of providing predictable and customizable procedures that eliminate\ninvasiveness, offer the potential to improve clinical outcomes and further reduce hospital stays and\npatient recovery times.\nProfound is establishing its own direct sales and marketing teams for sales of TULSA-PRO systems and\nthe one-time-use devices related thereto, as well as for Sonalleve systems in the jurisdictions where it is\napproved. The primary focus of Profound’s direct sales team is to cultivate adoption of the TULSA-PRO\ntechnology, support clinical customers with the TULSA-PRO procedures and increase the utilization of\nthe systems and one-time-use devices. Profound expects to generate recurring revenues from the use of\nthe system, one-time-use devices, clinical support and service maintenance.\nProfound also collaborates with its strategic partners Philips and Siemens for lead generation and\ndistribution of durable equipment, which are currently available through the Philips and Siemens sales\ncatalogs.\nOn December 21, 2020, Profound entered into a co-development agreement with GE Healthcare (the\n“GE Agreement”) whereby GE Healthcare and Profound have agreed to a non-exclusive, worldwide\nlicense that will enable Profound to interface its TULSA-PRO system with certain GE Healthcare MRI\nscanners. The collaboration with GE Healthcare expands our potential to interface with a significant\nportion of GE’s new and currently installed MRI scanners globally. In March 2022, Profound confirmed the\nTULSA-PRO system’s new compatibility with GE Healthcare’s 3T MRI scanners and signed the first site\nagreement for a TULSA-PRO® system interfaced with a GE scanner.\n3.4 Manufacturing Operations\nThe Company operates from leased premises in two different locations. We do not own any real estate\nproperty.\nLocation Area Premise Use Expiry Date\n2400 Skymark Ave, Unit 6, 38,148 ft2 Corporate offices and administration, September 30,\nMississauga, ON, Canada Manufacturing, Research and 2026\nDevelopment\nÄyritie 4B, 01510 Vantaa, 6,372 ft2 Manufacturing, Research and December 31,\nFinland Development 2025\nWe manufacture TULSA-PRO and SONALLEVE systems at dedicated manufacturing facilities located in\nCanada and Finland which are ISO 13485 certified. Our manufacturing model consists primarily of\noutsourcing sub-assemblies where it is most cost effective to do so, while assembling and quality testing\nthe final products in-house. Additionally, single use products are assembled entirely in the Mississauga\nfacility within a class 300 clean room. We believe our manufacturing facilities have sufficient capacity to\nmeet its manufacturing needs through the foreseeable future.\nProfound has in place supply agreements with manufacturers of key technologies and components.\nProfound and strategically located service partners handle equipment installation and field service\nglobally.\n3.5 Competition\nTULSA-PRO\nThe TULSA-PRO system is intended to ablate benign and malignant prostate tissue, however there are\nother treatment options for prostate disease. There are currently no marketed devices indicated for the\ntreatment of prostate diseases or prostate cancer and our FDA indication and CE Mark in the EU also do\nnot include treatment of any particular disease or condition. However, there are a number of devices\nindicated for the destruction or removal of prostate tissue and devices indicated for use in performing\nsurgical procedures that physicians and surgeons currently utilize when treating patients with prostate\ndisease, including prostate cancer. Approaches that physicians and surgeons currently use to address\nprostate disease include: (1) watchful waiting/active surveillance; (2) simple prostatectomy; (3) radical\nprostatectomy (includes open, laparoscopic and robotic procedures); (4) radiation therapies including,\nexternal beam radiation therapy, brachytherapy and high dose radiation; (5) cryoablation; and (6) trans-\nrectal high intensity focused ultrasound (“HIFU”). In addition, certain adjunct or less common procedures\nare used or are under development to address prostate disease, such as androgen deprivation therapy\nand proton beam therapy.\nEach of the foregoing competing options have their own limitations and benefits and may only be\nappropriate for limited patient populations. For example, active surveillance is generally recommended for\npatients who have been diagnosed with earlier stage, lower risk, disease where the possibility of side\neffects from intervention may outweigh the expected benefit of the chosen procedure. For clinicians and\npatients, the gap between active surveillance and the most commonly utilized options of surgery or\nradiation therapy imposes the possibility of substantial side effects, creating a need for a less invasive\nmethodology to remove diseased prostate tissue that is both radiation- and incision-free and provides a\nmore favorable side-effect profile.\nWe believe that the flexibility of the TULSA-PRO system may allow the Company to demonstrate its use\nas a tool for ablating benign and malignant diseased prostate tissue with greater speed and precision\nthan current options while minimizing potential side effects. We believe that the TULSA-PRO system may\novercome certain limitations of other devices and methodologies for removing or addressing diseased\nprostate tissue including HIFU, such as complications associated with trans-rectal delivery and limitations\nrelating to prostate size. We believe that a transurethral (inside out) ablation approach with millimeter\naccuracy has advantages over HIFU in ablating the whole gland safely.\nWatchful Waiting; Active Surveillance\nWatchful waiting means no treatment until there is an indication that the cancer has spread. Active\nsurveillance is monitoring of the prostate cancer closely with PSA tests and digital rectal exams. Prostate\nbiopsies may also be done to see if the cancer is becoming more aggressive. Test results will indicate\nwhether a more aggressive treatment option should be considered.\nSimple Prostatectomy\nSimple prostatectomy is recommended for men with severe urinary symptoms caused by an obstructive\nprostate gland and whose symptoms are not responsive to other medical or minimally-invasive therapies.\nSimple prostatectomy involves removing only the obstructive portion of the prostate gland rather than the\nentire gland and surrounding tissue. A simple prostatectomy can be open or robotic. Open simple\nprostatectomy can be conducted through retropubic, suprapubic, or perineal routes. Simple\nprostatectomy has higher morbidity and longer hospitalization in comparison to less invasive therapies\nsuch as transurethral resection of the prostate. Simple prostatectomy is contraindicated in the presence\nof cancer.\nRadical Prostatectomy\nRadical prostatectomy, an open surgical removal of the entire prostate gland and some surrounding\ntissues, represents a current standard of care, practiced by urologists in North America and Europe,\nwhich procedure involves the removal of the localized cancerous tissue. However, the conventional open\nsurgical technique has high post-surgery incidences of impotence and incontinence and long recovery\ntime. Relatively recently, robotic surgery systems have become more common in the market. Cited\nbenefits of the robotic technique include improved precision and range of motion. Risks specific to the\nrobotic technique include longer operation time, the possible need to convert the procedure to a non-\nrobotic approach, and the need for additional or larger incision sites. Converting the procedure could\nmean a longer operation time, resulting in a longer time under anesthesia.\nExternal Beam Radiation Therapy (“EBRT”)\nEBRT requires multiple weekly clinic visits over a period of six to eight weeks. The procedure directs a\nbeam of radiation from outside the body to cancerous tissue inside the body. Although such procedures\nare relatively costly with studies showing significant risk of collateral damage and lengthy recovery times,\nit is non-invasive. It can also be used to irradiate cancer that has spread to other areas.\nBrachytherapy and High Dose Radiation\nWith brachytherapy, radioactive seeds are implanted in the prostate to irradiate the cancerous tissue. The\nseeds irradiate the prostate over time and decay in place to background levels; they remain implanted\nand inert afterwards. Side effects of brachytherapy are similar to those of EBRT in terms of urinary, bowel\nand erectile function. An alternative is HDR, in which highly radioactive seeds are temporarily inserted,\nthen removed during the same procedure, leaving nothing implanted afterward. HDR has the ability to\ntarget tissue, but requires hospital stays and usually is accompanied by adjunct EBRT over several\nweeks.\nCryoablation\nCryoablation freezes cells to death by introducing cooled liquids and gases to an area of cancerous\ntissue. Studies show cryoablation offers poor precision and has delivered impotence rates that are almost\nas high as those for conventional radical prostatectomy. The procedure also carries a risk of potential\ndamage to the tissue between the urethra and rectum, potentially resulting in a urinary rectal fistulas.\nTrans-rectal High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (“HIFU”)\nTrans-rectal HIFU is used increasingly in the European Union, United States and Canada. This technique\nutilizes focused ultrasound that is delivered through the rectal wall to treat the prostate. Image guidance is\ngenerally provided by ultrasound. At an FDA urology panel meeting in 2014, the panel indicated that\nHIFU can lead to complications such as rectal fistulae and rectal incontinence. Due to the focused\ntreatment zone, this treatment requires approximately three hours to complete. One limitation of HIFU is\nprostate size; the procedure is limited to patients with prostate volume smaller than 40 cubic centimeters.\nPatients with larger prostates need a separate surgical procedure, such as TURP or ADT, both described\nbelow, to de-bulk or reduce the size of the prostate prior to HIFU. This additional procedure increases\ncosts and the risk of complications. Recent studies have indicated positive survival outcomes and thermal\nultrasound appears to be gaining traction in certain settings.\nAdjunct and Emerging Therapies\nAndrogen deprivation therapy (“ADT”), uses hormones to suppress testosterone production and alleviate\nsymptoms, but with the primary side-effect of reduced sexual interest and activity. Although historically\nused as a last line of defense for the disease (and typically in a palliative setting), it is increasingly used\nas a first line treatment or in combination with other treatments.\nTURP is a surgical procedure that removes portions of the prostate gland through the penis. This\nprocedure is used to relieve moderate to severe urinary symptoms caused by an enlarged prostate, a\ncondition known as BPH. This procedure is also used in adjunct to a HIFU procedure when a prostate\ngland is larger than 40 cubic centimeters.\nProton beam therapy is a way to deliver radiation to tumors using tiny, sub-atomic particles (protons)\ninstead of the photons used in conventional radiation treatment. Proton beam therapy uses new\ntechnology to accelerate atoms to approximately 93,000 miles per second, separating the protons from\nthe atom. While moving at this high speed, the particles are “fired” at the patient’s tumor. These charged\nparticles deliver a very high dose of radiation to the cancer but release very little radiation to the normal\ntissue in their path. In theory, this approach minimizes damage to healthy organs and structures\nsurrounding the cancer. The radiation beams must pass through the skin, the bladder and the rectum on\nthe way to the prostate gland, and once they reach the gland, they encounter normal prostate cells and\nthe nerves that control penile erections. Damage to these tissues can lead to complications, including\nbladder problems, rectal leakage or bleeding, and erectile dysfunction.\nWe believe that use of the TULSA-PRO system as a tool to ablate prostate tissue can provide a clinician\nand his or her patients with the following clinical advantages:\n• Clinically shown to have millimeter accuracy designed to ablate prostate tissue while sparing\nnearby critical structures, and that real time MR thermometry also ensures precision in ablation\ntemperature, minimizing side effects that can occur from overheating;\n• Enables clinician to define the boundaries of the tissue to be ablated, whether the whole prostate\nor any of its subsections, to ensure customization of the needs of each patient;\n• Transurethral approach allows for ablation of even the largest prostates that may be 120 cubic\ncentimeters or larger in size;\n• Potential to be a single outpatient procedure with a rapid recovery time; and\n• Designed to be compatible with leading MRI platforms and could become part of a continuum of\ncare from MR imaging diagnosis, MR guided biopsy to MR guided treatment.\nWe believe that the flexibility of the TULSA-PRO system may allow us to demonstrate its use as a tool for\nablating benign and malignant diseased prostate tissue with greater speed and precisions than current\noptions while minimizing potential side effects. We believe that the TULSA-PRO system may overcome\ncertain limitations of other devices and methodologies for removing or addressing disease prostate tissue\nincluding HIFU, such as complications associated with trans-rectal delivery and limitations relating to\nprostate size. We believe that a transurethral (inside out) ablation approach with millimeter accuracy has\nadvantages over HIFU in ablating the whole gland safely.\nSonalleve\nThe treatment choices for uterine fibroids usually depend on the symptoms of the patient, size of the\nfibroid, desire for future pregnancy, and preference of the treating gynecologist. Most common treatment\noptions for uterine fibroids include: (1) hormonal medications including gonadotrophin releasing hormone\nagonists (“Gn-RH”); (2) progesterone releasing intra-uterine devices; (3) surgical procedures such as\nhysterectomy and myomectomy; and (4) uterine artery embolization.\nWe believe that the Sonalleve system may provide a treatment option that is more convenient and\ncomfortable with less side effects than surgical procedures, such as hysterectomy or myomectomy.\nHormonal Medications\nFibroids can be treated with hormonal drugs, such as Gn-RH agonists. Gn-RH agonists can treat fibroids\nby blocking the production of estrogen and progesterone, putting women into a temporary\npostmenopausal state. As a result, menstruation stops, fibroids shrink and anemia is often alleviated.\nOther hormonal medications can also be utilized in patients with uterine fibroids. In many cases, however,\nmedication may provide only temporary relief from the symptoms caused by fibroids. The symptoms often\nreturn when the patient stops taking the medication. Moreover, the side effects of some drugs may cause\nthem to be unsuitable for some patients. Gn-RH agonists typically are used for no more than three to six\nmonths because long-term use can cause loss of bone.\nProgesterone Releasing Intra-Uterine Devices\nProgesterone releasing intra-uterine devices can relieve heavy bleeding caused by fibroids. However,\nthese devices can only provide symptom relief and do not impact the fibroid itself.\nUterine Artery Embolization\nUterine artery embolization involves injection of embolic agents into the arteries that supply the uterus,\nthereby cutting off the blood supply to the fibroids. Many women require at least one day of hospitalization\nand heavy pain medication. The prolonged pain may slow down the recovery period. Complications may\noccur if the blood supply to the ovaries or other organs is compromised.\nSurgery\nSurgical options for the treatment of uterine fibroids include hysterectomy and myomectomy.\nHysterectomy is a surgical procedure which involves the complete removal of uterus with or without\nremoval of the cervix, ovaries and fallopian tubes. Hysterectomy can be performed abdominally in an\nopen, laparoscopic, robotic-assisted or vaginal method. Surgical options are associated with blood loss,\nhospital stays, long recovery times, pain and scarring. Post-operative complications can include\ninfections, urinary incontinence, vaginal prolapse, fistula formation and chronic pain. After a\nhysterectomy, a woman will enter menopause and is infertile. Myomectomy is a surgical procedure to\nremove uterine fibroids from the wall of the uterus. The procedure can be performed with an abdominal\nincision, laparoscopic, or hysteroscopic.\nCurrent osteoid osteoma treatment options include surgery and radiofrequency ablation, which is a less\ninvasive option than surgical resection. Although RFA can have a high success rate, the treatment is\ninvasive and can potentially cause minor and major complications. It also exposes patients and operators\nto ionizing radiation associated with the CT imaging guidance.\nWe believe that use of the Sonalleve system as a tool to ablate uterine fibroids or osteoid osteoma can\nprovide a clinician and his or her patients with the following clinical advantages:\n• Millimeter accuracy designed to ablate uterine fibroid while sparing nearby critical structures;\n• Outpatient procedure with rapid recovery time, not requiring general anesthesia; and\n• Non-invasive approach using thermal ablation designed to heat the uterine fibroid; and guided by\nreal-time MRI with temperature (thermometry) feedback.\n3.6 Alliances and Partnerships\nPhilips\nOn July 31, 2017, Profound acquired the Sonalleve technology, which is used in our Sonalleve system\n(the “Sonalleve Transaction”).\nProfound also entered into several other agreements with Philips, including (1) a supply agreement dated\nJuly 31, 2017 with Philips Medical Systems Nederland B.V. (“Philips Medical”), pursuant to which Philips\nis required to manufacture our Sonalleve systems for a certain period; (2) a noncompetition,\nnonsolicitation and confidentiality agreement dated July 31, 2017 with Philips (the “Philips\nConfidentiality Agreement”), whereby Philips agreed to certain non-competition terms; and (3) a resale\npurchasing agreement dated July 31, 2017 (“Philips Resale Purchasing Agreement”) with Philips\nMedical, whereby Philips is permitted to purchase and resell certain of our products to its customers. For\nmore details on these agreements, see Item 16, “Material Contracts”.\nSiemens\nOn February 11, 2019, Profound entered into the New Siemens Agreement, effective as of January 21,\n2019. Under the New Siemens Agreement, all prior financial commitments and obligations owed to\nSiemens were released and replaced with a one-time fixed license fee and per annum payments\ncalculated based on annual volume of our systems interfaced to a Siemens MRI scanner. The initial term\nof the New Siemens Agreement is five years and will be automatically extended for successive terms of\none year thereafter unless terminated earlier. We also obtained a non-exclusive license to Siemens\nAccess I interface software and reasonable support for the term of the New Siemens Agreement.\nGE Healthcare\nOn December 21, 2020, Profound entered into a co-development agreement with GE Healthcare\nwhereby GE Healthcare and Profound have agreed to a non-exclusive, worldwide license that will enable\nProfound to interface its TULSA-PRO system with certain GE Healthcare MRI scanners. The\ncollaboration with GE Healthcare expands our potential to interface with a significant portion of GE’s new\nand currently installed MRI scanners globally. In March 2022, Profound confirmed the TULSA-PRO\nsystem’s new compatibility with GE Healthcare’s 3T MRI scanners and signed the first site agreement for\na TULSA-PRO® system interfaced with a GE scanner.\nKnight\nKnight acts as Profounds exclusive distributor for TULSA-PRO in Canada pursuant to a 10-year\ndistribution, license and supply agreement initially entered into in April 2015 (which may be extended for\nsuccessive 10-year periods at the option of either party). Currently, Profound are not planning any\nsignificant commercialization efforts in Canada.\nManufacturing and Supply\nProfound relies principally on third parties for the manufacturing of the components of our system;\nhowever, we are responsible for assembly and testing.\nProfound has designed the TULSA-PRO system to be capable of integration with some of the MRI\nscanners from three of the major MRI manufacturers (Philips, Siemens and GE Healthcare) and the\nSonalleve system with one MRI manufacturer (Philips). As not all hospital and treatment facilities utilize\nMRI scanners that are compatible with the TULSA-PRO and Sonalleve systems, such facilities would be\nrequired to acquire compatible MRI technology, which may involve additional capital expenditure and\nwhich could restrict or delay utilization of the systems by such facilities. Accordingly, we intend to expand\ncompatibility of the systems with other MRI scanners in the future.\nProfound’s systems are assembled from off-the-shelf and custom-made components. We have entered\ninto, and expect to enter into additional, manufacturing, licensing and distribution arrangements with one\nor more QSR compliant and FDA registered contract manufacturers for the materials and components\nused in our products. The TULSA-PRO and Sonalleve systems consist of common electronic\ncomponents, proprietary capital equipment and proprietary one-time-use devices. We purchase standard\nelectronic components from a number of third-party vendors. The capital equipment consists of custom\nsystem electronics, treatment delivery console, fluid circuits and an MRI compatible robotic positioning\nsystem. Printed circuit boards and assemblies and custom mechanical parts are outsourced to approved\nsuppliers. TULSA-PRO one-time-use devices consist of the UA, an endo-rectal cooling device and\nassociated accessories. Due to sterility requirements used in connection with the TULSA-PRO system,\nthe UA must be manufactured under clean conditions. We have developed proprietary automated\nmanufacturing test equipment to improve quality and provide scalability as demand grows and this\nequipment is assembled and tested in-house. We assemble and test the UA and endo-rectal cooling\ndevice in-house.\nWe have no long-term contracts with our suppliers, and we are not bound by any minimum purchase\nvolume undertakings with such suppliers.\nWe currently rely on single source suppliers for certain components used in our systems. In connection\nwith our anticipated commercialization of our approved products, we intend to procure alternative supply\narrangements for these components. See Item 4, “Risk Factors—Risk Factors Relating to Our Business\nand Growth Strategy—We depend on single-source suppliers for some of the components in our\nsystems.”\n3.7 Regulatory\nOn August 15, 2019, we obtained 510(k) clearance for commercial sale of the TULSA-PRO as a Class II\ndevice in the United States and have previously received a CE Certificate of Conformity for our products\nin European Union, and we have obtained regulatory approval for Sonalleve in China. On November 25,\n2019, the TULSA-PRO was approved as a class III device by Health Canada, which is key to our global\nexpansion strategy that requires a country-of-origin approval for medical devices. Additionally, the\nTULSA-PRO system has received regulatory clearances or approvals for commercial sale in Saudi\nArabia, Singapore, South Korea and Malaysia, while the Sonalleve system has received regulatory\nclearance or approval for commercial sale in Canada, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and Malaysia. Our long-\nterm goal is to expand our regulatory indications in Asia and other parts of the world where potential\nprofitable business development opportunities warrant such investments.\nUnited States\nThe FDA strictly regulates medical devices under the authority of the FFDCA and the regulations\npromulgated by the FDA under the FFDCA. The FFDCA and the implementing regulations govern,\namong other things, the following related to our products: preclinical and clinical testing, design,\nmanufacture, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, sales and distribution, importation, post-\nmarket adverse event reporting, recalls, and advertising and promotion.\nThe TULSA-PRO system, Sonalleve, and any future medical devices that we may develop, will be\nclassified by the FDA under the statutory framework described in the FFDCA. Medical devices are\nclassified into three classes from lowest risk (Class I) to highest risk (Class III). Unless an exemption\napplies, medical devices require FDA clearance or approval prior to commercial sale in the United States\ndepending on the assigned risk class. Most Class I devices and some Class II devices are exempt from\npremarket review requirements. Class I devices are subject to the “general controls” of the FFDCA, which\ninclude establishment registration and device listing, quality system requirements, labeling requirements,\nmedical device reporting, and reporting of corrections and removals. Most Class II devices and some\nClass I devices require FDA clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification prior to marketing. A 510(k)\npremarket notification must demonstrate that the device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed\npredicate device. In addition to the general controls, Class II devices are subject to “special controls,”\nsuch as performance standards and guidance documents, as identified in the classification regulation for\nthe device type. Class III devices require FDA approval of a premarket approval application, or PMA,\ndemonstrating reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of the device, prior to commercial\ndistribution. Class III devices are those deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-\nsustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices. Class III devices are subject to the general controls and\nany conditions of approval in the PMA approval order, which can include postmarket study requirements.\nNovel devices that have not been classified and devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a\npredicate device are automatically classified into Class III. For such devices that are low- to moderate-\nrisk, the manufacturer can submit a de novo classification request to classify the device into Class I or\nClass II. 510(k) premarket notifications, de novo classification requests, and PMA applications are subject\nto the payment of user fees paid at the time of submission for FDA review.\nThere is also a separate pathway for Humanitarian Use Devices, which are medical devices intended to\nbenefit patients in the treatment or diagnosis of a disease or condition that affects or is manifested in not\nmore than 8,000 individuals in the United States per year. Once a device has received designation as a\nHumanitarian Use Device, the sponsor may seek marketing authorization for the device under an HDE\napplication. An HDE application must demonstrate the device will not expose patients to an\nunreasonable or significant risk of illness or injury and the probable benefit to health outweighs the risk of\ninjury or illness (but is not required to demonstrate reasonable assurance of effectiveness). Devices with\nan approved HDE may only be used under IRB review and are subject to certain profit and use\nrestrictions.\nClinical trials are generally required to support a PMA application and are sometimes required for 510(k)\nclearance or de novo classification requests. Such trials, if conducted in the United States, generally\nrequire an IDE application, approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients and study\nsites, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device subject to more abbreviated IDE\nrequirements or an exemption applies. Clinical trials are subject to extensive monitoring, recordkeeping\nand reporting requirements as well as a requirement to submit information regarding certain clinical trials\nto a public database maintained by the National Institutes of Health. Clinical trials must be conducted\nunder the oversight of an IRB, for the relevant clinical trial sites and must comply with FDA regulations,\nincluding but not limited to those relating to good clinical practices and informed consent.\nAfter a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. Device manufacturers\nmust register their establishments annually, list the devices they manufacture and pay an annual\nregistration fee. Device manufacturers are also subject to the QSR, which includes both design control\nrequirements and good manufacturing practice requirements (such as requirements for purchasing\ncontrols, document controls, production and process controls, labeling and packaging controls, control of\nnonconforming product, complaint handling, corrective and preventative actions, storage, handling,\ndistribution, and servicing). Devices must be labeled in accordance with the FDA’s device labeling\nregulations, including Unique Device Identification requirements. The FDA also regulates the promotion of\nmedical devices, including a requirement that all device promotion be truthful and non-misleading and a\nprohibition against the promotion of devices for “off-label” uses, i.e., uncleared or unapproved uses.\nUnder the medical device reporting regulations, manufacturers must submit a report to the FDA if they\nbecome aware of information that reasonably suggests that one of their marketed devices may have\ncaused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned and the malfunction would be likely to\ncause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur. Manufacturers must also report any\ncorrections or removals, which can include, among other actions, repairs, adjustments, relabeling, or\ndestruction of distributed devices, if the correction or removal was initiated to reduce a risk to health or to\nremedy a violation of the FFDCA caused by the device which may present a risk to health.\nThe FDA has broad enforcement authority to take action against a failure to comply with the clinical trial,\npremarket review, or postmarket regulatory requirements discussed above and the agency conducts\nroutine inspections of device manufacturers to determine compliance with these requirements. FDA\nenforcement typically takes the form of inspectional observations at the close of inspection, a warning\nletter (a public letter alleging violations of regulatory significance), or an untitled letter (a typically non-\npublic letter alleging violations of lesser significance). However, the FDA has authority to take additional\nenforcement actions including: civil monetary penalties, criminal fines and prosecution, injunctions,\nproduct seizure, mandatory recall, and import detentions.\nEuropean Union\nOn April 5, 2017, the EU adopted a new Medical Devices Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (the “New EU\nMDR”), which repealed and replaced the Medical Devices Directive (MDD) effective May 26, 2021. Under\ntransitional provisions as they currently stand, medical devices with Notified Body certificates issued\nunder the Medical Devices Directive prior to May 26, 2021 will remain valid until the end of the period\nindicated on the certificate, but will become void at the latest on December 31, 2027 (for high-risk\ndevices) or on December 31, 2028 (for other devices), except for certificates issued in accordance with\nAnnex IV to the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive 90/385/EEC or Annex IV to the MDD which\nbecame void at the latest on May 27, 2022. After the expiry of any applicable transitional period, only\ndevices that have been CE marked under the New EU MDR may be placed on the market in the EU.\nOn the basis that TULSA-PRO and Sonalleve systems benefit from the New EU MDR transition period,\nthese devices can be placed on the market under their MDD certificates provided they continue to comply\nwith the MDD and there is no significant change in the devices’ designs or intended purposes. Under the\nMDD, legal manufacturers of medical devices, such as the TULSA-PRO and Sonalleve systems, are\nrequired to comply with the essential requirements laid down in Annex I of the MDD (the “Essential\nRequirements”). Active implantable medical devices and in-vitro diagnostic medical devices are\nregulated in separate EU directives. Compliance with these requirements entitles us to affix the CE Mark\nto our medical devices, without which they cannot be commercialized in the European Union. To\ndemonstrate compliance with the Essential Requirements and obtain the right to affix the CE Mark to our\nmedical devices, we must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the\ntype of medical device and its classification. The MDD provides for four different classifications of medical\ndevices based on their potential risks and vulnerability of the human body: Class I, Class IIa, Class IIb\nand Class III. Except for low risk medical devices (Class I with no measuring function and which are not\nsterile), in relation to which the manufacturer may prepare an EC Declaration of Conformity based on a\nself-assessment of the conformity of its products with the Essential Requirements, a conformity\nassessment procedure requires the intervention of a Notified Body. A Notified Body is a private entity\ndesignated by the competent authorities of a European Union Member State to conduct conformity\nassessments and to perform their tasks under the MDD (as implemented in the respective national legal\nsystem) in the public interest. Depending on the device’s risk category/class, the conformity assessment\nof the Notified Body extends to the quality assurance system established by the manufacturer and/or the\nproduct design, as well as to the Technical Documentation to be compiled by the manufacturer for each\ndevice to demonstrate compliance with the relevant Essential Requirements.\nAs part of the conformity assessment process, medical device manufacturers must carry out a clinical\nevaluation of their medical devices in accordance with Annex X of the MDD to verify that they comply with\nthe relevant Essential Requirements covering safety and performance. A clinical evaluation is defined in\nthe European Commission’s guidance (MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev. 4) as a “methodologically sound ongoing\nprocedure to collect, appraise and analyze clinical data pertaining to a medical device and to evaluate\nwhether there is sufficient clinical evidence to confirm compliance with relevant Essential Requirements\nfor safety and performance when using the device according to the manufacturer’s Instructions for Use”.\nA clinical evaluation must address the intended purpose of the device, clinical performance, benefits that\noutweigh associated risks and the usability of the device.\nThis assessment must be based on clinical data, which can be obtained from (i) clinical studies\nconducted on the devices being assessed; (ii) scientific literature from similar devices whose equivalence\nwith the assessed device can be demonstrated; or (iii) both clinical studies and scientific literature. As part\nof the conformity assessment procedure, depending on the type of devices, the Notified Body will review\nthe manufacturer’s clinical evaluation for the medical device.\nIf the Notified Body finds, as a result of its conformity assessment, that the quality assurance system\nand/or the product design is compliant with the applicable legal provisions, it issues a CE Certificate of\nConformity demonstrating compliance with the relevant Essential Requirements, which is valid for a\nmaximum of five (5) years (although as of May 26, 2021 when the New EU MDR became applicable, no\nnew certificates under the MDD could be issued and, as explained above, no MDD certificate will remain\nvalid from 27 May 2024, or such later date as the European Commission determines). On the basis of\nthese Notified Body CE Certificates of Conformity, the manufacturer is able to draw up an EC Declaration\nof Conformity and affix the CE Mark to the relevant device, followed by the ID number of the Notified\nBody. The CE Mark allows the device to be placed on the market throughout the EU and the EEA, as well\nas in Switzerland and Turkey based on bi-lateral treaties (although some additional requirements might\napply, for example, in Switzerland a Swiss Authorized Representative is now required as the mutual\nrecognition agreement does not cover the New EU MDR). CE marked devices can also be placed on the\nmarket in Northern Ireland under the Northern Ireland Protocol and in Great Britain (as the UK\nGovernment has agreed to recognize CE marked devices for a transitional period until June 30, 2028 if\nCE marked under the MDD or until June 30, 2030, if CE marked under the new EU MDR).\nThe Notified Body is obliged to perform regular audits and, before the expiry date of a certificate of\nconformity, renewal audits at the manufacturer’s site upon prior notification. In addition to these notified\naudits, a Commission Recommendation of 2013 advised notified bodies to conduct unannounced audits\n(including testing of product samples) on a regular basis.\nTherefore, when the MDD certificates become void, medical devices need to fully comply with the New\nEU MDR. The New EU MDR does not set out a substantially different regulatory system, but clearly\nenvisages, among other things, stricter controls of medical devices, including strengthening of the\nconformity assessment procedures, increased expectations as regards clinical data for devices and pre-\nmarket regulatory review of high-risk devices. The devices will need to undergo a conformity assessment\nunder the MDR. Medical devices must comply with the General Safety and Performance Requirements\nset out in Annex I (replacing the Essential Requirements). Further, new classification rules apply.\nAdditionally, the New EU MDR also envisages greater control over Notified Bodies and their standards\nand increased transparency through the establishment of a comprehensive EU database on medical\ndevices.\nHowever, regardless of whether a device is placed on the market under an existing MDD certificate or an\nMDR certificate, all devices must comply with the requirements relating to post-market surveillance,\nmarket surveillance, vigilance, registration of economic operators and of devices set out in the New EU\nMDR as from May 26, 2021.\nAfter a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. For CE\nmarked devices, certain modifications to the device or quality system depending on the conformity\nassessment procedure used must be submitted to and approved by the Notified Body before placing the\nmodified device on the market. Economic Operators, include device manufacturers, must register their\nestablishments and devices in the EUDAMED database once available. Additionally, manufacturers and\nauthorized representatives must now appoint a person responsible for regulatory compliance.\nIn the European Union, we must establish a medical device vigilance system (for reporting incidents) and\na post-marketing surveillance system (to monitor data about the device and confirm the benefits of the\ndevice continue to outweigh the risks). Under this system, serious incidents occurring in the EU that might\nlead to or might have led to the death of a patient or user or of other persons or to a serious deterioration\nin their state of health (either temporary or permanent) or that pose a serious public health threat must be\nreported to the relevant authorities of the European Union Member States. Manufacturers are required to\ntake FSCAs, including product recalls and withdrawals, to reduce a risk of death or serious deterioration\nin the state of health associated with the use of a medical device that is already placed on the market.\nManufacturers should report any FSCAs in respect of devices made available on the market or\nundertaken in a third country in relation to a device made available on the EU market. If the manufacturer\nof a device or its authorized representative in the EU has its registered place of business in Germany, it\nmust appoint a safety officer having the necessary professional qualifications to fulfil the reporting\nrequirements and to coordinate the necessary actions.\nIf the requirements for application of the CE Mark are not (or no longer) fulfilled, or in other cases of non-\ncompliance with applicable medical devices law:\n• the Notified Body has the power to withdraw, suspend or limit the scope of the applicable\ncertificate of conformity, in accordance with the principle of proportionality;\n• the competent authorities of the EU Member States may require relevant economic operators to\ntake the necessary actions to bring the device into compliance and/or address the risk, which can\ninclude withdrawal from the market or recall; and\n• depending on the EU member state, criminal and/or administrative sanctions (e.g. fines) may\napply.\nThe New EU MDR prohibits making any misleading claims about a device’s intended purpose, safety\nand/or performance. Therefore, devices can only be marketed for their intended purpose. In addition, the\nadvertising and promotion of our products in the European Union are subject to the provisions of Directive\n2006/114/EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising, and Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair\ncommercial practices, as well as other national legislation in the individual European Union Member\nStates governing the advertising and promotion of medical devices. These laws may limit or restrict the\nadvertising and promotion of our products to the public and may impose limitations on our promotional\nactivities with healthcare professionals. In Germany, a company which advises healthcare professionals\non the handling and use of medical devices – as may be the case for the TULSA-PRO and Sonalleve\ndevices – has to appoint a “medical devices advisor” with appropriate qualification and professional\nexperience as set out in the German Medical Devices Act.\nOn December 31, 2020, the UK exited the EU (“Brexit”). The UK did not implement the New EU MDR\ninto the laws of Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales). Northern Ireland is an exception as under\nthe Northern Ireland Protocol (the “Protocol”) the New MDR does apply (although the Protocol is under\ndiscussion and so could change). Great Britain instead introduced a new, standalone medical devices\nframework. Currently, this aligns closely to the MDD. However, the legislation has made some changes\nand included additional national requirements. For example, instead of a CE Mark, medical devices\nmarketed in Great Britain must bear a UKCA mark. However, EU CE Marks will continue to be\nrecognized in Great Britain until June 30, 2028, if the medical device is CE marked under the MDD, or\nuntil June 30, 2030, if the medical device is CE marked under the new EU MDR, as will certificates issued\nby EU-recognized Notified Bodies. This arrangement is not reciprocated in the EU. Medical devices\nmarketed in the UK must comply with the national laws in the UK. Notably the UK Government carried out\na consultation on proposed changes to the UK’s medical device framework. The Government’s response\nindicates that many changes will lead to the UK’s regulatory framework more closely aligning with the\nNew EU MDR (although there will be some key differences). The UK Government has stated it aims to\napply those changes from July 1, 2025.\nCanada\nHealth Canada’s Therapeutic Products Directorate (“TPD”) is the Canadian authority that regulates\nmedical devices. In general, prior to being given market authorization to sell a Class II, III or IV medical\ndevice in Canada, a manufacturer must present and/or attest to substantive scientific evidence of a\nproduct’s safety, efficacy and quality as required by the Food and Drugs Act and the Medical Devices\nRegulations (“Canada MDR”).\nThe Medical Devices Bureau (“MDB”) of the TPD applies the Canada MDR through a combination of pre-\nmarket review, post-approval surveillance and quality systems in the manufacturing process. Medical\ndevices are classified into one of four classes, where Class I represents the lowest risk and Class IV\nrepresents the highest risk. In order to perform investigational testing in Canada for a Class II, III or IV\nmedical device, authorization for the testing must be granted by the MDB. A Medical Device License is a\npre-market requirement for a Class II, III and IV medical device, including for Class II, III or IV medical\ndevices previously authorized for sale for investigational testing now to be offered for general/commercial\nsale. A Medical Device License is issued to the device manufacturer, provided the requirements of the\nCanada MDR are met.\nThe Canada MDR requires that medical devices be manufactured under a certified QMS that meets the\ncriteria of the international standard, ISO 13485 Medical devices – Quality management systems –\nRequirements for regulatory purposes. The MDB currently recognizes the Medical Device Single Audit\nProgram, a program designed to include compliance with the QMS requirements of the Canada MDR. We\nare manufacturing the TULSA-PRO and Sonalleve systems under a certified ISO 13485 Quality\nManagement System.\nRegulatory Status\nTULSA-PRO\nOn November 25, 2019, TULSA-PRO received approval as a Class III device from Health Canada, which\nis key to our global expansion strategy that requires a country of origin approval for medical devices. On\nAugust 15, 2019, we received 510(k) clearance for commercial sales of the TULSA-PRO as a Class II\ndevice in the United States for TULSA of prostate tissue, and in April 2016 the TULSA-PRO system was\nCE marked in the European Union for ablation of targeted prostate tissue (benign or malignant). Outside\nof these jurisdictions, the TULSA-PRO system will require country-specific pre-market clearance or\napproval prior to launch.\nUpon completion of our Phase I safety and feasibility study for TULSA-PRO in April 2016, we were\ngranted CE Mark approval for the commercial sale of the TULSA-PRO system in Europe and in other CE\nMark jurisdictions.\nIn August 2016, we initiated the TACT Pivotal Clinical Trial, which the FDA approved under an IDE\napplication. The TACT Pivotal Clinical Trial was designed to support a 510(k) premarket notification\nsubmission in the United States. This submission was made in May 2019 in support of clearance of the\nTULSA-PRO system by the FDA for use in the ablation of prostate tissue in the United States.\nIn Canada, we are currently manufacturing the TULSA-PRO system under a certified ISO 13485 Quality\nManagement System. The Canadian market is considered a lower priority from a commercialization\nstrategy perspective in light of its relatively small size.\nSonalleve\nOn November 30, 2020, the Sonalleve system received an approval from the FDA under the HDE for the\ntreatment of osteoid osteoma. Osteoid osteoma is a non-cancerous bone tumor that occurs most often in\nthe long bones of the leg, such as the femur and tibia, of young children and adolescents. An osteoid\nosteoma causes a dull, aching pain that is moderate in intensity, but can worsen and become severe,\nespecially at night. Computed tomography (CT) guided radiofrequency ablation, the most commonly used\nosteoid osteoma treatment, requires drilling through muscle and soft tissue into bone, and also exposes\nthe patient to radiation from the imaging necessary to guide the probe that is inserted to heat and destroy\ntumor tissue.\nThe Sonalleve applications for ablation of uterine fibroids and adenomyotic tissue, palliative pain relief\nassociated with bone metastases, treatment of osteoid osteoma, and management of benign desmoid\ntumors are CE marked and available in the European Union and its Member States. The uterine fibroids\napplication is also available for sale in Canada and South Korea. Sonalleve has been registered in\nseveral Middle East, North African, and South East Asian countries. We are also in the process of\nassessing current clinical research network activities and the investigator lead studies in the United\nStates to form regulatory strategies for several potential indications.\nIn 2018, Sonalleve was also approved in China by the NMPA for the non-invasive treatment of uterine\nfibroids.\n3.8 Reimbursement\nProfound’s ability to successfully commercialize the Company’s products depends in large part on the\nextent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for such products and related treatments or\nprocedures will be available from government health administration authorities, government and private\nhealth insurers, and other organizations or third-party payors. Pricing and reimbursement procedures and\ndecisions vary from country to country. Many government health authorities and private payors condition\npayment on the cost-effectiveness of the product. Even if a device is FDA cleared or CE marked or has\nreceived other regulatory clearance or approval, there is no guarantee that third-party payors will\nreimburse providers or patients for the cost of the device and related procedures or that the amount of\nsuch reimbursement will be adequate to cover the cost of the device. The availability of coverage and\nadequate reimbursement to hospitals and clinicians using Profound’s products therefore is important to its\nability to generate revenue and Profound plans to pursue coverage and reimbursement for the\nCompany’s products in the key markets where the Company has regulatory approvals. Successful\ncommercialization of the Company’s approved products will also depend on the cost of the system and\nthe availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors.\nAlthough Profound expects there to be an out-of-pocket market for the Company’s approved products, an\nout-of-pocket market alone is unlikely to be sufficient to support successful commercialization of the\nCompany’s products. With sponsorship and support from multiple physician specialty societies, the\nAmerican Medical Association (“AMA”) has established three new Current Procedural Terminology\n(“CPT’) Category 1 codes for MRI-Monitored Transurethral Ultrasound Ablation (“TULSA”) of prostate\ntissue, performed using Profound’s TULSA-PRO system. The first CPT Code describes the complete\nTULSA procedure when furnished by a single physician, such as a urologist. The other two CPT codes\neach describe a part of the TULSA procedure when TULSA is furnished by two physicians, such as a\nurologist in collaboration with a radiologist. The three new CPT Category 1 codes and their descriptors\ncovering the TULSA procedure will be included in a future edition of the CPT Codebook and will be\neffective on January 1, 2025. In the meantime, U.S. hospitals performing the TULSA procedure on\nMedicare patients may continue to utilize HCPCS C code, C9734, established by the U.S. Centers for\nMedicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for the Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System.\nEffective January 1, 2024, national average reimbursement to a hospital billing under C9734 is set to\n$12,553. For more information, see Item 4, “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Growth\nStrategy—Successful commercialization of our approved products will also depend on the cost of the\nsystem and the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payers.”\nITEM 4. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in the Common Shares involves a high degree of risk and should be considered highly\nspeculative due to the nature and present early stage of our business. The following risks are the material\nrisks that we face; however, the risks below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and\nuncertainties not presently known to us or that we believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our\nbusiness. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations\ncould be seriously harmed and you could lose all or part of your investment. Before deciding to invest in\nany Common Shares, investors should carefully consider the risk factors described below.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Operating History and Financial Condition\nWe have a limited operating history and history of operating losses.\nWe commenced operations in June 2008 and only began generating revenues in 2017. As of December\n31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of $217,931,000 and had cash and cash equivalents of\n$26,213,000. Since inception, we have incurred significant losses each year. For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, we recorded a net loss of $28,569,000, and for the year ended December 31, 2022,\nwe recorded a net loss of $28,669,000. We expect to incur significant operating losses even as we begin\nto commercialize the TULSA-PRO system in the United States following our FDA clearance, which will\nrequire significant expenditures to increase our sales and marketing capabilities and expand our\nmanufacturing and distribution capacity, as well as other expenses related to increasing reimbursement\ncoverage and gaining market acceptance among patients, physicians/clinicians and others in the medical\ncommunity. In addition, we plan to continue product research and development and clinical trials and may\npursue additional regulatory approvals. We expect to have sufficient cash to finance our operations for at\nleast the next 18 months. There is no assurance that we will ever successfully commercialize our\nsystems, generate significant revenues from our approved products or achieve profitability. Even if\nprofitability is achieved, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability. Our failure to achieve or\nmaintain profitability could negatively impact the value of the Common Shares.\nOur business is capital intensive and requires significant investment to increase our commercial\ncapacity for our approved products, and the resources to do so may not be available in amounts\nor on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nOur business requires substantial capital investment in order to commercialize our approved products, in\nparticular to expand our sales and marketing capabilities and increase our manufacturing capacity, as\nwell as to conduct research and development and to obtain regulatory approvals for existing products and\nfuture product candidates. However, although we obtained a term loan with CIBC for gross proceeds of\nC$10 million, we will need additional capital to fund our current and planned business activities and to\nfund any significant expansion of operations. In order to secure financing, if available, it is likely that we\nwould need to sell additional Common Shares and/or securities that are exchangeable for or convertible\ninto Common Shares, incur additional indebtedness and/or enter into development, manufacturing,\ndistribution and/or licensing relationships. Our CIBC Loan Agreement includes covenants which require\nus to achieve certain financial performance measures and contains restrictions on our ability to incur\nadditional debt. Any future equity financing may be dilutive to existing shareholders. Any future debt\nfinancing arrangements we enter into would likely contain restrictive covenants that would impose\nsignificant operating and/or financial restrictions on us. The availability of equity or debt financing will be\naffected by, among other things, our commercial progress and market acceptance in respect of the\nTULSA-PRO system and other approved products, as well as the results of our research and\ndevelopment, our ability to obtain regulatory approvals, the state of the capital markets generally,\nstrategic alliance agreements, and other relevant considerations.\nAny additional financing may not be obtained on favorable terms, if at all. If we cannot obtain adequate\nfunding on reasonable terms, we may not be able advance our business strategy and/or the\ncommercialization of our approved products, and we may need to terminate or delay clinical trials, curtail\nsignificant regulatory initiatives, and/or sell, license or assign rights to our technologies, products or\nproduct candidates.\nOur cash outflows are expected to consist primarily of expenditures to increase our commercial capacity,\nparticularly in sales and marketing, as well as in manufacturing and distribution. In addition, we intend to\ncontinue internal and external research and development efforts to develop and expand our product\npipeline, as well as incur general and administrative expenditures to support our corporate infrastructure.\nIf we do not obtain sufficient additional capital, there may be substantial doubt about our ability to\ncontinue as a going concern and realize assets and pay liabilities as they become due. Depending upon\nthe results of our research and development programs and the availability of financial resources, we\ncould decide to accelerate, terminate or reduce certain projects, or commence new ones. Any failure on\nour part to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us, or at all, may require us to significantly change\nor curtail current or planned operations in order to conserve cash until such time, if ever, that sufficient\nproceeds from operations are generated, and could result in us not taking advantage of business\nopportunities, in the termination or delay of clinical trials for one or more of our product candidates, in\ncurtailment of our product development programs designed to identify new product candidates, and/or in\nthe sale or assignment of rights to our technologies, products or product candidates. Any of the foregoing\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency risk, which exposure will increase as we commercialize our\napproved products in the United States; to date, we have not hedged against risk associated with\nforeign exchange rate exposure.\nAs we commercialize our approved products, in particular our TULSA-PRO system in the United States,\nwe expect that a significant portion of our revenues, expenses, current assets and current liabilities will be\ndenominated in United States dollars, Euros and other foreign currencies. Currently, our financial\nstatements are expressed in United States dollars. A decrease in the value of such foreign currencies\nrelative to the United States dollar could result in decreases in revenues from currency exchange rate\nfluctuations. To date, we have not hedged against risk associated with foreign exchange rate exposure.\nConsequently, our results of operations may be negatively affected by foreign currency exchange rate\nfluctuations, which could have a negative impact on the market price of our Common Shares.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Growth Strategy\nWe currently rely on our collaborative partners, and we may rely on additional collaborative\npartnerships, to assist in the sales and marketing and/or distribution of our approved products.\nWe currently rely on our collaborative partnerships for the sales and marketing and/or distribution of our\napproved products, in particular Philips, Siemens and GE Healthcare, who promote our systems that are\ncompatible with the MRI scanners produced and sold by them to end users, including hospitals and\nclinics. In the future, we intend to enter into similar arrangements with other producers of MRI scanners to\nincrease the compatibility of our products and to promote and increase market acceptance among\nhospitals, clinics and other end-users. However, we can provide no assurance that we will be successful\nin establishing such additional arrangements, which could negatively impact our commercialization\nstrategy and may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition. See “—We rely on the compatibility of our products with MRI scanners in the successful\ncommercialization of our products” above.\nWe may also seek out, evaluate and negotiate other third-party marketing and/or distribution\narrangements for our products in the jurisdictions where they are approved, which may involve the\ncommitment of substantial time and effort and may not ultimately result in an arrangement that is\nfavorable to our commercialization goals (e.g. if such third-party marketing or distribution partners are not\nas successful in promoting our products as anticipated). If any of these third-party collaborators are\nunable or unwilling to promote and/or deliver our products to our customers in an effective manner, then\nour business, financial condition and operating results could be materially impacted.\nAdditionally, if any of our relationships with third-party collaborators is terminated, whether by us or the\nthird-party for any reason, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain alternative sales and\nmarketing and/or distribution channels rapidly or effectively enough to prevent disruptions in sales\ngenerated in those markets or otherwise to ensure the success of our products in those markets. Any\nsuch termination may have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nWe may not achieve our commercialization and future product development goals in the time\nframes expected, or at all.\nWe may set goals for and make public statements regarding the timing of the accomplishment of\nobjectives material to our success, such as the timing and extent of product launches in the jurisdictions\nwhere they are approved for marketing and sale, in particular our expected commercialization of the\nTULSA-PRO system following FDA clearance in the United States; third-party reimbursement for our\napproved products; the timing and terms of any collaborations, partnerships, licenses, acquisitions or\nother agreements; the commencement and completion of clinical trials, including follow-up data on our\nTACT Pivotal Clinical Trial and CAPTAIN trail; and anticipated regulatory submission and approval dates\nfor our products in additional jurisdictions, and for future product candidates. The actual timing of these\nevents can vary dramatically due to factors such as the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the\nuncertainties inherent in the arrangements sufficient to commercialize our products, including in respect\nof manufacturing, distribution and marketing, as well as market competition and adverse results from our\nclinical trials, and other factors and described herein, many of which are beyond our control. There can be\nno assurance that we will achieve our commercialization goals in respect of the TULSA-PRO system in\nthe United States, or that future efficacy and safety results from our TACT Pivotal Clinical Trial and\nCAPTAIN trail will be favorable. If we fail to commercialize the TULSA-PRO system in the United States\nor any other approved products in the time frame and to the extent that we anticipate, our business,\nresults of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected, and the price of the\nCommon Shares could decline.\nOur products, including the TULSA-PRO system, may not achieve or maintain expected levels of\nmarket acceptance.\nThe commercial success of our approved products, including the TULSA-PRO system which was FDA-\ncleared in the United States in August 2019, is dependent upon achieving and maintaining market\nacceptance. New medical devices that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or\nmay have only limited or no commercial success. Levels of market acceptance for our products could be\nimpacted by several factors, many of which are not within our control, including but not limited to:\n• safety, efficacy, convenience and cost-effectiveness of our systems as a method of ablation\nof prostate tissue, uterine fibroids, bone metastases compared to products of our competitors\nor other forms of treatment;\n• scope of approved uses and marketing approval or clearance;\n• timing of market entry of our products versus those of our competitors;\n• difficulties in, or excessive costs required in the process of, manufacturing our products;\n• expanding compatibility of our systems to work with MRI scanners other than those made by\nPhilips, Siemens and GE Healthcare, and maintaining our existing relationships with Philips,\nSiemens and GE Healthcare;\n• infringement or alleged infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others;\n• acceptance of the price of our products relative to those of our competitors;\n• acceptance and adoption of our products by patients, physicians/clinicians and the medical\ncommunity;\n• the availability of training necessary for proficient use of our products, as well as willingness\nof physicians and technicians to participate in such training;\n• the perceived risks generally associated with the use of new products and procedures;\n• the placement of our products in treatment guidelines published by leading medical\norganizations;\n• the size and growth rate of the market for our products in the major geographies in which we\noperate or intend to operate, in particular in the United States; and\n• acceptance of our products by government and third-party payers for adequate\nreimbursement coverage.\nIn addition, the success of any new product will depend on our ability to either successfully build our in-\nhouse sales and marketing capabilities or to maintain or secure new, or to realize the benefits of existing\nor future arrangements with, third-party marketing or distribution partners. See “Risk Factors—We intend\nto rely primarily on our in-house sales and marketing capabilities for our commercialization strategy,\nwhich will require substantial build-up and commitment of resources” and “Risk Factors—We currently\nrely on our collaborative partners, and we may rely on additional collaborative partnerships, to assist in\nthe sales and marketing and/or distribution of our approved products” below. If we are unable to\ncommercialize new products successfully, whether through a failure to achieve market acceptance, a\nfailure to build our own in-house sales and marketing capabilities, a failure to maintain or secure new or\nexisting marketing partners or to realize the benefits of our arrangements with our marketing and\ndistribution partners, there may be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations and it could cause the market value of our Common Shares to decline.\nMarket acceptance of our approved products also depends on our ability to identify and address the\nrelevant market. For example, our TULSA-PRO system is FDA-cleared in the United States for\ntransurethral ultrasound ablation of prostate tissue and is not specific to any particular condition or\ndisease. For more information, see “We may be subject to fines, penalties or injunctions if we are\ndetermined to be promoting the use of our products for unapproved or “off-label” uses or engaged in false\nor misleading promotion.” below. Furthermore, our estimates of the number of patients who have received\nor might have been candidates to use a specific product may not accurately reflect the true market or\nmarket prices for such products or the extent to which such products will actually be used by patients. Our\nfailure to successfully introduce and market our approved products could have a material adverse effect\non our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nSuccessful commercialization of our approved products, including the TULSA-PRO system, and\nfuture product development depends upon our maintaining strong working relationships with\nphysicians/clinicians.\nIf we fail to maintain positive working relationships with physicians/clinicians, our approved products,\nincluding our TULSA-PRO system, may not achieve the level of market acceptance sufficient for\nsuccessful commercialization of the products. It is important for us to market our approved systems\nsuccessfully to physicians/clinicians who we expect will use our approved products, and we depend on\nour sales and marketing personnel (and those of our collaborative partners, e.g., Philips, Siemens and\nGE Healthcare) to do so in an effective manner. We can provide no assurance that physicians/clinicians\nwill prescribe or otherwise utilize our TULSA-PRO systems based on our existing clinical data (such as\nour TACT and CAPTAIN data) or the results of any future clinical trials, or at all. See “Risk Factors—Data\nfrom our clinical trials may not support regulatory approvals or clearances and/or reimbursement\ncoverage for our products” below. We also rely on our relationships with physicians/clinicians to further\ndevelop our existing products and develop future product candidates in line with the clinical needs and\nexpectations of the professionals who we expect will use and support the devices. These development\nefforts are similarly dependent upon us and our collaborative partners maintaining working relationships\nwith physicians/clinicians.\nIn addition, we rely on physicians/clinicians to provide considerable knowledge and experience that\nassists us in the marketing and sale of our approved products and development of our products and\nproduct candidates. Physicians/clinicians assist us as researchers, marketing and product consultants,\ninventors and public speakers. If we are unable to maintain strong relationships with these professionals\nand continue to receive their advice and input, the development and marketing of our products could\nsuffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating\nresults.\nPhysicians/clinicians misuse could result in negative publications, negative sentiment or adverse\nevents, thereby limiting market acceptance and future sales of our products.\nThere is a risk that physicians/clinicians may misuse our products, such as not following the instructions\nfor use, not using our products on the intended patient population, using our products with unapproved or\nmodified hardware or software, or misuse by inadequately trained staff. Physicians/clinicians may also\ninitiate their own clinical studies which may be poorly designed or controlled, and may result in adverse\nsafety or efficacy results. Any of the foregoing could result in negative publications, negative sentiment or\nadverse events or regulatory actions in respect of our products, thereby limiting market acceptance and\nsales of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nWe rely on the compatibility of our products with MRI scanners in the successful\ncommercialization of our products.\nWe have designed our TULSA-PRO system to be capable of integration with some of the MRI scanners\nfrom three of the major MRI manufacturers (Philips, Siemens and GE Healthcare), and the Sonalleve\nsystem with one MRI manufacturer (Philips). Although we believe that our approved products can be\nused by the vast majority of hospitals and treatment facilities, not all such facilities utilize MRI scanners\nthat are compatible with the TULSA-PRO and Sonalleve systems, and such facilities would be required to\nacquire (or outsource to other facilities that already have) compatible MRI equipment, which may increase\ntheir costs and which could restrict or delay utilization of our systems by such facilities. Accordingly, we\nintend to expand compatibility of the systems with other MRI scanners in the future, which would require\ndesign changes to our systems, collaboration with the manufacturer of the MRI scanner and may require\nadditional regulatory approvals. We may be unsuccessful in making the necessary design changes and, if\nrequired, receiving the necessary regulatory approvals for such changes, and the terms of any such\narrangements that we may enter into in the future with the MRI scanner manufacturers may not be on as\nfavorable terms. Accordingly, we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in any such\nexpansion of the compatibility of our products to other MRI scanners.\nSuccessful commercialization of our approved products will also depend on the cost of the\nsystem and the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement coverage from third-party\npayers.\nSuccessful commercialization of our approved products, including our TULSA-PRO system, depends\nlargely upon the cost of the system and the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement for the\nsystem, and the medical procedure associated with its use, from third-party payers, such as government\nhealthcare programs, private health insurers and other organizations, such as health maintenance\norganizations and managed care organizations. We expect that our systems will be purchased by health-\ncare providers, including clinics and hospitals that use MRI scanners that are compatible with our\nsystems, and that these providers will subsequently bill various third-party payers or will be responsible\nfor covering the costs of the system through the provider’s operating budget. Although we expect there to\nbe an out-of-pocket market for our approved products, an out-of-pocket market alone is unlikely to be\nsufficient to support successful commercialization of our products. To date we have not secured\nsignificant coverage or reimbursement for any of our products from government or third-party payers in\nthe jurisdictions where we have regulatory approvals, including our TULSA-PRO system in the United\nStates. We can provide no assurance that third-party payers will provide coverage and adequate\nreimbursement for our TULSA-PRO system to treat our targeted indications based on our existing clinical\ndata (such as our TACT and CAPTAIN data) or the results of any future clinical trials, or at all. See “Risk\nFactors—Data from our clinical trials may not support regulatory approvals or clearances and/or coverage\nand reimbursement for our products” below. Accordingly, we likely will need to conduct additional\nresearch and successfully complete additional clinical trials in order to obtain such coverage (e.g., follow-\nup data from our TACT Pivotal Clinical Trial and CAPTAIN trial). Such additional research and clinical\ntrials may require significant time and resources, and may not be successful, which could result in the\npostponement of or inability to obtain coverage and reimbursement for our approved products, which\ncould significantly delay or otherwise negatively affect our commercialization strategy. Any of the\nforegoing could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nThird-party payers carefully review and increasingly challenge the prices charged for medical devices,\nprocedures and services. Government healthcare programs in the United States and the European Union\nmay reimburse certain providers at a pre-determined all-inclusive amount for all the costs associated with\na particular procedure performed or course of treatment, based on such factors as the patient’s principal\ndiagnosis, age and severity or complexity. Similarly, the surgeon or physician may be reimbursed at a\npre-determined amount based on the procedure performed, and without taking into consideration the\nactual costs incurred, including the actual cost of the specific devices used.\nNew products are being increasingly scrutinized with respect to whether or not they will be covered at all\nby the various health plans and at what level of reimbursement. In some instances, economic research\nstudies are and will be required to demonstrate whether our products and approach are superior from a\nlong-term cost containment standpoint. Third-party payers may determine that our products are not\nmedically necessary, not cost-effective, experimental, or primarily intended for non-approved indications.\nSuch determinations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nFurther, healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future may impose more rigorous\ncoverage and reimbursement standards. We are unable to predict what, if any, additional legislation or\nregulation impacting the healthcare industry or third-party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted\nin the future, or what effect such legislation or regulation would have on our business.\nWe intend to rely primarily on our in-house sales and marketing capabilities for our\ncommercialization strategy, which will require substantial build-up and commitment of resources.\nWe intend to rely primarily on our in-house sales and marketing capabilities in order to advance our\ncommercialization strategy, particularly in the United States in respect of our FDA-cleared TULSA-PRO\nsystem. This will require a substantial commitment of time and resources in the near-term, and we may\nbe unsuccessful in executing on this strategy, which could negatively impact our anticipated\ncommercialization. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we remain in the early stages of expanding\nour U.S. sales and marketing capabilities and can provide no assurance that we will be successful in\nestablishing a marketing presence and sales force sufficient to commercialize the TULSA-PRO system\nsuccessfully in the United States.\nIn addition, by relying on an in-house sales and marketing function, we may have less visibility in the U.S.\nmarket (particularly among hospitals) than we would have if we had significant third-party distribution\nrelationships. Any shortcomings in our in-house sales force may have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may experience manufacturing scaling issues in connection with our commercialization\nstrategy, as we have limited experience assembling and testing our approved products, including\nthe TULSA-PRO system, at a significant scale.\nAs we implement our commercialization strategy, in particular in respect of the TULSA-PRO system in the\nUnited States, we may not be able to produce sufficient quantities of systems or maintain consistent\nquality control in the production of our systems. We have limited experience in assembling and testing our\napproved products, including our TULSA-PRO system, on a commercial scale. To commercialize our\napproved products successfully and become profitable, we must be able to assemble and test such in\ncommercial quantities in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, and at an acceptable cost.\nIncreasing our capacity to assemble and test our products on a commercial scale will require us to\nimprove internal efficiencies, including hiring additional experienced personnel, which may result in\nsignificant capital expenditures. We may encounter a number of difficulties in increasing our assembly\nand testing capacity, including:\n• managing production yields;\n• maintaining quality control and assurance;\n• providing component and service availability;\n• maintaining adequate control policies and procedures;\n• hiring and retaining qualified personnel; and\n• complying with U.S. and Canadian regulations (including at the state, provincial and/or\nfederal levels) and applicable foreign regulations.\nIn particular, our ability to increase our assembly and testing capacity successfully will greatly depend on\nour ability to hire, train and retain an adequate number of employees, in particular employees with the\nappropriate level of knowledge, background and skills to assemble and test our products. We compete\nwith several other medical device companies to hire and retain these skilled employees, and we may be\nunable to hire and retain such employees in numbers sufficient to increase our in-house capabilities.\nWe currently intend to partner with one or more additional QSR-compliant and FDA-registered contract\nmanufacturers for our TULSA-PRO systems in the United States. However, we may not be successful in\nestablishing or maintaining such partnerships on acceptable terms or in the timeframe necessary to\ncommercialize our products successfully, or at all.\nIn addition, we may encounter difficulties in scaling our manufacturing operations, whether in-house or\nthrough third-party contract manufacturers, as a result of, among other things, quality control and quality\nassurance issues and availability of components and raw material supplies. Any such quality control\nissues may negatively affect production and sales of our products, and may require increased repair or\nre-engineering costs due to product returns, defects and increased expenses due to switching to alternate\nsuppliers, and reputational damage, any of which could negatively affect our business and reputation.\nIf we are unable to satisfy commercial demand for our products, in particular our TULSA-PRO system in\nthe United States, due to our inability (or the inability of any of our contract manufacturers) to assemble\nand test such products in sufficient quantities with consistent quality control, and in compliance with\napplicable regulatory requirements (and in a cost-efficient manner), our ability to commercialize such\nproducts successfully, and market acceptance of our products could be adversely affected as our target\ncustomers may instead purchase or use our competitors’ products. This, in turn, could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on third parties to manufacture and supply components of our systems.\nThe TULSA-PRO and Sonalleve systems consists of common electronic components, proprietary capital\nequipment and proprietary one-time-use devices. We purchase standard electronic components for our\nsystems from a number of third-party vendors. The capital equipment consists of custom system\nelectronics, a treatment delivery console, fluid circuits and an MRI compatible robotic positioning system.\nPrinted circuit boards and assemblies and custom mechanical parts are outsourced from approved\nsuppliers.\nWe cannot be certain that manufacturing sources for all components will continue to be available or that\nwe can continue to outsource the manufacturing of our components on reasonable or acceptable terms. If\nwe encounter delays or difficulties with contract manufacturers, delivery of our products could be delayed.\nIn addition, we could be forced to secure new or alternative contract manufacturers or suppliers. Securing\na replacement contract manufacturer or supplier could be difficult, and we may not be able to do so in a\ntimely manner or without significant expense. Any loss of a manufacturer or any difficulties that could\narise in the manufacturing process could significantly affect our ability to supply sufficient amounts of our\nproducts to our customers on a timely basis, which may negatively affect our market share and,\ncorrespondingly, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nIn addition, not all of our suppliers provide us with guaranteed minimum production levels, and we rely on\nsingle-source suppliers for some of our components. See “Risk Factors—We depend on single-source\nsuppliers for some of the components in our systems” below. Furthermore, we do not currently have long-\nterm supply contracts, and accordingly, our suppliers could terminate their services at any time without\npenalty within agreed notice periods. As a result, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain\nsufficient quantities of components in the future necessary to commercialize our approved products.\nOur reliance on third-party manufacturers and suppliers involves a number of additional risks, including,\namong other things:\n• contract manufacturers or suppliers may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or make\nerrors in manufacturing that could negatively affect the efficacy or safety of our products or\ncause delays in shipments of products;\n• we or our contract manufacturers and suppliers may not be able to respond to unanticipated\nchanges in customer orders, and if orders do not match forecasts, our suppliers may have\nexcess or inadequate inventory of materials and components;\n• we or our contract manufacturers and suppliers may be subject to price fluctuations of raw\nmaterials and key components due to a lack of long-term supply arrangements for key\ncomponents;\n• we or our contract manufacturers and suppliers may lose access to critical services and\ncomponents, resulting in an interruption in the manufacture, assembly and shipment of our\nproducts;\n• we may experience delays in delivery by our contract manufacturers and suppliers as a result\nof the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or due to changes in demand from us or our other\ncustomers;\n• fluctuations in demand for products that our contract manufacturers and suppliers\nmanufacture for others may affect their ability or willingness to deliver components in a timely\nmanner;\n• suppliers or contract manufacturers may wish to discontinue supplying components or\nservices for risk management reasons;\n• we may not be able to find new or alternative components or reconfigure our system and\nmanufacturing processes in a timely manner if the necessary components become\nunavailable; and\n• contract manufacturers and suppliers may encounter financial hardships unrelated to our\ndemand, which could inhibit their ability to fulfill orders and meet our requirements.\nIf any of these risks materialize or worsen, it could significantly increase costs and impact our ability to\nmeet demand for our products, in particular in respect of our planned commercialization of TULSA-PRO\nin the United States. If we are unable to satisfy commercial demand for the TULSA-PRO system or other\napproved products in a timely manner, our ability to generate revenue could be impaired, market\nacceptance of our products could be adversely affected, and customers may instead purchase or use\ncompetitors’ products. As a result, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be\nmaterially adversely affected.\nWe depend on single-source suppliers for some of the components in our systems.\nWe currently rely on a single source for the manufacture of some of the components of our TULSA-PRO\nand Sonalleve systems. Although we intend to procure alternative supply sources for our components as\nour commercialization efforts increase, we can provide no assurance that we will be successful.\nEstablishing additional or replacement suppliers for these components will take a substantial amount of\ntime and could result in increased costs and impair our ability to produce our products. In addition, our\nproducts are highly technical and are required to meet exacting specifications, and any quality control\nproblems that we experience from such alternative supply sources could negatively affect our reputation\nand market acceptance of our products.\nWe may also have difficulty obtaining similar components from other suppliers that are acceptable to the\nFDA or foreign regulatory authorities. The failure of our suppliers to comply with strictly enforced\nregulatory requirements could expose us to regulatory action, including warning letters, product recalls,\ntermination of distribution, product seizures, or civil penalties. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the\nRegulation of the Company and Our Products” below for more information.\nIf we fail to procure alternative supply sources on acceptable terms or at all, our planned\ncommercialization of TULSA-PRO in the United States could be negatively affected, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe face significant competition in the markets for our products, and in particular, there are\nnumerous devices and procedures that compete with our TULSA-PRO system.\nOur products face significant competition from currently available and future medical devices or surgical\nmethodologies that are used in the same patient populations as our products. See Item 3.5, “Narrative\nDescription of the Business—Competition”. Some of these available options are well-established, and our\ncompetitors have greater financial resources, development, selling and marketing capabilities than we do.\nWe may face further competition from medical equipment/supply companies that focus their efforts on\ndeveloping and marketing products that are similar in nature to our products, but that in some instances\noffer improvements over our products. Our competitors may succeed in developing technologies and\nproducts that are more effective or less expensive to use than our products. These developments could\nrender our products uncompetitive, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition and operating results. In addition, academic institutions, government agencies and other public\nand private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection with respect to potentially\ncompetitive products. They may also establish exclusive collaborative or licensing relationships with our\ncompetitors.\nFurther, our industry is also subject to changing industry standards, market trends and customer\npreferences and to competitive pressures which can, among other things, necessitate revisions in pricing\nstrategies, price reductions and reduced profit margins. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to\nachieve technological superiority in our products and operations and maintain such superiority in the face\nof new technologies. No assurance can be given that further modification of our product offerings will not\nbe required in order to meet demands or to make changes necessitated by developments made by\ncompetitors that might render our products less competitive. Our future success will be influenced by our\nability to continue to develop, test and market our products and future product candidates, including\nincreasing and/or maintaining their compatibility with MRI scanners. Although we have committed\nresources to these efforts, there can be no assurance that we will be successful.\nData from our clinical trials may not support regulatory approvals or clearances and/or\nreimbursement coverage for our products.\nRegulatory clearances and approvals for the commercial sale of any of our product candidates require\nthat we demonstrate through clinical trials that the product candidate is safe and effective for its intended\nuse or, to receive 510(k) clearance in the United States, that the product candidate is substantially\nequivalent to an existing predicate device for its intended use. While we have obtained 510(k) clearance\nfor TULSA-PRO, additional follow-up data from our TACT Pivotal Clinical Trial and CAPTAIN trail may not\nbe consistent with our 12-month data in terms of efficacy and/or side effect profile, which in certain\ncircumstances may result in the FDA taking regulatory actions that are adverse to us. In addition, our\nTACT Pivotal Clinical Trial and CAPTAIN trail involves a relatively small patient population. Because of\nthe small sample size, the results may not be indicative of future results.\nWe believe that third-party payers, in determining reimbursement coverage for our products, including the\nTULSA-PRO system, generally would rely upon our clinical trial results, such as TACT and CAPTAIN,\nthat were obtained in support of our regulatory approvals; however, we may be required to provide\nadditional data from our existing trials and/or conduct additional clinical trials prior to obtaining\nreimbursement coverage for the TULSA-PRO system and other approved products, which would likely\ninvolve significant time and expense, and may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nIn the future, we may also seek regulatory approvals, which may include 510(k) clearance, for other\nproduct candidates, which likewise could be adversely affected by insufficient clinical trial results.\nObtaining product clearance or approval and conducting the requisite clinical trials is a long, expensive\nand uncertain process and is subject to delays and failures at any stage. There can be no assurance that\nclinical trials will be completed successfully within any specified period of time, if at all. In addition, a\nregulatory authority may disagree with our interpretation of the data from our clinical trials, or may find the\nclinical trial data inadequate to support clearance or approval, and may require us to extend existing\nclinical trials and/or pursue additional clinical trials, which would increase costs and could further delay\nregulatory approval or clearance of our products, or cause such regulatory approvals or clearances to be\ndenied altogether.\nThe data from a clinical trial may be inadequate to support clearance or approval of an application to the\nregulatory authorities for numerous reasons including, but not limited to:\n• prevalence and severity of adverse events and other unforeseen safety issues;\n• changes in regulatory requirements, policies or guidelines;\n• the interim or final results are insufficient (including in respect of the time period for which\nresults were obtained), inconclusive or unfavorable as to the safety or efficacy of the device;\n• the FDA or other regulatory authorities concluding that a clinical trial design is inadequate to\ndemonstrate safety and efficacy for a particular use, or to demonstrate substantial\nequivalence to a predicate device; and\n• the FDA or other regulatory authorities concluding that the trial was not conducted in\ncompliance with regulatory requirements or lacked controls necessary to ensure the integrity\nof the trial data.\nWe, the FDA or other regulatory authorities may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time if it is\ndetermined that patients may be or are being exposed to unacceptable health risks, including the risk of\ndeath, that our devices are not manufactured under acceptable conditions or with acceptable quality, or\nthat the trial is not being conducted according to the protocol and in compliance with Good Clinical\nPractice and regulatory requirements. Further, success in preclinical studies and early clinical trials does\nnot mean that future clinical trials will be successful because medical devices and/or treatment options in\nlater stage clinical trials may fail to demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the\nFDA and other regulatory authorities despite having progressed through initial clinical trials. We cannot be\nsure that the later trials will replicate the results of prior trials.\nEven if our clinical trials are completed as planned, there can be no certainty that trial results will support\nour product candidate claims or that the FDA or foreign authorities will agree with our conclusions\nregarding them or agree that they are adequate to support approval or clearance. The clinical trial\nprocess may fail to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for the proposed\nindicated uses, which could cause us to abandon a product candidate and may delay development of\nothers. Any delay or termination of our clinical trials will delay the filing of our regulatory submissions and,\nultimately, negatively affect our ability to commercialize our systems and generate revenues.\nIf our products do not prove to be safe and effective, or substantially equivalent to a predicate device, in\nclinical trials to the satisfaction of the relevant regulatory authorities or third-party payers, if the clinical\nstudies do not support our product candidate claims or if they result in the discovery of adverse side\neffects, then our regulatory approvals and reimbursement coverage (as applicable) may be delayed or\ndenied altogether, and our business, financial condition and results of operation could be materially\nadversely affected.\nWe may rely on third parties to perform clinical trial planning and to facilitate obtaining regulatory\napprovals or clearances for our product candidates.\nWe may rely on third parties to provide clinical trial planning and regulatory services for our product\ncandidates. We may be unable to find suitable partners, external consultants or service providers to\nprovide such services or such arrangements may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.\nFurther, we may engage third parties that may cease to be able to provide these services or may not\nprovide these services in a timely or professional manner. Accordingly, we may not be able to\nsuccessfully manage such services, execute clinical trials or obtain regulatory approvals or clearances for\nour product candidates, which may negatively affect our business. If we fail to establish such\narrangements when, and as necessary, we could be required to undertake these activities at our own\nexpense, which would significantly increase capital requirements and may delay the development,\napproval and future commercialization of our product candidates, which could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe depend on key managerial personnel for our continued success.\nWe are highly dependent upon our small team of managerial personnel, particularly that of our Chief\nExecutive Officer, Arun Menawat. We do not maintain any “key man” insurance policies on Dr. Menawat\nor any other members of senior management. Our anticipated growth will require additional expertise and\nthe addition of new qualified personnel. There is intense competition for qualified personnel in the medical\ndevice field. Therefore, we may not be able to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the\ndevelopment of our business. We must continue to retain, motivate and recruit executives and other key\nemployees. The failure to motivate, or the loss of the services of, existing personnel, as well as the failure\nto recruit additional key managerial personnel in a timely manner, would harm our business development\nprograms, and our ability to manage day-to-day operations, attract collaboration partners, attract and\nretain other employees, generate revenues, and could have a material adverse impact on our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nResearch and development carries substantial risk and we may not be able to expand our product\nportfolio.\nFuture growth may also depend on, among other factors, our ability to successfully develop new product\ncandidates and make product improvements to meet evolving market needs. We may not be able to\nsuccessfully expand our product portfolio to generate new revenue opportunities in the future. Although\nwe believe we have the scientific and technical resources available to improve our products and develop\nnew products, future products will nevertheless be subject to the risks of failure inherent in the\ndevelopment of products based on innovative technologies. In addition, any such research and\ndevelopment activities may involve significant capital expenditures. There can be no assurance that we\nwill be able to successfully develop future products and tests, which would prevent us from introducing\nnew products in the marketplace and negatively impact our ability to grow revenues and become\nprofitable.\nIn addition, the identification of new product candidates for development may require that we enter into\nlicensing or other collaborative agreements with others, including medical device and pharmaceutical\ncompanies and research institutions. These collaborative agreements may require that we pay license\nfees, make milestone payments or pay royalties or grant rights, including marketing rights, to one or more\nparties, and such amounts may be material to our results of operations and financial condition. Moreover,\nthese arrangements may contain covenants restricting our product development or business efforts in the\nfuture. Any such arrangements would also increase our reliance on third parties.\nWe may be subject to product liability claims, which can be expensive, difficult to defend and may\nresult in large judgments or settlements, and/or warranty claims on our products.\nThe use of medical devices for treatment of humans, whether in clinical trials or after marketing clearance\nor approval is obtained, can result in product liability claims. Product liability claims can be expensive,\ndifficult to defend and may result in large judgments or settlements against us. In addition, third-party\ncollaborators and licensees may not protect us from product liability claims.\nWe currently maintain product liability insurance in connection with the use of our products in clinical trials\nand in commercial use; however, we may not have adequate protection against all potential liabilities\nunder these insurance policies. If we are unable to obtain sufficient levels of insurance at acceptable cost\nor otherwise protect against potential product liability claims, we will be exposed to product liability claims.\nA successful product liability claim in excess of our insurance coverage could harm our financial\ncondition, results of operations and prevent or interfere with our commercialization efforts and future\nproduct development. In addition, any successful claim may prevent us from obtaining adequate product\nliability insurance in the future on commercially desirable terms. Even if a claim is not successful,\ndefending such a claim may be time-consuming and expensive.\nWe also bear the risk of warranty claims on our products, generally for one year after sale. We may not\nbe successful in claiming recovery of the relevant components from our suppliers in the event of a\nsuccessful warranty claim against us by a customer, or that any recovery from such suppliers would be\nadequate. In addition, warranty claims brought by our customers related to third-party components may\narise after the expiration of our corresponding warranty with our third-party suppliers, which would require\nus to bear the burden of any such warranty claims.\nRising insurance costs could negatively impact our profitability.\nThe cost of insurance, including director and officer, worker’s compensation, property, product liability and\ngeneral liability insurance, has risen significantly in recent years and is expected to continue to increase.\nIn particular, our product liability insurance is subject to price increases if we experience product liability\nclaims. In response, we may increase deductibles and/or decrease certain coverages to mitigate these\ncosts. These increases, and our increased risk due to increased deductibles and reduced coverages,\ncould have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology systems to operate our\nbusiness and if we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data or we experience a cyber-\nattack or other breach of these systems, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology for our development activities,\nproducts and infrastructure. We rely on information technology systems to process, transmit and store\nelectronic information in our day-to-day operations. The complexity of our information technology systems\nmakes them vulnerable to increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks, malicious intrusion, breakdown,\ndestruction, loss of data privacy, or other significant disruption. Any such event could be prolonged and/or\ncould go undetected for a significant period of time. Our products and their information systems require\nan ongoing commitment of resources to maintain, protect, and enhance existing systems and develop\nnew systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving\nsystems and regulatory standards, the increasing need to protect patient and customer information, and\nchanging customer patterns.\nIn addition, third parties may attempt to hack into our products or systems and may obtain data relating to\npatients, our products or our proprietary information. If we fail to maintain or protect our information\nsystems and data integrity effectively, we could lose existing customers, have difficulty attracting new\ncustomers, have problems in determining product cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing,\nhave difficulty preventing, detecting, and controlling fraud, have disputes with customers, physicians, and\nother health care professionals, become subject to litigation, have regulatory sanctions or penalties\nimposed, experience increases in operating expenses, incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a\ndata privacy breach, or suffer other adverse consequences. Any of the foregoing could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA portion of our employees are unionized, and our good labor relations may not continue.\nAs of December 31, 2023, 16 of our employees in Vantaa, Finland were unionized. Currently, labor\nrelations are good; however, the maintenance of a productive and efficient labor environment cannot be\nassured. If any of our employees at our other manufacturing facilities unionize in the future, or if\nprotracted and extensive work stoppages occur, labor disruptions such as strikes or lockouts could have\na material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our facilities are damaged or destroyed, we may experience delays that could negatively impact\nour revenues.\nOur facilities may be affected by natural or man-made disasters. If our facilities were affected by a\ndisaster, we would be forced to rely on third-party manufacturers or to set up production at another\nmanufacturing facility. In such an event, we might not be able to find a suitable alternate manufacturer or\nmight face significant delays in manufacturing which would prevent us from being able to sell our\nproducts. In addition, our insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of the potential losses and may not\ncontinue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe face risks associated with acquisition of businesses and technologies.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we intend to evaluate and may pursue additional acquisitions of, or\nsignificant investments in, complementary companies or technologies to increase our technological\ncapabilities and expand our product offerings. For example, in July 2017, we acquired from Philips the\ntechnologies and asset underlying our Sonalleve system. Acquisitions and the successful integration of\nnew technologies, products, assets or businesses may require significant attention from our management\nand could result in a diversion of resources from our existing business, which in turn could have an\nadverse effect on our business operations. Other risks typically encountered with acquisitions include\ndisruption of our ongoing business; difficulties in integration of the acquired operations and personnel;\ninability of our management to maximize our financial and strategic position by the successful\nimplementation or integration of the acquired technology into our product offerings; being subject to\nknown or unknown contingent liabilities, including taxes, expenses and litigation costs; and inability to\nrealize expected synergies or other anticipated benefits which may, among other things, also lead to\ngoodwill impairments or other write-offs. For example, our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the\nSonalleve Transaction depends in part on our ability to realize the anticipated growth opportunities and\nsynergies from the acquired assets and technologies, including our further development of the Sonalleve\nsystem.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems we may\nencounter in connection with the Sonalleve Transaction or potential future acquisitions. Our inability to\nsuccessfully integrate the operations of an acquired business, including a successful implementation of\nthe technologies and assets we acquire, and realize anticipated benefits associated with an acquisition,\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash\nflows. Acquisitions or other strategic transactions may also result in dilution to our existing shareholders if\nwe issue additional equity securities as consideration or partial consideration as well as in the incurrence\nof indebtedness if we borrow funds to finance such transactions.\nRisks Relating to Regulation of the Company and Our Products\nOur business is subject to limitations imposed by government regulations.\nThe preclinical testing and clinical trials of any products developed by us and the manufacturing, labeling,\nsale, distribution, export or import, marketing, advertising and promotion of any of those products are\nsubject to rigorous regulation by U.S., Canadian, EU and other foreign regulatory authorities at the\nfederal, provincial, state, national and local governmental levels, as applicable. Our medical devices are\nprincipally regulated in the United States by the FDA, in the European Union by the competent authorities\nof the EU Member States (who supervise Notified Bodies and manufacturers of medical devices), in\nCanada by Health Canada (particularly, the TPD), and by other similar regulatory authorities in other\njurisdictions. Government regulation substantially increases the cost and risk of researching, developing,\nmanufacturing and selling products.\nWe may be unable to obtain, or experience significant delays in obtaining, FDA clearances or\nother regulatory approvals for our product candidates and/or enhancements to our approved or\ncleared products.\nOur products are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other federal, state and foreign\ngovernmental authorities and Notified Bodies. The process of obtaining FDA clearances or approvals, or\nequivalent third country approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time consuming, and we\nmay not be able to obtain these clearances or approvals on a timely basis, if at all. For example, we\nwould highlight that there are currently few Notified Bodies able to perform conformity assessments under\nthe New EU MDR, which may lead to delays in recertification under the New EU MDR. We expect to\ngenerate a significant portion of our revenues from sales of our marketed systems, in particular our FDA-\ncleared TULSA-PRO system, but may be unable to do so if the systems do not continue to prove to be\nsafe and effective for our intended use in clinical trials to the satisfaction of the relevant regulatory\nauthorities in the United States, EU Member States, China or other countries. In addition, no assurance\ncan be given that our other product candidates will prove to be sufficiently safe and effective in clinical\ntrials or that we will receive regulatory approvals in the jurisdictions where we seek to market the systems.\nIn addition, no assurance can be given that current regulations relating to regulatory approval will not\nchange or become more stringent.\nAny delay in, or failure to receive or maintain, regulatory clearance or approval of other products under\ndevelopment would adversely affect our ability to commercialize those products, thereby adversely\naffecting operations and could prevent us from generating revenue from these products or achieving\nprofitability. Any failure to obtain regulatory clearance or approval would materially adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf clinical trials are conducted in a manner that fails to meet all FDA requirements, the FDA may\ndelay our clearances or approvals, or the deficiencies may be so great that the FDA could refuse\nto accept all or part of our data or trigger enforcement action.\nClinical trials are generally required to support PMA approval and de novo classification and are\nsometimes required to support 510(k) clearance. Such trials, if conducted in the United States and involve\na significant risk device require an IDE application to be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified\nnumber of patients and study sites. Clinical trials involving a non-significant risk device do not require\nFDA approval of an IDE application and are subject to abbreviated requirements under the IDE\nregulation. Further, some clinical trials are exempted from the IDE regulation. Although we do not expect\nto submit any additional IDE applications for any further clinical trials involving TULSA-PRO system, we\nmay need to obtain an IDE application for any clinical trials designed to expand the indications for the\nTULSA-PRO. In addition, FDA approval of IDE applications may be required in support of clinical trials\ninvolving other product candidates.\nClinical trials are subject to extensive monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Clinical trials\nmust be conducted under the oversight of an IRB and must comply with FDA regulations, including but\nnot limited to those relating to good clinical practices. To conduct a clinical trial, we must also obtain the\npatients’ informed consent that complies with FDA requirements, state and federal privacy regulations\nand human subject protection regulations. We, the FDA or the IRB could suspend a clinical trial at any\ntime for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated\nbenefits. Additionally, we may decide at any time, for business or other reasons, to terminate a clinical\ntrial. Following completion of a clinical trial, we would need to collect, analyze and present the data in an\nappropriate submission to the FDA. Even if a study is completed and submitted to the FDA, the results of\nclinical testing may not adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the device for its intended use,\nor may be equivocal or otherwise not be sufficient to obtain FDA clearance or approval of our product. In\naddition, the FDA may perform a bioresearch monitoring inspection of a study and if it finds deficiencies,\nwe will need to expend resources to correct those deficiencies, which may delay clearance or approval or\nthe deficiencies may be so great that the FDA could refuse to accept all or part of the data or could trigger\nenforcement action.\nEven if our products are approved by regulatory authorities, if we or our suppliers fail to comply\nwith ongoing FDA or other foreign regulatory authority requirements or if we experience\nunanticipated problems with our products, we could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from\nthe market.\nAny product for which we obtain regulatory clearance or approval, and the manufacturing processes,\npostmarket surveillance and reporting, post-approval clinical testing and promotional activities for such\nproduct, will be subject to continued regulatory review, oversight and periodic inspections by the FDA and\nother regulatory bodies (and Notified Bodies, as applicable). In particular, we and some of our suppliers\nare required to comply with the QSR and international standards for the manufacture of products and\nother regulations which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control,\nquality assurance, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping of any product for which we obtain\nregulatory clearance or approval. Regulatory bodies, such as the FDA, enforce the QSR and other\nregulations through periodic inspections. We and our contract manufacturers have been, and anticipate in\nthe future being, subject to such inspections.\nThe failure by us or one of our suppliers to comply with applicable statutes and regulations administered\nby the FDA and other regulatory bodies, or the failure to timely and adequately respond to any adverse\ninspectional observations or product safety issues, could result in, among other things, any of the\nfollowing enforcement actions:\n• untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;\n• customer notifications for repair, replacement or refunds;\n• recall, withdrawal, detention or seizure of our products;\n• operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n• refusing or delaying our requests for premarket approval of new products or modified\nproducts;\n• operating restrictions;\n• withdrawing PMA approvals that have already been granted;\n• suspension, variation, or withdrawal of our CE Certificates of Conformity;\n• refusals to allow imports and/or to issue documentation necessary to facilitate exports;\n• refusal to grant export approval for our products; or\n• imposition of civil, administrative or criminal penalties.\nIf any of these actions were to occur, we may be required to expend significant time and resources to\naddress or defend such actions, and our reputation may be harmed and our product sales and/or\nprofitability may be negatively affected. Furthermore, key component suppliers may not currently be, or\nmay not continue to be, in compliance with all applicable legal requirements or our supplier control\nrequirements, which could result in our failure to produce our products on a timely basis and in the\nrequired quantities, if at all.\nIn addition, we may be required to conduct costly post-market testing and surveillance to monitor the\nsafety or effectiveness of our products, and we must comply with medical device reporting requirements,\nincluding the reporting of certain adverse events and malfunctions related to our products. Later discovery\nof previously unknown problems with our products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse\nevents of unanticipated severity or frequency, manufacturing problems, or failure to comply with\nregulatory requirements such as QSR, may result in changes to labeling (which may require new\nmarketing applications or supplements), restrictions on such products or manufacturing processes,\nwithdrawal of the products from the market, voluntary or mandatory recalls, a requirement to repair,\nreplace or refund the cost of any product we manufacture or distribute, fines, suspension of regulatory\napprovals, product seizures, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties which would have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur products that have received regulatory clearance or approval are subject to extensive post-\nmarket regulation that could affect sales, marketing and profitability.\nWith respect to the products for which we have obtained regulatory clearance or approval, we are subject\nto post-marketing regulatory obligations, including requirements by the FDA, EU competent authorities,\nHealth Canada and similar agencies in other jurisdictions to maintain records regarding product safety\nand to report to regulatory authorities serious or unexpected adverse events. The occurrence of\nunanticipated serious adverse events or other safety problems could cause the governing agencies to\nimpose significant restrictions on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed, impose other\nrestrictions on the distribution or sale of the product or require potentially costly post-approval studies. In\naddition, post-market discovery of previously unknown safety problems or increased severity or\nsignificance of a pre-existing safety signal could result in withdrawal of the product from the market and\nproduct recalls. Compliance with extensive post-marketing record keeping and reporting requirements\nrequires a significant commitment of time and funds, which may limit our ability to successfully\ncommercialize approved products.\nWe may be subject to fines, penalties or injunctions if we are determined to be promoting the use\nof our products for unapproved or “off-label” uses or engaged in false or misleading promotion.\nRegulatory clearances and approvals may be subject to limitations on the intended uses for which our\nproducts may be marketed and reduce our potential to successfully commercialize our products. While\nphysicians/clinicians, in most jurisdictions, can use our products in ways or circumstances other than\nthose strictly within the scope of the regulatory clearance or approval, we are required, in many\njurisdictions, to limit our training and promotion of our products to the cleared or approved intended uses.\nFor example, if the FDA determines that our promotional materials, labeling, training or other marketing\nconstitutes promotion of an uncleared or unapproved, or “off-label” use, it could request that we modify or\ncease use of those training or promotional materials until we obtain FDA clearance or approval for those\nuses or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letter, a\nwarning letter, injunction, seizure, civil monetary penalty and/or criminal penalties. Discussions that may\nbe viewed as off-label promotion by FDA include discussions regarding treatment of a specific disease or\ncondition when FDA has cleared or approved a device with a general tool-type indication that does not\nmention any particular disease or condition. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign\nenforcement authorities might take action if they consider our promotional or training materials to\nconstitute promotion of an uncleared or unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or\npenalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement. In\nthat event, our reputation could be damaged and adoption of our products would be impaired.\nIn addition to promoting our products in a manner consistent with our clearances and approvals, we must\nhave adequate substantiation for the claims we make for our products. If any of our claims are\ndetermined to be false, misleading or deceptive, we could be subject to enforcement action. In addition,\nunsubstantiated claims also present a risk of consumer class action or consumer protection litigation and\ncompetitor challenges.\nModifications to our cleared or approved products may require new regulatory clearances or\napprovals or may require us to recall or cease marketing our products until such additional\nclearances or approvals are obtained.\nCertain modifications to our products may require the submission of new 510(k) premarket notifications,\nPMA supplements, or other regulatory agency approval applications or documents. If a modification is\nimplemented to address a safety concern, we may also need to initiate a recall or cease distribution of the\naffected device. The FDA can review a manufacturer’s decision not to submit a new 510(k) premarket\nnotification, PMA supplement or PMA for a modification and may disagree. The FDA may also on its own\ninitiative determine that clearance of a new 510(k) or approval of a new PMA submission is required. We\nmay make additional modifications to our products in the future that we believe do not or will not require\nclearance of a new 510(k) or approval of a new PMA. If we begin manufacture and distribution of the\nmodified devices and the FDA later disagrees with our determination and requires the submission of a\nnew 510(k) or PMA for the modifications, we may also be required to recall the distributed modified\ndevices and to stop distribution of the modified devices until we have received approval or clearance for\nthe modified device, which could have an adverse effect on our business. If the FDA does not clear or\napprove the modified devices, we may need to redesign the devices, which could also harm our business.\nWhen a device is marketed without a required clearance or approval, the FDA has the authority to take\ninformal enforcement actions such as the issuance of a Warning Letter, or bring a formal enforcement\naction, including injunction, seizure and criminal prosecution. The FDA considers formal enforcement\nactions generally when there is a serious risk to public health or safety or the company’s corrective and\npreventive actions are inadequate to address the FDA’s concerns.\nWhere we determine that modifications to our products require clearance of a new 510(k) or approval of a\nnew PMA or PMA supplement, we may not be able to obtain those additional clearances or approvals for\nthe modifications or additional indications in a timely manner, or at all. For those products sold in the\nEEA, we must notify an EU Notified Body, if significant changes are made to the products or if there are\nsubstantial changes to our quality assurance systems affecting those products. Delays in obtaining\nrequired future clearances or approvals would adversely affect our ability to introduce new or enhanced\nproducts in a timely manner, which in turn would harm its future growth. Additionally, such changes could\nmean we would no longer be able to rely on existing MDD CE Marks under the transition periods and\nwould need to obtain a CE Mark under the New EU MDR.\nOur contract manufacturers are subject to regulatory compliance by the FDA, Health Canada and\nregulatory authorities in the EU and other jurisdictions.\nOur contract manufacturers must comply with applicable FDA, EU, Health Canada and other applicable\nforeign regulations, which include quality control and quality assurance requirements, as well as the\ncorresponding maintenance of records and documentation and manufacture of devices according to the\nspecifications contained in the applicable regulatory file. If our contract manufacturers do not or cannot\ncomply with these requirements, our ability to commercialize our approved products may be adversely\naffected.\nThe introduction of new or alternative manufacturers or suppliers also may require manufacturing or\ndesign changes to our products that are subject to FDA and other regulatory clearances or approvals.\nSimilarly, in the European Union, the introduction of new or alternative manufacturers or suppliers could\nbe considered to constitute a substantial change to our quality system or result in design changes to our\nproducts which could affect compliance with the Essential Requirements for the Notified Body’s certificate\nunder the MDD (which continues to be valid during the transition period) and with the General Safety and\nPerformance Requirements once a Notified Body certificate under the New EU MDRs is required.\nIf a substantial change is made to a device relying on an MDD certificate it will no longer benefit from the\ntransition period set out in the New EU MDR. In this case the product would need to be CE marked\nunder the New EU MDR to be placed on the market. Once CE marked under the New EU MDR these\nchanges must be disclosed to our Notified Body in the EU before implementation. The Notified Body will\nthen assess the changes and verify whether they affect the products’ conformity with the General Safety\nand Performance Requirements. If the assessment is favorable the Notified Body will issue a new CE\nCertificate of Conformity or an addendum to the existing certificates attesting compliance with the General\nSafety and Performance Requirements. We may also be required to assess the new manufacturer’s\ncompliance with all applicable regulations and guidelines, which could further impede our ability to\nmanufacture our products in a timely manner. As a result, we could incur increased production costs,\nexperience delays in deliveries of our products, suffer damage to our reputation, and experience a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur products may in the future be subject to product recalls that could harm our reputation,\nbusiness and financial results.\nThe FDA and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of\ncommercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. In the\ncase of the FDA, the authority to require a recall must be based on an FDA finding that there is a\nreasonable probability that the device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death. In\naddition, we may initiate voluntary recalls of our products in the future to the extent we experience safety\nor other concerns with such products. For voluntary corrections or removals, the FDA requires that\nmanufacturers report to the FDA within 10 working days after the correction or removal is initiated if the\naction was initiated to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FFDCA\ncaused by the device which may present a risk to health. Companies are required to maintain certain\nrecords of corrections and removals, even if they are not reportable to the FDA. We may determine that\nany particular voluntary recall that we initiate does not require notification of the FDA. If the FDA\ndisagrees with our determinations, they could require us to report those actions. A future recall\nannouncement could harm our reputation with customers and negatively affect our sales. In addition, the\nFDA could take enforcement action for failing to report the recalls when they were conducted.\nIn the European Union, incidents and serious incidents must be reported to the relevant authorities of the\nEuropean Union Member States, and manufacturers are required to take FSCAs, to reduce a risk of\ndeath or serious deterioration in the state of health associated with the use of a medical device that is\nalready placed on the market (such FSCAs must also be reported to relevant authorities). The timing and\nmeans of making the report depend on the severity of the incident (for example, serious incidents that\nresulted in death or serious deterioration require immediate reporting to competent authorities, whereas\nincidents might be included in the periodic safety update report and/or trend reporting). For purposes of\nthese regulations, an “incident” is defined as any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics or\nperformance of a device made available on the market, including use-error due to ergonomic features, as\nwell as any inadequacy in the information supplied by the manufacturer and any undesirable side-effect.\n“Serious incident” is defined as any incident that directly or indirectly led, might have led or might lead to\nany of the following: (a) the death of a patient, user or other person, (b) the temporary or permanent\nserious deterioration of a patient’s, user’s or other person’s state of health, (c) a serious public health\nthreat. An FSCA is defined as a corrective action taken by a manufacturer for technical or medical\nreasons to prevent or reduce the risk of a serious incident in relation to a device made available on the\nmarket. A FSCA may include the recall, modification, exchange, destruction or retrofitting of the device.\nIn addition, governmental or other competent bodies or authorities have the authority to require the recall\nof products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. Manufacturers may,\nunder their own initiative, recall a product if any material deficiency in a device is found.\nA government-mandated or voluntary recall by us or one of our distributors could occur as a result of\ncomponent failures, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues.\nRecalls of the TULSA-PRO system, Sonalleve system or any future products would divert managerial and\nfinancial resources and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our products cause or contribute to a death or a serious injury, or malfunction in certain ways,\nwe will be subject to medical device reporting regulations, and such events can result in voluntary\ncorrective actions or agency enforcement actions.\nUnder FDA medical device reporting regulations, manufacturers are required to report to the FDA\ninformation that reasonably suggests that one of their marketed devices may have caused or contributed\nto a death or serious injury or has malfunctioned and that the device or a similar device marketed by the\nmanufacturer would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. If\nwe fail to report these events to the FDA within the required timeframes, or at all, the FDA could take\nenforcement action against us. Similar enforcement action could be taken by the competent authorities in\nthe European Union if we do not comply with our medical devices vigilance obligations. In addition, our\nEU Notified Body could decide to suspend or withdraw our CE Certificates of Conformity. Any such\nadverse event involving the TULSA-PRO or Sonalleve systems also could result in future voluntary\ncorrective actions, such as recalls or customer notifications, or agency action, such as inspection, audit or\nenforcement action. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, as well as defending\nourselves in a lawsuit, will require the dedication of personnel time and capital, distract management from\noperating the business and may harm our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition and operating results.\nLegislative or regulatory reform of the healthcare systems in which we intend to operate may\naffect our ability to sell our products profitably and could adversely affect our business.\nThe governments and regulatory authorities in the United States, the European Commission, Canada and\nother markets in which we expect to sell our devices may propose and adopt new legislation and\nregulatory requirements relating to medical product approval criteria, manufacturing and marketing\nrequirements. In addition, regulations and guidance promulgated by the FDA, the European Commission,\nand other regulatory bodies are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency and other relevant regulatory\nbodies in ways that may significantly affect our business and products. It is impossible to predict whether\nlegislative changes will be enacted or regulations, guidance or interpretations changed and what the\nimpact of such changes, if any, may be. Such legislation or changes in regulatory requirements, or the\nfailure to comply with such, could adversely impact our operations and could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFor example, in the United States in December 2022, Congress enacted the Food and Drug Omnibus\nReform Act of 2022 (FDORA), which reauthorized the FDA to collect device user fees and contained\nsubstantive amendments to the device provisions of the FFDCA. Such changes include a new\nrequirement for premarket submissions for “cyber devices” to include plans to address postmarket\ncybersecurity vulnerabilities and other cybersecurity-related information, a new requirement for sponsors\nof medical device clinical trials to develop diversity action plans, and new authority for FDA to approve or\nclear predetermined change control plans in PMAs or 510(k) premarket notifications, among other\nchanges. The FDA has implemented, and continues to implement, these reforms, which could impose\nadditional regulatory requirements upon us and delay our ability to obtain new 510(k) clearances or PMA\napprovals or increase the costs of compliance. Any change in the laws or regulations that govern the\nclearance and approval processes relating to our products could make it more difficult and costly to obtain\nclearance or approval for new products, or to produce, market and distribute products. Significant delays\nin receiving clearance or approval, or the failure to receive clearance or approval for our products would\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOn April 5, 2017, the EU adopted the New EU MDR, which became fully applicable on May 26, 2021, and\na new Regulation on in vitro diagnostic medical devices (Regulation (EU) 2017/746 of the European\nParliament and of the Council on in vitro diagnostic medical devices (“IVDR”)), which became fully\napplicable on May 26, 2022. The Regulations do not set out a substantially different regulatory system,\nbut contemplate, among other things, stricter controls of medical devices, including strengthening of the\nconformity assessment procedures, increased expectations as regards clinical data for devices and pre-\nmarket regulatory review of high-risk devices and an extension of transparency requirements through the\nestablishment of a comprehensive EU database on medical devices and of a device traceability system\nallowing a device to be traced from its manufacturer through the supply chain to the final user. The New\nEU MDR and the IVDR also introduce new classification rules according to which manufacturers must test\ntheir products and adapt their documentation. For example, stricter clinical requirements now apply to\nClass III medical devices and implants under the New EU MDR. The New EU MDR and IVDR also\nimpose stricter and more onerous obligations on economic operators (including manufacturers and\nauthorized representatives).\nAfter the expiry of the transitional periods as provided by the New EU MDR and the IVDR, respectively,\nonly devices that have been CE marked under the New EU MDR/IVDR may be placed on the market in\nthe EU. The latest a certificate from a Notified Body under the MDD will expire is May 27, 2028; however,\nsome devices may not benefit from this transition period at all and/or will not benefit for the entire period.\nFewer Notified Bodies currently have a notification under the New EU MDR as compared with the MDD.\nThe new legislation may therefore delay the CE marking of our product candidates under development or\nimpact our ability to renew the CE marking of our currently CE marked products on a timely basis.\nFurther, there is no guarantee that products approved under the MDD can or will be approved under the\nNew EU MDR in their current form.\nUpon Brexit, the UK did not implement the New EU MDR into the laws of Great Britain (England, Scotland\nand Wales) but the New EU MDR does apply in Northern Ireland currently. Great Britain instead kept the\nexisting legal framework (based on the MDD) and updated it so it existed as a standalone medical\ndevices framework and introduced some changes. For example, instead of a CE Mark, medical devices\nmarketed in Great Britain must bear a UKCA mark. However, EU CE Marks will continue to be\nrecognized in Great Britain until June 30, 2028, if the device is CE marked under the MDD, or until June\n30, 2030, if the device is CE marked under the new EU MDR, as will certificates issued by EU-recognized\nnotified bodies. This arrangement is not reciprocated in the EU. Each medical device that we wish to\nmarket in the UK must comply with the national laws in the UK, which going forwards may differ from the\nlaws in the EU. However, notably, in June 2022, the UK’s competent authority published a response to its\nconsultation on proposed changes to the medical device regulatory framework and this included wide\nsweeping regulatory changes that will mean the new UK regulatory framework will more closely align with\nthe New EU MDR (although there will be some notable differences, such as the need for UKCA marks\nrather than CE Marks). The UK Government has stated it aims for the changes to come into force in July\n2025, subject to the transition periods for devices with CE Marks described above.\nThe growth of overall healthcare costs as a percentage of gross domestic product in many countries\nmeans that governments and payers are under intense pressure to control healthcare spending even\nmore tightly. As a result, our businesses and the healthcare industry in general are operating in an ever\nmore challenging environment with very significant pricing pressures. In recent years, national, federal,\nprovincial, state and local officials and legislators have proposed, or are reportedly considering proposing,\na variety of price-based reforms to the healthcare systems in the United States, the European Union and\nother countries. Some proposals include measures that would limit or eliminate payments for certain\nmedical procedures and treatments or subject pricing to government control. Furthermore, in certain\nforeign markets, the pricing or profitability of healthcare products is subject to government controls and\nother measures that have been prepared by legislators and government officials. While we cannot predict\nwhether any such legislative or regulatory proposals or reforms will be adopted, the adoption of any such\nproposals or reforms could adversely affect the commercial viability of our existing and potential products.\nThe Trump Administration implemented regulatory changes to healthcare insurance exchange\nparameters. According to the Trump administration’s statements describing the changes, they were\nintended to increase flexibility, improve affordability, promote stability, and reduce unnecessary burdens.\nThe Biden Administration has sought to reverse some of these changes. We cannot predict the\ncontinuing existence or the full effect of these new measures, what other health care laws, and\nregulations and programs will be ultimately implemented at the federal or state level, or the effect of any\nfuture legislation, regulation or court order. However, any changes that deny or restrict coverage or lower\nreimbursement for our products or reduce medical procedure volumes could adversely affect our\nbusiness and results of operations. Changes in the law or regulatory framework that reduce our revenues\nor increase our costs would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations and cash flows.\nOther legislation or regulatory proposals may adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nExisting and proposed changes in the laws and regulations affecting public companies may cause us to\nincur increased costs as we evaluate the implications of new rules and responds to new requirements.\nFailure to comply with the new rules and regulations could result in enforcement actions or the\nassessment of other penalties. The new laws and regulations could make it more difficult to obtain certain\ntypes of insurance, including directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept\nreduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar\ncoverage. The impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified\npersons to serve on our Board, or as executive officers. We may be required to hire additional personnel\nand utilize additional outside legal, accounting and advisory services, all of which could cause our general\nand administrative costs to increase beyond what we currently have planned. Although we intend to\nevaluate and monitor developments with respect to these rules, we cannot predict or estimate the amount\nof the additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs.\nWe are subject to “fraud and abuse” laws, anti-bribery laws, environmental laws and privacy and\nsecurity regulations. Any violation by our employees or other agents could expose us to severe\npenalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to the FCPA, which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their officers,\ndirectors and employees from giving, promising, offering or authorizing, directly or indirectly, any\npayments or anything of value to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or\ndirecting business to any company or person, by securing an improper advantage, influencing any act or\ndecision by a foreign official in their official capacity, or inducing a foreign official to do or omit to do\nsomething in violation of their lawful duty. The FCPA also requires issuers to maintain accurate books\nand records and adequate internal controls. In addition, we are subject to anti-bribery laws of the nations\nin which we conduct business (e.g., Bribery Act 2010 in the United Kingdom, Articles 299a and 299b of\nthe German Criminal Code specifically addressing bribery in the healthcare sector, the Corruption of\nForeign Public Officials Act in Canada and laws adopted pursuant to the Organisation for Economic Co-\noperation and Development Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International\nBusiness Transactions). If our employees or our agents are found to have engaged in prohibited conduct\nunder our policies and procedures, or under the FCPA or other anti-bribery laws to which we may be\nsubject, we could suffer severe penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations may be directly or indirectly affected by various broad United States or foreign healthcare\nfraud and abuse laws. In particular, the United States federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute\nprohibits any person from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration,\ndirectly or indirectly, in return for or to induce the referring, ordering, leasing, purchasing or arranging for\nor recommending the ordering, purchasing or leasing of an item or service, for which payment may be\nmade under United States federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs.\nThis statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between device manufacturers on one hand\nand prescribers and purchasers on the other. For example, the United States government has sought to\napply the Anti-Kickback Statute to device manufacturers’ financial relationships with physician\nconsultants. Among other theories, the United States government has alleged that some such\nrelationships are payments to induce the consultants to arrange for or recommend the ordering,\npurchasing or leasing of the manufacturers’ products by the hospitals, medical institutions and other\nentities with whom they are affiliated. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory\nsafe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the\nexemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and arrangements that involve remuneration that could\ninduce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to government scrutiny if they do not\nqualify for an exemption or a safe harbor.\nAlso, the False Claims Act prohibits persons from knowingly submitting, or causing to be submitted, a\nfalse claim to, or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from the federal government.\nSuits filed under the False Claims Act can be brought by the United States government or they can be\nbrought by an individual on behalf of the United States government, as “qui tam” actions, and such\nindividuals, commonly known as “whistleblowers,” may share in any damages paid by the entity to the\nUnited States government in fines or settlement. When an entity is determined to have violated the False\nClaims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the United\nStates government, plus civil penalties of up to approximately $25,000 for each separate false claim.\nVarious states have also enacted laws modeled after the False Claims Act.\nProfound also may be subject to various privacy and security regulations, including but not limited to\nHIPAA in the United States. HIPAA mandates, among other things, the adoption of uniform standards for\nthe electronic exchange of information in common health care transactions (e.g., health care claims\ninformation and plan eligibility, referral certification and authorization, claims status, plan enrolment,\ncoordination of benefits and related information), as well as standards relating to the privacy and security\nof individually identifiable health information, which govern the use and disclosure of such information and\nrequire the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information. In\naddition, many U.S. states, Canadian provinces and other countries have enacted comparable laws\naddressing the privacy and security of health information, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA.\nFailure to comply with these laws could result in the imposition of significant civil and criminal penalties.\nThe costs of compliance with these laws and the potential liability associated with the failure to comply\nwith these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating\nresults.\nCompliance with environmental laws and regulations could be expensive, and failure to comply\nwith these laws and regulations could subject us to significant liability.\nWe may use hazardous materials in our research and development and manufacturing processes. We\nare subject to various regulations governing use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and\nassociated waste products. We will need one or more licenses to handle such materials, but there can be\nno assurance that it will be able to retain these licenses in the future or obtain licenses under new\nregulations if and when they are required by governing authorities. We cannot completely eliminate the\nrisk of contamination or injury resulting from hazardous materials, and we may incur liability as a result of\nany such contamination or injury. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for damages or\npenalized with fines, and the liability could exceed our resources and any applicable insurance. We would\nalso likely incur expenses related to any such incidents. Such future expenses or liability could have a\nsignificant negative impact on its business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, we\ncannot assure that the cost of compliance with these laws and regulations will not materially increase in\nthe future. We may also be subject to liability in respect of the operations of prior owners or operators of\nany properties we may own, at manufacturing sites where operations have previously resulted in spills,\ndischarges or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment. We could be held strictly\nliable under environmental laws for contamination of property that we occupy without regard to fault or\nwhether our actions were in compliance with law at the time. Our liability could also increase if other\nresponsible parties, including prior owners or operators of our facilities, fail to complete their clean-up\nobligations or satisfy indemnification obligations to us. Similarly, if we fail to ensure compliance with\napplicable environmental laws in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, we may not be able to offer our\nproducts and may be subject to civil or criminal liabilities.\nRisk Factors Relating to Intellectual Property\nIf we breach any of the agreements under which we license rights to our technology from third\nparties, we could lose license rights that are important to our business. Certain of our license\nagreements may not provide an adequate remedy for their breach by the licensor.\nWe license certain development and commercialization rights for certain technologies used in our\nsystems and expect to enter into similar licenses in the future. For instance, we license exclusive\nintellectual property rights from Sunnybrook that enable us to use, manufacture, distribute and sell the\nTULSA-PRO system. Under this royalty-free license, we are subject to various obligations, including the\nmilestone payment of C$250,000 we paid upon obtaining FDA clearance of our TULSA-PRO system, and\nlegal costs associated with patent application preparation, filing and maintenance. If we breach or\notherwise terminate any of the agreements under which we license rights to our technology from third\nparties, we could lose intellectual property rights that are important to our business and incur other\nliabilities. Certain of our license agreements may not provide an adequate remedy for their breach by the\nlicensor. The loss or breach of any of these license agreements could have a material adverse effect on\nour business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur proprietary rights may not adequately protect our technologies.\nOur commercial success will depend on our ability to obtain patents (or exclusive rights thereto) and to\nmaintain adequate protection for our technologies in the United States, Europe, Canada and other\ncountries. We own or have exclusive rights to multiple issued United States patents and several pending\nUnited States patent applications in respect of our products. For the TULSA-PRO system, our patent\nrights include rights licensed to us from Sunnybrook and other intellectual property that we have\ndeveloped. We acquired the patent rights for the Sonalleve system from Philips. We or our licensors will\nbe able to protect such proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our\nproprietary technologies and future products are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are\neffectively maintained as trade secrets.\nWe apply for patents covering our technologies as we deem appropriate. However, we may fail to apply\nfor patents on important technologies in a timely fashion, or at all. Our existing patent applications and\nany future patents we may obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from utilizing our\ntechnologies or from developing competing products and technologies. In addition, we cannot guarantee\nthat:\n• we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our licensed or\nissued patents and pending patent applications;\n• we or our licensors were the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n• others will not independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of\nour or our licensors’ technologies;\n• any of our or our licensors’ pending patent applications will result in issued patents;\n• any of our or our licensors’ patents will be valid or enforceable;\n• any patents issued to us or our licensors and collaboration partners will provide us with any\ncompetitive advantages, or will not be challenged by third parties;\n• we will develop or in-license additional proprietary technologies that are patentable; or\n• the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe actual protection afforded by a patent varies on an offering-by-offering basis, from country to country\nand depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of our or our licensors’ coverage,\nthe availability of regulatory related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country\nand the validity and enforceability of the patents. Our or our licensors’ ability to maintain and solidify our\nor our licensors’ proprietary position for our products will depend on our or our licensors’ success in\nobtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims once granted. Our or our licensors’ issued\npatents and those that may be issued in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and\nthe rights granted under any such issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or\ncompetitive advantages against competitors with similar products or offerings. Due to the extensive\namount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of a medical device, it is\npossible that, before our devices can be commercialized, any relevant patent may expire or remain in\nforce for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent.\nProtection afforded by patents may be adversely affected by recent or future changes to patent related\nstatutes and administrative procedures, for example, such as in the laws of the United States or to\nUSPTO rules. Patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the\nprosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. For\nexample, on September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith Act was signed into law in the United States. The\nLeahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to United States patent law. These include\nprovisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation.\nHowever, it is not fully clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our\nbusiness. As such, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation, as well as any future changes to patent\nlaw in the United States or elsewhere, could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the\nprosecution of our or our licensors’ patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our or our\nlicensors’ issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition and operating results.\nMoreover, we or our licensors may be subject to a third-party preissuance submission of prior art to the\nUSPTO and other patent offices, or become involved in opposition, derivation, re-examination, inter\npartes review or interference proceedings, or other preissuance or post-grant proceedings in the United\nStates or other jurisdictions, challenging our or our licensors’ patent rights or the patent rights of others.\nAn adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or\ninvalidate, our or our licensors’ patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or\nproduct and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or\ncommercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of\nprotection provided by our or our licensors’ patents and patent applications is threatened, it could\ndissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future\nproducts. Changes to the current patent statutes may adversely affect the protection afforded by our\npatents and/or open our patents up to third-party attack in non-litigation settings. The costs of patent\nenforcement or invalidity proceedings could be substantial, result in adverse determinations, and divert\nmanagement attention from our business.\nWe also rely on trade secrets to protect some of our technology, especially where we do not believe\npatent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to maintain. While we\nuse reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our or our collaboration partners’ employees,\nconsultants, contractors or scientific and other advisors may unintentionally or wilfully disclose our\nproprietary information to competitors. Enforcement of claims that a third-party has illegally obtained and\nis using trade secrets is expensive, time consuming and uncertain, and may divert our efforts and\nattention from other aspects of our business. In addition, non-U.S. courts are sometimes less willing than\ncourts in the United States to protect trade secrets. If our competitors independently develop equivalent\nknowledge, methods and know-how, we would not be able to assert our trade secrets against them and\nour business could be harmed.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on all of our product candidates, and products and services,\nwhen and if we have any, in every jurisdiction would be prohibitively expensive. Competitors may use our\ntechnologies in jurisdictions where we or our licensors have not obtained patent protection to develop\ncompeting products. These products may compete with our products, when and if we have any, and may\nnot be covered by any of our or our licensors’ patent claims or other intellectual property rights.\nThe laws of some countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of\nthe United States and many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and\ndefending such rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain\ndeveloping countries, may not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection,\nparticularly those relating to biotechnology and/or pharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to\nstop the infringement of our patents. Proceedings to enforce our or our licensors’ patent rights in foreign\njurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our\nbusiness.\nThe patent protection for our technologies may expire before we are able to maximize our\ncommercial value which may subject us to increased competition and reduce or eliminate our\nopportunity to generate product revenue.\nThe patents for our technologies have varying expiration dates; although the patents for the technologies\nwe use are not expected to expire in the near term, when these patents expire, we may be subject to\nincreased competition and may not be able to recover our development costs or license fees. In some of\nthe larger economic territories, such as the United States and the European Union, patent term\nextension/restoration may be available to compensate for time taken during aspects of a product\ncandidate’s regulatory review. However, we cannot be certain that any extension will be granted or, if\ngranted, what the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded during any extended\nperiod will be. If we or our licensors are unable to obtain patent term extension/restoration or some other\nexclusivity, we could be subject to increased competition and our opportunity to establish or maintain\nproduct revenue could be substantially reduced or eliminated. Furthermore, we may not have sufficient\ntime to recover our development costs prior to the expiration of our or our licensors’ patents in the United\nStates or elsewhere.\nWe may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to\nenforcement of our or our licensors’ patent and other intellectual property rights and we may be\nunable to protect our rights to, or use of, our technology.\nIf we choose to go to court to try to stop or prevent a third-party from using the inventions claimed in our\nor our licensors’ patents, that third-party has the right to ask the court to rule that these patents are invalid\nand/or should not be enforced against that third-party. Even if we were successful in stopping the\ninfringement of these patents, these lawsuits are expensive and would consume time and other resources\nand divert attention from other aspects of our business. In addition, there is a risk that the court will\ndecide that these patents are invalid or unenforceable and that we do not have the right to prevent the\nother party from using the inventions. There is also the risk that, even if the validity of these patents is\nupheld, the court will refuse to prevent the other party’s activities on the ground that such other party’s\nactivities do not infringe our rights.\nWe may be subject to lawsuits from, liable for damages to, or be required to enter into license\nagreements with, a third-party that claims we infringed its patents or otherwise misused its\nproprietary information.\nIf we wish to use the technology in issued and unexpired patents owned by others, we will need to obtain\na license from the owner, enter into litigation to challenge the validity or enforceability of these patents or\nincur the risk of litigation in the event that the owner asserts that we infringed these patents. The failure to\nobtain a license for technology or the failure to challenge an issued patent owned by others that we may\nrequire to develop or commercialize our product candidates may have a material adverse impact on us.\nIn addition, if a third-party asserts that we infringed its patents or other proprietary rights, we could face a\nnumber of risks that could seriously harm our results of operations, financial condition and competitive\nposition, including:\n• patent infringement and other intellectual property claims, which would be costly and time\nconsuming to defend, whether or not the claims have merit, and which could delay the\nregulatory approval process and divert management’s attention from our business;\n• substantial damages for past infringement, including possible treble damages in some\njurisdictions, which we may have to pay if a court determines that our product candidates,\nofferings or technologies infringe a competitor’s patent or other proprietary rights;\n• a court prohibiting us from selling or licensing our technologies unless the third-party licenses\npatents or other proprietary rights to us on commercially reasonable terms, which it is not\nrequired to do; and\n• if a license is available from a third-party, we may have to pay substantial royalties or lump\nsum payments or grant cross licenses to our patents or other proprietary rights to obtain that\nlicense.\nThe coverage of patents is subject to interpretation by the courts and the interpretation is not always\nuniform. If we are sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our products or\nmethods of use either do not infringe the patent claims of the relevant patent and/or that the patent claims\nare invalid, and we may not be able to do this. Proving invalidity, in particular, is difficult since it requires a\nshowing of clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of validity enjoyed by issued\npatents.\nPatent laws in the United States as well as the laws of certain other jurisdictions provide for provisional\nrights in published patent applications beginning on the date of publication, including the right to obtain\nreasonable royalties, if a patent is subsequently issued and certain other conditions are met. While we\nbelieve that there may be multiple grounds on which to challenge the validity of United States patents and\nthe counterparts filed in other jurisdictions possibly relevant to our business, we cannot predict the\noutcome of any invalidity challenge. Alternatively, it is possible that we may determine it is prudent to\nseek a license from a patent holder to avoid potential litigation and other potential disputes. We cannot be\nsure that a license would be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nBecause some patent applications in certain jurisdictions may be maintained in secrecy until the patents\nare issued, because patent applications in the United States and many other jurisdictions are typically not\npublished until 18 months after filing and because publications in the scientific literature often lag behind\nactual discoveries, we cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications for technology\ncovered by our or our licensors’ issued patents or our pending applications or our licensors’ pending\napplications, or that we or our licensors were the first to invent the technology.\nPatent applications filed by third parties that cover technology similar to ours may have priority over our or\nour licensors’ patent applications and could further require us to obtain rights to issued patents covering\nsuch technologies. If another party files a United States patent application on an invention similar to ours,\nwe may elect to participate in or be drawn into an interference or other proceeding declared by the\nUSPTO to determine priority of invention in the United States. The costs of these proceedings could be\nsubstantial, and it is possible that such efforts would be unsuccessful, resulting in a loss of our United\nStates patent position with respect to such inventions.\nWe may also be subject to damages resulting from claims that we or our employees or consultants have\nwrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of third parties. Many of our employees were\npreviously employed, and certain of our consultants are currently employed, at universities or medical\ndevice companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we have not received any\nclaim to date, we may be subject to claims that we, or these employees or consultants, have inadvertently\nor otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of these current or former\nemployers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending such\nclaims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or\npersonnel. We may be subject to claims that employees of our partners or licensors of technology\nlicensed by us have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary\ninformation of their former employers. We may become involved in litigation to defend against these\nclaims. If we fail in defending such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable\nintellectual property rights or personnel; and even if we are successful in defending such claims, they can\nbe expensive and would consume time and other resources and divert attention from other aspects of our\nbusiness.\nSome of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent and other intellectual\nproperty litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. In\naddition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our operations. We cannot\npredict whether third parties will assert these claims against us or against our licensors, or whether those\nclaims will harm our business. If we or our licensors are forced to defend against these claims, whether\nthey are with or without any merit, whether they are resolved in favor of or against us or our licensors, we\nmay face costly litigation and diversion of management’s attention and resources. As a result of these\ndisputes, we may have to develop costly non-infringing technology, or enter into licensing agreements.\nThese agreements, if necessary, may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us, if at all, which could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to the International Scope of our Business\nOur business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations are subject to risks arising\nfrom our international operations.\nWe conduct a portion of our business outside Canada and the U.S. and in the future expect to expand our\noperations into new international jurisdictions, including emerging markets.\nOur foreign operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business abroad, such as: difficulties in\ncoordinating and managing foreign operations, price and currency exchange controls, political and\neconomic instability, compliance with multiple regulatory regimes, differing degrees of protection for\nintellectual property, unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements and restrictive governmental\nactions. Adverse economic conditions impacting our customers or uncertainty about global economic\nconditions could cause purchases of our products to decline, which would adversely affect our revenues\nand operating results. Moreover, our projected revenues and operating results are based on assumptions\nconcerning certain levels of customer spending and ongoing use of our TULSA-PRO system.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Common Shares\nFuture sales or the issuances of our securities may cause the market price of our Common\nShares to decline.\nThe market price of our Common Shares could decline as a result of issuances of securities (including\nour Common Shares) by us, exercises of outstanding options or warrants for additional Common Shares\nor sales by our existing shareholders of Common Shares in the market, or the perception that these\nissuances or sales could occur. Sales of Common Shares by shareholders may make it more difficult for\nus to sell equity securities at a time and price that we deem appropriate. As at December 31, 2023, there\nwere a total of 1,474,809 outstanding share options issued under our Share Option Plan, 493,396\nRestricted Stock Units (“RSUs”), 75,000 Deferred Stock Units (“DSUs”) issued. In addition, as at\nDecember 31, 2023, the maximum number of Common Shares reserved for issuance under this plan is\n2,778,173 Common Shares or such other number as may be approved by the holders of the voting\nshares of the Company. In addition, in September 2023, we entered into an at-the-market equity program\nthat allows us, through certain securities dealers acting as agents, to issue and sell from time to time up\nto $30.0 million of our Common Shares. Sales or issuances of substantial numbers of Common Shares,\nor the perception that such sales or issuances could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices\nof the Common Shares. With any such sale or issuance of Common Shares, investors may suffer dilution\nand we may experience dilution in our earnings per share.\nWe expect that the price of our Common Shares may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of securities of many companies, particularly development and early commercial stage\nmedical device companies, experience wide fluctuations in price that are not necessarily related to the\noperating performance, underlying asset values or prospects of such companies.\nThe market price of our Common Shares could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many risk\nfactors listed in this section, and others beyond our control, including:\n• delays in respect of our commercialization of the TULSA-PRO system in the United States;\n• adverse results or delays in our future planned data collection for the TACT Pivotal Clinical\nTrial and any future clinical trials that we may conduct;\n• regulatory actions with respect to our products and/or product candidates;\n• changes in laws or regulations applicable to our products or any future product candidates,\nincluding but not limited to clinical trial requirements for approvals;\n• actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results;\n• actual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\n• competition from existing products or new products that may emerge;\n• announcements by us, our collaborators or our competitors of significant acquisitions,\nstrategic partnerships, joint ventures, collaborations or capital commitments;\n• failure to meet or exceed financial estimates and projections of the investment community or\nthat we provide to the public;\n• issuance of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts;\n• fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n• share price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our\nshares;\n• additions or departures of key management or scientific personnel;\n• disputes or other developments related to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation\nmatters and our ability to obtain patent protection for its products;\n• announcement or expectation of additional debt or equity financing efforts;\n• sales or issuances of our Common Shares by us, our insiders or our other shareholders,\nincluding by exercise of outstanding options or warrants; and\n• general economic and market conditions.\nThese and other market and industry factors may cause the market price and demand for our Common\nShares to fluctuate substantially, regardless of our actual operating performance, which may limit or\nprevent investors from readily selling their Common Shares and may otherwise negatively affect the\nliquidity of our Common Shares. In addition, stock markets in general, and the TSX, the Nasdaq and the\nshare prices of biotechnology companies in particular, have experienced price and volume fluctuations\nthat have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies.\nIf equity research analysts research or reports about our business or if they issue unfavorable\ncommentary or downgrade our Common Shares, the price of our Common Shares could decline.\nThe trading market for our Common Shares will rely in part on the research and reports that equity\nresearch analysts publish about us and our business, over which we have no control. The price of our\nCommon Shares could decline if one or more equity analysts downgrade our Common Shares or if\nanalysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business.\nWe may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management\nattention.\nThe market price of our Common Shares may be volatile, and in the past companies that have\nexperienced volatility in the market price of their shares have been subject to securities class action\nlitigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Litigation of this type could result in\nsubstantial costs and diversion of management’s attention and resources, which could adversely impact\nour business. Any adverse determination in litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities.\nWe have never paid dividends on our Common Shares and we do not anticipate paying any\ndividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, any gains from an investment in our Common\nShares will likely depend on whether the price of our Common Shares increases.\nWe have not paid dividends on our Common Shares to date and we currently intend to retain our future\nearnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if\nany, of our Common Shares will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future. Consequently, in\nthe foreseeable future, you will likely only experience a gain from your investment in our Common Shares\nif the price of our Common Shares increases. In addition, the terms of the CIBC Loan restrict our ability\nand the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends and make certain distributions and transfers. As a\nresult, only appreciation of the price of the Common Shares will provide a return to holders of Common\nShares.\nIf we are unable to satisfy the requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley, or our internal controls over\nfinancial reporting are not effective, the reliability of our financial statements may be questioned.\nWe are subject to certain of the requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley. Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley\n(“Section 404”) requires companies subject to the reporting requirements of the U.S. securities laws to\ncomplete a comprehensive evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting. To comply with this\nstatute, we are required to document and test our internal control procedures and our management are\nrequired to assess and issue a report concerning our internal controls over financial reporting. Pursuant to\nthe JOBS Act, we are classified as an “emerging growth company.” Under the JOBS Act, emerging\ngrowth companies are exempt from certain reporting requirements, including the independent auditor\nattestation requirements of Section 404(b) of Sarbanes-Oxley. Under this exemption, our independent\nauditor is not required to attest to and report on management’s assessment of our internal controls over\nfinancial reporting during a five-year transition period. We need to prepare for compliance with Section\n404 by strengthening, assessing and testing our system of internal controls to provide the basis for our\nreport. However, the continuous process of strengthening our internal controls and complying with\nSection 404 is complicated and time-consuming. Furthermore, we believe that our business will grow both\ndomestically and internationally, in which case our internal controls will become more complex and will\nrequire significantly more resources and attention to ensure our internal controls remain effective overall.\nDuring the course of our testing, our management may identify material weaknesses or significant\ndeficiencies, which may not be remedied in a timely manner to meet the deadline imposed by Sarbanes-\nOxley. If our management cannot favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial\nreporting, or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies material weaknesses in our\ninternal controls, investor confidence in our financial results may weaken, and the market price of our\nsecurities may suffer.\nAny default under our existing debt that is not waived by the applicable lender could materially\nadversely impact our results of operations and financial results and may have a material adverse\neffect on the trading price of our Common Shares.\nWe are required to comply with the covenants in the CIBC Loan and such covenants may create a risk of\ndefault on our debt if we cannot satisfy or continue to satisfy these covenants. If we are determined not to\nhave complied or in the future cannot comply with a debt covenant or anticipate that we will be unable to\ncomply with a debt covenant under any debt instrument we are a party to, including the CIBC Loan,\nmanagement may seek a waiver and/or amendment to the applicable debt instrument in respect of any\nsuch covenant in order to avoid any breach or default that might otherwise result therefrom. On June 30,\n2023, we were in breach of the covenant in the CIBC Loan that revenue for any fiscal quarter must be\n15% greater than revenue for the same fiscal quarter in the prior fiscal year. Prior to such breach, we\nobtained a waiver from CIBC, pursuant to which CIBC has waived such breach. On September 26, 2023,\nan amendment to the CIBC Loan changed financial covenants. The revised covenants specify that\nunrestricted cash must be greater than either (i) negative EBITDA for the most recent nine -month period\nor (ii) $7,500, reported monthly. Additionally, recurring revenue for any fiscal quarter must be 15% greater\nthan the same quarter in the prior fiscal year, reported quarterly. As of September 30, 2023, we were in\ncompliance with these covenants. Future compliance depends on achieving specific revenue, EBITDA,\nand cash levels. If we default under a debt instrument, including the CIBC Loan, and the default is not\nwaived by the lender(s), the debt extended pursuant to the CIBC Loan and any other debt instruments\ncould become due and payable prior to its stated due date. If such event were to occur in the future, we\ncannot give any assurance that (i) CIBC and/or our other lenders will agree to any covenant amendments\nor waive any covenant breaches or defaults that may occur, and (ii) we could pay this debt if it became\ndue prior to its stated due date. Accordingly, if we are unable to negotiate a covenant waiver or replace or\nrefinance our existing debt on favorable terms or at all, such default could materially adversely impact our\nresults of operations and financial results and may have a material adverse effect on the trading price of\nour Common Shares. Future compliance with the financial covenants included in the CIBC Loan is\ndependent upon achieving certain revenue, EBITDA, and anticipated cash levels. Management considers\nthere is a potential for a breach of these covenants in the future due to the volatility and unpredictability of\nour revenues\nAs a foreign private issuer whose shares are listed on Nasdaq, we intend to follow certain home\ncountry corporate governance practices instead of certain Nasdaq requirements.\nAs a foreign private issuer whose shares are listed on Nasdaq, we are permitted to follow certain home\ncountry corporate governance practices instead of certain requirements of the Nasdaq rules. We intend to\nadopt and approve material changes to equity incentive plans in accordance with TSX listing rules, which\ndo not impose a requirement of shareholder approval for such actions. In addition, we intend to follow the\nTSX listing rules in respect of private placements instead of Nasdaq requirements to obtain shareholder\napproval for certain dilutive events (such as issuances that will result in a change of control, certain\ntransactions other than a public offering involving issuances of a 20% or greater interest in us and certain\nacquisitions of the stock or assets of another company) and the minimum quorum requirement for a\nshareholders meeting. Under Nasdaq listing rules, the required minimum quorum for a shareholders\nmeeting is 33 1/3% of the outstanding Common Shares, and our minimum quorum requirement is only\n10% of the total number of voting rights attaching to all outstanding Common Shares. Accordingly, our\nshareholders may not be afforded the same protection as provided under Nasdaq corporate governance\nrules for domestic issuers.\nWe will incur significantly increased costs and devote substantial management time as a result of\noperating as a U.S. public company.\nAs a U.S. public company, we have and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other\nexpenses that we did not incur as a private company or as a Canadian public company. For example, we\nare subject to the reporting requirements of the U.S. Exchange Act, and are required to comply with the\napplicable requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer\nProtection Act, as well as rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC and the including\nthe establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in\ncorporate governance practices. Compliance with these requirements has increased and likely will\ncontinue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time\nconsuming and costly. In addition, management and other personnel have needed to divert attention from\noperational and other business matters to devote substantial time to these public company requirements.\nIn particular, we expect to incur significant expenses and devote substantial management effort toward\nensuring compliance with the requirements of Section 404, which involve annual assessments of a\ncompany’s internal controls over financial reporting. We may need to hire additional accounting and\nfinancial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge and may\nneed to establish an internal audit function. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of such additional\ncosts we may incur as a result of becoming a U.S. public company or the timing of such costs.\nWe may lose foreign private issuer status in the future, which could result in significant additional\ncosts and expenses.\nWe may in the future lose foreign private issuer status if a majority of our Common Shares are held in the\nUnited States and we fail to meet the additional requirements necessary to avoid loss of foreign private\nissuer status, such as if: (i) a majority of our directors or executive officers are U.S. citizens or residents;\n(ii) a majority of our assets are located in the United States; or (iii) our business is administered principally\nin the United States. The regulatory and compliance costs to us under U.S. securities laws as a U.S.\ndomestic issuer will be significantly more than the costs incurred as an SEC foreign private issuer. If we\nare not a foreign private issuer, we would be required to file periodic and current reports and registration\nstatements on U.S. domestic issuer forms with the SEC, which are generally more detailed and extensive\nthan the forms available to a foreign private issuer. In addition, we may lose the ability to rely upon\nexemptions from corporate governance requirements that are available to foreign private issuers.\nIt may be difficult for United States investors to effect service of process or enforcement of\nactions against us or certain of our directors and officers under U.S. federal securities laws.\nProfound is incorporated under the laws of the Province of Ontario, Canada. A majority of our directors\nand officers reside in Canada. Because all or a substantial portion of our assets and these persons are\nlocated outside the United States, it will be difficult for United States investors to effect service of process\nin the United States upon us or our directors or officers, or to realize in the United States upon judgments\nof United States courts predicated upon civil liabilities under the U.S. Exchange Act or other United States\nlaws. It may also be difficult to have a judgment rendered in a U.S. court recognized or enforced against\nus in Canada.\nWe may be a passive foreign investment company (“PFIC”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes,\nwhich generally would result in certain adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to our U.S.\nshareholders.\nIn general, a non-U.S. corporation is a PFIC for any taxable year in which (i) 75% or more of its gross\nincome consists of passive income or (ii) 50% or more of the value of its assets consists of assets that\nproduce, or are held for the production of, passive income. Generally, “passive income” includes interest,\ndividends, rents, royalties and certain gains, and cash generally is a passive asset for PFIC purposes. We\nhave made no determination as to whether we are classified as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes. The determination of whether we are a PFIC depends on the particular facts and\ncircumstances (such as the valuation of our assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets) and is\nalso affected by the application of the PFIC rules, which are subject to differing interpretations. The fair\nmarket value of our assets is expected to depend, in part, upon (i) the market price of the Common\nShares, which is likely to fluctuate, and (ii) the composition of our income and assets, which will be\naffected by how, and how quickly, we spend any cash that is raised in any financing transaction. If we\nwere a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. shareholder owned the Common Shares, such U.S.\nshareholder generally will be subject to certain adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences, including\nincreased tax liability on gains from dispositions of the Common Shares and certain distributions and a\nrequirement to file annual reports with the Internal Revenue Service. In light of the foregoing, no\nassurance can be provided that we are not currently a PFIC or that we will not become a PFIC in any\nfuture taxable year. Prospective investors should consult their own tax advisers regarding our PFIC\nstatus.\nIf we are required to register as an “investment company” under the Investment Company Act,\nsignificant compliance costs and applicable restrictions could have a material adverse effect on\nour business.\nWe do not believe that we are an “investment company” under the Investment Company Act, but we can\nprovide no assurance that we will not be deemed an “investment company” in the future.\nSection 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act defines the term “investment company” to mean any\nissuer that “is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the\nbusiness of investing, reinvesting, or trading in securities.” Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company\nAct defines “investment company” as any issuer which “is engaged or proposes to engage in the\nbusiness of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading in securities, and owns or proposes to\nacquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40 per centum of the value of such issuer’s total\nassets (exclusive of government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis.” Generally, any\nissuer meeting the definition of an investment company is subject to all applicable provisions of the\nInvestment Company Act and must register with the Commission under Section 8 of the Investment\nCompany Act, unless it meets the terms and conditions of various exceptions provided by the Investment\nCompany Act or in rules adopted by the SEC under the Investment Company Act. The term “investment\nsecurities” is very broadly defined in the Investment Company Act. We believe that the cash on our\nbalance sheet is held in a manner so that it constitutes “cash items” instead of “investment securities”\nwithin the meaning of the Investment Company Act, and accordingly, we do not believe we are required\nto register as an investment company; however, if we no longer hold our cash in this manner, we may\nneed to find another available exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act.\nFor example, Rule 3a-2 of the Investment Company Act provides that inadvertent or transient investment\ncompanies will not be treated as investment companies subject to the provisions of the Investment\nCompany Act, provided the issuer has the requisite intent to be engaged in a non-investment business,\nevidenced by the issuer’s business activities and an appropriate resolution of the issuer’s board of\ndirectors, within one year from the commencement of the earlier of (1) the date on which the issuer owns\nsecurities and/or cash having a value exceeding 50% of the value of such issuer’s total assets on either a\nconsolidated or unconsolidated basis, or (2) the date on which an issuer owns or proposes to acquire\ninvestment securities (as defined in section 3(a) of the Investment Company Act) having a value\nexceeding 40% of the value of such issuer’s total assets (exclusive of government securities and cash\nitems) on an unconsolidated basis. If the Company becomes an inadvertent investment company, and\nfails to meet the requirements of the transient investment company exemption under Rule 3a-2 of the\nInvestment Company Act, then we will be required to register as an investment company with the SEC.\nHowever, if we were to be deemed an investment company, we would be required to register as an\ninvestment company or adjust our business strategy and assets. If we were required to register as an\ninvestment company under the Investment Company Act, we would incur substantial expenses\nassociated with such registration, and we would become subject to substantial regulation with respect to\nour capital structure, management, operations, transactions with affiliated persons, asset composition,\nincluding restrictions with respect to diversification and industry concentration, and other matters, which\nwould have a material adverse effect on our business.\nITEM 5. ACQUISITIONS\nOn July 31, 2017, Profound entered into the Philips Share Purchase Agreement with Philips in order to\nseek to expand the existing collaboration and acquire Philip’s Sonalleve MR-HIFU business.\nUnder terms of the Philips Share Purchase Agreement, Philips transferred its Sonalleve assets to\nProfound for upfront consideration of 7,400,000 Common Shares. Under the Philips Share Purchase\nAgreement, the earn-out provisions included a requirement that Profound pay additional consideration of:\n(i) 5% of Net Sales occurring after July 31, 2017 for the calendar year 2017; (ii) 6% of Net Sales occurring\nin the calendar year 2018; and (iii) 7% of Net Sales occurring in the calendar years 2019 and 2020.\nAs part of the Sonalleve Transaction, Philips and Profound expanded their non-exclusive strategic sales\nrelationship for Profound’s TULSA-PRO system to include distribution of Sonalleve.\nThe Sonalleve Transaction has expanded Profound’s core competency in MR-ultrasound ablation\ntherapy. Management believes that Profound is now the only company to provide a therapeutics platform\nthat provides the precision of real-time MR imaging combined with the safety and ablation power of\ndirectional (inside-out) and focused (outside-in) ultrasound technology for the incision-free ablation of\ndiseased tissue.\nWe continue to pursue growth opportunities both organically, increasing its existing business by gaining\nnew customers, increasing product and service penetration with existing clients, as well as through\ntransactions in which we acquire new operating entities. Over the past year, we have enhanced our\ncorporate development capabilities to execute transactions, through significant investments in people,\ntechnology and other organizational resources, and have developed techniques, processes and other\nintellectual capital, all with the objective of creating a powerful combination of real-time MR-guidance\nimaging platforms and ultrasound for delivering non-invasive ablative tools to clinicians.\nWe will consider acquisitions ranging in size and structure, but all share the characteristic of having a\nstrong underlying strategic rationale, which include enhancing the Company’s position in existing markets\nor providing entry into new markets, expanding the Company’s administrative and technological\ncapabilities, providing new supplier relationships and enhancing the breadth and depth of our product and\nservice offering.\nITEM 6. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nOur intellectual property is comprised of a broad and world-wide portfolio of patents, patent applications,\ntrademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other proprietary assets. Our intellectual property portfolio is\nboth growing and dynamic and includes approximately 37 patent families representing approximately 158\ngranted or allowed patents and 24 patent applications in various stages of review and prosecution around\nthe world.\nMany of our patents and patent applications claim electronic and mechanical aspects of hardware,\nsoftware and methods related to ultrasonic ablation of tissue. The intellectual property assets are largely\ndirected to (i) using real time MRI imaging as a tool to plan, monitor or control said ultrasonic ablation;\n(ii) MRI thermometry methods, especially in respect of our ultrasound therapy processes and devices;\n(iii) the phasing, beam-forming, and control of acoustic arrays and similar energy sources;\n(iv) computational method to improve filtering, imaging and analyzing the results of MRI-guided thermal\ntherapy processes; and (v) secondary and support systems such as active cooling of near-target tissues.\nThe portfolio covers both the “TULSA” and the “Sonalleve” families of products, as well as generic\ntechnologies and applications and extensions of our products.\nWe believe that the protection of our intellectual property is an essential element of our business and we\nintend to continue our investment in the development of our intellectual property portfolio. We have\nworked over the past year to pursue, maintain and expand on the intellectual property portfolio acquired\nfrom Philips in 2017. This intellectual property has been strengthened and extended to many jurisdictions\naround the globe in support of our sales, development and marketing efforts.\nWe pursue a global intellectual property strategy, registering for patent protection in all jurisdictions where\nwe intend to carry on business, including the United States, Canada, Japan, major European markets\n(e.g., Germany, France, U.K., Italy, Spain and Turkey) and the emerging markets (e.g., Brazil, Russia,\nIndia, and China).\nWe also rely upon trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary, confidential information for the\nprotection of our technology. We require all employees, consultants, scientific advisors and other\ncontractors to enter into confidentiality agreements to protect against the disclosure of such proprietary\ninformation. Each inventor is required to execute a formal assignment specific to each invention that he or\nshe has listed, and which is officially recorded in the proper patent office.\nIn addition to developing our own intellectual property portfolio, we have licensed and acquired intellectual\nproperty rights from third parties through exclusive licenses, collaborative research and asset purchase\nagreements. Material license agreements include an exclusive license with Sunnybrook entered into on\nMay 11, 2010 (the “Sunnybrook License”). Under the Sunnybrook License, Sunnybrook granted us an\nexclusive worldwide and royalty-free right to use certain defined Sunnybrook technology in connection\nwith, among other things, manufacturing, marketing and selling products such as the TULSA-PRO\nsystem, in the field of MRI-guided transurethral ultrasound therapy. Under the license, we are subject to\nvarious obligations, including a milestone payment of C$250,000 that was paid in connection with our\nFDA clearance of TULSA-PRO in August 2019. In addition, we are required to pay legal costs associated\nwith patent application preparation, filing and maintenance. If either party to the Sunnybrook License\nbreaches or fails to perform a material obligation and fails to cure such breach or perform such\nobligations within a 30-day cure period, the non-breaching party may terminate the agreement. Material\nobligations include our agreement not to use the technology or intellectual property outside of the license\nscope, not to use the technology or intellectual property outside the field of MRI-guided transurethral\nultrasound therapy (or permitting our customers to do so) and not to breach confidentiality obligations.\nITEM 7. HUMAN RESOURCES\nAs of the date of this AIF, we have 131 full-time employees, 16 of whom are unionized. We believe that\nour relations with our employees are positive. The Company will be adding staff and consulting resources\nin order to support product development, market access, field support and additional clinical trials.\nITEM 8. DIVIDENDS\nWe have not declared or paid any dividends since incorporation and we have no present intention to\ndeclare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Any decision to declare or pay dividends on the\nCommon Shares will be made by the Board based upon our earnings, financial requirements and other\nconditions existing at such future time.\nITEM 9. DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STRUCTURE\nThe authorized capital of Profound consists of an unlimited number of Common Shares. As at the date of\nthis AIF, there were 24,428,899 Common Shares issued and outstanding. The holders of Common\nShares are entitled to: (i) one vote for each Common Share held at all meetings of shareholders of\nProfound; (ii) the right to receive any dividend declared by Profound; and (iii) the right to receive the\nremaining property and assets of Profound upon dissolution.\nITEM 10.

The\nShare Option Plan was originally adopted by the Board on June 4, 2015, and then amended and restated\non December 8, 2016 effective January 26, 2017 and again on July 13, 2018.\nThe Share Option Plan provides that the Board may from time to time, in its discretion, grant to directors,\nofficers, employees, consultants and any other person or entity engaged to provide ongoing services to\nthe Company non-transferable options to purchase Common Shares, provided that the maximum number\nof Common Shares reserved for issuance under the Share Option Plan is equal to 13% of the issued and\noutstanding shares in the capital of the Company at the time of any option grant. If any option is\nexercised, cancelled, expired, surrendered or otherwise terminated for any reason, the number of\nCommon Shares in respect of which the option is exercised, cancelled, expired, surrendered or otherwise\nterminated, as the case may be, will again be available for purchase pursuant to options granted under\nthe plan. As at December 31, 2023, 1,474,809 Options had been granted under the Share Option Plan\nwith a weighted average contractual life of 6.08 years, and the maximum number of Common Shares\nreserved for issuance under this plan is 2,778,173 Common Shares or such other number as may be\napproved by the holders of the voting shares of the Company.\nThe aggregate number of Common Shares that may be (i) issued to insiders of the Company within any\none-year period, or (ii) issuable to insiders of the Company at any time, in each case, under the Share\nOption Plan alone or when combined with all other security-based compensation arrangements of the\nCompany, cannot exceed 10% of the outstanding Common Shares.\nThe Board shall determine the exercise price of the options, provided that it cannot be less than the\nMarket Price of the Common Shares on the date of grant. For the purposes of the Share Option Plan,\n“Market Price” means the volume-weighted average price of the Common Shares on the stock exchange\nwhere the majority of trading volume and value of the Common Shares occurs (currently, the TSX), for\nthe five trading days immediately preceding the relevant date on which the Market Price is to be\ndetermined.\nThe expiry date for an option under the Share Option Plan shall not be later than the 10th anniversary of\nthe date such option is granted, subject to the expiry date falling with a corporate blackout period or within\n5 business days following the expiry of such a blackout period, in which case the expiry date will be\nextended to the 10th business day following the expiry of the blackout period.\nUnless otherwise specified by the Board, each option under the Share Option Plan generally vests and\nbecomes exercisable as to 1/4 on the first anniversary of the date of grant and as to 1/36 on the first day\nof each calendar month thereafter. The Board has the discretion to permit accelerated vesting of options.\nWe do not provide any financial assistance to optionees to facilitate the purchase of Common Shares\nissued pursuant to the exercise of options under the Share Option Plan. Options granted under the Share\nOption Plan are not transferable or assignable (except to an optionee’s estate) and no options may be\nexercised by anyone other than the optionee or his or her legal representative during the lifetime of the\noptionee.\nWe intend to adopt and approve material changes to the Share Option Plan, and any other equity\nincentive plans that we may have in the future, in accordance with TSX listing rules, which do not impose\na requirement of shareholder approval for such actions.\n10.3 Escrowed Securities and Securities subject to Contractual Restriction or Transfer\nAs of the date of this AIF, to the knowledge of the Company, the Company has no escrowed securities or\nsecurities subject to contractual restriction on transfer.\nITEM 11.

A Shareholder who\nwishes to appoint some other person (who need not be a Shareholder) to attend and act for and on such\nShareholder’s behalf at the Meeting other than the management nominees designated in the form of proxy may\ndo so by either: (i) crossing out the names of the management nominees AND legibly printing the other person’s\nname in the blank space provided in the accompanying form of proxy; or (ii) completing another valid form of\nproxy. In either case, the completed form of proxy must be delivered to the Transfer Agent at the place and within the\ntime specified herein for the deposit of proxies. A Shareholder who appoints a proxy who is someone other than the\nmanagement representatives named in the form of proxy should notify the nominee of the appointment, obtain the\nnominee’s consent to act as proxy and provide instructions on how the Common Shares are to be voted. The nominee\n1\nshould bring personal identification to the Meeting. In any case, the form of proxy should be dated and executed by\nthe Shareholder or an attorney authorized in writing, with proof of such authorization attached (where an attorney\nexecuted the proxy form).\nIn order to validly appoint a proxy, the form of proxy must be received by the Transfer Agent (the address is stated\nabove or in the form of proxy) by 10:00 a.m. (Toronto time) on Monday May 15, 2023, or if the Meeting is adjourned\nor postponed, at least 48 hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, prior to any such adjournment or\npostponement. After such time, the Chair of the Meeting may accept or reject a form of proxy delivered to him in his\ndiscretion but is under no obligation to accept or reject any particular late form of proxy.\nRevocation of a Proxy\nA Shareholder who has validly given a proxy may revoke it for any matter upon which a vote has not already been\ncast by the proxyholder appointed therein. In addition to revocation in any other manner permitted by law, a proxy\nmay be revoked with an instrument in writing signed and delivered to either the registered office of the Corporation\nor the Transfer Agent, 100 Adelaide Street West, Suite 301, Toronto, Ontario, M5H 4H1, at any time up to and\nincluding the last business day preceding the date of the Meeting, or any postponement or adjournment thereof at\nwhich the proxy is to be used, or deposited with the Chair of such Meeting on the day of the Meeting, or any\nadjournment or postponement thereof. The document used to revoke a proxy must be in writing and completed and\nsigned by the Shareholder or his or her attorney authorized in writing or, if the Shareholder is a corporation, under its\ncorporate seal or by an officer or attorney thereof duly authorized.\nSignature on Proxies\nThe form of proxy must be executed by the Shareholder or his or her duly appointed attorney authorized in writing or,\nif the Shareholder is a corporation, by a duly authorized officer whose title must be indicated. A form of proxy signed\nby a person acting as attorney or in some other representative capacity should indicate that person’s capacity\n(following his or her signature) and should be accompanied by the appropriate instrument evidencing qualification\nand authority to act (unless such instrument has been previously filed with the Corporation).\nVoting of Proxies\nEach Shareholder may instruct his, her or its proxy how to vote his, her or its Common Shares by completing the\nblanks on the form of proxy.\nThe Common Shares represented by the enclosed form of proxy will be voted or withheld from voting on any\nmotion, by ballot or otherwise, in accordance with any indicated instructions. If a Shareholder specifies a choice\nwith respect to any matter to be acted upon, the Common Shares will be voted accordingly. In the absence of\nsuch direction, such Common Shares will be voted FOR the resolutions described in the form of proxy and\nbelow.\nThe accompanying form of proxy confers discretionary authority upon the persons named therein to vote on any\namendments or variations to matters identified in the Notice and with respect to such other business or matters which\nmay properly come before the Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. As of the date hereof,\nmanagement of the Corporation knew of no such amendments or variations or other matters to come before the\nMeeting.\nBeneficial (Non-Registered) Shareholders\nThe information set forth in this section is of importance to many Shareholders, as a substantial number of\nShareholders do not hold Common Shares in their own name. Shareholders who hold their Common Shares\nthrough depositories (e.g. CDS & Co., the registration name for CDS Clearing and Depository Services Inc.), brokers,\nintermediaries, trustees or other persons, or who otherwise do not hold their Common Shares in their own name\n(referred to in this Circular as “Beneficial Shareholders”) should note that only proxies deposited by Shareholders\nwho are registered Shareholders (that is, shareholders whose names appear on the records maintained by the Transfer\nAgent as registered holders of Common Shares) will be recognized and acted upon at the Meeting.\n2\nWithout specific instructions, brokers (or their agents and nominees) are prohibited from voting shares for the broker’s\nclients. Subject to the following discussion in relation to NOBOs (as defined herein), the Corporation does not know\nfor whose benefit the Common Shares registered in the name of CDS & Co., a broker or another nominee, are held.\nThere are two categories of Beneficial Shareholders for the purposes of applicable securities regulatory policy in\nrelation to the mechanism of dissemination to Beneficial Shareholders of proxy-related materials and other\nsecurityholder materials and to request voting instructions from such Beneficial Shareholders. Non-objecting\nbeneficial owners (“NOBOs”) are Beneficial Shareholders who have advised their intermediary (such as brokers or\nother nominees) that they do not object to their intermediary disclosing ownership information to the Corporation,\nconsisting of their name, address, e-mail address, securities holdings and preferred language of communication.\nSecurities legislation restricts the use of that information to matters strictly relating to the affairs of the\nCorporation. Objecting beneficial owners (“OBOs”) are Beneficial Shareholders who have advised their\nintermediary that they object to their intermediary disclosing such ownership information to the Corporation.\nIn accordance with the requirements of NI 54-101, the Corporation is sending the Notice, this Circular and a voting\ninstruction form or a form of proxy, as applicable (collectively, the “Meeting Materials”), directly to NOBOs and\nindirectly, through intermediaries, to OBOs. NI 54-101 permits the Corporation, in its discretion, to obtain a list of its\nNOBOs from intermediaries and use such NOBO list for the purpose of distributing the Meeting Materials directly to,\nand seeking voting instructions directly from, such NOBOs. As a result, the Corporation is entitled to deliver Meeting\nMaterials to Beneficial Shareholders in two manners: (a) directly to NOBOs and indirectly through intermediaries to\nOBOs; or (b) indirectly to all Beneficial Shareholders through intermediaries. In accordance with the requirements of\nNI 54-101, the Corporation is sending the Meeting Materials directly to NOBOs and indirectly, through intermediaries,\nto OBOs. The Corporation will pay the fees and expenses of intermediaries for their services in delivering Meeting\nMaterials to OBOs in accordance with NI 54-101.\nThe Corporation has used a NOBO list to send the Meeting Materials directly to those NOBOs whose names appear\non that list. If the Corporation has sent these materials directly to a NOBO, such NOBO’s name and address and\ninformation about its holdings of Common Shares have been obtained from the intermediary holding such shares on\nthe NOBO’s behalf in accordance with applicable securities regulatory requirements. As a result, any NOBO of the\nCorporation can expect to receive a voting instruction form from the Transfer Agent. NOBOs should complete and\nreturn the voting instruction form to the Transfer Agent in the envelope provided. The Transfer Agent will tabulate\nthe results of voting instruction forms received from NOBOs and will provide appropriate instructions at the Meeting\nwith respect to the shares represented by such voting instruction forms.\nApplicable securities regulatory policy requires intermediaries, on receipt of Meeting Materials that seek voting\ninstructions from Beneficial Shareholders indirectly, to seek voting instructions from Beneficial Shareholders in\nadvance of shareholders’ meetings on Form 54-101F7 – Request for Voting Instructions Made by Intermediary\n(“Form 54-101F7”). Every intermediary has its own mailing procedures and provides its own return instructions,\nwhich should be carefully followed by Beneficial Shareholders in order to ensure that their Common Shares are voted\nat the Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. Often, the form of proxy supplied to a Beneficial\nShareholder by its broker is identical to the form of proxy provided to registered Shareholders; however, its purpose\nis limited to instructing the registered Shareholder how to vote on behalf of the Beneficial Shareholder. Beneficial\nShareholders who wish to appear in person and vote at the Meeting should be appointed as their own representatives\nat the Meeting in accordance with the directions of their intermediaries and Form 54-101F7. Beneficial Shareholders\ncan also write the name of someone else whom they wish to attend at the Meeting and vote on their behalf. Unless\nprohibited by law, the person whose name is written in the space provided in Form 54-101F7 will have full authority\nto present matters to the Meeting and vote on all matters that are presented at the Meeting, even if those matters are\nnot set out in Form 54-101F7 or this Circular.\nThe majority of brokers now delegate responsibility for obtaining instructions from clients to Broadridge Financial\nSolutions, Inc. (“Broadridge”). Broadridge typically mails a voting instruction form in lieu of the form of proxy.\nBeneficial Shareholders are requested to complete and return the voting instruction form to Broadridge by mail or\nfacsimile. Broadridge will then provide aggregate voting instructions to the Transfer Agent, which tabulates the results\nand provides appropriate instructions respecting the voting of shares to be represented at the Meeting or any\nadjournment or postponement thereof. By choosing to send the Meeting Materials to NOBOs directly, the Corporation\n(and not the intermediary holding Common Shares on your behalf) has assumed responsibility for (i) delivering these\n3\nmaterials to you; and (ii) executing your proper voting instructions.

(“Spartan”) from September 2020 to July 2021. On April 5,\n2021, Spartan filed a Notice of Intention to File a Proposal (the “NOI”) under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act with\nthe Office of the Superintendent in Bankruptcy. On June 21, 2021, the NOI proceeding was continued under the\nCompanies’ Creditors Arrangement Act. On December 1, 2021, Spartan entered bankruptcy.\nNo proposed director has, within the 10 years prior to the date hereof, become bankrupt, made a proposal under any\nlegislation relating to bankruptcy or insolvency, or become subject to or instituted any proceedings, arrangement or\ncompromise with creditors or had a receiver, receiver manager or trustee appointed to hold the assets of that person.\nNo proposed director has been subject to any penalties or sanctions imposed by a court relating to securities legislation\nor by any securities regulatory authority or has entered into a settlement agreement with a securities regulatory\nauthority or has been subject to any other penalties or sanctions imposed by a court or regulatory body that would be\nlikely to be considered important to a reasonable securityholder in deciding whether to vote for the proposed director.\nApproval of Unallocated RSUs & DSUs and Approval of Revisions to Amendment Provision\nGeneral\nSection 613(a) of the TSX Company Manual provides that every three years after the institution of a security based\ncompensation arrangement, all unallocated rights, options or other entitlements under such arrangement which does\nnot have a fixed maximum number of securities issuable thereunder, must be approved by a majority of the issuer’s\ndirectors and by the issuer’s security holders. As the Corporation’s long-term incentive plan (the “LTIP”) is\n8\nconsidered to be a security-based compensation arrangement and as the combined maximum number of Common\nShares issuable pursuant to the LTIP and the Share Option Plan is not a fixed number, but is instead equal to 13% of\nthe outstanding Common Shares, approval is being sought at the Meeting to approve the grant of unallocated deferred\nshare units (“DSUs”) and restricted share units (“RSUs” and collectively with DSUs, “Units”) under the LTIP. Units\nare considered to be “allocated” under the LTIP when issued and Units which remain available for grant under the\nLTIP are referred to as “unallocated”.\nOther than the approval of the unallocated Units under the LTIP and the revisions to the amendment provision intended\nto more closely track the TSX amendment provision requirements and governance best practices, none of the\namendments made to the LTIP require Shareholder approval. The amendments made to the LTIP that do not require\nShareholder approval include decreasing the maximum number of Common Shares issuable pursuant to the LTIP\nfrom 13% of the outstanding Common Shares to 4.9% of the outstanding Common Shares, provided that, the\nmaximum number of Common Shares which may be reserved for issuance pursuant to all of the Company’s security-\nbased compensation arrangements shall not in the aggregate exceed 13% of the issued and outstanding Common\nShares, including new non-employee director participation limits, including a new default vesting schedule for DSUs,\npermitting the holder of vested DSUs to elect settlement timing (subject to certain restrictions), providing the\nCorporation with the ability to elect whether vested DSUs are settled in Common Shares or cash, including a clawback\nprovision, and other amendments of an administrative or “housekeeping” nature. These amendments do not require\nShareholder approval because of the LTIP’s amendment provision that allows these amendments to be made without\nShareholder approval.\nAs at the date of this Circular (assuming a revised share reserve of 4.9% of the outstanding Common Shares), there\nwere 60,000 DSUs and 443,861 RSUs issued and outstanding, representing in the aggregate approximately 2.4% of\nthe outstanding Common Shares and accordingly, 312,139 Units remain unallocated and available for grant under the\nLTIP, representing approximately 1.5% of the outstanding Common Shares. The terms of the LTIP are fully described\nin this Circular under the heading “Statement of Executive Compensation – Description of the Corporation’s LTIP”.\nAt the Meeting, Shareholders will be asked to vote on a resolution to renew the LTIP, by approving the unallocated\nUnits under the LTIP, as well as to approve revisions to the LTIP’s amendment provision intended to more closely\ntrack the TSX amendment provision requirements and governance best practices (as further described in this Circular\nunder the heading “Statement of Executive Compensation – Description of the Corporation’s LTIP”).\nShareholder Approval\nIn accordance with the rules of the TSX, all unallocated RSUs and DSUs under the LTIP and the revisions to the LTIP\namendment provision must be approved by an ordinary resolution of the Shareholders. At the Meeting, Shareholders\nwill be asked to pass the following ordinary resolution approving the unallocated RSUs and DSUs issuable pursuant\nto the LTIP and the revised amendment provision:\n“BE IT RESOLVED THAT:\n1. all unallocated restricted share units (“RSUs”) and deferred share units (“DSUs”) under the long-term\nincentive plan of the Corporation are hereby approved;\n2. the Corporation shall have the ability to continue granting RSUs and DSUs under the long-term incentive\nplan of the Corporation until May 17, 2026, being the date that is three years from the date hereof;\n3. the revisions to the amendment provision of the long-term incentive plan of the Corporation be and are\nhereby approved and authorized; and\n4. any one director or officer of the Corporation is hereby authorized and directed for and in the name of and\non behalf of the Corporation to execute or cause to be executed and to deliver or cause to be delivered all\nsuch documents, and to do or cause to be done all such acts and things, as in the opinion of such director or\nofficer may be necessary or desirable in order to carry out the terms of this resolution, such determination to\nbe conclusively evidenced by the execution and delivery of such documents or the doing of any such act or\nthing.”\n9\nIf the unallocated Units under the LTIP are not approved by Shareholders at the Meeting, the Corporation will not be\npermitted to grant Units under the LTIP after May 20, 2023 until Shareholder approval for such Units is obtained.\nHowever, all allocated Units under the LTIP will continue unaffected.\nRecommendation of the Board\nThe Board unanimously recommends that Shareholders vote FOR the foregoing resolution.\nThe persons designated as proxyholders in the accompanying form of proxy (absent contrary directions) intend\nto vote FOR the foregoing resolution.\nAppointment of Auditor\nAt the Meeting, the Shareholders are required to appoint the auditors of the Corporation. Shareholders will be asked\nto vote on the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and to authorize the Board to fix their remuneration.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP was first appointed as the auditors of the Corporation on June 22, 2015.\nThe persons designated as proxyholders in the accompanying form of proxy (absent contrary directions) intend\nto vote FOR the appointment of the auditors as set forth above.\nSTATEMENT OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis\nObjectives\nProfound has relied on the experience of the Board and the Human Resources and Corporate Governance Committee\nin setting executive compensation. In considering compensation awards, the Human Resources and Corporate\nGovernance Committee has considered the skill level of its executives as well as comparable levels of compensation\nfor individuals with similar capabilities and experience. In regard to Profound’s current executive compensation\narrangements, the Human Resources and Corporate Governance Committee has considered such factors as Profound’s\ncurrent financial situation, the estimated financial situation of Profound in the mid-term and the need to attract and\nretain the key executives necessary for Profound’s long-term success. The Human Resources and Corporate\nGovernance Committee has determined that at this stage of Profound it is appropriate that compensation be in the\nform of base salary, Options, a potential bonus award and certain benefits plans.\nProfound has established a Human Resources and Corporate Governance Committee, comprised of three independent\ndirectors, currently, Arthur Rosenthal (Chair), Brian Ellacott and Kenneth Galbraith. Mr. Kenneth Galbraith is not\nstanding for re-election to the Board. The Human Resources and Corporate Governance Committee oversees the\nCorporation’s remuneration policies and practices. The principal responsibilities of the Human Resources and\nCorporate Governance Committee include:\n(a) with respect to human resources: (i) assist the Board in ensuring that the necessary policies and processes are\nin place by which all employees of the Corporation, with special attention to the executive group, will be\nfairly and competitively compensated; and (ii) produce a report on executive compensation for inclusion in\nthe Corporation’s proxy statement as required by applicable rules and regulations; and\n(b) with respect to corporate governance: (i) identify individuals qualified to become Board members, and\nrecommend that the Board select the director nominees for the next annual meeting of shareholders; and (ii)\ndevelop and recommend to the Board the corporate governance guidelines and processes applicable to the\nCorporation, review these guidelines and processes at least annually and recommend changes to the Board.\nA copy of the Human Resources and Corporate Governance Committee’s charter is available on Profound’s website\nat https://profoundmedical.com/investors/#governance.\n10\nCompensation Philosophy and Objectives of Compensation Programs\nThe executive compensation program adopted by Profound and applied to its executive officers is designed to:\n(a) attract and retain qualified and experienced executives who have international business and operations\nexperience and will contribute to the success of Profound;\n(b) ensure that the compensation of the executive officers provides a competitive base compensation package,\nwith additional compensation to reward success and create a strong link between corporate performance and\ncompensation; and\n(c) motivate executive officers to enhance long term shareholder value, with current compensation being\nweighted toward at-risk long-term incentives in the form of Options and RSUs so as to foster alignment with\nthe interests of the Shareholders.\nThe goals of the compensation program are to attract and retain the most qualified people with relevant experience, to\nmotivate and reward such individuals on a short term and long-term basis, and to create alignment between corporate\nperformance and compensation. The Human Resources and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board intend\nthat the total cash components of compensation (base salary plus annual cash bonus) target the median of a benchmark\ngroup in comparable industries with similar market capitalization (the “Compensation Peer Group”).\nAggregate compensation (including annual cash bonus and equity-based compensation) payable to each NEO (as\ndefined below) is based on the achievement of certain performance goals. Performance goals are established annually\nand designed to align with the Corporation’s strategic objectives. As described in greater detail below, performance\ngoals affect equity-based compensation grants and annual cash bonuses.\nProfound does not believe that its compensation programs encourage excessive or inappropriate risk taking as: (i)\nemployees receive both fixed and variable compensation, and the fixed (salary) portion provides a steady income\nregardless of Common Share value which allows employees to focus on the business; (ii) the Share Option Plan\nencourages a long term perspective due to the vesting provisions of the options (see “Share Option Plan” below); and\n(iii) annual bonus is earned only if short-term Company objectives are achieved. Profound believes that the\ncompensation program is appropriately structured and balanced to motivate its executives and reward the achievement\nof annual performance goals, as well as the achievement of long term growth in shareholder value. NEOs and directors\nare not permitted to purchase financial instruments, including, for greater certainty, prepaid variable forward contracts,\nequity swaps, collars, or units of exchange funds, that are designed to hedge or offset a decrease in market value of\nequity securities granted as compensation or held, directly or indirectly, by the NEO or director.\nAligning Management and Shareholders\nThe Corporation’s compensation program seeks to align management interests with Shareholder interests through\nboth short-term and long-term incentives linking compensation to performance. The short-term incentive is an annual\ncash bonus which is linked to individual performance and the Corporation’s performance. Further, long-term\nincentives of Option grants comprise a significant portion of overall compensation for the Corporation’s NEOs (as\ndefined herein). The Human Resources and Corporate Governance Committee believes this is appropriate because it\ncreates a direct correlation between variations in the Corporation’s share price (which is based in part on the\nCorporation’s financial performance) and the compensation of its NEOs, thereby aligning the interests of the\nCorporation’s executives and Shareholders.\nClawback Policy\nThe Corporation has adopted a clawback policy which applies to cash bonus awards made, and RSUs granted, to the\nNEOs and any other individuals as determined by the Board from time to time. Under the clawback policy, a clawback\nmay be triggered if an NEO is indicted for or convicted of an act involving gross negligence, fraud, theft, dishonesty\nor willful misconduct. Among other remedial actions, the enforcement of the clawback policy may involve forfeiture\nor cancellation of unpaid cash bonus awards or unvested RSUs and recoupment of the value of such awards. The\n11\nHuman Resources and Corporate Governance Committee will continue to keep this policy under review as part of its\nregular risk review.\nCompensation Peer Group\nIn reviewing and approving the Corporation’s 2022 compensation program, the Human Resources and Corporate\nGovernance Committee considered the recommendations of the CEO, which were based upon public disclosure\ninformation available for the Compensation Peer Group. The Human Resources and Corporate Governance\nCommittee retained the services of Radford, a business unit of Aon Hewitt, as its external independent compensation\nadvisor to review the Corporation’s executive compensation program. In 2022, Radford assembled a benchmark peer\ngroup report to serve as a comparator for compensation purposes. The selection criteria for the comparator companies\nwere based on revenue, market capitalization, business focus and headcount. Radford was paid executive\ncompensation related fees of $13,800 in 2022 and $2,000 in 2021 and no other fees in their respective years. Radford\nwas originally retained in 2017.\nWith the assistance of Radford’s benchmark peer group report, the following 2022 Compensation Peer Group was\nestablished. There were no changes to the Compensation Peer Group from that in 2021.\nCompensation Peer Group\nAnika Therapeutics Inc. Apollo Endosurgery, Inc.\nAvedro, Inc.

Transmedics, Inc.\nViewray Inc. Viveve Medical Inc.\nBase Salary\nBase salary is intended to reflect an executive officer’s position within the corporate structure, his or her years of\nexperience and level of responsibility, and salary norms in the sector and the general marketplace. As such, decisions\nwith respect to base salary levels for executive officers are not based on objective identifiable performance measures\nbut for the most part are determined by reference to competitive market information for similar roles and levels of\nresponsibility, as well as more subjective performance factors such as leadership, commitment, accountability,\nindustry experience and contribution. The Corporation’s view is that a competitive base salary is a necessary element\nfor retaining qualified executive officers, as it creates a meaningful incentive for individuals to remain at Profound\nand not be unreasonably susceptible to recruiting efforts by the Corporation’s competitors.\nIn determining the base salary of the Named Executive Officers (as defined herein), the Board considered: (i)\nrecruiting and retaining executives critical to the success of Profound and the enhancement of shareholder value; (ii)\nproviding fair and competitive compensation; (iii) balancing the interests of management and Shareholders; and (iv)\nrewarding performance, both on an individual basis and with respect to operations in general.\nLong-term Incentives\nLong-term incentives, in the form of Options, are intended to align the interests of Profound’s directors and its\nexecutive officers with those of the Shareholders, to provide a long-term incentive that rewards these individuals for\ntheir contribution to the creation of shareholder value and to reduce the cash compensation Profound would otherwise\nhave to pay. The Share Option Plan is administered by the Board. In establishing the number of Options to be granted\nto any particular executive officer, reference was made to the number of Options granted to officers of other companies\ninvolved in similar businesses. The Board also considers previous grants of Options and the overall number of Options\nthat are outstanding relative to the number of outstanding Common Shares in determining whether to make any new\ngrants of Options and the size and terms of any such grants, as well as the performance of the executive officer as\ndemonstrated through his or her level of effort, time, responsibility, ability, experience, level of commitment and\nperformance goals in determining the level of incentive stock option compensation.\n12\nBonus Awards\nThe Board will consider whether it is appropriate and in the best interests of the Corporation to award a discretionary\ncash bonus to executive officers for the most recently completed financial year and if so, in what amount. A cash\nbonus may be awarded to reward performance that has led to increased value for Shareholders through property\nacquisitions or divestitures, the formation of new strategic or joint venture relationships and/or capital raising efforts.\nQuantitative performance objectives include the achievement of the Corporation’s revenue target, departmental and\nindividual goals, which may be quantitative or qualitative in nature. These have been established for each individual\nexecutive officer by the Board with alignment of such corporate/individual goals with the CEO and include objectives\nsuch as research and product development, company productivity, revenue growth and long-term strategic guidance\nof the Corporation. These corporate, departmental and individual goals form the basis for the review of the executive\nofficers and the determination of cash bonuses at the end of each year with the Board. These awards are reviewed\nyearly to ensure that corporate performance metrics and individual goals are consistent from year to year.\nBonus award payments are based on the following assessment of:\n(a) whether or not the executive officers have successfully met or exceeded the established corporate,\ndepartmental and individual performance metrics and goals;\n(b) the executive officers’ decisions and actions and whether or not they are aligned with the Corporation’s long-\nterm growth strategy and have created value for Shareholders;\n(c) whether any near-term goals and objectives were not met because the executive officers made decisions in\nthe best long-term interests of the Corporation or due to factors outside of the executive officers’ control;\nand/or\n(d) additional initiatives undertaken by the executive officers, which were not contemplated in the initial\nobjectives.\nThe following targets, as a percentage of base salary, were approved for each NEO for the fiscal year ending\nDecember 31, 2022:\nPosition Target\nCEO 65%\nOther NEOs 20 - 50%\nBenefits Plans\nThe Named Executive Officers are entitled to life insurance, health and dental benefits.\nPerformance Graph\nThe following graph illustrates the cumulative return to Shareholders of a $100 investment in Common Shares from\nDecember 31, 2017 to December 31, 2022, as compared to the cumulative total return on the Standard & Poor’s/TSX\nIndex and Standard & Poor’s/Nasdaq Composite Index for the same period, assuming the reinvestment of cash\ndistributions and/or dividends.\nDecember December December December December December\n31, 2017 31, 2018 31, 2019 31, 2020 31, 2021 31, 2022\n$ $ $ $ $ $\nProfound Medical 100.00 65.48 175.60 311.79 169.76 172.38\nS&P/TSX Composite Index 100.00 88.36 105.27 107.55 130.93 119.59\nNasdaq Composite Index 100.00 96.12 129.98 186.70 226.64 151.62\n13\n350.00\n300.00\n250.00\n200.00\n150.00\n100.00\n50.00\n‐\n31‐Dec‐18 31‐Dec‐19 31‐Dec‐20 31‐Dec‐21 31‐Dec‐22\nS&P/TSX Composite Index NASDAQ Profound Medical Corporation\nThe trend shown in the above graph does not necessarily correspond to the Corporation’s trend of compensation for\nthe NEOs (as defined herein) for the period disclosed above.

The Share Option Plan was\noriginally adopted by the Board on June 4, 2015, and then amended and restated on December 8, 2016 and again on\nJuly 13, 2018.\nThe amendments made on July 13, 2018 were as follows: (i) inclusion of the Insider Participation Limits (as defined\nherein); (ii) removal of TSX Venture Exchange (“TSXV”) required participation limits since the Corporation was no\nlonger listed on the TSXV; (iii) clarification to the share reserve since the Corporation was listed on the TSX and\npursuant to the Share Option Plan, the reserve changed from a fixed number to a fixed percentage as described below;\n(iv) inclusion of an additional amendment to the list of amendments that require Shareholder approval (being removing\nor exceeding the Insider Participation Limits); and (v) other amendments of a housekeeping nature.\nThe Share Option Plan provides that the Board may from time to time, in its discretion, grant to directors, officers,\nemployees, consultants and any other person or entity engaged to provide ongoing services to the Corporation non-\ntransferable Options, provided that the maximum number of Common Shares reserved for issuance under the Share\nOption Plan is equal to 13% of the issued and outstanding shares in the capital of the Corporation at the time of any\nOption grant. If any Option is exercised, cancelled, expired, surrendered or otherwise terminated for any reason, the\nnumber of Common Shares in respect of which the Option is exercised, cancelled, expired, surrendered or otherwise\nterminated, as the case may be, will again be available for purchase pursuant to Options granted under the plan. As at\nDecember 31, 2022, 1,511,773 Options have been granted under the Share Option Plan, which represents 7.2% of the\nissued and outstanding Common Shares of the Corporation as at December 31, 2022. As at December 31, 2022,\n1,202,562 Options are available for grant under the Share Option Plan, which represents 5.8% of the issued and\noutstanding shares in the capital of the Corporation as at December 31, 2022.\nThe aggregate number of Common Shares that may be (i) issued to insiders of the Corporation within any one-year\nperiod, or (ii) issuable to insiders of the Corporation at any time, in each case, under the Share Option Plan alone or\nwhen combined with all other security-based compensation arrangements of the Corporation, cannot exceed 10% of\nthe outstanding Common Shares (the “Insider Participation Limits”).\nThe Board shall determine the exercise price of the Options, provided that, it cannot be less than the Market Price of\nthe Common Shares on the date of grant. For the purposes of the Share Option Plan, “Market Price” means the\nvolume-weighted average price of the Common Shares on the stock exchange where the majority of trading volume\nand value of the Common Shares occurs, for the five trading days immediately preceding the relevant date on which\nthe Market Price is to be determined.\nThe expiry date for an Option shall not be later than the 10th anniversary of the date an Option is granted, subject to\nthe expiry date falling with a corporate blackout period or within 5 business days following the expiry of such a\nblackout period, in which case the expiry date will be extended to the 10th business day following the expiry of the\nblackout period.\nUnless otherwise specified by the Board, each Option generally vests and becomes exercisable as to 1/4 on the first\nanniversary of the date of grant and as to 1/36 on the first day of each calendar month thereafter. The Board has the\ndiscretion to permit accelerated vesting of Options.\nThe Corporation does not provide any financial assistance to optionees to facilitate the purchase of Common Shares\nissued pursuant to the exercise of Options under the Share Option Plan. Options granted under the Share Option Plan\nare not transferable or assignable (except to an optionee’s estate) and no Options may be exercised by anyone other\nthan the optionee or his or her legal representative during the lifetime of the optionee.\nThe Share Option Plan contains the following provisions regarding the exercise and cancellation of Options following\na change in the employment status of an optionee. In the event of:\n(a) an optionee’s retirement, the optionee will continue to participate in the plan and each Option that has vested\nor that vests within 12 months following the retirement date continues to be exercisable until the earlier of\n21\nthe Option’s expiry date and the date that is 12 months from the retirement date, and any Options that have\nnot been exercised by such time will immediately expire and be cancelled;\n(b) an optionee’s death or disability, each vested Option is exercisable until the earlier of the Option’s expiry\ndate and 6 months following the date of death or disability, as applicable, and any Options that have not been\nexercised by such time will immediately expire and be cancelled;\n(c) a termination without cause for an employee optionee, or the termination by the Corporation or an affiliate\nof a consulting agreement or arrangement (other than for breach) or the death or disability of a consultant,\neach vested Option is exercisable until the earlier of the Option’s expiry date and 90 days following the date\nof termination, death or disability, as applicable, and any Options that have not been exercised by such time\nwill immediately expire and be cancelled;\n(d) a termination for cause or resignation of an employee optionee, or the termination by the Corporation or an\naffiliate of a consulting agreement or arrangement (for breach) or the voluntary termination by the consultant,\nall Options (whether vested or unvested) terminate on the date of termination or resignation, as applicable;\nand\n(e) a director (who is not an employee or consultant) ceases to hold office, each vested Option is exercisable\nuntil the earlier of the Option’s expiry date and 60 days following the cessation date, and any Options that\nhave not been exercised by such time will immediately expire and be cancelled.\nThe Board may from time to time, without notice and without Shareholder approval, amend, modify, change, suspend\nor terminate the Share Option Plan or any Options granted thereunder as it, in its discretion determines appropriate,\nprovided, however, that no such amendment, modification, change, suspension or termination of the Share Option\nPlan or any Option granted thereunder may materially impair any rights of an optionee or materially increase any\nobligations of an optionee under the plan without the consent of the optionee, unless the Board determines such\nadjustment is required or desirable in order to comply with any applicable securities laws or stock exchange\nrequirements. Amendments that can be made by the Board without Shareholder approval include, but are not limited\nto, housekeeping amendments, amendments to comply with applicable law or stock exchange rules, amendments\nnecessary for Options to qualify for favorable treatment under applicable tax laws, amendments to the vesting\nprovisions of the Share Option Plan or any Option, amendments to include or modify a cashless exercise feature,\namendments to the termination or early termination provisions of the Share Option Plan or any Option, and\namendments necessary to suspend or terminate the Share Option Plan. Shareholder approval is required for the\nfollowing amendments to be made to the Share Option Plan:\n(a) increase to the number of Common Shares reserved for issuance under the Share Option Plan, except pursuant\nto the provisions in the plan that permit the Board to make equitable adjustments in the event of transactions\naffecting the Corporation or its capital;\n(b) reduce the exercise price of an Option, except pursuant to the provisions in the plan that permit the Board to\nmake equitable adjustments in the event of transactions affecting the Corporation or its capital;\n(c) extend the term of an Option beyond the original expiry date, except where an expiry date would have fallen\nwithin a blackout period or within 5 business days following the expiry of such a blackout period;\n(d) permit an Option to be exercisable beyond 10 years from its date of grant, except where an expiry date would\nhave fallen within a blackout period;\n(e) permit Options to be transferred other than for normal estate settlement purposes;\n(f) remove or exceeds the Insider Participation Limits;\n(g) permit awards, other than the Options, to be granted under the Share Option Plan; or\n(h) delete or reduce the range of amendments which require Shareholder approval.\n22\nAs required by section 613 of the TSX Company Manual, the Corporation’s annual burn rate, which represents the\nnumber of Options granted under the Share Option Plan divided by the weighted average number of Common Shares\noutstanding as at the end of a fiscal year, was 8.8% in 2020, 10.2% in 2021 and 7.3% in 2022.\nDescription of the Corporation’s LTIP\nOn May 20, 2020, the Shareholders approved the adoption of the LTIP. The LTIP is an incentive-based equity\ncompensation plan that provides for the grant of RSUs and DSUs. This description of the LTIP is qualified in its\nentirety by reference to the text of the LTIP, a full copy of which is attached as Schedule “B” hereto.\nThe RSUs may be granted to any director, officer, employee or consultant of the Corporation or any of its affiliates\nand any such person’s personal holding company, as designated by the Board in a resolution (the “RSU Participants”)\nupon the terms and conditions set forth in a grant agreement. The DSUs may be granted to any director of the\nCorporation who has been designated by the Corporation for participation in the LTIP and who has agreed to\nparticipate in the LTIP (the “DSU Participants”, together with the RSU Participants, the “Participants”), upon the\nterms and conditions set forth in a grant agreement. Subject to Board approval, once each fiscal year, a DSU Participant\nmay elect to be paid up to 100% of this or her annual board retainer in the form of DSUs, with the remaining balance\n(if any) being paid in cash.\nThe LTIP was amended and restated by the Board on April 3, 2023, subject to Shareholder approval with respect to\nthe revisions to the LTIP’s amendment provision intended to more closely track the TSX amendment provision\nrequirements and governance best practices (as further described below). Other than the revisions to the amendment\nprovision, none of the amendments made to the LTIP require Shareholder approval. The amendments made to the\nLTIP that do not require Shareholder approval include decreasing the maximum number of Common Shares issuable\npursuant to the LTIP from 13% of the outstanding Common Shares to 4.9% of the outstanding Common Shares,\nprovided that, the maximum number of Common Shares which may be reserved for issuance pursuant to all of the\nCompany’s security-based compensation arrangements shall not in the aggregate exceed 13% of the issued and\noutstanding Common Shares including new non-employee director participation limits, including a new default\nvesting schedule for DSUs, permitting DSU Participants holding vested DSUs to elect settlement timing (subject to\ncertain restrictions), providing the Corporation with the ability to elect whether vested DSUs are settled in Common\nShares or cash, including a clawback provision, and other amendments of an administrative or “housekeeping” nature.\nThese amendments do not require Shareholder approval because of the LTIP’s amendment provision that allows these\namendments to be made without Shareholder approval.\nThe LTIP is intended to advance the interests of the Corporation by: (i) providing Participants with additional\nincentives; (ii) rewarding the performance of the Participants through the issuance of the Units; (iii) increasing the\nproprietary interest of the Participants in the success of the Corporation; (iv) encouraging the Participants to remain\nwith the Corporation or its affiliates; and (v) attracting new directors, employees, officers and consultants to the\nCorporation or its affiliates.\nThe LTIP will be administered by the Board and the Human Resources and Corporate Governance Committee. The\nBoard is responsible for, among other things, granting the RSUs to the RSU Participants, granting the DSUs to the\nDSU Participants, determining the terms of such grants, and interpreting the LTIP and all agreements entered into\nthereunder. Pursuant to the LTIP, the number of RSUs (including fractional RSUs) granted at any particular time will\nbe calculated by dividing (i) the dollar amount of such grant by (ii) the market value of a Common Share on the\napplicable grant date, which is equal to the volume weighted average trading price of all Common Shares traded on\nthe TSX (or other exchange where the Common Shares are listed) for the five (5) trading days immediately preceding\nsuch date (the “Market Value”). The number of DSUs (including fractional DSUs) granted at any particular time will\nbe calculated by dividing (i) the dollar amount of such grant by (ii) the Market Value of a Common Share on the\napplicable grant date.\nThe RSUs will vest 1/3 on each of the first, second and third anniversary dates of the original grant, provided that the\nRSU Participant is continuously employed by or in service with the Corporation, or any of its affiliates, until the\nrespective vesting date. The Board would have the option to add any performance-based vesting criteria at its\ndiscretion. After the RSUs have vested, a Canadian RSU Participant may deliver a settlement notice to the Corporation\nin respect of any or all vested RSUs it desires to settle. U.S. RSU Participants must settle any vested RSUs within 70\ndays after such RSUs vested unless otherwise specified in the grant agreement. The Corporation may elect to settle\n23\nthe vested RSUs in cash, in Common Shares issued from treasury, or a combination thereof. Since the form of\nsettlement (i.e. cash and/or Common Shares) is at the option of the Corporation, all RSUs must settle no later than\nDecember 31 in the third calendar year following the year in which the services giving rise to the RSUs were rendered.\nDSUs granted prior to April 3, 2023 and any DSUs that a director elects to receive in lieu of annual cash board retainers\nwill vest on the DSU termination date, which is the date on which the DSU Participant ceases to be a director and, if\napplicable, an employee of the Corporation for any reason. DSUs granted on or after April 3, 2023 will vest 1/3 on\neach of the first, second and third anniversary dates of the original grant, provided that the DSU Participant is\ncontinuously in service with the Corporation, or any of its affiliates, until the respective vesting date.\nAfter the DSUs have vested and following a DSU Participant ceasing to hold all positions with the Corporation, a\nParticipant may elect when to settle the Participant’s vested DSUs (subject to certain restrictions) and the Corporation\nwill elect to settle such DSUs in such DSU Participant’s notional account for cash, Common Shares issued from\ntreasury, or a combination thereof. U.S. DSU Participant’s shall settle any vested DSUs within 70 days on the date\nfrom such DSU Participant incurs a “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A of U.S. Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986.\nThe maximum number of Common Shares which may be reserved for issuance under the LTIP cannot exceed 4.9%\nof the issued and outstanding Common Shares from time to time on a non-diluted basis (representing an aggregate of\n1,025,003 Common Shares as at December 31, 2022), provided that the Board may make appropriate adjustments in\nthe Common Shares issuable or amounts payable to preclude a dilution or enlargement of the benefits under the LTIP\nas a result of a consolidation, share split or similar change in the capital structure of the Corporation, subject to any\nrequired approval by any stock exchange or regulatory authority. As at December 31, 2022 (assuming a revised share\nreserve of 4.9% of the outstanding Common Shares), an aggregate of 503,861 Units, representing approximately 2.4%\nof the issued and outstanding Common Shares, are outstanding under the LTIP. As at December 31, 2022 (assuming\na revised share reserve of 4.9% of the outstanding Common Shares), an aggregate of 312,139 Units, representing\napproximately 1.5% of the issued and outstanding Common Shares, are available for grant under the LTIP.\nCertain other restrictions on grants apply, including that: (i) the number of Common Shares issuable to insiders (as a\ngroup), at any time, under the LTIP and any other security-based compensation arrangements, including the Share\nOption Plan, shall not exceed 10% of the Corporation’s issued and outstanding Common Shares; (ii) the number of\nCommon Shares issued to insiders (as a group), within a one-year period, under the LTIP and any other security-based\ncompensation arrangements cannot exceed 10% of the Corporation’s issued and outstanding Common Shares; and\n(iii) the Corporation is prohibited from granting to any individual non-employee director of the Corporation more than\n$150,000 worth of awards under any security-based compensation arrangement of the Corporation (with no more than\n$100,000 attributable to stock options) annually based on the grant date fair value of the Units, other than in respect\nof awards granted to non-employee directors in lieu of cash fees on a value for value basis.\nUnder the LTIP, the Corporation will not provide financial assistance to Participants in connection with the settlement\nof Units by Participants. Except as the Board may otherwise determine, if a RSU Participant ceases to be a RSU\nParticipant for any reason, including, without limitation, as a result of his or her resignation, voluntary or involuntary\ntermination (including with or without cause), retirement, disability, or death, any unvested RSUs held by such RSU\nParticipant shall expire. Each DSU Participant is entitled to terminate his or her participation in the LTIP by filing a\ntermination notice with the designated officer of the Corporation. Thereafter, any portion of such DSU Participant’s\nannual board retainer payable and all subsequent annual board retainers shall be paid in cash.\nIn no event may the rights or interests of a Participant under the LTIP be assigned, encumbered, pledged, transferred\nor alienated in any way, except to the extent that certain rights may pass to a beneficiary or legal representative upon\ndeath of a Participant, by will or by the laws of succession and distribution.\nAny Unit which is subject to recovery, cancellation, forfeiture, revocation or recoupment under applicable laws, stock\nexchange listing requirements or policies adopted by the Corporation, including the Corporation’s clawback policy,\nwill be subject to such deductions, cancellations, forfeitures, revocations, recoupments and clawbacks as may be\nrequired pursuant to such laws, stock exchange listing requirements or policies.\nIn the event of a change of control, merger, amalgamation, arrangement, business combination or other transaction\npursuant to which the Common Shares of the Corporation are converted into, or exchanged for, other property, whether\n24\nin the form of securities of another entity, cash or otherwise, any surviving or acquiring company must, (i) assume\nany Unit outstanding under the LTIP on substantially the same economic terms and conditions as the LTIP; or (ii)\nsubstitute or replace restricted share units and deferred share units, as applicable for those RSUs and DSUs outstanding\nunder the LTIP on substantially the same economic terms and conditions. In the event any surviving or acquiring\ncompany neglects or refuses (as determined by the Board, acting reasonably) to assume any Units or to substitute or\nreplace similar restricted share units and deferred share units, as applicable, for those outstanding RSUs and DSUs in\nconnection with a such an event, then with respect to any Units held by Participants, the vesting of such Units will\nautomatically accelerate and be fully vested. Additionally, the Board may, in its discretion: (a) terminate, conditionally\nor otherwise and on such terms as it sees fit, the RSUs not settled following successful completion of such event; and\n(b) accelerate, conditionally or otherwise and on such terms as it sees fit, the vesting of Units or otherwise modify the\nterms of the Units to assist the Participants to obtain the advantage of holding Common Shares during the event.\nIn the event of a potential change of control following a take-over bid, the Board may, in its discretion, conditionally\nor otherwise and on such terms as it sees fit, accelerate the vesting of all of a Participant’s unvested Units to a date\nprior to the expiry date of such take-over bid or offer, such that all of a Participant’s Units will immediately vest at\nsuch time. In such event, all RSUs so vested may be settled conditionally or otherwise, from such date until their\nrespective expiry date so as to permit the Participant to tender the Common Shares received upon such settlement\npursuant to the take-over bid or offer.\nThe Board may make certain amendments to the LTIP or to any Unit outstanding thereunder without seeking\nshareholder approval, including, but not limited to, housekeeping amendments, amendments to comply with\napplicable law or stock exchange rules, amendments necessary for Units to qualify for favorable treatment under\napplicable tax laws, amendments to the vesting provisions of the LTIP or any Unit, amendments to the termination or\nearly termination provisions of the LTIP or any Unit, and amendments necessary to suspend or terminate the LTIP.\nOnly the following types of amendments will not be able to be made without obtaining shareholder approval:\n increasing the number of Common Shares reserved for issuance under the LTIP (other than as a result of a\nshare split or similar change in the capital structure of the Corporation);\n permitting awards to be transferred or assigned other than for normal estate settlement purposes;\n permitting the introduction or reintroduction of non-employee directors as participants on a discretionary\nbasis or increasing limits previously imposed on non-employee director participation;\n removing or exceeding the participation limits on insiders;\n amendments which delete or reduce the range of amendments which require approval by the Shareholders;\nand\n amendments required to be approved by shareholders under applicable laws or the rules, regulations and\npolicies of any stock exchange on which the Common Shares are listed.\nAs required by section 613 of the TSX Company Manual, the Corporation’s annual burn rate, which represents the\nnumber of Units granted under the LTIP divided by the weighted average number of Common Shares outstanding as\nat the end of a fiscal year, was 0.0% in 2020, 1.1% in 2021 and 2.4% in 2022.\nSecurities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans\nThe following table sets forth the securities of the Corporation that are authorized for issuance under the Share Option\nPlan and the LTIP as at the end of the Corporation’s most recently completed financial year.\n25\nNumber of securities to be Weighted-average exercise Number of securities\nissued upon exercise of price of outstanding remaining available for\noutstanding options, options, warrants and future issuance under\nPlan Category warrants and rights rights equity compensation plans\nEquity compensation plans\n2,015,634 C$16.07 per Common Share 698,701\napproved by securityholders\nEquity compensation plans\nnot approved by Nil Nil Nil\nsecurityholders\nTotal 2,015,634 C$16.07 per Common Share 698,701\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nThe Board is committed to a high standard of corporate governance practices. The Board believes that this\ncommitment is not only in the best interests of the Shareholders but that it also promotes effective decision making at\nthe Board level. The Board is of the view that its approach to corporate governance is appropriate and continues to\nwork to align with the recommendations currently in effect and contained in National Policy 58-201 - Corporate\nGovernance Guidelines which are addressed below.\nBoard Mandate\nThe Board has responsibility for the stewardship of the Corporation. The Board has adopted a written mandate for the\nBoard (the “Mandate”) to confirm and enhance the Board’s ongoing duty and responsibility for stewardship of the\nCorporation, a copy of which is available on the Corporation’s website at www.profoundmedical.com. and attached\nhereto as Schedule “A”. The Board is ultimately responsible for supervising the management of the business and\naffairs of the Corporation and, in doing so, is required to act in the best interests of the Corporation. The Board\ngenerally discharges its responsibilities either directly or through the Audit Committee and the Human Resources and\nCorporate Governance Committee. Specific responsibilities of the Board set out in the Mandate include:\n(a) Appointing Management – including approval of the Chief Executive Officer, the compensation of the\nexecutive officers and the oversight of succession planning programs;\n(b) Board Organization – including responding to recommendations received from the Human Resources and\nCorporate Governance Committee, but the Board retains the responsibility for managing its own affairs;\n(c) Strategic Planning – including the review and approval of the Corporation’s business, financial and strategic\nplans on at least an annual basis;\n(d) Monitoring of Financial Performance and Other Financial Reporting Matters – including the review of the\nCorporation’s ongoing financial performance and results of operations and review and approval of the\nCorporation’s audited and interim consolidated financial statements and management’s discussion and\nanalysis of financial conditions and results of operations;\n(e) Risk Management – including the identification of the Corporation’s principal business risks and the\nimplementation of appropriate systems to effectively monitor and manage such risks;\n(f) Policies and Procedures – including the approval and monitoring of all policies and procedures including\nthose related to corporate governance, ethics and confidentiality;\n(g) Communication and Reporting – including the oversight of the timely and accurate disclosure of financial\nreports and other material corporate developments; and\n(h) Other Responsibilities – including those related to position descriptions, orientation and continuing\neducation, nomination of directors and Board evaluations and matters in respect of any disposition, material\ncommitment or venture, or significant expenditure in either monetary or business terms.\n26\nComposition of the Board\nDirector Independence\nBrian Ellacott, Cynthia Lavoie, Murielle Lortie, Arthur Rosenthal and Kris Shah are all “independent” as such term\nis defined by National Instrument 58-101 – Disclosure of Corporate Governance Practices. Arun Menawat is non-\nindependent as he is the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation. Each of the independent directors has no direct\nor indirect material relationship with the Corporation, including any business or other relationship, which could\nreasonably be expected to interfere with the director’s ability to act with a view to the best interests of the Corporation\nor which could reasonably be expected to interfere with the exercise of the director’s independent judgment. Mr.\nKenneth Galbraith is not standing for re-election to the Board.\nIf the Chairman is not independent, the independent directors may select one of their members to be appointed lead\ndirector of the Board (“Lead Director”) for such term as the independent directors may determine. The Lead Director\nis responsible for chairing regular meetings of the independent directors and seeking to ensure that the Board is able\nto carry out its role.\nDr. Arun Menawat acts as Chairman of the Board. Since Dr. Menawat is not independent, Brian Ellacott has been\nappointed Lead Director of the Board.\nThe table below shows the current Board and committee membership.\nCommittees\nHuman Resources and\nCorporate Governance\nYear Appointed Audit Committee\nIndependent Board Members\nBrian Ellacott 2018 - Member\nKenneth Galbraith(1) 2017 Member Member\nCynthia Lavoie 2021 Member -\nMurielle Lortie 2020 Chair -\nArthur Rosenthal 2018 - Chair\nKris Shah 2022 - -\nNot Independent – Management\nArun Menawat (Chairman) 2015 - -\nNote:\n(1) Mr. Kenneth Galbraith is not standing for re-election to the board and will be replaced on the Audit Committee by Dr. Arthur Rosenthal\nand will be replace on the Human Resource and Corporate Governance Committee by Kris Shah.\nMeetings of Independent Directors\nThe entire complement of independent directors on the Board and each of the committees meet regularly without\nmanagement present. The Chairman of the Board conducts these sessions at Board meetings and the Chair of each\ncommittee conducts them at committee meetings. During the last financial year ended December 31, 2022, there were\neight such meetings of the independent directors.\nChairman of the Board\nDr. Arun Menawat is the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation and as a result does not meet the Board’s\nindependence standards. The primary functions of the Chairman are to facilitate the operations and deliberations of\nthe Board and the satisfaction of the Board’s responsibilities under its Mandate. The Chairman’s key responsibilities\ninclude duties relating to providing overall leadership to the Board, chairing board and Shareholder meetings, acting\n27\nas a liaison between management, the members of the Board and the Chairs of the various committees of the Board,\nand communicating with Shareholders and regulators. The responsibilities of the Chairman are reviewed by the\nHuman Resources and Corporate Governance Committee and considered by the Board for approval each year.\nDirector Term Limits and Other Mechanics of Board Renewal\nThe Board has not established any term limits for directors, as the Board takes the view that term limits are an arbitrary\nmechanism for removing directors which can result in valuable, experienced directors being forced to leave the Board\nsolely because of length of service. The Board’s priorities continue to be ensuring the appropriate skill sets are present\namongst the Board to optimize the benefit to the Corporation. The Board conducts annual evaluations of the individual\ndirectors, the committees of the Board and the Chairman of the Board, which are overseen by the Human Resources\nand Corporate Governance Committee, to ensure these objectives are met. See “Board Assessments”.\nBoard Meetings\nThe Board holds a minimum of one regular quarterly meeting and a corporate strategy session each year, as well as\nadditional meetings as required. An in camera session of the directors is held at each regularly scheduled Board and\ncommittee meeting so that the independent members of the Board have an opportunity to meet without the presence\nof management members of the Board.\nMeeting Attendance\nBoard Meetings Attended in 2022 Committee Meetings Attended in 2022\nName No. % No. %\nArun Menawat 6 of 6 100% - -\nBrian Ellacott 6 of 6 100% 2 of 2(3) 100%\nKenneth Galbraith 6 of 6 100% 6 of 6(2)(3) 100%\nCynthia Lavoie 6 of 6 100% 4 of 4(2) 100%\nMurielle Lortie 6 of 6 100% 4 of 4(2) 100%\nArthur Rosenthal 6 of 6 100% 2 of 2(3) 100%\nKris Shah(1) 3 of 4 75% - -\nNotes:\n(1) Mr. Shah was appointed to the Board on May 18, 2022.\n(2) Audit Committee.\n(3) Human Resources and Corporate Governance Committee.\nOrientation and Continuing Education\nPursuant to the Mandate, it is the responsibility of the Board to provide an orientation program for new directors and\nongoing educational opportunities for all directors. New directors are expected to participate in an initial information\nsession on the Corporation in the presence of its senior executive officers to learn about, among other things, the\nbusiness of the Corporation, its financial situation and its strategic planning. All directors will receive a record of\npublic information about the Corporation, as well as other relevant corporate and business information including\ncorporate governance practices of the Corporation, the structure of the Board and its standing committees, its corporate\norganization, the charters of the Board and its standing committees, the Code (as defined herein) and other relevant\ncorporate policies.\nContinuing education opportunities are directed at enabling individual directors to maintain or enhance their skills and\nabilities as directors, as well as ensuring that their knowledge and understanding of the Corporation’s affairs remains\ncurrent. Directors are kept informed as to matters which may impact the Corporation’s operations through regular\nreports and presentations at Board and committee meetings.\n28\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics\nThe Corporation has adopted a written Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the “Code”) for directors, officers and\nemployees. The objective of the Code is to provide guidelines for maintaining the integrity, reputation, honesty,\nobjectivity and impartiality of the Corporation and its subsidiaries. The Code addresses compliance with laws,\nconflicts of interest, corporate opportunity, confidentiality, fair dealing with customers, suppliers, competitors, officers\nand employees, protection and proper use of company assets and accounting complaints. The Board has the ultimate\nresponsibility for the stewardship of the Code and is responsible for considering any request for waivers from the\nCode. Any waiver of the Code’s provisions is subject to the disclosure and other provisions of applicable securities\nlaws and the applicable rules of any and all securities exchanges on which the securities of the Corporation are listed\nand posted for trading. A copy of the Code is available on the Corporation’s website at www.profoundmedical.com.\nThe Board monitors compliance with the Code and reviews it on at least an annual basis to determine whether updates\nare appropriate. Where a director or officer has any interest in or a perceived conflict involving a contract or business\nrelationship with the Corporation, that director or officer is excluded from all discussions and deliberations regarding\nthe contract or relationship and such director abstains from voting in respect thereof. Directors and executive officers\nhave disclosed to the Corporation all directorships held by such member and the existence and nature of any interests\nthat could result in a conflict situation with the Corporation.\nThe Board has also adopted a whistleblower policy (the “Whistleblower Policy”) relating to the reporting of\ninappropriate activity to encourage and promote a culture of ethical business conduct. The Whistleblower Policy is\nintended to encourage and facilitate the reporting of questionable accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing\nmatters.\nNomination of Directors\nThe Human Resources and Corporate Governance Committee has the responsibility for reviewing the composition of\nthe Board by taking into account, among other things, its size and the particular competencies and skills of its\nmembers. The Human Resources and Corporate Governance Committee, in consultation with the Chairman of the\nBoard and Chief Executive Officer, will then identify potential Board nominees and recommend such nominees for\nelection as directors based on the competencies and skills each new member possesses in the context of the needs of\nthe Corporation. The Board as a whole is then responsible for nominating new directors. The Human Resources and\nCorporate Governance Committee is composed entirely of independent directors.\nThe Board seeks nominees that have the following characteristics: (i) a track record in general business management;\n(ii) special expertise in an area of strategic interest to the Corporation; (iii) the ability to devote time; and (iv) support\nfor the Corporation’s mission and strategic objectives.\nWhile the Corporation has not adopted a written policy relating to the identification and nomination of women\ndirectors, it recognizes that diversity is an economic driver of competitiveness for companies and it strives to promote\nan environment and culture conducive to the appointment of well qualified persons so that there is appropriate diversity\nto maximize the achievement of corporate goals. Gender of a potential candidate is one component in the overall list\nof factors the Human Resources and Corporate Governance Committee considers when selecting candidates for\nexecutive officer and senior manager appointments, and membership on the Board and its committees. The Human\nResources and Corporate Governance Committee is of the opinion that if gender was the overriding factor governing\nthe selection of Board nominees, it could unduly restrict the Board’s ability to select the most appropriate nominees\nand candidates. The Corporation has not adopted targets regarding women on the Board or women in executive officer\nand senior management positions as it does not believe that such targets are necessary at this time given the size of\nthe Board and that the director nomination process recognizes the benefits of diversity. There are currently two women\non the Board.\nDirector and Executive Compensation\nThe Human Resources and Corporate Governance Committee oversees the remuneration policies and practices of the\nCorporation. The principal responsibilities of the Human Resources and Corporate Governance Committee include:\n(i) considering the Corporation’s overall remuneration strategy and, where information is available, verifying the\nappropriateness of existing remuneration levels using external sources for comparison; (ii) comparing the nature and\namount of the Corporation’s directors’ and executive officers’ compensation to performance against goals set for the\nyear while considering relevant comparative information, independent expert advice and the financial position of the\nCorporation, and (iii) making recommendations to the Board in respect of director and executive officer remuneration\n29\nmatters, with the overall objective of ensuring maximum Shareholder benefit from the retention of high quality board\nand executive team members.\nBoard Assessments\nThe Board is responsible for ensuring that there is a process in place for annually evaluating the effectiveness and\ncontribution of the Chief Executive Officer, the Board, the committees of the Board, the Chairman of the Board and\nthe individual directors based on their applicable terms of reference or position description.\nThe objective of the assessments is to ensure the continued effectiveness of the Board in the execution of its\nresponsibilities and to contribute to a process of continuing improvement. In addition to any other matters the Board\ndeems relevant, the assessments may consider in the case of the Board or a committee, the applicable terms of\nreference, the applicable position descriptions, as well as the competencies and skills each individual director is\nexpected to bring to the Board.\nThe Human Resources and Corporate Governance Committee annually reviews and makes recommendations to the\nBoard on the method and content of such evaluations and oversees the evaluation process.\nBoard Committees\nThe Board has two standing committees, being the Audit Committee and the Human Resources and Corporate\nGovernance Committee.

Any Deferred Share Units that are unvested as of the DSU Participant’s DSU\nTermination Date shall, unless otherwise determined by the Board at its sole discretion, be\nterminated effective immediately on the DSU Termination Date.\n6.7 Settlement in respect of Deferred Share Units.\nIn respect of an award of vested Deferred Share Units granted to a DSU Participant, at any time between\nthe DSU Participant’s DSU Termination Date and December 1st of the year following the year in which\nthe DSU Participant’s DSU Termination Date occurs, a DSU Participant shall be entitled to deliver to the\nCompany a DSU Settlement Notice in respect of any or all vested Deferred Share Units which the DSU\nParticipant desires to settle. In the event that a DSU Participant fails to settle any vested Deferred Share\nUnits as of December 1st of the year following the year in which the DSU Participant’s DSU Termination\nDate occurs, the Company shall automatically settle all such vested Deferred Share Units by the\napplicable DSU Payment Date. Settlement of vested Deferred Share Units shall occur as follows:\n(1) The Company shall elect to settle all vested Deferred Share Units in such DSU Participant’s\nnotional account for their Cash Equivalent (determined in accordance with Section 6.8(1)), in\nShares (determined in accordance with Section 6.8(2)) or a combination thereof.\n(2) Settlement of vested Deferred Share Units shall take place no later than the DSU Payment Date\nand in the form elected by the Company through:\n(a) in the case of settlement for their Cash Equivalent, a cheque to the Participant, a dependant\nor relation of the Participant or the Participant’s duly authorized legal representative, as the\ncase may be, representing the Cash Equivalent;\n(b) in the case of settlement for Shares, a share certificate to the Participant, a dependant or\nrelation of the Participant or the Participant’s duly authorized legal representative, as the\ncase may be, representing Shares issued from treasury; or\n(c) in the case of settlement for a combination of Shares and the Cash Equivalent, a\ncombination of (a) and (b) above.\nB-16\n6.8 Determination of Amounts.\n(1) Cash Equivalent of Deferred Share Units. For purposes of determining the Cash Equivalent of\nDeferred Share Units to be made pursuant to Section 6.7(2)(a) or Section 6.7(2)(c), such calculation\nwill be made based on the Market Value on the DSU Termination Date multiplied by the number\nof vested Deferred Share Units in the Participant’s Deferred Share Unit notional account as of the\nDSU Termination Date which are being settled, net of any Applicable Withholding Taxes.\n(2) Payment in Shares; Issuance of Shares from Treasury. For the purposes of determining the\nnumber of Shares from treasury to be issued and delivered to a DSU Participant upon settlement of\nDeferred Share Units pursuant to Section 6.7(2)(b) or Section 6.7(2)(c), such calculation will be\nbased on the whole number of Shares equal to the whole number of vested Deferred Share Units\nrecorded in the Participant’s Deferred Share Unit notional account that are being settled, net of any\nApplicable Withholding Taxes. Shares issued from treasury will be issued in consideration for the\npast services of the DSU Participant to the Company and the entitlement of the DSU Participant\nunder this Plan shall be satisfied in full by such issuance of Shares. As set out in Section 6.9, the\nCompany will, if applicable, also make a cash payment, net of any Applicable Withholding Taxes,\nto the Participant with respect to the value of any fractional Deferred Share Units standing to the\nParticipant’s credit after the maximum number of whole Shares have been issued by the Company\nas described above.\n6.9 Cash Payment.\nIf applicable, the Company shall also make a cash payment, net of any Applicable Withholding Taxes, to\nthe DSU Participant with respect to the value of fractional vested Deferred Share Units standing to the\nDSU Participant’s credit after the maximum number of whole Shares have been issued by the Company,\ncalculated by multiplying (i) the number of such fractional vested Deferred Share Units by (ii) the Market\nValue of such fractional vested Deferred Share Units on the applicable date.\n6.10 Applicable Withholding Taxes.\nFor greater certainty, unless not required under the ITA or any other applicable law, no cash payment will\nbe made nor will Shares be issued until:\n(a) An amount sufficient to cover the Applicable Withholding Taxes payable on the settlement\nof such Deferred Share Units has been received by the Company (or withheld by the\nCompany from the Cash Equivalent and/or cash payment noted above if applicable); or\n(b) The DSU Participant undertakes to arrange for such number of Shares to be sold as is\nnecessary to raise an amount equal to Applicable Withholding Taxes, and to cause the\nproceeds from the sale of such Shares to be delivered to the Company.\n6.11 Cancellation of Deferred Share Units.\nUpon payment in full of the value of the Deferred Share Units, the Deferred Share Units shall be\ncancelled and no further payments shall be made from the Plan in relation to such Deferred Share Units.\n6.12 Adjustments.\nSubject to any required approval by the TSX or regulatory authority, in the case of any merger,\namalgamation, arrangement, rights offering, subdivision, consolidation, or reclassification of the Shares\nor other relevant change in the capitalization of the Company, or stock dividend or distribution (excluding\ndividends or distributions which may be paid in cash or in Shares at the option of the Shareholder), or\nB-17\nexchange of the Shares for other securities or property, the Company shall make appropriate adjustments\nin the Shares issuable or amounts payable, as the case may be, as determined as appropriate by the Board,\nto preclude a dilution or enlargement of the benefits hereunder, and any such adjustment (or non-\nadjustment) by the Company shall be conclusive, final and binding upon the DSU Participants. However,\nno amount will be paid to, or in respect of, the DSU Participants under the Plan or pursuant to any other\narrangement, and no additional Deferred Share Units will be granted to such Participant to compensation\nfor a downward fluctuation in the price of the Shares, nor will any other form of benefit be conferred\nupon, or in respect of, a DSU Participant for such purpose.\n6.13 US Participants.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, if the Deferred Share Units of a DSU\nParticipant are subject to tax under both the income tax laws of Canada and the income tax laws of the\nUnited States, the following special rules regarding forfeiture will apply. For greater clarity, these\nforfeiture provisions are intended to avoid adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code\nand/or under paragraph 6801(d) of the regulations under the ITA, that may result because of the different\nrequirements as to the time of redemption of Deferred Share Units (and thus the time of taxation) with\nrespect to a DSU Participant’s Separation From Service (under U.S. tax law) and the DSU Participant’s\nDSU Termination Date (under Canadian tax law). The intended consequence of this Section 6.13 of the\nPlan is that payments to US Participants in respect of Deferred Share Units will only occur if such US\nParticipant experiences both a Separation From Service and a DSU Termination Date. If a US Participant\ndoes not experience both a Separation From Service and a DSU Termination Date, including in the\ncircumstances enumerated below, such Deferred Share Units shall instead be immediately and irrevocably\nforfeited:\n(a) a US Participant experiences a Separation From Service as a result of a permanent decrease\nin the level of services such US Participant provides to the Company or a related entity that\nis considered the same service recipient under Section 409A of the Code to less than 20%\nof his or her past service, but such US Participant continues to provide some level of service\nto the Company or a Related Entity;\n(b) a US Participant experiences a Separation From Service as a result of ceasing to be a\nmember of the Board, but such US Participant continues providing services as an employee\nof the Company or Related Entity; or\n(c) a US Participant, for any reason, experiences a DSU Termination Date, but continues to\nprovide services as an independent contractor such that he or she has not experienced a\nSeparation From Service.\nARTICLE 7\nASSUMPTION OR SUBSTITUTION OF UNITS\n7.1 Substitution.\n(1) In the event of a Substitution Event, any surviving or acquiring company must, unless Article 8\napplies:\n(a) Assume any Unit outstanding under the Plan on substantially the same economic terms and\nconditions as the Plan; or\n(b) Substitute or replace restricted share units and deferred share units, as applicable (including\nan award to acquire the same consideration paid to the securityholders of the Company in\nB-18\nthe transaction effecting the Substitution Event) for those Restricted Share Units and\nDeferred Share Units outstanding under the Plan on substantially the same economic terms\nand conditions as the Plan.\n(2) In the event any surviving or acquiring company neglects or refuses (as determined by the Board,\nacting reasonably) to assume any Units or to substitute or replace similar restricted share units and\ndeferred share units, as applicable, for those outstanding Restricted Share Units and Deferred Share\nUnits under the Plan in connection with a Substitution Event, then with respect to any Units held\nby Participants, the vesting of such Units will automatically and without further action by the Board\nor the Company be immediately accelerated so that such Units will be fully vested.\n(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, in the event of a potential Substitution Event, the\nBoard may, in its discretion: (i) terminate, conditionally or otherwise and on such terms as it sees\nfit, the Restricted Share Units not settled following successful completion of such Substitution\nEvent; and (ii) accelerate, conditionally or otherwise and on such terms as it sees fit, the vesting of\nUnits or, subject to Section 3.3(5), otherwise modify the terms of the Units to assist the Participants\nto obtain the advantage of holding Shares during the Substitution Event. If the Substitution Event\nreferred to in this Article 7 is not completed during the time specified therein (as the same may be\nextended), the Units which vested pursuant to this Article 7 will be reinstated as unvested Units\nand the original terms applicable to such Units will apply. If any of the Units that vested pursuant\nto this Article 7 were settled, the applicable Shares or the Cash Equivalent must be returned to the\nCompany and any Shares shall be cancelled. The determination of the Board in respect of any such\nSubstitution Event will for the purposes of this Plan be final, conclusive and binding.\nARTICLE 8\nTAKE-OVER BIDS\n8.1 Take-over Bids.\n(1) In the event of a “potential change of control following a take-over bid” (as defined herein), the\nBoard may, in its discretion, conditionally or otherwise and on such terms as it sees fit, accelerate\nthe vesting of all of a Participant’s unvested Units to a date prior to the expiry date of such take-\nover bid or offer, such that all of a Participant’s Units will immediately vest at such time and the\nRSU Vesting Date in connection with any such Restricted Share Units will be adjusted accordingly.\nIn such event, all Restricted Share Units so vested may be settled conditionally or otherwise, from\nsuch date until their respective expiry date so as to permit the Participant to tender the Shares\nreceived upon such settlement pursuant to the take-over bid or offer. For purposes of this Article 8,\na “potential change of control following a take-over bid” will be deemed to occur upon a formal\ntake-over bid or tender offer for Shares being made as a result of which the offeror and its Affiliates\nor Associates, and each company, trust, partnership or other entity under common control with any\nof them would, if successful, beneficially own, directly or indirectly, fifty percent (50%) or more\nof the Shares then outstanding.\n(2) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Plan, in the event of a potential change of control\nfollowing a take-over bid, the Board will have the power, if determined appropriate (i) to terminate,\nconditionally or otherwise and on such terms as it sees fit, the Restricted Share Units not settled\nfollowing successful completion of such event, and/or (ii) subject to Section 3.3(5), to modify the\nterms of the Units, conditionally or otherwise and on such terms as it sees fit, in order to assist the\nParticipants to tender their securities into the take-over bid. For greater certainty, in the event that\nthe acquiring entity acquires one hundred percent (100%) of the outstanding Shares following the\ntake-over bid, the Board will have the power, if determined appropriate, to terminate the Restricted\nB-19\nShare Units not settled upon the expiry of the time period for tendering Shares to the acquiring\nentity for purchase.\n(3) If the take-over bid referred to in this Article 8 is not completed within the time specified therein\n(as the same may be extended), the Units that vested pursuant to this Article 8 (if any) will be\nreinstated as unvested Units and the original terms applicable to such Units will apply. If any of the\nUnits that vested pursuant to this Article 8 (if any) were settled the applicable Shares or the Cash\nEquivalent must be returned to the Company, and any Shares shall be cancelled. The determination\nof the Board with respect to any such event will for the purposes of this Plan be final, conclusive\nand binding.\nARTICLE 9\nASSIGNMENT\n9.1 Successors and Assigns.\nIn no event may the rights or interests of a Participant under the Plan be assigned, encumbered, pledged,\ntransferred or alienated in any way, except to the extent that certain rights may pass to a beneficiary or\nlegal representative upon death of a Participant, by will or by the laws of succession and distribution.\n9.2 Rights and Obligations.\nRights and obligations under the Plan may be assigned by the Company to a successor in the business of\nthe Company.\nARTICLE 10\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\n10.1 Clawback.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, any Unit which is subject to recovery, cancellation,\nforfeiture, revocation or recoupment under applicable laws, stock exchange listing requirements or\npolicies adopted by the Company, including the Company’s clawback policy, as amended or restated\nfrom time to time, will be subject to such deductions, cancellations, forfeitures, revocations, recoupments\nand clawbacks as may be required pursuant to such laws, stock exchange listing requirements or policies.\nThe Company’s rights pursuant to such laws, stock exchange listing requirements or policies may\ninclude, without limitation, the ability to cancel or revoke any Unit for no consideration or require\nreimbursement or other recoupment of the value realized from any such Unit.\n10.2 Non-Exclusivity.\nNothing contained herein will prevent the Board from adopting other additional compensation\narrangements for the benefit of Eligible Persons, subject to any required regulatory or Shareholder\napproval.\n10.3 No Right to Continued Employment or Consultancy.\nNothing contained herein shall (i) be construed as conferring upon any Participant the right to continued\nemployment or consultancy, (ii) affect in any way the right of the Company or Shareholders to terminate\nsuch employment or consultancy, or (iii) affect in any way the rights of any party contained in any\nagreement governing a Participant’s service as an employee or consultant or other agreement governing\nthe Participant’s services to the Company.\nB-20\n10.4 No Right to Continued Board Membership.\nNothing contained herein shall (i) be construed as conferring upon any Participant the right to continue as\na member of the Board, (ii) affect in any way the right of the Company or Shareholders to terminate such\nmembership, or (iii) affect in any way the rights of any party contained in any agreement governing a\nParticipant’s service as a member of the Board or other agreement governing the Participant’s non-\nemployee services to the Company.\n10.5 Reorganization of the Company.\nThe existence of any Units shall not affect in any way the right or power of the Company or its\nShareholders to make or authorize any adjustment, recapitalization, reorganization or other change in the\nCompany’s capital structure or its business, or any amalgamation, combination, merger or consolidation\ninvolving the Company or to create or issue any bonds, debentures, Shares or other securities of the\nCompany or the rights and conditions attaching thereto or to affect the dissolution or liquidation of the\nCompany or any sale or transfer of all or any part of its assets or business, or any other corporate act or\nproceeding, whether of a similar nature or otherwise.\n10.6 Notice\nAny notice required to be given by this Plan shall be in writing and shall be given by registered mail,\npostage prepaid, or delivered by courier or by facsimile transmission addressed, if to the Company, to the\nhead office of the Company, Attention: Chief Financial Officer; or, if to a Participant, to such Participant\nat his or her address as it appears on the books of the Company or in the event of the address of any such\nParticipant not so appearing, then to the last known address of such Participant; or, if to any other person,\nto the last known address of such person.\n10.7 Compliance with Legislation\nThe administration of the Plan shall be subject to and performed in conformity with all applicable laws,\nregulations, orders of governmental or regulatory authorities and the requirements of any stock exchange\non which the Shares are listed.

TULSA employs real-time MR guidance for precision to preserve patients’ urinary continence and sexual function, while killing the targeted prostate tissue via precise sound absorption technology that gently heats it to 55-57°C. TULSA is an incision- and radiation-free “one-and-done” procedure performed in a single session that takes a few hours. Virtually all prostate shapes and sizes can be safely, effectively, and efficiently treated with TULSA. There is no bleeding associated with the procedure; no hospital stay is required; and most TULSA patients report quick recovery to their normal routine.\n\nRecognizing TULSA is being used by urologists to treat an unrivalled variety of prostate cancer and/or BPH patients, Profound is developing a novel set of software modules under the TULSA-AI® brand to work in conjunction with TULSA-PRO® to provide further customizability, ease of use, speed of treatment and higher confidence in clinical outcomes.\n\nAs the name implies, UA Alignment Assistant streamlines the alignment of the ultrasound applicator (“UA”) catheter that resides in the center of the prostate during the TULSA procedure. The primary benefit of the software is improvement in workflow consistency, as instead of aligning it manually, it will now be done the same way every time via the module. Previously, the manual TULSA-PRO® UA alignment meant that users had to spend time scrolling through MR images and clicking through to align them to the UA. Via the new software, MR images will be automatically imported and then immediately displayed to the user in an aligned way.\n\n“One of the focusses of RSNA 2024 _–_ which is expected to attract more than 40,000 physicians, researchers and industry participants _–_ will be on the increasingly important role that AI can play in improving the efficiency and quality of care,” said Arun Menawat, Profound’s CEO and Chairman. “Accordingly, it is the ideal forum for us to unveil for the first time our third TULSA-AI® module, UA Alignment Assistant. Effectively, the module removes a whole procedural step from TULSA, resulting in less mental charge, fewer steps to remember, and overall procedural simplification for users. We are also excited to see that the RSNA and SUO 2024 meetings will feature presentations on the TULSA procedure by esteemed physicians and researchers from the Busch Center, UT Southwestern Medical Center and the Mayo Clinic.”\n\n**Presentation details:**\n\n**RSNA 2024**\n\n  * **Customized Whole-Gland MR-Guided Transurethral Ultrasound Ablation (TULSA) for the Treatment of Localized Prostate Cancer: A Single Centre Retrospective of 73 Patients** Joseph J.

The TULSA procedure, performed using the TULSA-PRO® system, has the potential of becoming a mainstream treatment modality across the entire prostate disease spectrum; ranging from low-, intermediate-, or high-risk prostate cancer; to hybrid patients suffering from both prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia (“BPH”); to men with BPH only; and also, to patients requiring salvage therapy for radio-recurrent localized prostate cancer. TULSA employs real-time MR guidance for pixel-by-pixel precision to preserve prostate disease patients’ urinary continence and sexual function, while killing the targeted prostate tissue via a precise sound absorption technology that gently heats it to kill temperature (55-57°C). TULSA is an incision- and radiation-free “one-and-done” procedure performed in a single session that takes a few hours. Virtually all prostate shapes and sizes can be safely, effectively, and efficiently treated with TULSA. There is no bleeding associated with the procedure; no hospital stay is required; and most TULSA patients report quick recovery to their normal routine. TULSA-PRO® is CE marked, Health Canada approved, and 510(k) cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”).\n\nProfound is also commercializing Sonalleve®, an innovative therapeutic platform that is CE marked for the treatment of uterine fibroids and palliative pain treatment of bone metastases. Sonalleve® has also been approved by the China National Medical Products Administration for the non-invasive treatment of uterine fibroids and has FDA approval under a Humanitarian Device Exemption for the treatment of osteoid osteoma. The Company is in the early stages of exploring additional potential treatment markets for Sonalleve® where the technology has been shown to have clinical application, such as non-invasive ablation of abdominal cancers and hyperthermia for cancer therapy.\n\n**For further information, please contact:** Stephen KilmerInvestor

Unless specified otherwise, all amounts in this press release are expressed in U.S. dollars and are presented in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.\n\n**Business Highlights**\n\n  * Q3-2024 revenue growth of 64% over Q3-2023.\n  * Profound continued to see a wide variety of prostate disease patients treated by its TULSA-PRO® customers in the third quarter of 2024: \n    * 64% were treated for prostate cancer only, 28% were hybrid patients suffering from both prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia (“BPH”), 6% were salvage, and 2% were men with BPH only;\n    * For cancer grade, 7% were GG1, 66% were GG2, 16% were GG3, and 11% were GG4 & GG5;\n    * In terms of ablation, 53% were whole gland; 25% were sub-total but more than half the gland; and 22% were hemi-ablations or focal therapy; and\n    * For prostate size, 6% were < 20cc; 40% were 20 – 40cc; 33% were 40-60cc; 15% were 60-100cc; and 6% were over 100cc.\n  * In September 2024, Profound hosted its second ‘PRO-TALK _Live!_ ’ event in Las Vegas with 70 physicians participating, 31 of whom being existing TULSA-PRO® users and the other 39 being potential users. The program featured presentations on TULSA-PRO® and its flexibility to treat the widest variety of prostate disease patients from key opinion leaders who have gained first-hand experience with the technology. In addition, members of Profound’s management team provided clinical, technology and commercial updates, with a focus on the future of TULSA-PRO®. Finally, participants heard from representatives of two leading global medical technology companies, Siemens Healthineers and Cook Medical, who discussed their shared common vision with Profound of creating a total magnetic resonance (MR) solution to support the Modern Treatment Pathway that allows for more accurate and precise prostate disease diagnosis, the TULSA Procedure, and follow-up.\n  * In October 2024, the Company announced the appointment of Tom Tamberrino as its new Chief Commercial Officer. Mr. Tamberrino has an accomplished history of sales and marketing leadership, business development, executive management and entrepreneurial success, most of which was gained in the U.S. healthcare industry.\n  * The ongoing Level 1 CAPTAIN trial comparing the TULSA procedure to radical prostatectomy in men with localized prostate cancer remains on track to complete patient enrollment by the end of this year, and Profound anticipates beginning to report interim data from this post-market study in the first half of 2025.\n  * A few days ago, the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issued its outpatient prospective payment system (OPPS) final rule (“Final Rule”) for the three new CPT® Category 1 codes and their descriptors covering the TULSA procedure, which will become effective on January 1, 2025. With the Final Rule, TULSA reimbursement was raised to Urology Level 7 Ambulatory Payment Classification (“APC”) from the Urology APC Level 6 proposed in July 2024.\n  * The TULSA-PRO® systems installed base now totals 59. In light of the positive reimbursement news, Profound is transitioning from a pure recurring revenue model in the U.S. to a more traditional medtech business model that includes both capital and consumable sales, as well as the sale of service/maintenance contracts.\n  * Today, Profound announces the promotion of Mathieu Burtnyk, PhD, from Chief Operating Officer to President to further support growth as the Company transitions to a reimbursement business model. Dr. Burtnyk, along with Rashed Dewan, Profound’s CFO, and Tom Tamberrino, its Chief Commercial Officer, will continue to report to Dr. Menawat.\n\n\n\n“As excited as we were in July that TULSA was poised to start competing with other major prostate treatment modalities on a level playing field, now with the Final Rule, not only will TULSA be uniquely reimbursed at a higher Urology APC Level 7, but also feasible at an unrivaled number of locations compared to other prostate disease treatment modalities. We believe this will enable needed physician and patient access to innovative therapy that men deserve, and be an inflection point for our business,” said Arun Menawat, Profound’s CEO and Chairman.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Results**\n\nFor the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded revenue of $2.83 million, with $2.65 million from recurring revenue, which consists of the sale of TULSA-PRO® consumables, lease of medical devices, procedures and services associated with extended warranties, and $179,000 for one-time sale of capital equipment. Third quarter 2024 revenue increased 64% from $1.73 million in the same three-month period a year ago.\n\nTotal operating expenses, which consist of research and development (“R&D”), general and administrative (“G&A”), and selling and distribution (“S&D”) expenses, were $10.8 million in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 42% compared with $7.6 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nExpenditures for R&D for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were $4.2 million, an increase of 22% compared with $3.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to increases in clinical trial costs, material, and salaries and benefits. The increases were the result of increased CAPTAIN trial treatments and clinical trial recruitment efforts, various R&D projects undertaken during the period which included fixture developments, yield improvements and additional materials for clinical trials, higher headcount and lower reimbursement of workforce costs. Partially offsetting these was a decrease in share based compensation due to fewer awards granted to employees, a decrease in travel due to lower service calls and repairs, and an overall decrease to the general office expense.\n\nG&A expenses for the 2024 third quarter were $3.7 million, an increase of 84% compared with $2.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to increase in salaries and benefits, consulting fees, software, office expenses, expected credit loss and bad debt as a result of higher cost of living salary increases, increased legal and accounting fees associated with the expected loss of Emerging Growth Company status in the United States, increased hosting, license and user costs, coupled with the increase in number of users, the overall increase in general expenses and bad debt expense associated with one customer. Partially offsetting these was a decrease to insurance expense due to lower premium rates and decrease to share based compensation due to fewer awards granted to employees.\n\nThird quarter 2024 S&D expenses increased by 34% to $2.9 million, compared with $2.2 million in the third quarter of 2023. This was driven by increases in salaries and benefits, consulting fees, marketing expenses, travel and general office expenses, as a result of increased salesforce and commission payments, consultants engaged to assist with sales and marketing efforts, increased in-person conferences, meetings and largest event hosted, PRO-Talk _Live!_ , coupled with an increase to the general office expenses. Partially offsetting these was a decrease in share based compensation due to fewer awards granted to employees.\n\nNet finance expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $199,000, compared with net finance income of $1.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nThird quarter 2024 net loss was $9.4 million, or $0.38 per common share, compared to $5.6 million, or $0.26 per common share, in the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n**Current 2024 Outlook**\n\nAs previously disclosed, based on the Company’s current business planning and budgeting activities, Profound anticipates its total revenue for full-year 2024 to be in the range of $11.0 million to $12.0 million, representing total year-over-year revenue growth of 53% to 67%.\n\n**Liquidity and Outstanding Share Capital**\n\nAs at September 30, 2024, Profound had cash of $27.1 million.\n\nAs at November 7, 2024, Profound had 24,661,771 common shares issued and outstanding.\n\nFor complete financial results, please see Profound’s filings at [www.sedarplus.ca](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=mQ8va95260R_TbWlhKbkq21IVv3iv167Ac2jBaPVHPmT0WFUSEUEV7yNhl3MwJL3M-r8718FhtlcH_pQzGtQxw== \"www.sedarplus.ca\"), [_www.sec.gov_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=mQ8va95260R_TbWlhKbkq9TD0ahgZfSs3JjfNCpNUMeVeQCoUu-CoYjjH6VVyAOuiPt2n6mwBWziZ93QjosDPw==) and on the Company’s website at [_www.profoundmedical.com_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=P7e7s4aBBnEy_xZ-vPm1uN5w_zrgnSx9g2hhcZGGHUzrOUjpoNswGNvTrYcFu2sYDY9ed1Q6c4HJ79zYGhKAcGWA3-JChCcL2T9JYhTCo5M=) under “Financial” in the Investors section.\n\n**Conference Call Details**\n\nProfound Medical is pleased to invite all interested parties to participate in a conference call today at 4:30 pm ET during which time the results will be discussed.\n\nTo participate in the conference call by telephone, please pre-register via this [link](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=qWmUW79YDz2u472A_ZIoN9z1dv_0jf-TLxyL3uJsFjbGoc-ufDfLIxhh0s2qAMx3vcz97QGJk9QvOrVX0usnn3q8uzeVUEuEhwLh9_LiijMyRFTZZBbIuiFlFmtdEbCnPrK3ef74KlZ9kFrxct6G3Q== \"link\") to receive the dial-in number and your unique PIN.\n\nThe call will also be broadcast live and archived on the Company's website at [www.profoundmedical.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=P7e7s4aBBnEy_xZ-vPm1uN5w_zrgnSx9g2hhcZGGHUwmx1EbM2mwTG2aH_2C2QWdTY8Kgw8roHx8nU77DNc5xlPI1o6b9DgTBV5_R-uOWt4= \"www.profoundmedical.com\") under \"Webcasts\" in the Investors section.\n\n**About Profound Medical Corp.**\n\nProfound is a commercial-stage medical device company that develops and markets customizable, incision-free therapies for the ablation of diseased tissue.\n\nProfound is commercializing TULSA-PRO®, a technology that combines real-time MRI, robotically-driven transurethral ultrasound and closed-loop temperature feedback control. The TULSA procedure, performed using the TULSA-PRO® system, has the potential of becoming a mainstream treatment modality across the entire prostate disease spectrum; ranging from low-, intermediate-, or high-risk prostate cancer; to hybrid patients suffering from both prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia (“BPH”); to men with BPH only; and also, to patients requiring salvage therapy for radio-recurrent localized prostate cancer. TULSA employs real-time MR guidance for pixel-by-pixel precision to preserve prostate disease patients’ urinary continence and sexual function, while killing the targeted prostate tissue via a precise sound absorption technology that gently heats it to kill temperature (55-57°C). TULSA is an incision- and radiation-free “one-and-done” procedure performed in a single session that takes a few hours. Virtually all prostate shapes and sizes can be safely, effectively, and efficiently treated with TULSA. There is no bleeding associated with the procedure; no hospital stay is required; and most TULSA patients report quick recovery to their normal routine. TULSA-PRO® is CE marked, Health Canada approved, and 510(k) cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”).\n\nProfound is also commercializing Sonalleve®, an innovative therapeutic platform that is CE marked for the treatment of uterine fibroids and palliative pain treatment of bone metastases. Sonalleve® has also been approved by the China National Medical Products Administration for the non-invasive treatment of uterine fibroids and has FDA approval under a Humanitarian Device Exemption for the treatment of osteoid osteoma. The Company is in the early stages of exploring additional potential treatment markets for Sonalleve® where the technology has been shown to have clinical application, such as non-invasive ablation of abdominal cancers and hyperthermia for cancer therapy.\n\n_Forward-Looking Statements_\n\n_This release includes forward-looking statements regarding Profound and its business which may include, but is not limited to,_ _any express or implied statements regarding current or future financial performance and position, including the Company’s year 2024 financial outlook and related assumptions; the expectations regarding the efficacy of Profound’s technology in the treatment of prostate cancer, BPH, uterine fibroids, palliative pain treatment and osteoid osteoma; and its future revenues/financial results.

(NASDAQ:PROF; TSX:PRN) (“Profound” or the “Company”), a commercial-stage medical device company that develops and markets customizable, incision-free therapies for the ablation of diseased tissue, today announced that U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) has released its final rule (the “Final Rule”) establishing, for the first time, a Category 1 CPT® code for the Transurethral Ultrasound Ablation (“TULSA”) procedure, effective January 1, 2025.\n\nAccording to the Final Rule, TULSA will have three codes to cover how therapy is delivered depending on if there are one or two physicians involved in the procedure: CPT 51721 TULSA Device Management and CPT 55881 TULSA Treatment, when two physicians are involved in the procedure, and CPT 55882 TULSA Complete Procedure, when performed by a single physician. All three TULSA codes will have a 0-day global period, indicating that the payment associated with the codes will only cover the work performed on the day TULSA is performed. Physicians will thereby bill for any pre- or post-procedure patient visits separately using existing evaluation and management (E/M) codes. This will provide physicians with the most flexibility to assess the appropriate number of visits needed by each patient and enable their safe and fast recovery.\n\nUniquely for prostate treatment modalities, TULSA codes have been assigned to all three sites of service: Hospital Outpatient (“HOPD”), Ambulatory Surgical Center (“ASC”), and Private Office/Non-Facility (“OBL”). The spectrum of the location of service will ensure TULSA patients can be treated in an unrivalled number of settings.\n\nFor Hospital Payment, the Final Rule has established TULSA CPT 55882 as a Level 7 Urology Ambulatory Payment Classification (“APC”) for 2025 of $12,992 (Medicare National Average). For ASCs, the facility payment for CPT 55882 will be $10,728 (Medicare National Average). This represents increases of approximately 41% and 49% for hospitals and ASCs, respectively, over TULSA payments previously set in the Proposed Rule announced in July 2024 and is also 25% higher than the Final Rule for robotic radical proctectomy, a mainstream treatment modality for prostate cancer, and 41% higher than the 2025 payment classification for benign prostatic hyperplasia (“BPH”) treatments, such as Aquablation.\n\n“We are delighted to see that CMS recognized the value proposition of the TULSA procedure and placed it in Urology APC Level 7. The codes will be applicable in the widest possible range of treatment settings, including hospitals and ASC’s, imaging centers, and office settings, such as large urology practices. Clinically, TULSA is being used today at leading hospitals primarily for whole- and partial-gland treatment of a variety of prostate cancer grades and/or as relief from symptoms of BPH in certain patients who would otherwise need surgical interventions. We are pleased to bring to market an innovative procedure like TULSA that completely changes patient care from major surgery that can cause significant side effects to incision-free intervention with no blood loss, no hospital stay and preservation of patients’ vital functions,” said Arun Menawat, Profound’s CEO and Chairman.\n\nThe Final Rule for the Physician Fee Schedule has set the total Facility (HOPD or ASC) Relative Value Units (“RVU”) at 6.47 for CPT 51721 TULSA Device Management and 14.56 RVU for CPT 55881 TULSA Treatment, when 2 physicians are involved in the TULSA procedure. If one physician performs the complete TULSA procedure, the RVU is 17.91 for CPT 55882.\n\nThe Proposed Rule for Physician fee schedule for Non-Facility (OBL or Private Office) has set RVU at 16.25 for CPT 51721 TULSA Device Management and 263.05 RVU for CPT 55881 TULSA Treatment, when 2 physicians are involved in the TULSA procedure. If one physician performs the complete TULSA procedure, the RVU is 272.21 for CPT 55882.\n\nAs noted above, the TULSA procedure will have a 0-day Global Period, meaning that all post-operative visits are billed separately. This is distinct from all other comparable prostate treatments which are 90-day Global Period and therefore include bundled payments for all post-operative visits performed in the first 90 days. The typical range of post-operative office visits would be approximately 9-11 total RVUs in the first 90-days.\n\nThe below tables summarize the proposed rule Codes, RVUs and Facility Dollar Amounts.\n\n_Fee Schedule (Medicare National Average):_\n\n**CPT Code**| **Description**| **APC 5377: Level 7 Urology- HOPD**| **APC: ASC**  \n---|---|---|---  \n55882| TULSA Complete Procedure| $12,992.42| $10,728.00  \n  \n_Physician Fee Schedule:_\n\n**CPT Code**| **Description**| **Physician Total RVU**| **Typical 90-Day Follow-up**| **Physician Total RVU with Typical 90-Day Follow-Up**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n**Facility (HOPD, ASC)**| **Non-Facility (OBL)**| **Facility (HOPD, ASC)**| **Non-Facility (OBL)**  \n51721| TULSA Device Management| 6.47| 16.25| 9.37-11.61| 15.84-18.08| 25.62-27.86  \n55881| TULSA Treatment| 14.56| 263.05| n/a| 14.56| 263.05  \n51721 & 55881 Total| Procedure Total| 21.03| 279.30| 9.37-11.61| 30.40-32.66| 288.67-290.91  \n(Two Physician)  \n55882| TULSA Complete Procedure (One Physician)| 17.91| 272.21| 9.37-11.61| 27.28-29.52| 281.58 - 283.82  \n  \n**About Profound Medical Corp.**\n\nProfound is a commercial-stage medical device company that develops and markets customizable, incision-free therapies for the ablation of diseased tissue.\n\nProfound is commercializing TULSA-PRO®, a technology that combines real-time MRI, robotically-driven transurethral ultrasound and closed-loop temperature feedback control. The TULSA procedure, performed using the TULSA-PRO® system, has the potential of becoming a mainstream treatment modality across the entire prostate disease spectrum; ranging from low-, intermediate-, or high-risk prostate cancer; to hybrid patients suffering from both prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia (“BPH”); to men with BPH only; and also, to patients requiring salvage therapy for radio-recurrent localized prostate cancer. TULSA employs real-time MR guidance for pixel-by-pixel precision to preserve prostate disease patients’ urinary continence and sexual function, while killing the targeted prostate tissue via a precise sound absorption technology that gently heats it to kill temperature (55-57°C). TULSA is an incision- and radiation-free “one-and-done” procedure performed in a single session that takes a few hours. Virtually all prostate shapes and sizes can be safely, effectively, and efficiently treated with TULSA. There is no bleeding associated with the procedure; no hospital stay is required; and most TULSA patients report quick recovery to their normal routine. TULSA-PRO® is CE marked, Health Canada approved, and 510(k) cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”).\n\nProfound is also commercializing Sonalleve®, an innovative therapeutic platform that is CE marked for the treatment of uterine fibroids and palliative pain treatment of bone metastases. Sonalleve® has also been approved by the China National Medical Products Administration for the non-invasive treatment of uterine fibroids and has FDA approval under a Humanitarian Device Exemption for the treatment of osteoid osteoma. The Company is in the early stages of exploring additional potential treatment markets for Sonalleve® where the technology has been shown to have clinical application, such as non-invasive ablation of abdominal cancers and hyperthermia for cancer therapy.\n\n**_Forward-Looking Statements_**\n\n_This release includes forward-looking statements regarding Profound and its business which may include, but is not limited to, the expectations regarding the efficacy of Profound’s technology in the treatment of prostate cancer, BPH, uterine fibroids, palliative pain treatment and osteoid osteoma; and the success of Profound’s U.S. commercialization strategy and activities for TULSA-PRO®. Often, but not always, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as \"plans\", \"is expected\", \"expects\", \"scheduled\", \"intends\", \"contemplates\", \"anticipates\", \"believes\", \"proposes\" or variations (including negative variations) of such words and phrases, or state that certain actions, events or results \"may\", \"could\", \"would\", \"might\" or \"will\" be taken, occur or be achieved.

The TULSA procedure, performed using the TULSA-PRO® system, has the potential of becoming a mainstream treatment modality across the entire prostate disease spectrum; ranging from low-, intermediate-, or high-risk prostate cancer; to hybrid patients suffering from both prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia (“BPH”); to men with BPH only; and also, to patients requiring salvage therapy for radio-recurrent localized prostate cancer. TULSA employs real-time MR guidance for pixel-by-pixel precision to preserve prostate disease patients’ urinary continence and sexual function, while killing the targeted prostate tissue via a precise sound absorption technology that gently heats it to kill temperature (55-57°C). TULSA is an incision- and radiation-free “one-and-done” procedure performed in a single session that takes a few hours. Virtually all prostate shapes and sizes can be safely, effectively, and efficiently treated with TULSA. There is no bleeding associated with the procedure; no hospital stay is required; and most TULSA patients report quick recovery to their normal routine. TULSA-PRO® is CE marked, Health Canada approved, and 510(k) cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”).\n\nProfound is also commercializing Sonalleve®, an innovative therapeutic platform that is CE marked for the treatment of uterine fibroids and palliative pain treatment of bone metastases. Sonalleve® has also been approved by the China National Medical Products Administration for the non-invasive treatment of uterine fibroids and has FDA approval under a Humanitarian Device Exemption for the treatment of osteoid osteoma. The Company is in the early stages of exploring additional potential treatment markets for Sonalleve® where the technology has been shown to have clinical application, such as non-invasive ablation of abdominal cancers and hyperthermia for cancer therapy.\n\n**For further information, please contact:**\n\nStephen KilmerInvestor
