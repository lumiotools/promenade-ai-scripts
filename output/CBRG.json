(the \"Bank\"), today announced financial results for the third quarter of 2024 and the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\n[ ![Chain Bridge Bancorp, Inc. \\(PRNewsfoto/Chain Bridge Bancorp, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1990576/Chain_Bridge_Bancorp_Inc_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1990576/Chain_Bridge_Bancorp_Inc_Logo.html \"Opens in a new window\")\n\nOn October 3, 2024, the Company priced its initial public offering (the \"IPO\") of 1,850,000 shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share (\"Class A Common Stock\") at $22.00 per share. In connection with the IPO, the Company reclassified and converted each previously outstanding share of the Company's existing common stock, par value $1.00 per share (\"Old Common Stock\"), into 170 shares of Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share (\"Class B Common Stock\") (the \"Reclassification\"). The Class A Common Stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on October 4, 2024, under the ticker symbol \"CBNA.\" Shares of Class B Common Stock are convertible on a one-for-one basis into shares of Class A Common Stock.\n\nOn October 7, 2024, the Company completed its IPO and received net proceeds of approximately $33.6 million. On October 10, 2024, the Company used a portion of the net proceeds to fully repay the $10.0 million outstanding principal balance on its unsecured line of credit with a correspondent bank.\n\nOur financial statements, including earnings per share and book value per share, reflect the Reclassification retroactively. As a result, the financial statements as of and for the periods ended September 30, 2024 show no shares of Old Common Stock or Class A Common Stock outstanding, and 4,568,920 shares of Class B Common Stock issued and outstanding. Because the IPO occurred after September 30, 2024, the financial impacts are not included in the financial statements presented in this release.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights (Three Months Ended September 30, 2024):**\n\n  * **Consolidated Net Income:** $7.5 million \n  * **Earnings Per Share:** $1.64 per basic and diluted common share outstanding \n  * **Return on Average Equity:** 29.90% (on an annualized basis) \n  * **Return on Average Assets:** 2.03% (on an annualized basis) \n  * **Book Value Per Share:** $22.95 compared to $20.57 at June 30, 2024, and $16.45 at September 30, 2023\n\n\n\n**Year-to-Date 2024 Financial Highlights (Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024):**\n\n  * **Consolidated Net Income:** $17.2 million \n  * **Earnings Per Share:** $3.77 per basic and diluted common share outstanding \n  * **Return on Average Equity:** 25.00% (on an annualized basis) \n  * **Return on Average Assets:** 1.79% (on an annualized basis)\n\n\n\n**Financial Performance**\n\nThe Company reported net income of $7.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $5.8 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $2.8 million in the third quarter of 2023. Earnings per share for the third quarter of 2024 were $1.64, compared to $1.27 for the second quarter of 2024 and $0.62 for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nThe increase in earnings during the third quarter of 2024 was primarily attributable to an increase in net interest income of $3.1 million over the second quarter of 2024, and $6.5 million over the third quarter of 2023. The rise in net interest income resulted from higher average interest-earning assets and an improvement in the net interest margin across both periods. Although non-interest income increased by $450 thousand over the second quarter of 2024 and by $1.9 million over the third quarter of 2023, these increases were offset by non-interest expense increases of $1.4 million over the second quarter of 2024 and $2.6 million over the third quarter of 2023.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported net income of $17.2 million, compared to $5.5 million for the same period in 2023. Earnings per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $3.77, compared to $1.21 for the same period in 2023.\n\nThe increase in earnings for the first nine months of 2024 reflects a $13.0 million increase in net interest income, driven by a $258.8 million increase in average interest-earning assets, compared to the same period in 2023. Additionally, non-interest income rose $5.4 million compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to higher fee income from IntraFi Cash Service® (ICS®) One-Way Sell® deposits. However, non-interest expenses increased $4.7 million, reflecting higher employment and professional services expenses associated with the Company's preparations to become a public company.\n\n**Book Value Per Share (BVPS)**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, book value per share (BVPS) was $22.95, reflecting the retroactive application of the Reclassification for comparability, compared to $20.57 at June 30, 2024 and $16.45 at September 30, 2023.\n\nThe quarter-over-quarter increase in BVPS was primarily driven by $7.5 million in retained earnings during the third quarter of 2024. Additionally, a $3.4 million reduction in accumulated other comprehensive loss, largely due to improvements in the fair value of our available for sale bond portfolio, further contributed to BVPS growth.\n\nThe year-over-year increase in BVPS reflected a $20.6 million rise in retained earnings over the 12-month period and a $9.1 million reduction in accumulated other comprehensive loss.\n\n**Interest Income and Net Interest Margin**\n\nNet interest income for the third quarter of 2024 was $13.6 million, compared to $10.6 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $7.2 million in the third quarter of 2023. Income from interest-bearing deposits in other banks, primarily comprised of reserve balances at the Federal Reserve, drove the increase in net interest income to $7.4 million in the third quarter of 2024 from $4.9 million during the second quarter of 2024 and $1.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. Interest and dividends on securities also increased during the third quarter of 2024 to $3.9 million, from $3.2 million during the second quarter of 2024 and $3.0 million during the third quarter of 2023. The net interest margin, which is calculated as net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets and presented on an annualized basis, was 3.73% in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 3.43% in the second quarter of 2024 and 2.78% in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income totaled $33.0 million, compared to $20.0 million for the same period in 2023, with a net interest margin of 3.47% compared to 2.64% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The income from interest-bearing deposits increased during the nine month period to $15.6 million compared to $3.7 million during the same period in 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest and dividends on securities increased to $10.2 million from $9.3 million during the first nine months of 2023.\n\nThe rise in net interest income and net interest margin during both the third quarter of 2024 and the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by growth in reserves held at the Federal Reserve and investments in securities, along with declining deposit costs. The increase in these earning asset segments was primarily driven by a rise in deposits from political organizations ahead of the November 2024 presidential election. The interest rate paid by the Federal Reserve on reserve balances increased from 5.15% to 5.40%, effective July 27, 2023, and decreased from 5.40% to 4.90%, effective September 19, 2024.\n\n**Non-Interest Income**\n\nNon-interest income for the third quarter of 2024 was $3.1 million, driven by $2.5 million in deposit placement services income which is fee income we earn on One-Way Sell® deposits sold through the ICS® network. Many of these deposits were sourced from political organizations. Other contributors to non-interest income included $376 thousand in service charges on deposit accounts and $243 thousand in trust and wealth management income. By comparison, non-interest income was $2.6 million for the second quarter of 2024, driven by $2.0 million in deposit placement services income, $321 thousand in service charges on accounts, and $239 thousand in trust and wealth management services income. Non-interest income was $1.2 million for the third quarter of 2023, driven by $859 thousand in deposit placement services income, $227 thousand in service charges on accounts, and $149 thousand in trust and wealth management income.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, non-interest income totaled $7.4 million, driven by $5.6 million in deposit placement services income, $1.0 million in service charges on accounts, and $669 thousand in trust and wealth management income. This compares to $1.9 million in non-interest income for the same period in 2023, driven by $1.1 million in deposit placement services income, $651 thousand in service charges on account, and $407 thousand in trust and wealth management income.\n\n**Non-Interest Expenses**\n\nTotal non-interest expense for the third quarter of 2024 was $7.4 million, compared to $6.0 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $4.9 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily driven by higher salaries and employee benefit costs, and an increase in professional service fees associated with the Company's preparation for becoming a public company.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total non-interest expenses were $19.2 million, compared to $14.4 million in the same period in 2023. The change was primarily driven by increased salaries and employee benefits, which totaled $11.6 million during the period, and increased professional services expenses, which increased to $2.2 million primarily on account of the increased professional service fees.\n\n**Balance Sheet & Related Highlights**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024:\n\n  * Total assets were $1.6 billion, compared to $1.4 billion as of June 30, 2024, and $1.2 billion as of September 30, 2023. \n  * Total deposits were $1.4 billion, compared to $1.3 billion as of June 30, 2024, and $1.1 billion as of September 30, 2023. \n  * Total ICS® One-Way Sell® deposits were $432.3 million, compared to $499.2 million as of June 30, 2024, and $106.3 million as of September 30, 2023. \n  * Interest-bearing reserves held at the Federal Reserve were $627.0 million, compared to $471.2 million as of June 30, 2024 and $246.4 million as of September 30, 2023. \n  * The loan-to-deposit ratio was 20.92%, compared to 23.42% as of June 30, 2024, and 29.15% as of September 30, 2023. \n  * The ratio of non-performing assets to total assets remained at 0.00%, unchanged from June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023.\n\n\n\n**Capital and Liquidity**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company's liquidity ratio was 85.31%, compared to 82.64% at June 30, 2024 and 76.28% at September 30, 2023. The liquidity ratio is calculated as the sum of cash and cash equivalents plus unpledged securities classified as investment grade, divided by total liabilities. \n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company's tangible common equity to tangible total assets ratio was 6.74%, compared to 6.66% at June 30, 2024 and 6.53% at September 30, 2023. The ratio of tangible common equity to tangible total assets is calculated in accordance with GAAP and represents the ratio of common equity to total assets. The Company did not have any intangible assets or goodwill for the periods presented.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company's Tier 1 leverage ratio was 7.59%, and the Company's Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio stood at 28.17%. The Company's total risk-based capital ratio was 29.29%. This compares to June 30, 2024 when the Tier 1 leverage ratio was 8.30%, the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio 26.27% and the total risk-based capital ratio 27.42%. At September 30, 2023 the Tier 1 leverage ratio stood at 8.75%, the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio 21.81% and the total risk-based capital ratio 22.95%.\n\n**Trust & Wealth Department**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Bank's Trust & Wealth Department oversaw total assets under administration (AUA) of $384.0 million, consisting of $111.2 million in assets under management (AUM) and $272.8 million in assets under custody (AUC). This compares to AUA of $364.0 million as of June 30, 2024, which consisted of $98.0 million in AUM and $266.0 million in AUC. As of September 30, 2023, AUA totaled $185.8 million, with $70.9 million in AUM and $114.9 million in AUC. Trust and wealth management income was $243 thousand in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $239 thousand in the second quarter of 2024 and $149 thousand in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n**Seasonal Deposit Trends and Outlook**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Bank maintained elevated deposit levels ahead of the November 2024 federal elections. We estimate that at least a majority of our deposit balances as of September 30, 2024 were sourced from political organizations. Deposits from political organizations are currently experiencing outflows, which we expect to continue through the end of the fourth quarter of 2024 and into early 2025, as the 2024 election cycle concludes. The outflows to date have been consistent with the seasonal patterns we have historically observed during federal election cycles. Historically, deposits from political organizations have typically increased in the periods leading up to federal elections and declined in the quarters during and after federal elections. The amount and timing of these deposit inflows and outflows are difficult to predict and may differ from historical patterns.\n\n**About Chain Bridge Bancorp, Inc.:**\n\nChain Bridge Bancorp, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is the registered bank holding company for Chain Bridge Bank, National Association.

The Reclassification also authorized 20,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock, and 10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock. Share information is presented on an as adjusted basis giving effect to the Reclassification. Accordingly, all shares and balances relating to Old Common Stock are reflected in Class B Common Stock.  \n16 Share information for all periods presented gives effect to the Reclassification. All earnings are attributed to Class B shares because no Class A shares were outstanding during the periods presented. The number of basic and diluted shares are the same because there are no potentially dilutive instruments.  \n17 Average balances for securities transferred from AFS to HTM at fair value are shown at carrying value. Average balances for AFS and all other HTM bonds are shown at amortized cost.  \n  \nView original content to download multimedia:<https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chain-bridge-bancorp-inc-reports-third-quarter-2024-and-year-to-date-financial-results-302290585.html>\n\nSOURCE Chain Bridge Bancorp, Inc.\n\nReleased October 29, 2024\n\n  * [emailEmail Alerts](/news/email-alerts)\n  * [contact_pageContacts](/overview/contact-information)\n  * [rss_feedRSS News Feed](/rss-news-feed)\n\n\n"

(the \"Bank\"), today announced financial results for the third quarter of 2024 and the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\n[ ![Chain Bridge Bancorp, Inc. \\(PRNewsfoto/Chain Bridge Bancorp, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1990576/Chain_Bridge_Bancorp_Inc_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1990576/Chain_Bridge_Bancorp_Inc_Logo.html \"Opens in a new window\")\n\nOn October 3, 2024, the Company priced its initial public offering (the \"IPO\") of 1,850,000 shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share (\"Class A Common Stock\") at $22.00 per share. In connection with the IPO, the Company reclassified and converted each previously outstanding share of the Company's existing common stock, par value $1.00 per share (\"Old Common Stock\"), into 170 shares of Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share (\"Class B Common Stock\") (the \"Reclassification\"). The Class A Common Stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on October 4, 2024, under the ticker symbol \"CBNA.\" Shares of Class B Common Stock are convertible on a one-for-one basis into shares of Class A Common Stock.\n\nOn October 7, 2024, the Company completed its IPO and received net proceeds of approximately $33.6 million. On October 10, 2024, the Company used a portion of the net proceeds to fully repay the $10.0 million outstanding principal balance on its unsecured line of credit with a correspondent bank.\n\nOur financial statements, including earnings per share and book value per share, reflect the Reclassification retroactively. As a result, the financial statements as of and for the periods ended September 30, 2024 show no shares of Old Common Stock or Class A Common Stock outstanding, and 4,568,920 shares of Class B Common Stock issued and outstanding. Because the IPO occurred after September 30, 2024, the financial impacts are not included in the financial statements presented in this release.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights (Three Months Ended September 30, 2024):**\n\n  * **Consolidated Net Income:** $7.5 million \n  * **Earnings Per Share:** $1.64 per basic and diluted common share outstanding \n  * **Return on Average Equity:** 29.90% (on an annualized basis) \n  * **Return on Average Assets:** 2.03% (on an annualized basis) \n  * **Book Value Per Share:** $22.95 compared to $20.57 at June 30, 2024, and $16.45 at September 30, 2023\n\n\n\n**Year-to-Date 2024 Financial Highlights (Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024):**\n\n  * **Consolidated Net Income:** $17.2 million \n  * **Earnings Per Share:** $3.77 per basic and diluted common share outstanding \n  * **Return on Average Equity:** 25.00% (on an annualized basis) \n  * **Return on Average Assets:** 1.79% (on an annualized basis)\n\n\n\n**Financial Performance**\n\nThe Company reported net income of $7.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $5.8 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $2.8 million in the third quarter of 2023. Earnings per share for the third quarter of 2024 were $1.64, compared to $1.27 for the second quarter of 2024 and $0.62 for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nThe increase in earnings during the third quarter of 2024 was primarily attributable to an increase in net interest income of $3.1 million over the second quarter of 2024, and $6.5 million over the third quarter of 2023. The rise in net interest income resulted from higher average interest-earning assets and an improvement in the net interest margin across both periods. Although non-interest income increased by $450 thousand over the second quarter of 2024 and by $1.9 million over the third quarter of 2023, these increases were offset by non-interest expense increases of $1.4 million over the second quarter of 2024 and $2.6 million over the third quarter of 2023.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported net income of $17.2 million, compared to $5.5 million for the same period in 2023. Earnings per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $3.77, compared to $1.21 for the same period in 2023.\n\nThe increase in earnings for the first nine months of 2024 reflects a $13.0 million increase in net interest income, driven by a $258.8 million increase in average interest-earning assets, compared to the same period in 2023. Additionally, non-interest income rose $5.4 million compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to higher fee income from IntraFi Cash Service® (ICS®) One-Way Sell® deposits. However, non-interest expenses increased $4.7 million, reflecting higher employment and professional services expenses associated with the Company's preparations to become a public company.\n\n**Book Value Per Share (BVPS)**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, book value per share (BVPS) was $22.95, reflecting the retroactive application of the Reclassification for comparability, compared to $20.57 at June 30, 2024 and $16.45 at September 30, 2023.\n\nThe quarter-over-quarter increase in BVPS was primarily driven by $7.5 million in retained earnings during the third quarter of 2024. Additionally, a $3.4 million reduction in accumulated other comprehensive loss, largely due to improvements in the fair value of our available for sale bond portfolio, further contributed to BVPS growth.\n\nThe year-over-year increase in BVPS reflected a $20.6 million rise in retained earnings over the 12-month period and a $9.1 million reduction in accumulated other comprehensive loss.\n\n**Interest Income and Net Interest Margin**\n\nNet interest income for the third quarter of 2024 was $13.6 million, compared to $10.6 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $7.2 million in the third quarter of 2023. Income from interest-bearing deposits in other banks, primarily comprised of reserve balances at the Federal Reserve, drove the increase in net interest income to $7.4 million in the third quarter of 2024 from $4.9 million during the second quarter of 2024 and $1.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. Interest and dividends on securities also increased during the third quarter of 2024 to $3.9 million, from $3.2 million during the second quarter of 2024 and $3.0 million during the third quarter of 2023. The net interest margin, which is calculated as net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets and presented on an annualized basis, was 3.73% in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 3.43% in the second quarter of 2024 and 2.78% in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income totaled $33.0 million, compared to $20.0 million for the same period in 2023, with a net interest margin of 3.47% compared to 2.64% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The income from interest-bearing deposits increased during the nine month period to $15.6 million compared to $3.7 million during the same period in 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest and dividends on securities increased to $10.2 million from $9.3 million during the first nine months of 2023.\n\nThe rise in net interest income and net interest margin during both the third quarter of 2024 and the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by growth in reserves held at the Federal Reserve and investments in securities, along with declining deposit costs. The increase in these earning asset segments was primarily driven by a rise in deposits from political organizations ahead of the November 2024 presidential election. The interest rate paid by the Federal Reserve on reserve balances increased from 5.15% to 5.40%, effective July 27, 2023, and decreased from 5.40% to 4.90%, effective September 19, 2024.\n\n**Non-Interest Income**\n\nNon-interest income for the third quarter of 2024 was $3.1 million, driven by $2.5 million in deposit placement services income which is fee income we earn on One-Way Sell® deposits sold through the ICS® network. Many of these deposits were sourced from political organizations. Other contributors to non-interest income included $376 thousand in service charges on deposit accounts and $243 thousand in trust and wealth management income. By comparison, non-interest income was $2.6 million for the second quarter of 2024, driven by $2.0 million in deposit placement services income, $321 thousand in service charges on accounts, and $239 thousand in trust and wealth management services income. Non-interest income was $1.2 million for the third quarter of 2023, driven by $859 thousand in deposit placement services income, $227 thousand in service charges on accounts, and $149 thousand in trust and wealth management income.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, non-interest income totaled $7.4 million, driven by $5.6 million in deposit placement services income, $1.0 million in service charges on accounts, and $669 thousand in trust and wealth management income.

The increase was primarily driven by higher salaries and employee benefit costs, and an increase in professional service fees associated with the Company's preparation for becoming a public company.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total non-interest expenses were $19.2 million, compared to $14.4 million in the same period in 2023.

Trust and wealth management income was $243 thousand in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $239 thousand in the second quarter of 2024 and $149 thousand in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n**Seasonal Deposit Trends and Outlook**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Bank maintained elevated deposit levels ahead of the November 2024 federal elections. We estimate that at least a majority of our deposit balances as of September 30, 2024 were sourced from political organizations. Deposits from political organizations are currently experiencing outflows, which we expect to continue through the end of the fourth quarter of 2024 and into early 2025, as the 2024 election cycle concludes. The outflows to date have been consistent with the seasonal patterns we have historically observed during federal election cycles. Historically, deposits from political organizations have typically increased in the periods leading up to federal elections and declined in the quarters during and after federal elections. The amount and timing of these deposit inflows and outflows are difficult to predict and may differ from historical patterns.\n\n**About Chain Bridge Bancorp, Inc.:**\n\nChain Bridge Bancorp, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is the registered bank holding company for Chain Bridge Bank, National Association.

Reports Third\nQuarter 2024 and Year-to-Date Financial\nResults\nMCLEAN, Va., Oct. 29, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Chain Bridge Bancorp, Inc. (NYSE: CBNA)\n(the \"Company\"), the holding company for Chain Bridge Bank, N.A. (the \"Bank\"), today\nannounced financial results for the third quarter of 2024 and the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nOn October 3, 2024, the Company priced its initial public offering (the \"IPO\") of 1,850,000\nshares of Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share (\"Class A Common Stock\") at\n$22.00 per share. In connection with the IPO, the Company reclassified and converted each\npreviously outstanding share of the Company's existing common stock, par value $1.00 per\nshare (\"Old Common Stock\"), into 170 shares of Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per\nshare (\"Class B Common Stock\") (the \"Reclassification\"). The Class A Common Stock began\ntrading on the New York Stock Exchange on October 4, 2024, under the ticker symbol\n\"CBNA.\" Shares of Class B Common Stock are convertible on a one-for-one basis into\nshares of Class A Common Stock.\nOn October 7, 2024, the Company completed its IPO and received net proceeds of\napproximately $33.6 million. On October 10, 2024, the Company used a portion of the net\nproceeds to fully repay the $10.0 million outstanding principal balance on its unsecured line\nof credit with a correspondent bank.\nOur financial statements, including earnings per share and book value per share, reflect the\nReclassification retroactively. As a result, the financial statements as of and for the periods\nended September 30, 2024 show no shares of Old Common Stock or Class A Common\nStock outstanding, and 4,568,920 shares of Class B Common Stock issued and\noutstanding. Because the IPO occurred after September 30, 2024, the financial impacts are\nnot included in the financial statements presented in this release.\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights (Three Months Ended September 30, 2024):\nConsolidated Net Income: $7.5 million\nEarnings Per Share: $1.64 per basic and diluted common share outstanding\nReturn on Average Equity: 29.90% (on an annualized basis)\nReturn on Average Assets: 2.03% (on an annualized basis)\nBook Value Per Share: $22.95 compared to $20.57 at June 30, 2024, and $16.45 at\nSeptember 30, 2023\nYear-to-Date 2024 Financial Highlights (Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024):\nConsolidated Net Income: $17.2 million\nEarnings Per Share: $3.77 per basic and diluted common share outstanding\nReturn on Average Equity: 25.00% (on an annualized basis)\nReturn on Average Assets: 1.79% (on an annualized basis)\nFinancial Performance\nThe Company reported net income of $7.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to\n$5.8 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $2.8 million in the third quarter of 2023.\nEarnings per share for the third quarter of 2024 were $1.64, compared to $1.27 for the\nsecond quarter of 2024 and $0.62 for the third quarter of 2023.\nThe increase in earnings during the third quarter of 2024 was primarily attributable to an\nincrease in net interest income of $3.1 million over the second quarter of 2024, and $6.5\nmillion over the third quarter of 2023. The rise in net interest income resulted from higher\naverage interest-earning assets and an improvement in the net interest margin across both\nperiods. Although non-interest income increased by $450 thousand over the second quarter\nof 2024 and by $1.9 million over the third quarter of 2023, these increases were offset by\nnon-interest expense increases of $1.4 million over the second quarter of 2024 and $2.6\nmillion over the third quarter of 2023.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported net income of $17.2\nmillion, compared to $5.5 million for the same period in 2023. Earnings per share for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 were $3.77, compared to $1.21 for the same period\nin 2023.\nThe increase in earnings for the first nine months of 2024 reflects a $13.0 million increase in\nnet interest income, driven by a $258.8 million increase in average interest-earning assets,\ncompared to the same period in 2023. Additionally, non-interest income rose $5.4 million\ncompared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to higher fee income from IntraFi Cash\nService® (ICS®) One-Way Sell® deposits. However, non-interest expenses increased $4.7\nmillion, reflecting higher employment and professional services expenses associated with\nthe Company's preparations to become a public company.\nBook Value Per Share (BVPS)\nAs of September 30, 2024, book value per share (BVPS) was $22.95, reflecting the\nretroactive application of the Reclassification for comparability, compared to $20.57 at June\n30, 2024 and $16.45 at September 30, 2023.\nThe quarter-over-quarter increase in BVPS was primarily driven by $7.5 million in retained\nearnings during the third quarter of 2024. Additionally, a $3.4 million reduction in\naccumulated other comprehensive loss, largely due to improvements in the fair value of our\navailable for sale bond portfolio, further contributed to BVPS growth.\nThe year-over-year increase in BVPS reflected a $20.6 million rise in retained earnings over\nthe 12-month period and a $9.1 million reduction in accumulated other comprehensive loss.\nInterest Income and Net Interest Margin\nNet interest income for the third quarter of 2024 was $13.6 million, compared to $10.6 million\nin the second quarter of 2024 and $7.2 million in the third quarter of 2023. Income from\ninterest-bearing deposits in other banks, primarily comprised of reserve balances at the\nFederal Reserve, drove the increase in net interest income to $7.4 million in the third quarter\nof 2024 from $4.9 million during the second quarter of 2024 and $1.7 million in the third\nquarter of 2023. Interest and dividends on securities also increased during the third quarter\nof 2024 to $3.9 million, from $3.2 million during the second quarter of 2024 and $3.0 million\nduring the third quarter of 2023. The net interest margin, which is calculated as net interest\nincome as a percentage of average interest-earning assets and presented on an annualized\nbasis, was 3.73% in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 3.43% in the second quarter of\n2024 and 2.78% in the third quarter of 2023.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income totaled $33.0 million,\ncompared to $20.0 million for the same period in 2023, with a net interest margin of 3.47%\ncompared to 2.64% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The income from\ninterest-bearing deposits increased during the nine month period to $15.6 million compared\nto $3.7 million during the same period in 2023. During the nine months ended September\n30, 2024, interest and dividends on securities increased to $10.2 million from $9.3 million\nduring the first nine months of 2023.\nThe rise in net interest income and net interest margin during both the third quarter of 2024\nand the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by growth in reserves held at\nthe Federal Reserve and investments in securities, along with declining deposit costs. The\nincrease in these earning asset segments was primarily driven by a rise in deposits from\npolitical organizations ahead of the November 2024 presidential election. The interest rate\npaid by the Federal Reserve on reserve balances increased from 5.15% to 5.40%, effective\nJuly 27, 2023, and decreased from 5.40% to 4.90%, effective September 19, 2024.\nNon-Interest Income\nNon-interest income for the third quarter of 2024 was $3.1 million, driven by $2.5 million in\ndeposit placement services income which is fee income we earn on One-Way Sell® deposits\nsold through the ICS® network. Many of these deposits were sourced from political\norganizations. Other contributors to non-interest income included $376 thousand in service\ncharges on deposit accounts and $243 thousand in trust and wealth management income.\nBy comparison, non-interest income was $2.6 million for the second quarter of 2024, driven\nby $2.0 million in deposit placement services income, $321 thousand in service charges on\naccounts, and $239 thousand in trust and wealth management services income. Non-interest\nincome was $1.2 million for the third quarter of 2023, driven by $859 thousand in deposit\nplacement services income, $227 thousand in service charges on accounts, and $149\nthousand in trust and wealth management income.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, non-interest income totaled $7.4 million,\ndriven by $5.6 million in deposit placement services income, $1.0 million in service charges\non accounts, and $669 thousand in trust and wealth management income. This compares\nto $1.9 million in non-interest income for the same period in 2023, driven by $1.1 million in\ndeposit placement services income, $651 thousand in service charges on account, and $407\nthousand in trust and wealth management income.\nNon-Interest Expenses\nTotal non-interest expense for the third quarter of 2024 was $7.4 million, compared to $6.0\nmillion in the second quarter of 2024 and $4.9 million in the third quarter of 2023. The\nincrease was primarily driven by higher salaries and employee benefit costs, and an\nincrease in professional service fees associated with the Company's preparation for\nbecoming a public company.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total non-interest expenses were $19.2\nmillion, compared to $14.4 million in the same period in 2023. The change was primarily\ndriven by increased salaries and employee benefits, which totaled $11.6 million during the\nperiod, and increased professional services expenses, which increased to $2.2 million\nprimarily on account of the increased professional service fees.\nBalance Sheet & Related Highlights\nAs of September 30, 2024:\nTotal assets were $1.6 billion, compared to $1.4 billion as of June 30, 2024, and $1.2\nbillion as of September 30, 2023.\nTotal deposits were $1.4 billion, compared to $1.3 billion as of June 30, 2024, and $1.1\nbillion as of September 30, 2023.\nTotal ICS® One-Way Sell® deposits were $432.3 million, compared to $499.2 million\nas of June 30, 2024, and $106.3 million as of September 30, 2023.\nInterest-bearing reserves held at the Federal Reserve were $627.0 million, compared\nto $471.2 million as of June 30, 2024 and $246.4 million as of September 30, 2023.\nThe loan-to-deposit ratio was 20.92%, compared to 23.42% as of June 30, 2024, and\n29.15% as of September 30, 2023.\nThe ratio of non-performing assets to total assets remained at 0.00%, unchanged from\nJune 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023.\nCapital and Liquidity\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company's liquidity ratio was 85.31%, compared to 82.64%\nat June 30, 2024 and 76.28% at September 30, 2023.

At September 30, 2023 the Tier 1 leverage ratio stood at 8.75%, the Tier 1 risk-\nbased capital ratio 21.81% and the total risk-based capital ratio 22.95%.\nTrust & Wealth Department\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Bank's Trust & Wealth Department oversaw total assets\nunder administration (AUA) of $384.0 million, consisting of $111.2 million in assets under\nmanagement (AUM) and $272.8 million in assets under custody (AUC). This compares to\nAUA of $364.0 million as of June 30, 2024, which consisted of $98.0 million in AUM and\n$266.0 million in AUC. As of September 30, 2023, AUA totaled $185.8 million, with $70.9\nmillion in AUM and $114.9 million in AUC. Trust and wealth management income was $243\nthousand in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $239 thousand in the second quarter of\n2024 and $149 thousand in the third quarter of 2023.\nSeasonal Deposit Trends and Outlook\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Bank maintained elevated deposit levels ahead of the\nNovember 2024 federal elections. We estimate that at least a majority of our deposit\nbalances as of September 30, 2024 were sourced from political organizations. Deposits from\npolitical organizations are currently experiencing outflows, which we expect to continue\nthrough the end of the fourth quarter of 2024 and into early 2025, as the 2024 election cycle\nconcludes. The outflows to date have been consistent with the seasonal patterns we have\nhistorically observed during federal election cycles. Historically, deposits from political\norganizations have typically increased in the periods leading up to federal elections and\ndeclined in the quarters during and after federal elections. The amount and timing of these\ndeposit inflows and outflows are difficult to predict and may differ from historical patterns.\nAbout Chain Bridge Bancorp, Inc.:\nChain Bridge Bancorp, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is the registered bank holding company\nfor Chain Bridge Bank, National Association.

The “Bank” and “Chain Bridge Bank, N.A” refer to Chain Bridge Bank, National Association, a nationally chartered bank.\n\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements because they are subject to numerous uncertainties and factors relating to our operations and business, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Forward-looking statements include information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations, including descriptions of our business strategy. These forward-looking statements are generally identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, including the terms “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “target,” “will,” “would” and, in each case, their negative or other variations or comparable terminology and expressions. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including statements regarding our strategies, future operations, future financial position, future revenue, projected costs, prospects, plans, objectives of management and expected market growth are forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements are contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include, but are not limited to, statements relating to: \n\n•Changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies of, and other activities undertaken by, governments, agencies, central banks and similar organizations, including the effects of United States federal government spending; \n\n•The level of, or changes in the level of, interest rates and inflation, including the effects on our net interest income and the market value of our investment and loan portfolios; \n\n•The level and composition of our deposits, including our ability to attract and retain, and the seasonality of, client deposits, including those in the IntraFi Cash Service (“ICS®”) network, as well as the amount and timing of deposit outflows through the end of the fourth quarter of 2024 and into early 2025; \n\n•The level and composition of our loan portfolio, including our ability to maintain the credit quality of our loan portfolio; \n\n•Current and future business, economic and market conditions in the United States generally or in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area in particular; \n\n•The effects of disruptions or instability in the financial system, including as a result of the failure of a financial institution or other participants in it, or geopolitical instability, including war, terrorist attacks, pandemics and man-made and natural disasters; \n\n•The impact of, and changes, in applicable laws, regulations, regulatory expectations and accounting standards and policies; \n\n•Our likelihood of success in, and the impact of, legal, regulatory or other actions, investigations or proceedings related to our business; \n\n•Adverse publicity or reputational harm to us, our senior officers, directors, employees or clients; \n\n•Our ability to effectively execute our growth plans or other initiatives; \n\n•Changes in demand for our products and services; \n\n•Our levels of, and access to, sources of liquidity and capital; \n\n•The ability to attract and retain essential personnel or changes in our essential personnel; \n\n•Our ability to effectively compete with banks, non-bank financial institutions, and financial technology firms and the effects of competition in the financial services industry on our business; \n\n•The effectiveness of our risk management and internal disclosure controls and procedures; \n\n•Any failure or interruption of our information and technology systems, including any components provided by a third party; \n\n•Our ability to identify and address cybersecurity threats and breaches; \n\n•Our ability to keep pace with technological changes; \n\n•Our ability to receive dividends from the Bank and satisfy our obligations as they become due; \n\n•The one-time and incremental costs of operating as a public company; \n\n•Our ability to meet our obligations as a public company, including our obligation under Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley; and\n\n3\n\n[Table of Contents](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)\n\n•The effect of our dual-class structure and the concentrated ownership of our Class B common stock, including beneficial ownership of our shares by the lineal descendants of Gerald Francis Fitzgerald, deceased, and Marjorie Gosselin Fitzgerald, their spouses or surviving spouses, children, and grandchildren, and the spouses of their children and grandchildren (the “Fitzgerald Family”).\n\nYou should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We have based the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q primarily on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. The outcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors described in the section titled “Risk Factors” included in our prospectus dated October 3, 2024, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in accordance with Rule 424(b) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, on October 7, 2024 (the “Prospectus”). Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all risks and uncertainties that could have an impact on the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The results, events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur, and actual results, events, or circumstances could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. \n\nThe forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q relate only to events as of the date on which the statements are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or to reflect new information or the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law. We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any future acquisitions, mergers, dispositions, joint ventures, or investments we may make. \n\nIn addition, statements that “we believe” and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements are based upon information available to us as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. And while we believe such information provides a reasonable basis for such statements, such information may be limited or incomplete. Our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain and you are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these statements. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results or returns and no representation or warranty is made regarding future performance.\n\n4\n\n[Table of Contents](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)\n\nPart I - Financial Information\n\nItem 1.

Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \n\nOrganization and Nature of Operations \n\nChain Bridge Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”) is a Delaware corporation and is the registered bank holding company for Chain Bridge Bank, National Association (the “Bank”). Both the Company and Bank have their headquarters and sole executive office in McLean, Virginia. \n\nThe Bank operates a model that combines electronic banking channels with its physical banking headquarters in McLean, Virginia, allowing it to serve clients nationally. \n\nThe Bank provides a wide range of commercial and personal banking services, including deposit accounts, mortgage financing, various loan products, trust administration, wealth management, and asset custody. The core deposit products offered by the Bank include noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing checking accounts, along with savings accounts. The Bank’s lending portfolio is comprised primarily of mortgage-related loans, with the majority being consumer residential mortgages in the Washington, D.C. area. The Bank offers tailored solutions to individuals, families, businesses, non-profit organizations, and political organizations. The term “political organizations” refers to campaign committees, party committees, separate segregated funds (including trade association political action committees (“PACs”) and corporate PACs), non-connected committees (including independent expenditure-only committees (“Super PACs”), committees maintaining separate accounts for direct contributions and independent expenditures (“Hybrid PACs”), and committees other than authorized campaign committees, or those affiliated therewith, maintained or controlled by a candidate or federal officeholder (“Leadership PACs”)), and other tax-exempt 527 organizations.\n\nThe accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information. The statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of the Company’s management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, which are necessary for a fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements, have been included. These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the notes thereto. \n\nThe results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other interim period or for the full year. \n\nPrinciples of Consolidation \n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Chain Bridge Bancorp, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Chain Bridge Bank, National Association. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\nReclassification \n\nCertain amounts reported in prior years may be reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation. There were no reclassifications for the periods reported.\n\nSignificant Accounting Policies \n\nThe accounting and reporting policies of the Company are in accordance with GAAP and conform to general practices within the banking industry. The Company’s significant accounting policies are described in the Note 1 of the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” included in the audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no significant changes to the application of significant accounting policies since December 31, 2023. \n\n12\n\n[Table of Contents](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)\n\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nIn preparing financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) on loans and held to maturity debt securities. \n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements \n\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.” The amendments in this ASU require an entity to disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold, which is greater than five percent of the amount computed by multiplying pretax income by the entity’s applicable statutory rate, on an annual basis. Additionally, the amendments in this ASU require an entity to disclose the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign taxes and the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by individual jurisdictions that are equal to or greater than five percent of total income taxes paid (net of refunds received). Lastly, the amendments in this ASU require an entity to disclose income (or loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense (or benefit) disaggregated between domestic and foreign and income tax expense (or benefit) from continuing operations disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments should be applied on a prospective basis; however, retrospective application is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2023-09 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. \n\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, “Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses.” ASU 2024-03 requires public companies to disclose, in the notes to the financial statements, specific information about certain costs and expenses at each interim and annual reporting period. This includes disclosing amounts related to employee compensation, depreciation, and intangible asset amortization. In addition, public companies will need to provide qualitative description of the amounts remaining in relevant expense captions that are not separately disaggregated quantitatively. ASU 2024-03 is effective for public business entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Implementation of ASU 2024-03 may be applied prospectively or retrospectively. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2024-03 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\n\nOther accounting standards that have been issued by the FASB or other standard setting bodies are not currently expected to have material effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n\n13\n\n[Table of Contents](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)\n\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nNote 2. Capital Structure\n\nOn September 13, 2024, the Company filed a Registration Statement on Form S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) in connection with its initial public offering (“IPO”), as amended on September 30, 2024, and declared effective by the SEC on October 3, 2024 (the “Registration Statement”). On October 7, 2024, the Company issued 1,850,000 shares of Class A common stock, par value of $0.01 (“Class A Common Stock”), at a public offering price of $22.00 per share. On October 7, 2024, the Company completed its IPO and received total net proceeds of $37.1 million, after deducting the underwriters’ discount and reimbursements for the underwriters’ legal and other out of pocket expenditures. The net proceeds less other related expenses, including audit fees, legal fees, listing fees, and other expenses, totaled $33.6 million. \n\nOn October 10, 2024, the Company used a portion of the net proceeds to fully repay $10.0 million in short-term borrowings. The Company subsequently closed the line of credit on October 11, 2024. \n\nOn November 1, 2024, the Company issued an additional 142,897 shares of Class A Common Stock as a result of the underwriters' exercise of their 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 277,500 shares of its Class A Common Stock. The issuance resulted in net proceeds to the Company of approximately $2.9 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions.\n\nIn connection with the IPO, on October 3, 2024, the Company filed an Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, which established two new classes of common stock, the Class A Common Stock and Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Class B Common Stock”), and reclassified and converted each outstanding share of the Company’s existing common stock, par value $1.00 per share (“Old Common Stock”), into 170 shares of Class B Common Stock (the “Reclassification”). The Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware also changed the number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock from 100,000 to 10,000,000. \n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had 26,876 shares of Old Common Stock issued and outstanding and no shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock issued and outstanding. After giving effect to the Reclassification, which was retroactively applied to the financial statements, the Company had no shares of Old Common Stock and Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding and 4,568,920 shares of Class B Common Stock issued and outstanding. Because the Reclassification was applied retroactively to all periods presented, a share that was previously reported as Old Common stock at $1.00 par value and Additional Paid in Capital, is now reported as 170 shares of Class B Common Stock at $0.01 par value and Additional Paid in Capital. The following table sets forth selected balance sheet components as of September 30, 2024:\n\n•On an unadjusted basis, giving no effect to the Reclassification; \n\n•On an as adjusted basis, giving effect to the Reclassification transactions described above; and\n\n•On an as further adjusted basis after giving effect to (1) the Reclassification, (2) the Company’s receipt of \n\nthe net proceeds from the IPO, after deducting underwriting discounts and commission and other direct expenses of the offering, and (3) the use of a portion of the net proceeds to repay the outstanding principal balance of $10.0 million of borrowings under the Company’s unsecured line of credit with a correspondent bank. \n\n14\n\n[Table of Contents](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)\n\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nAs of September 30, 2024  \n---  \nUnadjusted | As adjusted for Reclassification | As Further Adjusted for IPO  \n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)  \nCash and cash equivalents | $ | 639,767 | $ | 639,767 | $ | 666,293  \nDebt: Short-term borrowings | $ | 10,000 | $ | 10,000 | $ | —  \nStockholders’ equity:  \nPreferred Stock, no par value; 100,000 shares authorized, none issued and outstanding, unadjusted; no par value, 10,000,000 shares authorized, none issued and outstanding, as adjusted for Reclassification and as further adjusted for IPO | $ | — | $ | — | $ | —  \nOld Common Stock, $1.00 par value; 200,000 shares authorized, 26,876 shares issued and outstanding, unadjusted; no shares authorized, no shares issued and outstanding, as adjusted for Reclassification and as further adjusted for IPO | $ | 27 | $ | — | $ | —  \nClass A Common Stock, $0.01 par value; no shares authorized, no shares issued and outstanding, unadjusted; 20,000,000 shares authorized, no shares issued and outstanding, as adjusted for Reclassification; 20,000,000 shares authorized, 1,992,897 shares issued and outstanding, as further adjusted for IPO | $ | — | $ | — | $ | 20  \nClass B Common Stock, $0.01 par value; no shares authorized, no shares issued and outstanding, unadjusted; 10,000,000 shares authorized, 4,568,920 shares issued and outstanding, as adjusted for Reclassification and as further adjusted for IPO | $ | — | $ | 46 | $ | 46  \nAdditional paid-in capital | $ | 38,295 | $ | 38,276 | $ | 74,782  \nRetained earnings | $ | 73,901 | $ | 73,901 | $ | 73,901  \nAccumulated other comprehensive loss | $ | (7,380) | $ | (7,380) | $ | (7,380)  \nTotal stockholders’ equity | $ | 104,843 | $ | 104,843 | $ | 141,369  \n  \n15\n\n[Table of Contents](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)\n\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nNote 3. Securities & Allowance for Securities Credit Losses \n\nThe Company invests in a variety of debt securities, principally obligations of the U.S. government and federal agencies, mortgage backed securities, state and municipal agencies, and corporations. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, all debt securities were classified as held to maturity (“HTM”) or available for sale (“AFS”). \n\nManagement considers the appropriateness of the accounting treatment applied to the Company’s debt securities portfolio on an ongoing basis. During a prior year, certain AFS bonds were transferred to the HTM portfolio. Bonds selected for transfer included U.S. government and federal agencies, corporate bonds, and state and municipal bonds. The unrealized loss at the time of transfer is being amortized monthly over the remaining lives of the debt securities with an increase to the carrying value of the debt securities and a decrease to the related accumulated other comprehensive loss, which is included in the stockholders’ equity section of the consolidated balance sheets. \n\nThe following tables summarize the amortized cost, gross unrealized gains and losses, fair value and allowance for credit losses of AFS and HTM debt securities at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands): \n\nSeptember 30, 2024  \n---  \nAmortizedCost | GrossUnrealizedGains | GrossUnrealized(Losses) | FairValue | Allowancefor CreditLosses  \nSecurities available for sale:  \nU.S. government and federal agencies | $ | 131,089 | $ | 52 | $ | (1,416) | $ | 129,725 | $ | —  \nMortgage backed securities | 8,658 | — | (429) | 8,229 | —  \nCorporate bonds | 53,283 | 62 | (750) | 52,595 | —  \nState and municipal securities | 107,323 | 88 | (3,206) | 104,205 | —  \nTotal securities available for sale | $ | 300,353 | $ | 202 | $ | (5,801) | $ | 294,754 | $ | —  \nSecurities held to maturity:  \nU.S. government and federal agencies | $ | 122,447 | $ | 6 | $ | (7,236) | $ | 115,217 | $ | —  \nMortgage backed securities | 1,173 | — | (1) | 1,172 | —  \nCorporate bonds | 58,409 | 90 | (1,545) | 56,954 | (230)  \nState and municipal securities | 120,580 | 23 | (8,166) | 112,437 | (31)  \nTotal securities held to maturity | $ | 302,609 | $ | 119 | $ | (16,948) | $ | 285,780 | $ | (261)  \nTotal securities | $ | 602,962 | $ | 321 | $ | (22,749) | $ | 580,534 | $ | (261)  \n  \nDecember 31, 2023  \n---  \nAmortizedCost | GrossUnrealizedGains | GrossUnrealized(Losses) | FairValue | Allowancefor CreditLosses  \nSecurities available for sale:  \nU.S. government and federal agencies | $ | 95,129 | $ | 32 | $ | (2,864) | $ | 92,297 | $ | —  \nMortgage backed securities | 9,247 | 11 | (609) | 8,649 | —  \nCorporate bonds | 57,304 | 5 | (1,837) | 55,472 | —  \nState and municipal securities | 106,472 | 34 | (4,810) | 101,696 | —  \nTotal securities available for sale | $ | 268,152 | $ | 82 | $ | (10,120) | $ | 258,114 | $ | —  \nSecurities held to maturity:  \nU.S. government and federal agencies | $ | 123,938 | $ | — | $ | (10,069) | $ | 113,869 | $ | —  \nMortgage backed securities | 1,190 | — | (17) | 1,173 | —  \nCorporate bonds | 59,629 | 59 | (3,027) | 56,661 | (322)  \nState and municipal securities | 123,649 | 6 | (11,442) | 112,213 | (26)  \nTotal securities held to maturity | $ | 308,406 | $ | 65 | $ | (24,555) | $ | 283,916 | $ | (348)  \nTotal securities | $ | 576,558 | $ | 147 | $ | (34,675) | $ | 542,030 | $ | (348)  \n  \n16\n\n[Table of Contents](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)\n\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nThere were no holdings of municipal or corporate debt that equaled or exceeded 10.0% of stockholders’ equity at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. \n\nThere were no securities pledged to secure a line of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. \n\nProceeds from calls, maturities, paydowns and sales of debt securities available for sale totaled $81.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and $28.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Proceeds from calls, maturities, and paydowns of debt securities held to maturity totaled $5.5 million and $248 thousandfor the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Bank sold an AFS bond that was charged off during a prior year for $210 thousand. The proceeds were recorded as a recapture of credit loss. Because this sale did not result in a realized gain or loss on sale of securities, it is excluded from the related tables below. \n\nThe proceeds, gross realized gains and losses from sales of debt securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows (dollars in thousands): \n\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024 | Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024  \n---|---  \nAvailable for Sale | Held to Maturity | Available for Sale | Held to Maturity  \nProceeds from sales of securities | $ | — | $ | 953 | $ | — | $ | 953  \nGross gains | — | — | — | —  \nGross losses | — | (65) | — | (65)  \nNet losses on sale of a securities | $ | — | $ | (65) | $ | — | $ | (65)  \nIncome tax benefit attributable to realized net losses on sale of securities | $ | — | $ | 14 | $ | — | $ | 14  \n  \nThree Months Ended September 30, 2023 | Nine Months EndedSeptember 30, 2023  \n---|---  \nAvailable for Sale | Held to Maturity | Available for Sale | Held to Maturity  \nProceeds from sales of securities | $ | 977 | $ | — | $ | 1,929 | $ | —  \nGross gains | — | — | — | —  \nGross losses | (30) | — | (312) | —  \nNet losses on sale of a securities | $ | (30) | $ | — | $ | (312) | $ | —  \nIncome tax benefit attributable to realized net losses on sale of securities | $ | 6 | $ | — | $ | 66 | $ | —  \n  \nManagement classifies bonds as HTM only when the Company has the ability and intent to hold the bond to maturity, and certain sales or transfers of HTM could call into question management’s ability or intent to hold the remaining HTM bond portfolio to maturity, thereby “tainting” the entire portfolio and triggering a reclassification of the entire portfolio to available for sale. However, there are limited situations, including evidence of deterioration in the issuer’s creditworthiness, in which the Company could sell an HTM bond without tainting the remaining HTM portfolio. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company sold two HTM bonds from a single issuer due to significant documented deterioration of the issuer’s creditworthiness evidenced by the downgrading of the issuer’s public credit rating. The sales are included in the tables above. Under these circumstances, the sale did not taint the HTM portfolio.\n\nThe amortized cost and fair value of debt securities by contractual maturity at September 30, 2024 is as follows (dollars in thousands): \n\n17\n\n[Table of Contents](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)\n\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nAvailable for Sale | Held to Maturity  \n---|---  \nAmortizedCost | FairValue | AmortizedCost | FairValue  \nWithin one year | $ | 166,593 | $ | 166,033 | $ | 16,873 | $ | 16,668  \nAfter one year through five years | 98,391 | 95,808 | 189,090 | 181,392  \nAfter five years through ten years | 29,950 | 27,843 | 92,329 | 83,923  \nOver ten years | 5,419 | 5,070 | 4,317 | 3,797  \nTotal | $ | 300,353 | $ | 294,754 | $ | 302,609 | $ | 285,780  \n  \nExpected maturities may differ from contractual maturities if issuers have the right to call or repay obligations with or without prepayment penalties. \n\nThe following table shows the gross unrealized losses and fair value of the Company’s AFS debt securities with unrealized losses aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual debt securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands): \n\nSeptember 30, 2024  \n---  \nLess Than TwelveMonths | Over Twelve Months | Total  \nGrossUnrealizedLoss | FairValue | GrossUnrealizedLoss | FairValue | GrossUnrealizedLoss | FairValue  \nSecurities available for sale:  \nU.S. government and federal agencies | $ | (1) | $ | 10,997 | $ | (1,415) | $ | 46,445 | $ | (1,416) | $ | 57,442  \nMortgage backed securities | — | 27 | (429) | 8,170 | (429) | 8,197  \nCorporate bonds | (17) | 5,454 | (733) | 37,865 | (750) | 43,319  \nState and municipal securities | (27) | 6,061 | (3,179) | 83,089 | (3,206) | 89,150  \nTotal securities available for sale | $ | (45) | $ | 22,539 | $ | (5,756) | $ | 175,569 | $ | (5,801) | $ | 198,108  \n  \nDecember 31, 2023  \n---  \nLess Than TwelveMonths | Over Twelve Months | Total  \nGrossUnrealizedLoss | FairValue | GrossUnrealizedLoss | FairValue | GrossUnrealizedLoss | FairValue  \nSecurities available for sale:  \nU.S. government and federal agencies | $ | (16) | $ | 5,860 | $ | (2,848) | $ | 70,906 | $ | (2,864) | $ | 76,766  \nMortgage backed securities | — | — | (609) | 8,604 | (609) | 8,604  \nCorporate bonds | (3) | 2,482 | (1,834) | 51,987 | (1,837) | 54,469  \nState and municipal securities | (31) | 3,675 | (4,779) | 89,828 | (4,810) | 93,503  \nTotal securities available for sale | $ | (50) | $ | 12,017 | $ | (10,070) | $ | 221,325 | $ | (10,120) | $ | 233,342  \n  \nIn the AFS portfolio at September 30, 2024, 46 out of 61 debt securities of the U.S. government and federal agencies, 15 out of 20 mortgage backed securities, 89 out of 108 corporate bonds, and 269 out of 306 state and municipal securities were in an unrealized loss position. All of the Company’s investment portfolio was evaluated under the monitoring process described in Note 1 of the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, and all investments were deemed investment grade. All of the unrealized losses are attributed to changes in market interest rates, and are not a result of deterioration of creditworthiness among any of the issuers. \n\nOf the total AFS and HTM portfolio at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 792 and 880 debt securities had unrealized losses with aggregate impairment of 3.8% and 6.0%, respectively, of the Company’s amortized cost basis. These unrealized losses related principally to interest rate movements and not the creditworthiness of the issuer. In analyzing an issuer’s financial condition, management considers whether the debt securities are issued by the federal government or its \n\n18\n\n[Table of Contents](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)\n\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nagencies, whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, and industry analysts’ reports. Credit loss allowances for the AFS and HTM portfolios are described in the following sections. \n\nAllowance for Credit Losses—AFS Securities \n\nManagement evaluates debt securities to determine whether the unrealized loss is due to credit-related factors or non-credit-related factors. This analysis occurs on a quarterly basis. Consideration is given to the extent to which fair value is less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the intent and ability of the Company to retain its investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for full recovery of its amortized cost. If the assessment reveals that a credit loss exists, the present value of the expected cash flows of the security is compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of future cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost, an allowance for the credit loss is recorded. The loss is limited by the amount that the amortized cost exceeds fair value. \n\nAs of the reporting date, the Company did not intend to sell any of the AFS debt securities, did not expect to be required to sell these debt securities, and expected to recover the entire amortized cost basis of all of the debt securities. \n\nThe Company did not record an ACL on the AFS debt securities at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company has evaluated these debt securities for credit-related impairment at the reporting date and concluded that no impairment existed. In analyzing an issuer’s financial condition, management considers whether the debt securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies, whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, industry analysts’ reports, and correlations between fair value changes and interest rate changes among instruments that are not credit sensitive. All AFS debt securities were current with no debt securities past due or on non-accrual as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company considers the unrealized losses on the debt securities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 to be related to fluctuations in market conditions, primarily interest rates, and is not reflective of deterioration in credit. \n\nThe table below presents a rollforward by major security type of the allowance for credit losses on AFS debt securities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in thousands): \n\nSeptember 30, 2024  \n---  \nFor the nine months ended | U.S.Governmentand FederalAgencies | MortgageBackedSecurities | CorporateBonds | State andMunicipalSecurities | Total AFSSecurities  \nAllowance for credit losses:  \nBeginning balance, December 31, 2023 | $ | — | $ | — | $ | — | $ | — | $ | —  \nProvision for (recapture of) credit losses | — | — | (210) | — | (210)  \nWrite offs charged against the allowance | — | — | — | — | —  \nRecoveries of amounts previously written off | — | — | 210 | — | 210  \nEnding balance, September 30, 2024 | $ | — | $ | — | $ | — | $ | — | $ | —  \n  \n19\n\n[Table of Contents](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)\n\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nAt September 30, 2024, there was no allowance for credit losses on AFS debt securities recorded. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Bank received proceeds totaling $210 thousand for a bond that was fully charged off during 2023, and recorded a recovery of credit loss. The entire ACL recovery during 2024 was recorded in the first quarter. \n\nSeptember 30, 2023  \n---  \nFor the nine months ended | U.S.Governmentand FederalAgencies | MortgageBackedSecurities | CorporateBonds | State andMunicipalSecurities | Total AFSSecurities  \nAllowance for credit losses:  \nBeginning balance, December 31, 2022 | $ | — | $ | — | $ | — | $ | — | $ | —  \nImpact of adopting ASC 326 | — | — | — | — | —  \nProvision for credit losses | — | — | 785 | — | 785  \nWrite offs charged against the allowance | — | — | (785) | — | (785)  \nRecoveries of amounts previously written off | — | — | — | — | —  \nEnding balance, September 30, 2023 | $ | — | $ | — | $ | — | $ | — | $ | —  \n  \nAt September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2023, there was no allowance for credit losses on AFS debt securities recorded. The entire ACL provision recorded for the AFS portfolio during 2023 was recorded in the first quarter and pertained to a holding from a single corporate issuer whose business was ultimately closed by a regulatory authority. The bond, initially classified as HTM, was transferred to the AFS portfolio based on the unlikely collectability of the unsecured bond and significant documented credit deterioration. A portion of the bond was subsequently sold at a loss, and the remaining unsold portion was written off entirely. \n\nCredit Quality Indicators and Allowance for Credit Losses - HTM Securities \n\nThe Company evaluates the credit risk of its HTM debt securities on a quarterly basis. The Company estimates expected credit losses on HTM debt securities using an instrument -level process described in Note 1 of the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. The primary indicators of credit quality for the Company’s HTM portfolio are security type, time remaining to maturity, and credit rating. Credit ratings may be influenced by a number of factors including obligor cash flows, geography, seniority and others. The HTM portfolio includes debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury and agencies of the federal government, and mortgage-backed securities issued by government agencies. These types of investments carry implicit or explicit backing of the U.S. Treasury, and therefore are deemed to carry no credit risk for purposes of the ACL evaluation. \n\nThe following table presents the amortized cost of HTM debt securities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 by security type and credit rating (dollars in thousands): \n\nSeptember 30, 2024  \n---  \nU.S.Governmentand FederalAgencies | MortgageBackedSecurities | CorporateBonds | State andMunicipalSecurities | Total HTMSecurities  \nAAA / AA / A | $ | 122,447 | $ | 1,173 | $ | 18,447 | $ | 120,580 | $ | 262,647  \nBBB / BB / B | — | — | 39,962 | — | 39,962  \nTotal | $ | 122,447 | $ | 1,173 | $ | 58,409 | $ | 120,580 | $ | 302,609  \n  \n20\n\n[Table of Contents](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)\n\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nDecember 31, 2023  \n---  \nU.S.Governmentand FederalAgencies | MortgageBackedSecurities | CorporateBonds | State andMunicipalSecurities | Total HTMSecurities  \nAAA / AA / A | $ | 123,938 | $ | 1,190 | $ | 20,091 | $ | 123,168 | $ | 268,387  \nBBB / BB / B | — | — | 39,538 | 481 | 40,019  \nTotal | $ | 123,938 | $ | 1,190 | $ | 59,629 | $ | 123,649 | $ | 308,406  \n  \nThe following tables summarize the change in the allowance for credit losses on HTM debt securities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands):\n\nSeptember 30, 2024  \n---  \nFor the three months ended  | U.S.Governmentand FederalAgencies | MortgageBackedSecurities | CorporateBonds | State andMunicipalSecurities | Total HTMSecurities  \nAllowance for credit losses:  \nBeginning balance, June 30, 2024 | $ | — | $ | — | $ | 215 | $ | 33 | $ | 248  \nProvision for (recapture of) credit losses | — | — | 15 | (2) | 13  \nWrite offs charged against the allowance | — | — | — | — | —  \nRecoveries of amounts previously written off | — | — | — | — | —  \nEnding balance, September 30, 2024 | $ | — | $ | — | $ | 230 | $ | —  | $ | 31 | $ | —  | $ | 261  \n  \nSeptember 30, 2023  \n---  \nFor the three months ended  | U.S.Governmentand FederalAgencies | MortgageBackedSecurities | CorporateBonds | State andMunicipalSecurities | Total HTMSecurities  \nAllowance for credit losses:  \nBeginning balance, June 30, 2023 | $ | — | $ | — | $ | 316 | $ | 26 | $ | 342  \nProvision for (recapture of) credit losses | — | — | (8) | 14 | 6  \nWrite offs charged against the allowance | — | — | — | — | —  \nRecoveries of amounts previously written off | — | — | — | — | —  \nEnding balance, September 30, 2023 | — | — | 308 | 40 | 348  \n  \nSeptember 30, 2024  \n---  \nFor the nine months ended | U.S.Governmentand FederalAgencies | MortgageBackedSecurities | CorporateBonds | State andMunicipalSecurities | Total HTMSecurities  \nAllowance for credit losses:  \nBeginning balance, December 31, 2023 | $ | — | $ | — | $ | 322 | $ | 26 | $ | 348  \nProvision for (recapture of) credit losses | — | — | (92) | 5 | (87)  \nWrite offs charged against the allowance | — | — | — | — | —  \nRecoveries of amounts previously written off | — | — | — | — | —  \nEnding balance, September 30, 2024 | $ | — | $ | — | $ | 230 | $ | 31 | $ | 261  \n  \n21\n\n[Table of Contents](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)\n\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nSeptember 30, 2023  \n---  \nFor the nine months ended | U.S.Governmentand FederalAgencies | MortgageBackedSecurities | CorporateBonds | State andMunicipalSecurities | Total HTMSecurities  \nAllowance for credit losses:  \nBeginning balance, December 31, 2022 | $ | — | $ | — | $ | — | $ | — | $ | —  \nImpact of adopting ASC 326 | — | — | 303 | 26 | 329  \nProvision for credit losses | — | — | 5 | 14 | 19  \nWrite offs charged against the allowance | — | — | — | — | —  \nRecoveries of amounts previously written off | — | — | — | — | —  \nEnding balance, September 30, 2023 | $ | — | $ | — | $ | 308 | $ | 40 | $ | 348  \n  \nAt September 30, 2024, the Company had no HTM debt securities that were 30 days or more past due as to principal and interest payments.

\nCollateral Dependent Loans \n\nFASB ASC Topic 326 describes a collateral-dependent asset as a financial asset for which the repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral when the borrower, based on management’s assessment, is experiencing financial difficulty as of the reporting date. Whether the underlying collateral is expected to be a substantial source of repayment for an asset depends on the availability, reliability, and capacity of sources other than the collateral to repay the debt. Collateral-dependent loans are individually evaluated for expected credit losses as of the reporting date, and they are removed from their respective pools of collectively evaluated assets. Expected credit losses for these types of assets are based on the fair value of the collateral at the measurement date, adjusted for estimated selling costs. There were no collateral-dependent loans that were individually evaluated for purposes of determining the allowance for credit loss under FASB ASC Topic 326 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. \n\nModifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty \n\nThe Company may modify loans to borrowers in financial distress by providing principal forgiveness, term extension, and other-than-insignificant payment delay or interest rate reduction. When principal forgiveness is provided, the amount of forgiveness is charged-off against the allowance for credit losses. There were no loan modifications provided to borrowers exhibiting financial distress during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and there were no such prior modifications in existence during the periods reported. During the reported periods, there were no payment defaults from any such loans during the twelve months preceding the modification because no such modifications were in existence during the periods. \n\nRelated Party Loan Transactions \n\nOfficers, directors and their affiliates had loans outstanding with the Company of $8.6 million and $6.9 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The increase in loans outstanding relates to the cumulative effect of changes in the composition of related parties, due to the hiring of a new officer. These transactions occurred in the ordinary course of business on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with unrelated persons.\n\nNote 5. Deposits \n\nThe Bank held no deposits classified as brokered as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. To achieve full insurance from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), some of the Bank’s depositors have enrolled in the \n\n26\n\n[Table of Contents](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)\n\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nIntraFi Cash Service® (“ICS®”) program offered by the Bank through the IntraFi® network. When accounts are enrolled in this service, the Bank must elect, for each account, whether it will receive a reciprocal deposit balance or sell the deposit balance. There were no reciprocal deposits held as of September 30, 2024. At December 31, 2023, the Bank held $177.3 million of reciprocal deposits through ICS® on its consolidated balance sheets. Total ICS® One-Way Sell® deposits of $432.3 million and $130.1 million as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively, were sold to the network and excluded from the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The Company receives fee income for sold accounts, which is included in deposit placement services income on the consolidated statements of income. \n\nThe Bank’s deposit balances have consistently followed the trend of historic seasonality surrounding federal election cycles, where political organization deposits generally increase in the quarters leading up to federal elections and decline in the quarters during and after the elections. Consistent with this trend, as of September 30, 2024, the Bank maintained elevated deposit levels ahead of the November 2024 federal elections, with deposits reported on the balance sheet totaling $1.4 billion, and One-Way Sell® deposits totaling $432.3 million. Entering the fourth quarter of 2024—the quarter of the 2024 presidential election—between October 1, 2024 and November 12, 2024, the date prior to the filing of this quarterly report, total deposits, including reciprocal ICS® deposits, have ranged from approximately $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion, and ICS® One-Way Sell® accounts have approximately ranged from a minimum of $85.4 million to a maximum of $462.5 million. At the close of business on November 12, 2024, total deposits were $1.2 billion and ICS® One-Way Sell® accounts were $85.4 million. Declines in the volume of deposits retained on the balance sheet will cause net interest income to decrease, and declines in ICS® One-Way Sell® balances will cause noninterest income to decrease. The amount and timing of these deposit inflows and outflows are difficult to predict and may differ from historical patterns. \n\nFDIC deposit insurance covers $250 thousand per depositor, per FDIC-insured bank, for each account ownership category. The Company estimates uninsured deposits held at the Bank as of September 30, 2024 are $1.2 billion, which is 81.4% of total deposits. The Company estimated uninsured deposits as of December 31, 2023 were $648.0 million, which is 58.3% of total deposits. \n\nThere were two clients with an individual deposit balance exceeding 5.0% of total deposits as of September 30, 2024. The total deposit balance related to these clients as of September 30, 2024 was $226.6 million or 15.8% of total deposits. There were no clients whose individual deposit balances exceeded 5.0% of total deposits as of December 31, 2023.\n\nNote 6. Borrowings \n\nFederal Home Loan Bank Advance \n\nThe Bank has a secured line of credit with the Federal Home Loan Bank, which is renewed annually in December. The Bank has historically pledged 1-4 family residential real estate loans within the Bank’s loan portfolio to establish credit availability. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the secured line of credit had no collateral pledged and therefore no available or outstanding balance. \n\nShort-Term Borrowings \n\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had an unsecured line of credit from a correspondent bank totaling $10.0 million with an outstanding balance of $10.0 million as of September 30, 2024 and $5.0 million as of December 31, 2023. On October 10, 2024, the Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the IPO to fully repay the $10.0 million outstanding balance. The Company subsequently closed the line on October 11, 2024. The interest rate on the line of credit was 7.85% and 7.95% at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of December 6, 2023, the agreement was amended to require payment of a quarterly unused commitment fee at the rate of 1.00% per annum on the undisbursed and uncanceled daily balance during the preceding quarter. \n\nThe Bank has unsecured federal fund purchase lines of credit with Community Bankers’ Bank totaling $8.0 million maturing March 12, 2025, First National Bankers’ Bank totaling $10.0 million maturing on June 30, 2025, and Pacific Coast Bankers’ Bank totaling $50.0 million maturing June 30, 2025. The federal funds lines renew annually and balances may remain outstanding for period of up to 10 to 90 consecutive days. The use of the facilities is subject to certain terms and conditions, including those related to the Bank’s financial condition. There were no outstanding federal funds purchased balances as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n\n27\n\n[Table of Contents](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)\n\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nNote 7. Fair Value Measurements \n\nDetermination of Fair Value \n\nFair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The fair value measurements and disclosure topic specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to these valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s market assumptions. U.S. GAAP requires that valuation techniques maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. \n\nFair Value Hierarchy\n\nU.S. GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy which categorizes the valuation inputs into three broad levels. Based on the underlying inputs, each fair value measurement in its entirety is reported in one of the three levels. These levels are: \n\nLevel 1 - Valuation is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 1 assets and liabilities generally include debt and equity securities that are traded in an active exchange market. Valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for market transactions involving identical assets or liabilities. \n\nLevel 2 - Valuation is based on inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. The valuation may be based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. \n\nLevel 3 - Valuation is based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. \n\nAn asset or liability’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. \n\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis \n\nThe following describes the valuation techniques used by the Company to measure certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis in the financial statements: \n\nSecurities Available for Sale & Equity Securities\n\nDebt securities available for sale and equity securities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value measurement is based upon quoted market prices, when available (Level 1). If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are measured utilizing independent valuation techniques of identical or similar securities for which significant assumptions are derived primarily from or corroborated by observable market data (Level 2). If the inputs used to provide the evaluation for certain securities are unobservable and/or there is little, if any, market activity then the security would fall to the lowest level of the hierarchy (Level 3). \n\nThe Company’s investment portfolio is valued using fair value measurements that are considered to be Level 1 or Level 2 but may also use Level 3 measurements if required by the composition of the portfolio. The Bank has contracted with a securities portfolio accounting service provider for valuation of its securities portfolio. Most security types are priced using the securities accounting provider’s internally developed pricing software which appraises securities from an online real-time database. Subscription pricing services such as ICE Data Services and Bloomberg Valuation Services may be used to supplement the internal pricing system for security types where the underlying collateral, cash flow projections or trade data is not readily available. If Level 1 or Level 2 inputs are not available, the software may rely upon a discounted cash flow analysis based on the net present value of a security’s projected cash flow to arrive at fair market value. Valuations for direct obligations of the U.S. Treasury, exchange listed stock and preferred stock are obtained from on-line real-time databases. \n\n28\n\n[Table of Contents](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)\n\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nThe securities accounting service provider utilizes proprietary valuation matrices for valuing all municipal securities. The initial curves for determining the price, movement, and yield relationships within the municipal matrices are derived from industry benchmark curves or sourced from a municipal trading desk. The securities are further broken down according to issuer, credit support, state of issuance and rating to incorporate additional spreads to the industry benchmark curves. \n\nThe following table presents the balances of financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis (dollars in thousands): \n\nFair Value Measurements Using  \n---  \nFinancial Assets | Balances | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3  \nAs of September 30, 2024:  \nAvailable for sale securities:  \nU.S. government and federal agencies | $ | 129,725 | $ | 125,773 | $ | 3,952 | $ | —  \nMortgage backed securities | 8,229 | — | 8,229 | —  \nCorporate bonds | 52,595 | 492 | 52,103 | —  \nState and municipal securities | 104,205 | — | 104,205 | —  \nTotal available for sale securities | $ | 294,754 | $ | 126,265 | $ | 168,489 | $ | —  \nEquity securities | 527 | 527 | — | —  \nTotal | $ | 295,281 | $ | 126,792 | $ | 168,489 | $ | —  \nAs of December 31, 2023:  \nAvailable for sale securities:  \nU.S. government and federal agencies | $ | 92,297 | $ | 78,817 | $ | 13,480 | $ | —  \nMortgage backed securities | 8,649 | — | 8,649 | —  \nCorporate bonds | 55,472 | 475 | 54,997 | —  \nState and municipal securities | 101,696 | — | 101,696 | —  \nTotal available for sale securities | $ | 258,114 | $ | 79,292 | $ | 178,822 | $ | —  \nEquity securities | 505 | 505 | — | —  \nTotal | $ | 258,619 | $ | 79,797 | $ | 178,822 | $ | —  \n  \nAssets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis \n\nCertain assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Adjustments to the fair value of these assets usually result from the application of lower-of-cost-or-market accounting or write-downs of individual assets. \n\nCollateral Dependent Loans\n\nIndividually evaluated loans are analyzed to determine whether they are collateral dependent. Any individually evaluated loans, which are deemed to be collateral dependent, with an allocation to the ACL are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Any fair value adjustments are recorded in the period incurred as provision for credit losses on the consolidated statements of income. \n\nThe measurement of loss associated with collateral dependent loans can be based on either the observable market price of the loan or fair value of the collateral. Fair value is measured based on the value of the collateral securing the loans. Collateral may be in the form of real estate or business assets including equipment, inventory, and accounts receivable. The vast majority of the collateral is real estate. The value of real estate collateral is determined utilizing a market valuation approach based on an appraisal conducted by an independent, licensed appraiser outside of the Company using observable market data (Level 2). However, if the collateral is a house or building in the process of construction or if an appraisal of the real estate property using an income approach or is over two years old, then the fair value is considered Level 3. The value of business equipment is based upon an outside appraisal if deemed significant, or the net book value on the applicable business’s financial statements if not considered significant using observable market data. Likewise, values for inventory and accounts receivables collateral are based on financial statement balances or aging reports (Level 3). Any fair \n\n29\n\n[Table of Contents](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)\n\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nvalue adjustments are recorded in the period incurred as a provision for loan credit losses on the consolidated statements of income. There were no collateral dependent loans with a recorded reserve as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. \n\nOther Real Estate Owned\n\nOther real estate owned (“OREO”) is measured at fair value less costs to sell. Valuation of OREO is determined using current appraisals from independent parties, a Level 2 input. If current appraisals cannot be obtained, or if declines in value are identified after a recent appraisal is received, appraisal values may be discounted, resulting in a Level 3 estimate. If the Company markets the property with a realtor, estimated selling costs reduce the fair value, resulting in a valuation based on Level 3 inputs. Fair value adjustments are recorded in the period incurred and expensed against current earnings. The Bank held no OREO at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. \n\nLoans Held for Sale\n\nLoans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value. These loans currently consist of 1-4 family residential loans originated for sale in the secondary market. Fair value is based on the price secondary markets are currently offering for similar loans using observable market data which is not materially different than cost due to the short duration between origination and sale (Level 2). As such, the Company records any fair value adjustments on a nonrecurring basis. No nonrecurring fair value adjustments were recorded on loans held for sale at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. \n\nThere were no assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. \n\nFair Value of Financial Instruments \n\nThe following tables present the carrying value and estimated fair value including the level within the fair value hierarchy of the Company’s financial instruments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands): \n\nCarryingAmount | Fair Value Measurements Using | TotalFair Value  \n---|---|---  \nLevel 1 | Level 2 | Level 3  \nAs of September 30, 2024:  \nFinancial assets:  \nCash and due from banks | $ | 639,767 | $ | 639,767 | $ | — | $ | — | $ | 639,767  \nSecurities available for sale | 294,754 | 126,265 | 168,489 | — | 294,754  \nSecurities held to maturity, net | 302,348 | 109,514 | 176,266 | — | 285,780  \nEquity securities | 527 | 527 | — | — | 527  \nRestricted securities | 2,886 | — | 2,886 | — | 2,886  \nLoans, net | 295,826 | — | — | 286,987 | 286,987  \nAccrued interest receivable | 5,360 | — | 5,360 | — | 5,360  \nFinancial liabilities:  \nDemand and savings deposits | $ | 1,421,999 | $ | — | $ | 1,249,724 | $ | 163,186 | $ | 1,412,910  \nTime deposits | 11,869 | — | — | 11,829 | 11,829  \nShort-term borrowings | 10,000 | — | 10,000 | — | 10,000  \nAccrued interest payable | 25 | — | 25 | — | 25  \n  \n30\n\n[Table of Contents](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)\n\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nCarryingAmount | Fair Value Measurements Using | TotalFair Value  \n---|---|---  \nLevel 1 | Level 2 | Level 3  \nAs of December 31, 2023:  \nFinancial assets:  \nCash and due from banks | $ | 316,767 | $ | 316,767 | $ | — | $ | — | $ | 316,767  \nSecurities available for sale | 258,114 | 79,292 | 178,822 | — | 258,114  \nSecurities held to maturity, net | 308,058 | 106,837 | 177,079 | — | 283,916  \nEquity securities | 505 | 505 | — | — | 505  \nRestricted securities | 2,613 | — | 2,613 | — | 2,613  \nLoans, net | 299,825 | — | — | 280,352 | 280,352  \nAccrued interest receivable | 4,354 | — | 4,354 | — | 4,354  \nFinancial liabilities:  \nDemand and savings deposits | $ | 1,095,283 | $ | — | $ | 766,933 | $ | 299,765 | $ | 1,066,698  \nTime deposits | 16,742 | — | — | 16,600 | 16,600  \nShort-term borrowings | 5,000 | — | 5,000 | — | 5,000  \nAccrued interest payable | 61 | — | 61 | — | 61  \n  \nNote 8.

The Company did not pay dividends to any stockholder during 2023 or the nine-month period ending September 30, 2024. \n\nUnder the two-class method, earnings available to common stockholders are allocated ratably on a per-share basis between Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. The table below provides a reconciliation of the combined Class A and Class B Common Stock numerators and denominators of the earnings per share computations. The table gives effect to the Reclassification of 26,876 shares of Old Common Stock into 4,568,920 shares of Class B Common Stock on October 3, 2024. It does not give effect to the issuance of 1,850,000 and 142,897 shares of Class A Common Stock issued in connection with the IPO on October 7, 2024 and November 1, 2024, respectively, and there were no shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding during any of the periods reported. The number of basic and diluted shares are the same because there are no potentially dilutive instruments.\n\nThree Months Ended | Nine Months Ended  \n---|---  \nSeptember 30, | September 30, | September 30, | September 30,  \n2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \nNet Income | $ | 7,487 | $ | 2,843 | $ | 17,209 | $ | 5,517  \nDividends declared on common stock  \nClass A Common Stock | $ | — | $ | — | $ | — | $ | —  \nClass B Common Stock | $ | — | $ | — | $ | — | $ | —  \nUndistributed net income for basic and diluted earnings per share | $ | 7,487 | $ | 2,843 | $ | 17,209 | $ | 5,517  \nWeighted average shares outstanding  \nClass A Common Stock | — | — | — | —  \nClass B Common Stock | 4,568,920 | 4,568,240 | 4,568,920 | 4,568,240  \nWeighted average shares outstanding, basic and dilutive | 4,568,920 | 4,568,240 | 4,568,920 | 4,568,240  \n  \n33\n\n[Table of Contents](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)\n\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nThree Months Ended | Nine Months Ended  \n---|---  \nSeptember 30, | September 30, | September 30, | September 30,  \n2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \nEarnings per common share, basic and diluted  \nClass A Common Stock  \nPer share dividends distributed | $ | — | $ | — | $ | — | $ | —  \nUndistributed earnings per share | — | — | — | —  \nTotal basic and diluted earnings per share - Class A Common Stock | $ | — | $ | — | $ | — | $ | —  \nClass B Common Stock  \nPer share dividends distributed | $ | — | $ | — | $ | — | $ | —  \nUndistributed earnings per share | 1.64 | 0.62 | 3.77 | 1.21  \nTotal basic and diluted earnings per share - Class B Common Stock | $ | 1.64 | $ | 0.62 | $ | 3.77 | $ | 1.21  \n  \nNote 10.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes and the discussion under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in our Prospectus. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, particularly in the section entitled “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” as well as the section entitled “Risk Factors” in our Prospectus. We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements except to the extent required by law. \n\nThe following discussion relates to our historical results, on a consolidated basis. Because we conduct all our material business operations through our wholly owned subsidiary, Chain Bridge Bank, N.A., the discussion and analysis primarily focus on activities conducted at the subsidiary level. \n\nIntroduction \n\nChain Bridge Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”) is a Delaware-chartered bank holding company and the parent of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Chain Bridge Bank, N.A. (the “Bank”), a nationally chartered commercial bank with fiduciary powers granted by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC”). The Company was incorporated on May 26, 2006, and the Bank opened on August 6, 2007. The Company conducts substantially all of its operations through the Bank and has no other subsidiaries. \n\nWe offer a range of commercial and personal banking services, including deposits, treasury management, payments, loans, commercial lending, residential mortgage financing, consumer loans, trusts and estate administration, wealth management, and asset custody. \n\nOur mission is to deliver exceptional banking and trust services nationwide, blending financial strength, personalized service, and advanced technology to offer tailored solutions to businesses, non-profit organizations, political organizations, individuals, and families. We aspire to grow responsibly by adapting our personalized service and advanced technology solutions to our clients’ evolving needs while emphasizing liquidity, asset quality, and financial strength. We aim to be recognized for our “Strength, Service, Solutions: Your Bridge to Better Banking Nationwide.” \n\nReclassification and Initial Public Offering\n\nOn October 3, 2024, in connection with its initial public offering (the “IPO”) Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Class A Common Stock”), the Company reclassified and converted each outstanding share of the Company’s existing common stock, par value $1.00 per share, into 170 shares of Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Class B Common Stock”) (the “Reclassification”). \n\nOn October 7, 2024, the Company completed an offering of 1,850,000 shares of Class A Common Stock and received net proceeds of approximately $33.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. On November 1, 2024, the Company issued an additional 142,897, shares of Class A Common Stock as a result of the underwriters’ exercise of their 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 277,500 shares of its Class A Common Stock, resulting in net proceeds to the Company of approximately $2.9 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. \n\nShare information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is presented on an as adjusted basis giving effect to the Reclassification. \n\n35\n\n[Table of ](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[Con](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[t](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[e](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[n](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[t](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[s](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)\n\nNine Months ended September 30, 2024 Highlights \n\nHighlights of our results of operations and financial condition as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are provided below. \n\nFinancial Performance \n\n•Consolidated net income was $17.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $5.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Earnings per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $3.77, compared to $1.21 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.4\n\n•Net interest income, before provision for, or recapture of, credit losses, was $33.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $20.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net interest income, after provision for, or recapture of, credit losses was $33.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $19.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n•Return on average equity was 25.00% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 10.10% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Return on average assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.79%, compared to 0.72% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n•Yield on average earning assets was 3.77% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.05% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cost of funds decreased to 0.32% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 0.44% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nBalance Sheet\n\n•Total assets were $1.6 billion as of September 30, 2024, compared to $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2023. Total deposits were $1.4 billion as of September 30, 2024, compared to $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2023. Excluded from these totals are One-Way Sell® deposits, which were placed at other banks through the IntraFi Cash Service® (“ICS®”) network. These One-Way Sell® deposits amounted to $432.3 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $130.1 million as of December 31, 2023.\n\n•No non-performing assets or other real estate owned (“OREO”) were reported as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.\n\n•Cash balances held at the Federal Reserve were $627.0 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $309.8 million as of December 31, 2023.\n\n•As of September 30, 2024, the Bank’s total investment debt securities portfolio balance was $597.1 million, compared to $566.2 million as of December 31, 2023.\n\n•Book value per share was $22.95 as of September 30, 2024, compared to $18.26 as of December 31, 2023.\n\n•As of September 30, 2024, the Bank exceeded the minimum requirements to be well-capitalized for bank regulatory purposes, with a total risk-based capital ratio of 29.29% and a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 28.17%.\n\n•As of September 30, 2024, our liquidity ratio was 85.31%, compared to 78.75% as of December 31, 2023.\n\nSignificant Factors Impacting Our Business, Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nSeveral key factors impact our financial performance: \n\nShort-term interest rates: The cyclical nature of our balance sheet and our focus on liquidity cause our primary revenue source, net interest income, to be highly correlated to short-term interest rates. We strive to maintain high liquidity and low loan-to-deposit ratios. Higher rates generally increase our net interest income because of our high levels of liquid interest-earning assets and low levels of interest-bearing deposits and borrowings. Conversely, if short-term interest rates fall, our net interest income would likely decrease due to our high levels of cash. The Federal Reserve began reducing its target federal funds rate in September 2024, and as short-term rates decline, our net interest income will be adversely affected. This relationship between our revenue and the yield curve may differ from that of banks that have lower levels of cash and liquidity and higher loan-to-deposit ratios. \n\nPolitical organizations and federal election cycles: We provide deposit services to a wide range of political organizations, including political committees registered with the Federal Election Commission (“FEC”), such as campaign committees, party committees, and PACs and Super PACs, and other tax-exempt 527 organizations. These accounts are often associated with firms that provide treasury, legal or regulatory compliance services to political organizations. We estimate that at least a majority of our deposits were sourced from political organizations as of September 30, 2024. \n\n4 All earnings are attributed to Class B shares because no Class A shares were outstanding during the periods presented. \n\n36\n\n[Table of ](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[Con](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[t](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[e](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[n](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[t](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[s](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)\n\nFederal election cycles significantly affect our deposit levels. These cycles also impact revenue-generating activities, such as wire transfers, payments, check processing, debit card usage, and treasury management services. Historically, in the quarters leading up to federal elections, especially presidential elections, our deposits, net interest income, and noninterest income generally increase. In the quarters during and after a federal election, we usually experience an outflow of our political organization deposits, causing our balance sheet and revenue to decline until clients resume fundraising for the next election cycle. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank experienced elevated deposit levels ahead of the November 2024 presidential election, consistent with patterns observed in previous election cycles. \n\nBetween October 1, 2024, and November 12, 2024, deposits from political organizations declined. The Bank expects deposit outflows to continue through the end of the fourth quarter of 2024 and into early 2025. The deposit outflows observed between October 1, 2024, and November 12, 2024, occurred at levels consistent with patterns we have experienced during prior federal election cycles. SeeNote 5—Deposits in the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements contained within this Form 10-Q. However, future deposit levels and the timing of deposit fluctuations are difficult to predict and may differ from historical patterns. Our political organization clients are overwhelmingly affiliated with the Republican Party, and, as a result of the November 2024 federal elections, our clients’ post-election fundraising activities and deposit trajectories may be impacted. While we have previously provided banking services to certain key political organizations during election cycles, there is no assurance that we will be selected to provide such services in the future. Changes in deposit levels could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations, as discussed in the “Risk Factors” section in our Prospectus. To mitigate the risks associated with deposit seasonality, we aim to maintain a relatively high level of cash reserve deposits at the Federal Reserve. \n\nLending approach: Our lending policies are designed to manage credit risk. We seek borrowers with a strong capacity to repay, who have good financial habits, are generally debt averse, and prefer to repay loans quickly. We aim to mitigate credit risk on commercial loans with appropriate structuring, reasonably margined collateral, personal guarantees, a primary deposit relationship, and sometimes compensating balances. Our lending policies typically attract borrowers who may qualify for lower borrowing rates, which may result in lower yields for us. \n\nEconomic conditions: General economic conditions, including conditions in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, and government spending influence our deposit levels and earnings. As of September 30, 2024, we estimate that at least a majority of our deposit balances were sourced from political organizations, which we believe makes us less dependent on the broader economy. However, if the economy worsens, some political donors may contribute less, negatively impacting our deposit levels and income. In addition, a national or regional recession could increase the risk of loan defaults and negatively affect our municipal and corporate bonds, potentially leading to defaults. In particular, significant changes in government spending, particularly federal budget cuts, could adversely affect the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area economy and, consequently, our loan performance and deposit levels. Such changes may also impact the value of our investment securities portfolio, which includes U.S. government, municipal, and corporate bonds. Finally, rising inflation can increase our operational costs, including labor and technology expenses, while also potentially diminishing the purchasing power of our clients, further impacting our deposit and loan levels. \n\nMonetary Policy:We rely on the Federal Reserve’s payment of interest on reserve balances as a source of interest income. The rate of interest on reserve balances is determined by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has historically adjusted its interest on reserves rate in conjunction with the federal funds rate. Because this rate affects other money market yields, it can have a significant impact on our interest income. We are most exposed to monetary policy during federal election years such as in 2024 when campaign-related deposits rise and we match those liabilities with short-term assets such as Federal Reserve cash balances, which reprice immediately, and Treasury bills. Although higher interest rates decrease the value of our investment securities portfolio, they increase our interest income. While we have recently benefited from high short-term rates, the Federal Reserve began reducing its target federal funds rate in 2024. To the extent short-term rates decline, our net interest income will be adversely affected. The Federal Reserve has additional monetary tools that can impact our interest income through changes in rates, such as the overnight reverse repo rate and open market operations. \n\nRegulatory and Supervisory Environment:We incur significant costs due to our regulation and supervision by the federal government. As a bank holding company, we are subject to comprehensive supervision and regulatory oversight by the Federal Reserve. The Bank’s primary regulator and supervisor is the OCC, which through regular examinations oversees our operations, risk management, compliance, and corporate governance. The Bank is also subject to FDIC secondary regulatory oversight that focuses on insurance standards, risk management practices, and overall regulatory compliance. We pay assessments to the FDIC and the OCC for their insurance and supervision. In addition, we manage our balance sheet to meet regulatory standards, such as capital ratio requirements. Failure to meet these standards may result in corrective actions, restrictions, and increased scrutiny from federal regulators. By adhering to these requirements, we aim to maintain our financial health and strengthen our market position. See “Supervision and Regulation.” \n\n37\n\n[Table of ](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[Con](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[t](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[e](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[n](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[t](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[s](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)\n\nUninsured Deposits:Most of our deposits come from commercial clients rather than retail clients, resulting in a relatively high level of account balances exceeding the FDIC coverage limits. As of September 30, 2024, we estimate that approximately 81.4% of our total deposits were not insured by the FDIC. To manage the associated risks, we aim to maintain high levels of liquidity, asset quality, and financial strength. \n\nFor clients with uninsured balances, we offer access to additional FDIC insurance coverage by placing their deposits in increments within the insurance limits at other banks through the ICS® network. We typically earn fee income from ICS® for deposits that are placed at other banks as One-Way Sell® deposits, or we earn interest income when we choose to receive reciprocal deposits through ICS®.Using the ICS® program helps us to manage the size of our balance sheet. See “— Financial Condition — Deposits” below. \n\nPublicCompanyCosts: In preparation for, and following the completion of, our IPO, we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, additional costs associated with operating as a public company. We expect that these costs will include additional personnel, legal, consulting, regulatory, insurance, accounting, investor relations and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules adopted by the SEC and national securities exchanges, requires public companies to implement specified corporate governance practices that are now applicable to us as a public company. These additional rules and regulations will increase our legal, regulatory and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time consuming and costly. \n\nPrimary Factors Used to Evaluate Our Business \n\nThe most significant factors we use to evaluate our business and results of operations are net income, return on average equity, return on average assets and return on average risk-weighted assets. We also use net interest income, noninterest income and noninterest expense. \n\nNet Income. Our net income depends substantially on net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets (usually interest-bearing cash, investment securities and loans) and the interest expense incurred in connection with interest-bearing liabilities (usually interest-bearing deposits and borrowings). Our net income also depends on noninterest income, which is income generated other than by our interest-earning assets. Other factors that influence our net income include our provisions for credit losses, income taxes, and noninterest expenses, which include our fixed and variable overhead costs and other miscellaneous operating expenses. \n\nReturn on Average Equity. We use return on average equity to assess our effectiveness in utilizing stockholders’ equity to generate net income. In determining return on average equity for a given period, net income is divided by the average stockholders’ equity for that period. \n\nReturn on Average Assets. We monitor return on average assets to measure our operating performance and to determine how efficiently our assets are being used to generate net income. In determining return on average assets for a given period, net income is divided by the average total assets for that period. \n\nReturn on Average Risk-Weighted Assets. We use return on average risk-weighted assets to measure how efficiently our assets are being used to generate net income on a risk-adjusted basis. Return on average risk-weighted assets is calculated as annualized net income divided by the average of quarter end risk-weighted assets over the period observed.\n\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income, representing interest income less interest expense, is the largest component of our net income. The level of net interest income is primarily a function of the average balance of interest-earning assets, the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities and the spread between the realized yield on such assets and the cost of such liabilities. Net interest income is impacted by the relative mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and movements in market interest rates. Net interest income and net interest margin in any one period can be significantly affected by a variety of factors, including the mix and overall size of our earning assets portfolio and the cost of funding those assets. Management calculates the cost of funds performance indicator to monitor funding costs. Cost of funds is calculated as total interest expense divided by the sum of average total interest-bearing liabilities and average demand deposits. \n\nNoninterest Income. Noninterest income consists primarily of service charge income earned from deposit placement services, service charges on accounts, revenue from trust and wealth management services, gains on sale of mortgage loans, net gains or losses on sales of securities and other income. The Company records as noninterest income deposit placement services income for One-Way Sell® deposits which are sold into the ICS® network. See “— Financial Condition \n\n38\n\n[Table of ](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[Con](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[t](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[e](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[n](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[t](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[s](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)\n\n— Deposits” for more information on these deposits. Service charges on deposit accounts include fees earned from monthly service charges, account analysis charges and interchange fee income. It also includes fees charged for transaction activities such as wire transfers, cash letters and overdrafts. Trust and wealth management income represents monthly service charges due from clients for managing and administering clients’ assets. Services include investment management and advisory services, custody of assets, trust services, and financial planning. Other income primarily relates to rental income and other minor items. \n\nNoninterest Expense. Noninterest expense relates to fixed and variable overhead costs, the largest component of which is personnel expenses, including salaries and employee benefits. Certain expenses tend to vary based on the volume of activity and other factors, including data processing and communication expenses, occupancy, equipment expense, regulatory assessments and fees, marketing and business development costs, insurance expenses and other operating expenses. \n\nData processing and communication expenses primarily relate to expenses paid to third party providers of core processing, cloud computing and cybersecurity, a substantial component of which is paid to a core technology provider we rely on for the banking software used by our clients and back office functions. Professional services expenses include internal and external audit, legal, loan review, compliance audit and compliance monitoring fees. Occupancy and equipment expenses include depreciation for buildings and improvements, fixtures and furniture, equipment, and technology related items as well as building related expenses such as utilities and maintenance costs. The Commonwealth of Virginia levies a capital-based franchise tax on banks operating within the state, replacing the state income tax. FDIC and regulatory assessments represent costs incurred to cover quarterly or semi-annual payments to the FDIC or OCC for their insurance or supervision. FDIC assessments are based on a complicated matrix of factors to form an assessment rate, which is then applied to a base of quarterly average assets less quarterly tangible equity. Directors’ fees represent fees paid to our directors for board or committee meetings. Marketing and business development costs include sponsorships, membership dues, as well as marketing and advertising costs, which are subject to normal variability based on the volume and cost of sponsorship and business development activities. Insurance expenses include costs for coverage of fidelity bond, professional liability, property and casualty, workers compensation and cyber liability policies. Other operating costs include other operating and administrative costs such as other vendor and employee costs, postage and printing, office supplies, and subscriptions. \n\nAs discussed above, we expect our noninterest expenses to increase as a result of the additional costs associated with being a public company. \n\nPrimary Factors Used to Evaluate Our Financial Condition \n\nThe most significant factors we use to evaluate and manage our financial condition include liquidity, asset quality and capital. \n\nLiquidity. Maintaining an adequate level of liquidity depends on our ability to efficiently meet both expected and unexpected cash flows and collateral needs without adversely affecting our daily operations or the financial condition of the Bank. Because transaction account deposits form a primary source of our funding, and generally can be withdrawn on demand, managing our liquidity is a top priority. Our account at the Federal Reserve, which held $627.0 million as of September 30, 2024, is a primary source of our liquidity for daily and ongoing activities. \n\nAsset Quality. We monitor the quality of our assets based upon several factors, including the level and severity of deterioration in borrower cash flows and asset quality. We aim to adjust the allowance for credit losses to reflect loan volumes, identified credit and collateral conditions, economic conditions and other qualitative factors. \n\nCapital. We manage capital to comply with our internal planning targets and regulatory capital standards. We monitor capital levels on an ongoing basis, perform periodic evaluations under stress scenarios and project capital levels in connection with our strategic goals to ensure appropriate capital levels. We evaluate a number of capital ratios, including Tier 1 capital to total quarterly average assets (the leverage ratio) and total Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets. \n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \n\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements according to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”).

Earnings also benefited from a $1.9 million increase in noninterest income, derived primarily from fee income earned from One-Way Sell® deposit accounts. An increase of $2.6 million in noninterest expense, driven most notably by increases in employment and professional services costs, partially offset these positive earnings components. \n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net income increased by $11.7 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a $13.0 million, or 65.3%, increase in net interest income. Earnings also benefited from a $5.4 million increase in noninterest income, derived primarily from fee income earned from One-Way Sell® deposit accounts, and a $1.1 million reduction of the credit loss provision, primarily resulting from the partial recovery of a bond in the first quarter of 2024 that was charged off during the first quarter of 2023, and a recapture of the provision for bond credit losses as shorter maturity periods result in a lower credit risk rating. An increase of $4.7 million in noninterest expense, driven most notably by increases in employment and professional services costs associated with the stock Reclassification, partially offset these positive earnings components.\n\n40\n\n[Table of ](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[Con](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[t](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[e](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[n](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[t](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[s](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)\n\nNet Interest Income Analysis \n\nOur operating results depend primarily on our net interest income, which is calculated as the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities. Interest and dividend income consists of interest and fees on loans, interest and dividends on taxable and tax-exempt securities, and interest on interest-bearing deposits in banks. Interest expense consists of interest we pay on deposits and short-term borrowings. \n\nFor Three Months Ended, September 30, | For Nine Months Ended, September 30,  \n---|---  \n(dollars in thousands) | 2024 | 2023 | $Change | %Change | 2024 | 2023 | $Change | %Change  \nInterest and dividend income   \nInterest and fees on loans | $ | 3,445  | $ | 3,417  | $ | 28  | 0.8  | % | $ | 10,115  | $ | 10,124  | $ | (9) | (0.1  | %)  \nInterest and dividends on securities, taxable | 3,573  | 2,741  | 832  | 30.4  | % | 9,312  | 8,360  | 952  | 11.4  | %  \nInterest on securities, tax exempt | 284  | 304  | (20) | (6.6  | %) | 863  | 918  | (55) | (6.0  | %)  \nInterest on interest-bearing deposits in banks | 7,366  | 1,681  | 5,685  | 338.2  | % | 15,568  | 3,680  | 11,888  | 323.0  | %  \nTotal interest and dividend income | 14,668  | 8,143  | 6,525  | 80.1  | % | 35,858  | 23,082  | 12,776  | 55.4  | %  \nInterest expense  \nInterest on deposits | 813  | 861  | (48) | (5.6  | %) | 2,437  | 2,822  | (385) | (13.6  | %)  \nInterest on short-term borrowings | 209  | 96  | 113  | 117.7  | % | 409  | 284  | 125  | 44.0  | %  \nTotal interest expense | 1,022  | 957  | 65  | 6.8  | % | 2,846  | 3,106  | (260) | (8.4  | %)  \nNet interest income | $ | 13,646  | $ | 7,186  | $ | 6,460  | 89.9  | % | $ | 33,012  | $ | 19,976  | $ | 13,036  | 65.3  | %  \n  \n41\n\n[Table of ](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[Con](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[t](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[e](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[n](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[t](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[s](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)\n\nInterest income and expense are affected by fluctuations in interest rates, by changes in the volume of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and by the interaction of these rate and volume factors.

This increase was primarily due to cyclical inflows of deposits from political organizations ahead of the 2024 federal elections, which started building in the second half of 2023 and were invested in interest-earning assets, such as reserves at the Federal Reserve. As a result, our net interest margin increased to 3.73% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 2.78% for the three months ended September 30, 2023. \n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net interest income increased by $13.0 million, or 65.3%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by a $285.0 million increase in the average volume of interest-bearing deposits in other banks, principally at the Federal Reserve. This increase was primarily due to cyclical inflows of deposits from political organizations ahead of the 2024 federal elections, which started building in the second half of 2023 and were invested in interest-earning assets, such as reserves at the Federal Reserve. As a result, our net interest margin increased to 3.47% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 2.64% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. \n\nInterest Income\n\nInterest and fees on loans. Loan interest income is comprised of fixed and adjustable-rate structures related to residential and commercial real estate loan products, commercial loans and other consumer loan products. Deferred loan origination fees, net of deferred loan origination costs, accrete to the loan’s yield over the life of the loan. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our interest and fees on loans increased 0.8% to $3.4 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily driven by a 0.2% increase in average yield which was offset by a reduction of the average total loan balance of $11.4 million. The Company has strategically allowed a decline in the commercial real estate portfolio. Rising interest rates have increased the cost of borrowing and remote work trends continue to be a concern \n\n44\n\n[Table of ](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[Con](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[t](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[e](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[n](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[t](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[s](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)\n\nfor this portfolio. These factors negatively impact the value of commercial properties, making commercial real estate loans less attractive. \n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our interest and fees on loans decreased 0.1% to $10.1 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily driven by a 0.2% increase in average yield which was offset by a reduction of the average total loan balance of $14.5 million. The months following a general election, including the first nine months of 2023, often see elevated commercial and industrial loan balances, as political organizations typically utilize their lines of credit around election periods and may replay these balances over the subsequent six to twelve months, or as cash flows allow. In addition, rising interest rates caused a reduction in demand for consumer loans during the time between interim periods, and management has strategically allowed a decline in the commercial real estate portfolio. Rising interest rates have increased the cost of borrowing and remote work trends continue to be a concern for this portfolio. These factors negatively impact the value of commercial properties, making commercial real estate loans less attractive.\n\nSee “— Financial Condition — Loan Portfolio” below for an analysis of the composition of our loan portfolio. \n\nInterest and dividends on securities, taxable. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our interest and dividends on taxable securities increased 30.4% to $3.6 million from $2.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The average balance for all taxable securities increased $27.1 million when comparing the periods, and the yield improved 0.50%. As portions of maturing bonds have been reinvested, we have observed a steady increase in the average yield for the taxable securities portfolio. In addition to actively reinvesting maturing bonds during the second half of 2024, the Company invested funds from temporarily elevated deposit levels in short term U.S. Treasury bonds that will mature during the fourth quarter of 2024, which is intended to align with the timing of expected deposit outflows following the 2024 federal elections. \n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our interest and dividends on taxable securities increased 11.4% to $9.3 million from $8.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The average balance for all taxable securities decreased $8.0 million when comparing the periods, although the decline was fully offset by a 0.27% increase in yield. As portions of maturing bonds have been reinvested, we have observed a steady increase in the average yield for the taxable securities portfolio. \n\nInterest on securities, tax-exempt. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our interest on tax-exempt securities decreased 6.6% from the prior period due primarily to a $3.8 million decline in the average balance of tax-exempt securities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our interest on tax-exempt securities decreased 6.0% from the prior period due primarily to a $3.7 million decline in the average balance of tax-exempt securities. In recent years, the attainable yields for any new investment in this segment and the investment landscape have left tax-exempt securities less attractive than their taxable counterparts. Accordingly, as tax-exempt securities have matured, those proceeds have been invested into taxable municipal securities. \n\nSee “— Financial Condition — Securities” below for an analysis of the composition of the securities portfolio, including taxable and tax-exempt securities. \n\nInterest on interest-bearing deposits in banks. Chain Bridge earns interest for accounts held at certain correspondent banks, which are primarily reserves held at the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has historically adjusted its interest on reserves rate in conjunction with the federal funds rate. The interest rate paid by the Federal Reserve on reserve balances increased from 5.15% to 5.40% on July 27, 2023 and decreased from 5.40% to 4.90% on September 29, 2024. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our interest on interest-bearing deposits in banks increased by $5.7 million compared to the prior period, primarily driven by a $417.5 million increase in average balances. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our interest on interest-bearing deposits in banks increased by $11.9 million compared to the prior period, primarily driven by a $285.0 million increase in average balances, in addition to a 0.33% increase in the average yield for the period. \n\nInterest Expense\n\nInterest on deposits. The Bank pays a variable interest rate to depositors for their non-maturing savings, interest-bearing checking, and money market accounts. In addition, the Bank issues time deposits that pay a fixed rate of interest until the instrument matures. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our interest expense on deposits decreased 5.6% compared to the prior period. The decrease was primarily driven by a $64.7 million decrease in average interest-bearing deposit balances, partially offset by a 0.27% increase in the average rate. For the nine months ended September 30, \n\n45\n\n[Table of ](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[Con](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[t](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[e](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[n](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[t](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[s](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)\n\n2024, our interest expense on deposits decreased 13.6% compared to the prior period. The decrease was primarily driven by a $75.0 million decrease in average interest-bearing deposit balances, partially offset by a 0.16% increase in the average rate. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximately 87.2% and 69.0%, respectively, of our deposits were noninterest bearing. \n\nSee “— Financial Condition — Deposits” for an analysis of the composition of the deposits portfolio, including its interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing components. \n\nInterest on short-term borrowings. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an outstanding balance of $10.0 million on its $10.0 million unsecured line of credit with a correspondent bank. The interest rate applicable to advances under this unsecured line of credit is determined by the reference rate the Company elects to have applied to the advance, which may be the correspondent bank’s base rate, the daily Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) or a term SOFR rate, plus a credit spread adjustment. This line of credit is held by the Company, not the Bank. On October 10, 2024, the Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the IPO to fully repay the $10.0 million outstanding principal balance on this line of credit and closed the line on October 11, 2024. Substantially all interest on short-term borrowings is related to this line of credit. The Bank currently has no borrowings, and there are no outstanding draws on its lines of credit with the FHLB, the Federal Reserve, or other third-party institutions. \n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, interest on short-term borrowings increased by 117.7% compared to the prior period, primarily due to a $5.0 million increase in the average outstanding balance as well as an increase in the average rate from 7.62% to 8.31%. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest on short-term borrowings increased by 44.0% compared to the prior period, due to a $1.5 million increase in the average outstanding balance as well as an increase in the average rate from 7.27% to 8.09%. \n\nProvision for Credit Losses \n\nThe allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) represents an amount which, in management’s judgment, is adequate to absorb the lifetime expected credit losses that may be sustained on outstanding loans and investments at the balance sheet date. The provision for credit losses represents the amount of expense charged to current earnings to fund an increase in the ACL. Conversely, a recapture of credit loss is recorded to earnings when the ACL is reduced. Our provisions for or recaptures of credit losses arising from within the loan and securities portfolios were as follows: \n\nFor the three months ended September 30, | For the nine months ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n(dollars in thousands) | 2024 | 2023 | $Change | %Change | 2024 | 2023 | $Change | %Change  \nProvision for (recapture of) credit losses  \nProvision for (recapture of) loan credit losses | $ | (131) | $ | 1  | $ | (132) | NM | $ | (113) | $ | (82) | $ | (31) | 37.8  | %  \nProvision for (recapture of) securities credit losses | 13  | 6  | 7  | 116.7  | % | (297) | 804  | (1,101) | NM  \nTotal provision for (recapture of) credit losses | $ | (118) | $ | 7  | $ | (125) | (1785.7  | %) | $ | (410) | $ | 722  | $ | (1,132) | (156.8  | %)  \n  \n__________\n\nNM — Comparisons from positive to negative values or to zero values are considered not meaningful. \n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, our provision for credit losses consisted of a net recapture of $118 thousand, primarily attributable to the reduction in our loan portfolio, compared to a net provision of $7 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023. \n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our provision for credit losses consisted of a net recapture of $410 thousand, compared to a net provision of $722 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received proceeds totaling $210 thousand for a bond we wrote off in its entirety during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 related to a single corporate issuer whose business was ultimately closed by a regulatory authority. In addition, we recaptured provisions totaling $297 thousand because the shortening time to maturity of our held to maturity securities portfolio resulted in a lower required reserve in accordance with our ACL \n\n46\n\n[Table of ](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[Con](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[t](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[e](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[n](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[t](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[s](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)\n\nmethodology, compared to the $804 thousand provision for securities credit losses recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 which pertains to a single corporate bond discussed above. \n\nNoninterest Income \n\nNoninterest income consists of deposit placement services income, service charges on deposit accounts, trust and wealth management income, gains on sale of mortgage loans, net gains or losses on sales of securities and other income. \n\nThree months ended September 30, | Nine months ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n(dollars in thousands) | 2024 | 2023 | $Change | %Change | 2024 | 2023 | $Change | %Change  \nNoninterest income  \nDeposit placement services income | $ | 2,464  | $ | 859  | $ | 1,605  | 186.8  | % | $ | 5,617  | $ | 1,106  | $ | 4,511  | 407.9  | %  \nService charges on accounts | 376  | 227  | 149  | 65.6  | % | 1,008  | 651  | 357  | 54.8  | %  \nTrust and wealth management income | 243  | 149  | 94  | 63.1  | % | 669  | 407  | 262  | 64.4  | %  \nGain on sale of mortgage loans | 13  | —  | 13  | NM | 25  | —  | 25  | NM  \nLoss on sale of securities | (65) | (30) | (35) | 116.7  | % | (65) | (312) | 247  | (79.2  | %)  \nOther income | 49  | 16  | 33  | 206.3  | % | 104  | 89  | 15  | 16.9  | %  \nTotal noninterest income | $ | 3,080  | $ | 1,221  | $ | 1,859  | 152.3  | % | $ | 7,358  | $ | 1,941  | $ | 5,417  | 279.1  | %  \n  \n__________\n\nNM — Comparisons from positive to negative values or to zero values are considered not meaningful. \n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, our noninterest income increased by $1.9 million, or 152.3%, to $3.1 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily driven by an increase in deposit placement services income, which is fee income we earn on One-Way Sell® deposits sold through the ICS® network. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our noninterest income increased by $5.4 million, or 279.1%, to 7.4 million compared to the prior period primarily driven by an increase in fee income on One-Way Sell® deposits sold through the ICS® network, and partially offset by a loss on the sale of corporate bonds. \n\nDeposit placement services income. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our deposit placement services income increased by $1.6 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 on account of higher One-Way Sell® deposit balances. As of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, One-Way Sell® deposits totaled $432.3 million and $106.3 million, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, our average One-Way Sell® deposits were $491.3 million and $178.1 million, respectively. \n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our deposit placement services income increased by $4.5 million to $5.6 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During both comparative periods, the increase in deposit placement services income is a direct result of the increase in the volume of One-Way Sell® deposits, and changes in the rate paid by ICS® for those deposits which typically adjust in a manner parallel to federal funds rate adjustments. Accounts enrolled in the ICS® network are further discussed under “— Financial Condition — Deposits” below. \n\nService charges on accounts. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our service charges on accounts increased by $149 thousand, or 65.6%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily driven by higher transaction volume, particularly among check processing, wire transfers and debit card usage. Our fee income is typically higher during the fiscal quarters prior to and during the general election as political organization deposit account activity causes an increase in bank transactions. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our service charges on accounts increased 54.8% compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 also due to the higher transaction volume associated with an election year. \n\nTrust and wealth management income. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our trust and wealth management income increased by 63.1% and 64.4%, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. These increases were primarily due to a rise in the volume of total assets under administration, which grew to $384.0 million at September 30, 2024 from $185.8 million at September 30, 2023. The size and mix of the assets under administration drove the income growth. Assets under management, which produce a higher rate of income under our fee structure, increased 56.9% from September 30, 2023, while assets under custody increased 137.3% over the same period. \n\n47\n\n[Table of ](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[Con](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[t](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[e](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[n](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[t](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[s](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)\n\nOur trust and wealth management services utilize service charge structures for assets under management (“AUM”) and assets under custody (“AUC”) that are distinct with respect to the level and range of services used. Service charges for AUM are calculated as a percentage of the assets managed, with the rate varying based on the type of service provided, such as investment management or fiduciary services, and tiered based on the value of the assets under management. These service charges are not performance-based. Service charges for AUC are also tiered based on the value of the assets under custody, and are generally lower than the service charges for AUM, reflecting the more limited services provided, such as safekeeping and administrative functions. \n\nThe service charges we collect for AUM are subject to fluctuations in the total value of assets managed, which can vary with changes in market conditions, including stock prices and bond yields. Therefore, any significant market volatility or changes in interest rates could impact the valuation of the assets we manage, thereby affecting the service fees we collect. \n\nThe growth in AUC during the periods was largely driven by clients seeking higher interest rates. A material decline in interest rates could result in a reduction of custody balances, negatively impacting our revenue from these accounts. Additionally, a substantial portion of our custody account balances are related to political organizations, which are seasonal and are expected to decline following periods of high spending around federal elections. \n\nGain on sale of mortgage loans. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the gain on sale of mortgages increased by $13 thousand and $25 thousand compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, which had no gains from sales of mortgage loans because there was no sales activity during the 2023 period. \n\nLoss on sale of securities. Because Chain Bridge historically has not actively engaged in bond sales, gains and losses from sales of securities are irregular. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred $65 thousand in losses on sales of securities compared to a $30 thousand loss for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our loss on sale of securities was $65 thousand, compared to a $312 thousand loss for the nine months ended September 31, 2023. Sales for all periods in 2024 and 2023 were a result of decisions to divest of specific corporate issuers. \n\nNoninterest Expense \n\nNoninterest expense consists of salaries and employee benefits, data processing and communication expenses, professional services, occupancy and equipment expenses, Virginia bank franchise tax, FDIC and regulatory assessments, directors’ fees, marketing and business development costs, insurance expenses, and other operating expenses.\n\nThree Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n(dollars in thousands) | 2024 | 2023 | $Change | %Change | 2024 | 2023 | $Change | %Change  \nNoninterest expenses  \nSalaries and employee benefits | $ | 4,280  | $ | 3,116  | $ | 1,164  | 37.4  | % | $ | 11,553  | $ | 9,237  | $ | 2,316  | 25.1  | %  \nProfessional services | 1,206  | 207  | 999  | 482.6  | % | 2,154  | 623  | 1,531  | 245.7  | %  \nData processing and communication expenses | 669  | 570  | 99  | 17.4  | % | 1,928  | 1,683  | 245  | 14.6  | %  \nVirginia bank franchise tax | 253  | 188  | 65  | 34.6  | % | 604  | 695  | (91) | (13.1  | %)  \nOccupancy and equipment expenses | 236  | 232  | 4  | 1.7  | % | 748  | 564  | 184  | 32.6  | %  \nFDIC and regulatory assessments | 212  | 159  | 53  | 33.3  | % | 560  | 443  | 117  | 26.4  | %  \nDirectors fees | 191  | 100  | 91  | 91.0  | % | 523  | 286  | 237  | 82.9  | %  \nInsurance expenses | 61  | 54  | 7  | 13.0  | 181  | 166  | 15  | 9.0  | %  \nMarketing and business development costs | 47  | 48  | (1) | (2.1  | %) | 169  | 170  | (1) | (0.6  | %)  \nOther operating expenses | 277  | 207  | 70  | 33.8  | % | 758  | 574  | 184  | 32.1  | %  \nTotal noninterest expenses | $ | 7,432  | $ | 4,881  | $ | 2,551  | 52.3  | % | $ | 19,178  | $ | 14,441  | $ | 4,737  | 32.8  | %  \n  \nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, our noninterest expense increased by $2.6 million, or 52.3%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by increases in salaries and employee benefits and professional service expenses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our noninterest expense increased by \n\n48\n\n[Table of ](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[Con](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[t](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[e](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[n](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[t](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[s](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)\n\n$4.7 million, or 32.8%, compared to the prior year, primarily driven by increases in salaries and employee benefits costs, as well as an increase in professional services costs related to the process of becoming a public company and costs associated with the Reclassification. \n\nSalaries and employee benefits. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our salaries and employee benefits increased by $1.2 million, or 37.4%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, resulting from higher headcount and salary increases. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our salaries and employee benefits increased $2.3 million, or 25.1%, compared to the corresponding period in the prior year driven by salary increases and higher employee benefits plan costs. Deferred loan origination costs have the effect of reducing salaries expense during the period when a loan is originated. When loan origination volume declines, so too does the amount of deferred loan origination costs. \n\nProfessional services. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our professional services expense increased $999 thousand, or 482.6%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by legal and consulting expenses incurred in connection with the Reclassification and public company readiness. For similar reasons, our professional services expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased $1.5 million, or 245.7%. \n\nData processing and communication expenses. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our data processing and communication expenses increased $99 thousand, or 17.4%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, driven by higher data processing expenses charged by our core provider, the installation of a new financial reporting tool, and increased costs associated with enhanced information technology (“IT”) functionality. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our data processing and communication expenses increased $245 thousand, or 14.6%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by increased data processing fees charged by our core provider arising from periodic rate increases and purchases of new products, increased cloud computing and cybersecurity costs incurred with our IT-managed services provider, and an increase in core processing expenses incurred by the Trust & Wealth Department on account of growth in managed assets and custody accounts. \n\nVirginia bank franchise tax. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our Virginia bank franchise tax increased $65 thousand, or 34.6%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our Virginia bank franchise tax decreased 13.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the corresponding period in the prior year. The franchise tax expense is based on estimated accruals throughout the year, and the Bank's adjusted capital serves as the basis for tax to be paid. Changes to capital expectations, total asset at each quarter end, and other factors that offset the taxable base cause the expense to fluctuate slightly throughout a year. \n\nOccupancy and equipment expenses. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our occupancy and equipment expenses remained steady compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our occupancy and equipment expenses increased $184 thousand, or 32.6%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by building maintenance costs. \n\nFDIC and regulatory assessments. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our FDIC and regulatory assessments expense increased $53 thousand, or 33.3%, due to the growth in the Bank’s assets between the comparative periods. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our FDIC and regulatory assessments increased $117 thousand, or 26.4%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by high year-over-year asset growth and a declining leverage ratio compared to 2023, a non-election year. \n\nDirectors’ fees. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our directors’ fees increased by $91 thousand and $237 thousand, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by an increase in the number of board and committee meetings and training for newly appointed members. \n\nInsurance expenses. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our insurance expenses were relatively unchanged, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. \n\nMarketing and business development costs. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our marketing and business development costs were relatively unchanged, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nOther operating costs. This segment includes other operating and administrative costs such as other vendor and employee costs, postage and printing, office supplies and subscriptions. None of the components or fluctuations are \n\n49\n\n[Table of ](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[Con](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[t](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[e](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[n](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[t](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[s](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)\n\nindividually significant, and the increase in our other operating costs during both periods were driven primarily by increased administrative costs. \n\nIncome Tax Expense \n\nIncome tax expense incurred is based upon our pre-tax income adjusted for tax exempt income and temporary deferred tax assets or liabilities. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our income tax expense was $1.9 million, representing an increase of 184.8%, compared to $676 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was driven by the increase in pre-tax earnings, which increased 167.5% during the comparable period. \n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our income tax expense was $4.4 million, representing an increase of 255.1%, compared to $1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was driven by the increase in pre-tax earnings, which increased 219.7% during the comparable period.\n\nOur effective income tax rate was 20.45% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 1.24% from 19.21% for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our effective income tax rate was 20.35% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 2.03% from 18.32% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During 2024, the effective income tax rate increased compared to the corresponding prior period because pre-tax income increased while tax-exempt income decreased, causing tax-exempt income to comprise a lower proportion of income before taxes. \n\nFinancial Condition \n\nSecurities \n\nOur securities portfolio is used to provide liquidity, manage risk, meet capital requirements, and generate interest income. Our securities portfolio consists of U.S. government and federal agencies, mortgage backed securities, corporate bonds, and state and municipal securities. Securities that management has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as “held to maturity” (“HTM”) and recorded at amortized cost. Securities not classified as held to maturity or trading are classified as “available for sale” (“AFS”) and recorded at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive loss. We do not hold trading securities. \n\n50\n\n[Table of ](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[Con](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[t](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[e](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[n](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[t](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[s](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)\n\nThe following table summarizes the amortized cost and weighted average yield of securities as of September 30, 2024 by contractual maturities. \n\nBalance as of September 30, 2024  \n---  \nAvailable-for-Sale | Held-to-Maturity  \n(dollars in thousands) | AmortizedCost | WeightedAverageYield | AmortizedCost | WeightedAverageYield  \nU.S. government and federal agencies  \nDue in one year or less | $ | 111,707  | 3.82  | % | $ | 6,964  | 1.79  | %  \nDue after one year through five years | 14,467  | 2.09  | % | 85,492  | 1.79  | %  \nDue after five years through ten years | 4,915  | 1.32  | % | 27,429  | 1.77  | %  \nDue after ten years | —  | —  | 2,562  | 1.77  | %  \n131,089  | 3.54  | % | 122,447  | 1.79  | %  \nMortgage backed securities  \nDue in one year or less | 1,300  | 2.09  | % | —  | —   \nDue after one year through five years | 2,934  | 2.09  | % | —  | —   \nDue after five through ten years | —  | —  | —  | —   \nDue after ten years | 4,424  | 2.94  | % | 1,173  | 4.62  | %  \n8,658  | 2.53  | % | 1,173  | 4.62  | %  \nCorporate bonds  \nDue in one year or less | 29,500  | 3.42  | % | 6,898  | 2.19  | %  \nDue after one year through five years | 23,287  | 3.10  | % | 51,004  | 2.61  | %  \nDue after five years through ten years | —  | —  | 507  | 2.83  | %  \nDue after ten years | 496  | 7.49  | % | —  | —   \n53,283  | 3.32  | % | 58,409  | 2.56  | %  \nState and municipal securities  \nDue in one year or less | 24,086  | 3.01  | % | 3,011  | 3.00  | %  \nDue after one year through five years | 57,703  | 2.58  | % | 52,593  | 2.24  | %  \nDue after five years through ten years | 25,035  | 2.04  | % | 64,393  | 2.29  | %  \nDue after ten years | 499  | 3.75  | % | 583  | 2.59  | %  \n107,323  | 2.56  | % | 120,580  | 2.29  | %  \nTotal securities | $ | 300,353  | 3.12  | % | $ | 302,609  | 2.15  | %  \n  \nThe weighted average yield is calculated using the amortized cost and yield on each security.

As of September 30, 2024, our total debt securities were $597.4 million excluding the allowance for credit loss, representing an increase of $30.8 million, or 5.4%, compared to $566.5 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by investments of excess cash into U.S. government treasuries maturing in the fourth quarter of 2024, as well as a decrease in unrealized losses within the available for sale securities portfolio. \n\nU.S. government treasuries. U.S. government treasuries represent debt securities backed by the U.S. Treasury or the full faith and credit of the U.S. government and are guaranteed as to the timely payment of interest and principal when held to maturity. As of September 30, 2024, our U.S. government treasuries increased by $47.0 million, or 24.0%, compared to December 31, 2023. During 2024, we invested a portion of our excess cash reserves in short term U.S. Treasury securities that mature around the federal elections in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nU.S. federal agencies securities. U.S. federal agencies securities represent obligations issued by U.S. federal government agencies or government-sponsored enterprises that guarantee repayment of principal at maturity. As of September 30, 2024, our U.S. federal agencies securities decreased by $11.0 million, or 52.7%, compared to December 31, 2023. U.S. federal agency bonds were called or matured during 2024, and not replaced with like investments. \n\nMortgage backed securities. Our mortgage backed securities portfolio consists of pass through and agency-issued collateralized mortgage obligations. As of September 30, 2024, our mortgage backed securities decreased by $437 thousand, or 4.4%, compared to December 31, 2023. During the period, mortgage backed securities represented less than 2.0% of our securities portfolio. \n\nCorporate bonds. Corporate bonds are debt obligations issued by companies to raise capital and refinance obligations of the issuer. As of September 30, 2024, our corporate bonds decreased by $4.1 million, or 3.6%, compared to December 31, 2023, due to maturities within the portfolio which have not been subsequently replaced with similar investments. \n\nState and municipal securities. State and municipal securities are debt obligations issued by state and local governments. As of September 30, 2024, our state and municipal securities remained unchanged compared to December 31, 2023 declining by only 0.2%. \n\nAllowance for Credit Losses — Securities \n\nManagement measures expected credit losses on HTM debt securities on a collective basis by major security type (U.S. government and federal agencies, agency mortgage backed securities, corporate bonds and state and municipal securities). We estimate expected credit losses based on our historical credit loss information as adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Securities issued by the U.S. Treasury or government agencies are not considered to be credit sensitive as they are explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government, and result in expectations of zero credit loss. Accordingly, management’s analysis of credit loss considers only the corporate and municipal segments. Accrued interest receivable on HTM debt securities totaled $1.9 million as of September 30, 2024 and as of December 31, 2023 and is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. \n\nFor AFS debt securities in an unrealized loss position, management first assesses whether it intends to sell, or if it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the \n\n52\n\n[Table of ](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[Con](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[t](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[e](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[n](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[t](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[s](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)\n\ncriteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security’s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. For AFS debt securities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, management evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, management considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists, and an allowance for credit loss is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount by which the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit loss is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). \n\nThe following table presents an analysis of the allowance for credit losses on securities: \n\nHeld to Maturity: | As of and for the threemonths endedSeptember 30, | As of and for the ninemonths endedSeptember 30,  \n---|---|---  \n(dollars in thousands) | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \nAverage HTM debt securities outstanding | $ | 305,564  | $ | 311,302  | $ | 307,389  | $ | 311,734   \nTotal outstanding HTM debt securities at end of each period | 302,609  | 311,251  | 302,609  | 311,251   \nAllowance for credit losses at the beginning of period | 248  | 342  | 348  | —   \nImpact of adopting ASC 326 | —  | —  | —  | 329   \nProvision for (recapture of) for credit losses | 13  | 6  | (87) | 19   \nTotal charge-offs | —  | —  | —  | —   \nTotal recoveries | —  | —  | —  | —   \nNet (charge-offs) recoveries | —  | —  | —  | —   \nAllowance for credit losses at end of period | 261  | 348  | 261  | 348   \nRatio of allowance to total HTM debt securities outstanding at period end | 0.09  | % | 0.11  | % | 0.09  | % | 0.11  | %  \nRatio of nonaccrual HTM securities to total HTM securities outstanding at period end | —  | —  | —  | —   \nRatio of allowance to nonaccrual debt securities at period end | —  | —  | —  | —   \n  \n53\n\n[Table of ](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[Con](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[t](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[e](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[n](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[t](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[s](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)\n\nAvailable-for-Sale: | As of and for the threemonths endedSeptember 30, | As of and for the ninemonths endedSeptember 30,  \n---|---|---  \n(dollars in thousands) | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \nAverage AFS debt securities outstanding | $ | 295,789  | $ | 260,772  | $ | 268,289  | $ | 271,151   \nTotal outstanding AFS debt securities at end of each period | 294,754  | 254,908  | 294,754  | 254,908   \nAllowance for credit losses at the beginning of period | —  | —  | —  | —   \nProvision for (recapture of) for credit losses | —  | —  | (210) | 785   \nCharge-offs:  \nCorporate | —  | —  | —  | (785)  \nTotal charge-offs | —  | —  | —  | (785)  \nRecoveries:  \nCorporate | —  | —  | 210  | —   \nTotal recoveries | —  | —  | 210  | —   \nNet (charge-offs) recoveries | —  | —  | 210  | (785)  \nAllowance for credit losses at end of period | —  | —  | —  | —   \nRatio of allowance to total AFS debt securities outstanding at period end | —  | % | —  | % | —  | % | —  | %  \nRatio of nonaccrual AFS securities to total AFS securities outstanding at period end | —  | —  | —  | —   \nRatio of allowance to nonaccrual debt securities at period end | —  | —  | —  | —   \n  \nIn 2023, we recorded a charge-off related to a credit loss on a specific bond due to regulatory actions against the issuer.

A substantial portion of our loan portfolio is primarily represented by residential real estate and commercial real estate loans throughout the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. The ability of our debtors to honor their contracts is dependent upon a number of factors, including the real estate and general economic conditions in this area. \n\nThe following table summarizes our loan portfolio by the type of loans as of the dates indicated: \n\nAs of September 30, | As of December 31,  \n---|---  \n2024 | 2023 | Change  \n(dollars in thousands) | Amount | % ofTotalLoans | Amount | % ofTotalLoans | $ | %  \nCommercial real estate | $ | 51,387  | 17.1  | % | $ | 60,138  | 19.8  | % | $ | (8,751) | (14.6  | %)  \nCommercial | 11,144  | 3.7  | % | 12,438  | 4.1  | % | (1,294) | (10.4  | %)  \nResidential real estate, closed-end | 218,129  | 72.7  | % | 210,358  | 69.1  | % | 7,771  | 3.7  | %  \nOther consumer loans | 19,372  | 6.5  | % | 21,210  | 7.0  | % | (1,838) | (8.7  | %)  \nTotal | $ | 300,032  | 100.0  | % | $ | 304,144  | 100.0  | % | $ | (4,112) | (1.4  | %)  \n  \nAs of September 30, 2024, our total loans decreased by $4.1 million or 1.4%, compared to December 31, 2023. The decrease reflects the strategic reduction in our commercial real estate lending to reduce our exposure to this sector, which was partially offset by growing consumer demand for residential mortgages as interest rates decreased. \n\nResidential real estate loans, closed-end. Single family (1-4 units) residential mortgage loans are primarily secured by owner-occupied primary and secondary residences and are “closed-end” mortgage loans, which means that the loan amount is fixed at the outset and repaid over a set term without the ability to re-borrow. As of September 30, 2024, our residential real estate loans increased by $7.8 million, or 3.7%, compared to December 31, 2023 reflecting tempered demand by consumers and a lower prepayment level amid elevated interest rates. \n\n55\n\n[Table of ](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[Con](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[t](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[e](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[n](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[t](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[s](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)\n\nCommercial real estate loans. Commercial real estate loans are generally long-term loans secured by a commercial property that is either owner-occupied or investor owned. This category also includes commercial construction loans and multifamily residential property loans. Management has strategically allowed a decline in the commercial real estate portfolio. Rising interest rates have increased the cost of borrowing and remote work trends continue to be a concern. These factors negatively impact the value of commercial properties, making commercial real estate loans less attractive. As of September 30, 2024, our commercial real estate loans decreased by $8.8 million, or 14.6%, compared to December 31, 2023. \n\nAs of September 30, 2024, our commercial real estate portfolio included owner-occupied and non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans and were concentrated in certain sectors and in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area:\n\n•Owner-Occupied vs. Non-Owner-Occupied Properties: Our commercial real estate loans include both owner-occupied and non-owner-occupied properties. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had $15.0 million and $16.2 million, respectively, in owner-occupied loans and $32.7 million and $35.5 million, respectively, in non-owner-occupied loans. Non-owner-occupied properties depend on rental income for repayment. Factors such as market conditions, tenant defaults, and vacancies could reduce cash flow from these properties, leading to increased delinquencies and potential losses.\n\n•Sector Concentration: Our commercial real estate loan portfolio is concentrated in the office, retail, multifamily, and hotels sectors. As of September 30, 2024, our non-owner-occupied office loans totaled $6.6 million, retail loans totaled $13.0 million, multifamily loans totaled $4.9 million, and hotel loans totaled $4.0 million. \n\n•Geographic Concentration: Our commercial real estate loan portfolio is concentrated in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. This exposes us to risks tied to local economic conditions, property market trends, and regulatory changes. See “Risk Factors — Other Risks Related to Our Business — The geographic concentration of our business in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area makes our business highly susceptible to local economic conditions and reductions or changes in government spending,” in our Prospectus.\n\nCommercial. Commercial loans are commercial and industrial (C&I) term loans or lines of credit and, due to the participation of political organizations in this segment, exhibit cyclicality when measured as a percentage of our loan portfolio. C&I loans include unsecured or UCC secured lending, accounts receivable, inventory or equipment financing loans or working capital loans. As of September 30, 2024, our commercial loans decreased by $1.3 million, or 10.4%, compared to December 31, 2023. \n\nOther consumer loans. Other consumer loans include residential construction loans, revolving loans secured by residential properties, commonly known as home equity lines of credit (“HELOCs”), and loans made directly to individuals for non-business purposes which may be secured or unsecured. As of September 30, 2024, other consumer loans decreased by $1.8 million, or 8.7%, from December 31, 2023. The following table presents the components of other consumer loans: \n\nAs ofSeptember 30, | As ofDecember 31,  \n---|---  \n(dollars in thousands) | 2024 | 2023  \nResidential construction loans | $ | 1,497  | $ | 3,445   \nHELOCs | 14,461  | 14,664   \nConsumer secured | 2,758  | 2,527   \nConsumer unsecured | 656  | 574   \nTotal consumer loans | $ | 19,372  | $ | 21,210   \n  \nLoan Maturity and Sensitivity to Interest Rates \n\nThe information in the following table is based on the contractual maturities of individual loans, including loans that may be subject to renewal at their contractual maturity. Renewal of these loans is subject to review and credit approval, as well as modification of terms upon maturity. Actual repayments of the loans may differ from the maturities reflected below because consumer borrowers and some commercial borrowers have the right to prepay obligations with or without prepayment penalties. As of September 30, 2024, variable rate loans, which include floating and adjustable rate structures, comprised 69.4% of our loan portfolio. Our variable rate loans primarily consist of adjustable residential real estate loans with initial fixed-rate periods of three, five, seven or ten years, which, depending on the loan program, reprice every one, three, or five years after the initial fixed-rate period. Variable rate loans provide a better match against our deposit liabilities and reduce our interest rate risk. \n\n56\n\n[Table of ](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[Con](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[t](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[e](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[n](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[t](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[s](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)\n\nThe following table details maturities and sensitivity to interest rate changes for our loan portfolio as of September 30, 2024, and the contractual maturity and interest-rate profile of our loan portfolio: \n\nAt September 30, 2024 | Remaining Contractual Maturity Held for Investment  \n---|---  \n(dollars in thousands) | One year orless | After oneyearthrough fiveyears | After fiveyears andthroughfifteen years | After fifteenyears | Total  \nFixed rate loans:  \nCommercial real estate | $ | 7  | $ | 18,310  | $ | 23,915  | $ | —  | $ | 42,232   \nCommercial | 103  | 281  | 1,199  | —  | 1,583   \nResidential real estate, closed-end | 264  | 1,050  | 36,247  | 7,961  | 45,522   \nOther consumer loans | 469  | 2,049  | —  | —  | 2,518   \nTotal fixed rate loans | $ | 843  | $ | 21,690  | $ | 61,361  | $ | 7,961  | $ | 91,855   \nVariable rate loans:  \nCommercial real estate | $ | —  | $ | 2,867  | $ | 5,722  | $ | 566  | $ | 9,155   \nCommercial | 8,761  | —  | 500  | 300  | 9,561   \nResidential real estate, closed-end | —  | 2,179  | 2,726  | 167,702  | 172,607   \nOther consumer loans | 3,046  | 5,316  | 7,153  | 1,339  | 16,854   \nTotal variable rate loans | $ | 11,807  | $ | 10,362  | $ | 16,101  | $ | 169,907  | $ | 208,177   \nTotal loans | $ | 12,650  | $ | 32,052  | $ | 77,462  | $ | 177,868  | $ | 300,032   \n  \nCredit Policies and Procedures \n\nManagement employs a multi-pronged approach to address credit risk, guided by a defined risk appetite. The approach includes underwriting policies, loan risk classification grading, and an internal and external loan review process. In addition, it involves strategic portfolio management to address loan concentration and oversight by our Board. These policies and guidelines are designed with the intention of maintaining the quality of our loan portfolio while aiming to generate a return commensurate with the associated risks. However, it is important to recognize that all risk management strategies have inherent limitations. \n\nThe commercial underwriting process involves an evaluation of the borrower’s ability to repay, the quality of the available collateral (if applicable), the financial character of the borrower and the nature of the credit. It also includes an analysis of the borrower’s needs and an industry analysis to understand relevant external factors that might affect the borrower’s financial stability and repayment capacity. Commercial borrowers are often asked to maintain their primary banking relationship with the Bank to attract both loans and transaction deposits. Residential mortgage loans and consumer loans are underwritten based on an evaluation of the borrower’s repayment ability, which typically includes a review of documentation to verify income and assets. Consumers are encouraged to maintain deposit accounts with the Bank, and pricing incentives may be offered. \n\nDuring the underwriting process, loans are assigned a loan risk classification grade. The risk rating scale is intended to provide a framework for analyzing risk across various credit exposures, regardless of their nature, type or location. \n\nThe internal loan review process, performed by our credit administration staff, aims to verify that basic requirements for loan origination have been met. Ongoing internal loan review processes monitor commercial borrower performance using a risk-based approach, which may result in grade confirmations or change recommendations. Certain scenarios such as delinquent payments, overdue taxes, overdrafts, lack of borrower cooperation, delayed financial statements, or significant changes to the borrower’s financial position may be considered potential indicators of problem loans. In such cases, the loan risk classification may be re-evaluated.\n\nAn external loan review is conducted annually by a third-party firm. This review examines a sample of the loan portfolio, focusing on areas such as underwriting practices, adherence to loan policies and banking regulations, loan documentation, watch list, and portfolio concentration. \n\n57\n\n[Table of ](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[Con](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[t](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[e](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[n](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[t](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[s](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)\n\nCredit concentration policies are designed to address risk relative to our regulatory capital. Concentration limits are established for various categories including loans to individual borrowers or industries, specific loan types, collateral types, commercial real estate concentrations, and total real estate loans, among others. \n\nWe have exposures to certain categories of loans that we believe represent relatively higher credit risk, such as commercial real estate loans. To manage our exposures to these loans, our policy is to require low loan-to-value ratios and high debt service coverage ratios, and to conduct borrower credit assessments. To manage our exposure to commercial real estate, we have set specific concentration limits for commercial real estate loans by property type, and our policy is to monitor these limits quarterly. Our risk management practices include annual internal reviews of commercial mortgages with balances over $500 thousand, focusing on early warning signs like payment delinquencies, property performance, and borrower financial condition. We also engage a third party to conduct an external loan review audit of the entire loan portfolio annually. Additionally, we perform quarterly stress tests on our loan portfolio, including the commercial real estate segment, to assess the potential impact of adverse economic conditions. In response to the inherent risks in higher-risk segments like commercial real estate, we may increase our loan loss reserves to mitigate potential losses due to changing market conditions. \n\nAsset Quality \n\nWe seek to maintain a prudent lending approach, which has historically been associated with our asset quality performance. Our loan underwriters employ underwriting guidelines, and we assign a loan risk classification grade at origination. These practices are designed to help us evaluate potential risks throughout the life of the loan. The Bank’s risk classification system utilizes a 10-grade risk-rating scale. The four lowest grade categories (7-10) correspond to the regulatory categories special mention, substandard, doubtful and loss. \n\nThe risk classification grade is a key component of our risk management process. Certain grades may result in a loan being added to the watch list report, which is a tool used in monitoring loans or commitments that may present elevated risks. This report is overseen by our Chief Credit Officer and presented to the Board monthly. Loan officers are responsible for managing credit risk within their loan portfolios and are encouraged to be proactive in considering whether to add a loan to the watch list report. \n\nManagement uses internal and external review processes, as described under “— Credit Policies and Procedures,” to monitor adherence to loan and credit policies, evaluate the loan portfolio, and identify areas that may require additional attention. \n\nNon-performing Assets \n\nAn asset is classified as non-performing when it ceases to yield interest or principal repayments for a specified period, usually 90 days or more. This classification includes loans that are 90 days or more past due on scheduled payments, or assets where full repayment of principal and interest is in doubt due to the borrower’s financial difficulties. Additionally, assets that have been restructured due to the borrower’s financial difficulties may also be classified as non-performing if the restructuring does not restore the asset to a performing status. \n\nA loan is considered non-performing when the borrower is 90 days or more past due on the scheduled payment of principal and interest, or if the loan’s terms have been restricted due to the borrower’s financial difficulties. Additionally, a loan may be classified as non-performing even if it is less than 90 days past due if there is a reasonable doubt about the collectability of the loan’s principal or interest. \n\nLoans are generally considered delinquent when the required principal and interest payments have not been received by the assigned due date. Loans are typically placed on non-accrual status when a loan becomes 90 days delinquent, unless the credit is well-secured and in the process of collection. Management may, at its discretion, place loans on non-accrual status prior to 90 days delinquency if it determines that interest may be uncollectible. Loans determined to be non-performing or potentially uncollectible may be placed in non-accrual status pending further collection efforts or charged off if collection of principal or interest is deemed doubtful. \n\nFor loans placed in non-accrual status, all interest previously accrued but not collected is generally reversed against interest income. The interest on loans in non-accrual status is typically accounted for on the cash basis or cost recovery method until qualifying for return to accrual. Loans may be returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured. \n\n58\n\n[Table of ](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[Con](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[t](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[e](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[n](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[t](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[s](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)\n\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, based on our internal classifications, we did not identify any assets that met our criteria for classification as non-performing assets or OREO. \n\nAllowance for Credit Losses — Loans \n\nThe ACL represents an amount that is intended to absorb the lifetime expected credit losses that may be sustained on outstanding loans at the balance sheet date. Additional information regarding the ACL evaluation can be found in Note 1 and Note 3 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the notes thereto included elsewhere in our Prospectus. \n\nThe estimate for expected credit losses is based on an evaluation of the various factors, including, but not limited to, size and current risk characteristics of the loan portfolio, past events, current conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions, and prepayment experience as related to credit contractual term information. The ACL is generally measured on a collective (pool) basis when similar risk characteristics exist and is typically recorded upon the initial recognition of a financial asset. \n\nThe ACL may be adjusted by charge-offs, net of recoveries of previous losses, and may be increased or decreased by a provision for or recapture of credit losses, which is recorded in the consolidated statements of income. Management estimates the allowance balance using various information sources, both internal and external, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience typically provides a basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss information may be made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics and changes in environmental conditions. Expected credit losses are typically estimated over the contractual term of the loans, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. The contractual term generally excludes expected extensions, renewals, and modifications. \n\nFor loans that do not share risk characteristics with a pool of other loans, expected credit losses are measured on an individual loan basis. Management individually evaluates the expected credit loss for certain loans, such as those that are collateral-dependent, are graded substandard or doubtful, or are identified as having risk characteristics dissimilar to those of the established loan pools. \n\nFor loans considered collateral-dependent, the Company has adopted a practical expedient to the ACL, which allows for recording an ACL based on the fair value of the collateral rather than by estimating expected losses over the life of the loan. \n\nWhile the ACL on loans follows these guidelines, and management believes the allowance is appropriate based on current information, the judgmental nature of the calculation could lead to fluctuations due to ongoing evaluations of the loan portfolio. These evaluations may be influenced by economic conditions in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, changes in asset quality, or loan portfolio growth, among other factors, which could potentially require additional provisions for the allowance for credit losses. \n\nThe quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance are subject to review by our internal and external auditors as well as our regulators. \n\n59\n\n[Table of ](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[Con](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[t](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[e](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[n](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[t](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[s](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)\n\nThe following table presents an analysis of the allowance for credit losses: \n\nAs of and for the ThreeMonths EndedSeptember 30, | As of and for the NineMonths EndedSeptember 30,  \n---|---  \n(dollars in thousands) | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \nAverage loans outstanding | $ | 302,547  | $ | 317,117  | $ | 302,547  | $ | 317,117   \nTotal loans outstanding at end of each period | 300,032  | 310,514  | 300,032  | 310,514   \nAllowance for credit losses at the beginning of period | 4,337  | 4,399  | 4,319  | 4,482   \nProvision for (recapture of) credit losses | (131) | 1  | (113) | (82)  \nCharge-offs | —  | —  | —  | —   \nRecoveries | —  | —  | —  | —   \nAllowance for credit losses at end of period | 4,206  | 4,400  | 4,206  | 4,400   \nRatio of allowance to total loans outstanding at period end | 1.40  | % | 1.42  | % | 1.40  | % | 1.42  | %  \nRatio of nonaccrual loans to total loans outstanding at period end | —  | —  | —  | —   \nRatio of allowance to nonaccrual loans at period end | —  | —  | —  | —   \n  \nThe following table presents the allocation of the allowance for credit losses: \n\nAs of September 30, | As of December 31,  \n---|---  \n2024 | 2023  \n(dollars in thousands) | Amount | % oftotalloans | Amount | % oftotalloans  \nCommercial real estate | $ | 1,022  | 0.34  | % | $ | 1,233  | 0.41  | %  \nCommercial non-real estate | 164  | 0.05  | % | 189  | 0.06  | %  \nResidential real estate | 2,774  | 0.92  | % | 2,668  | 0.88  | %  \nOther consumer loans | 246  | 0.08  | % | 229  | 0.08  | %  \nTotal | $ | 4,206  | 1.40  | % | $ | 4,319  | 1.42  | %  \n  \nThe allocations of the allowance between loan segments did not vary significantly during the periods presented. However, we note a modest migration of applied allowances from the commercial segment as of December 31, 2023 to the residential real estate segment as of September 30, 2024 caused by growth in the consumer residential segment contrasted to an overall balance decline in the commercial segment. \n\nThere were no loan charge-offs for the interim period ended September 30, 2024 or the year ended December 31, 2023. As a result, the ratio of loan charge-offs to average loans outstanding is 0.00% for all reported periods. \n\nDeposits\n\nWe provide a wide range of commercial and personal deposit services. The deposit products we offer include noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing checking accounts, savings accounts, and money market accounts. We aim to attract transaction account deposits, particularly from commercial clients. Our deposit base is largely composed of funds from commercial entities, specifically federal political organizations, trade associations, non-profit organizations and business enterprises. As of September 30, 2024, we estimate that at least a majority of our deposit balances were sourced from political organizations. Deposits from political organizations generally exhibit more seasonality than typical commercial or consumer deposits as federal election cycles often influence deposit levels of political organizations. \n\nWe are a member of the IntraFi® Cash Services network, which allows our deposit clients to enroll in the ICS® program. This program is designed to provide our clients with access to FDIC insurance beyond the standard maximum deposit insurance amount at a single insured depository institution. For accounts enrolled in this service, we select whether each account should be in a reciprocal position or a one-way sell position. A reciprocal position means that we receive an equal amount of network deposits for our enrolled accounts, and those deposits are reflected on our balance sheet. If we \n\n60\n\n[Table of ](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[Con](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[t](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[e](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[n](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[t](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[s](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)\n\nelect to receive reciprocal deposits, we are required to pay a fee to IntraFi® equal to our reciprocal deposits balances multiplied by an annualized rate of 0.125% as of September 30, 2024. Conversely, we do not receive reciprocal network funding when accounts are positioned as One-Way Sell®, and therefore the deposits are not reported on the balance sheet. For deposits placed at other participating banks as One-Way Sell® deposits, we receive deposit placement services income, which is inversely related to the interest rate on the deposit account, meaning that we receive less deposit placement services income for placing deposits with a higher interest rate. \n\nDuring periods of increased political organization deposits, which typically occur in connection with election cycles, we may adjust the positioning of certain accounts enrolled in the ICS® program. These adjustments can include changing some accounts from a reciprocal position to a One-Way Sell® position, which affects whether and how these deposits are reflected on our balance sheet. These adjustments are part of our overall asset and liability management strategy, which aims to maintain appropriate balance sheet metrics in accordance with regulatory guidelines and our risk management policies. As of September 30, 2024, our balance sheet reflected no reciprocal ICS® deposits. Excess deposits totaling $432.3 million as of September 30, 2024 were placed at other participating banks as One-Way Sell® deposits. Our deposit placement services income was $2.5 million and $5.6 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. If we were to convert some or all of these deposits into reciprocal deposits, bringing them back onto our balance sheet, we would expect to receive interest income by investing these deposits, but our deposit placement services income would decline and our interest on deposits, FDIC and regulatory assessments and the fee we pay to IntraFi® would increase. \n\nOur participation in the ICS® network is subject to certain terms and conditions, and there can be no assurances that we will be able to participate in the ICS® network in the future. As of September 30, 2024, the terms and conditions for participation in the ICS® network include a $265.0 million limit on the amount of each participating client’s ICS® deposits that may be placed at other banks within the ICS® network, a $3.5 billion and $6.5 billion limit on the maximum amount of savings account deposits and demand account deposits, respectively, that a bank may place at other banks as reciprocal deposits, and a $10.0 billion limit on the maximum amount of deposits that a bank may place at other banks as One-Way Sell® deposits. The terms and conditions also include limitations on a bank’s ability to receive reciprocal deposits, place One-Way Sell® deposits, or receive One-Way Buy® deposits if the bank is not “well capitalized” under the applicable federal banking regulations. \n\nWe are subject to various fees associated with the placement and management of deposits within the ICS® network, as outlined in the IntraFi® Participating Institution Agreement. When we elect to receive reciprocal deposits, which are network deposits that are matched with equivalent funds placed by other participating institutions, we incur an “IntraFi Placement Fee.” As of September 30, 2024, the annualized rate for this fee was 0.125%, which is applied to the reciprocal deposits balance to determine the amount of the fee incurred. This fee increases our overall operating expenses, impacting our net income. \n\nThe fees associated with our participation in the ICS® network require careful management. The IntraFi Placement Fee represents an additional cost that is not incurred with traditional deposit accounts. As such, this fee is factored into our overall asset and liability management strategy with the aim of ensuring that our participation in the ICS® network remains financially advantageous. These fees, together with our interest expense on deposits and other operational costs, contribute to the overall cost structure associated with our deposit services. \n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Bank maintained elevated deposit levels ahead of the November 2024 federal elections. We estimate that at least a majority of our deposit balances as of September 30, 2024 were sourced from political organizations. Deposits from political organizations are currently experiencing outflows, which we expect to continue through the end of the fourth quarter of 2024 and into early 2025, as the 2024 election cycle concludes. The outflows to date have been consistent with the seasonal patterns we have historically observed during federal election cycles. Historically, deposits from political organizations have typically increased in the periods leading up to federal elections and declined in the quarters during and after federal elections. The amount and timing of these deposit inflows and outflows are difficult to predict and may differ from historical patterns. See Note 5—Deposits in the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements contained within this Form 10-Q. \n\n61\n\n[Table of ](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[Con](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[t](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[e](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[n](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[t](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[s](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)\n\nThe following table presents the types of deposits compared to total deposits for the periods indicated: \n\nAs of September 30, 2024 | As of December 31, 2023 | Change  \n---|---|---  \n(dollars in thousands) | Amount | % oftotaldeposits | Amount | % oftotaldeposits | $ | %  \nNoninterest-bearing | $ | 1,249,724  | 87.1  | % | $ | 766,933  | 69.0  | % | $ | 482,791  | 63.0  | %  \nSavings, interest-bearing and money market accounts | 172,275  | 12.0  | % | 328,350  | 29.5  | % | (156,075) | (47.5  | %)  \nTime, $250 and over | 6,589  | 0.5  | % | 9,385  | 0.8  | % | (2,796) | (29.8  | %)  \nOther time | 5,280  | 0.4  | % | 7,357  | 0.7  | % | (2,077) | (28.2  | %)  \nTotal | $ | 1,433,868  | 100.0  | % | $ | 1,112,025  | 100.0  | % | $ | 321,843  | 28.9  | %  \n  \nThe following table presents the average balances and average rates paid for the periods indicated: \n\nThree months ended September 30, | Nine months ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \n(dollars in thousands) | AverageBalance | AverageRate | AverageBalance | AverageRate | AverageBalance | AverageRate | AverageBalance | AverageRate  \nNoninterest-bearing | $ | 1,134,556  | 0.00  | % | $ | 663,920  | 0.00  | % | $ | 944,693  | 0.00  | % | $ | 626,949  | 0.00  | %  \nSavings, interest-bearing checking and money market accounts | 207,387 | 1.39  | % | 266,380 | 1.10  | % | 221,488 | 1.29  | % | 291,959 | 1.12  | %  \nTime, $250 and over | 6,584 | 2.96  | % | 9,599 | 2.98  | % | 7,966 | 2.95  | % | 7,885 | 2.51  | %  \nOther time | 5,303 | 2.78  | % | 7,968 | 2.64  | % | 5,945 | 2.88  | % | 10,517 | 3.04  | %  \nTotal average deposits | $ | 1,353,830  | 0.08  | % | $ | 947,867  | 0.11  | % | $ | 1,180,092  | 0.28  | % | $ | 937,310  | 0.40  | %  \n  \nFDIC deposit insurance covers $250 thousand per depositor, per FDIC-insured bank, for each account ownership category.

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had an unsecured line of credit from a correspondent bank totaling $10.0 million with an outstanding balance of $10.0 million as of September 30, 2024 and $5.0 million as of December 31, 2023. On October 10, 2024, the Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the IPO to fully repay the $10.0 million outstanding balance. The Company subsequently closed the line on October 11, 2024. \n\nThe Bank also maintains federal funds lines of credit agreements with three correspondent banks totaling $68.0 million, which renew annually, are offered on an unsecured basis, and may remain outstanding for periods of up to 10 to 90 consecutive days. The three federal funds purchase lines of credit are for $8.0 million, expiring on March 12, 2025, $10.0 million, expiring on June 30, 2025, and $50.0 million, expiring on June 30, 2025, and the Bank’s use of the facilities is subject to certain terms and conditions, including those related to the Bank’s financial condition. There were no outstanding federal funds purchased balances as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. \n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements \n\nWe are party to credit-related financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our clients. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Such commitments involve, in varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. \n\nOur exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amount of these commitments. We follow the same credit policies in making commitments as we do for on-balance sheet instruments. \n\nThe contractual amounts of financial instruments with off-balance sheet commitments are as follows: \n\nAs of September 30, | As of December 31,  \n---|---  \n(dollars in thousands) | 2024 | 2023  \nCommitments to grant loans | $ | 1,021  | $ | —   \nUnfunded commitments under lines of credit | 37,758  | 22,947   \nStandby letters of credit | 3,707  | 3,598   \n  \nUnfunded commitments under lines of credit increased $14.8 million, or 64.5% from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 primarily due to a $17.5 million increase in renewed availability under two lines of credit issued to political organizations. These lines were fully drawn subsequent to quarter end on October 16, 2024. \n\nFor information regarding the arrangement related to the ICS® network and related One-Way Sell® deposits, see “— Deposits” above. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Management \n\nLiquidity Management \n\nLiquidity refers to our capacity to meet cash and collateral obligations in a timely manner. Maintaining appropriate levels of liquidity depends on our ability to address both expected and unexpected cash flows and collateral needs while aiming to avoid adverse effects on our daily operations or the financial condition of the Bank. Effective liquidity management is considered essential to our business model, as deposits, which can generally be withdrawn on demand, form a primary source of our funding. We employ various strategies intended to manage liquidity. Our account at the Federal Reserve, which held approximately $627.0 million as of September 30, 2024, serves as a primary source of liquidity for daily and ongoing activities. We also maintain additional supplemental sources of liquidity, as discussed below. For regulatory reporting purposes, the liquidity ratio is typically calculated as the sum of our cash and cash equivalents plus unpledged securities classified as investment grade divided by total liabilities. Based on this calculation method, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our reported liquidity ratios were 85.31% and 78.75%, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had $432.3 million in One-Way Sell® deposit accounts through the ICS® platform that could be converted to a reciprocal position in order to provide additional near-term liquidity. It is important to note that these ratios and amounts are point-in-time measurements and may not be indicative of future liquidity positions. \n\nDeposit account balances received from federal political organizations fluctuate due to the seasonality of fundraising and spending around federal elections. Historically, in the quarters leading up to federal elections, especially presidential \n\n63\n\n[Table of ](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[Con](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[t](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[e](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[n](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[t](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[s](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)\n\nelections, our deposits generally increase, and decline in the quarters during and after federal elections. The amount and timing of these deposit inflows and outflows are difficult to predict and may differ from historical patterns. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank’s deposits maintained an elevated level ahead of the November 2024 presidential election. Consistent with patterns observed in previous election cycles, deposits from political organizations are currently experiencing outflows, which we expect to continue through the end of the fourth quarter of 2024 and into early 2025, as the 2024 election cycle concludes. SeeNote 5—Depositsin the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements contained within this Form 10-Q. Management seeks to address liquidity needs related to seasonal outflows by identifying political organization accounts, tracking activity, communicating with clients and retaining high cash balances at the Federal Reserve to fund deposit outflows. \n\nIn addition to traditional sources of liquidity, such as reciprocal deposits and lines of credit, we also utilize the ICS® network for both One-Way Buy® deposits and One-Way Sell® deposits, each serving distinct roles in our liquidity management strategy. One-Way Sell® deposits and reciprocal deposits involve placing deposits from our own clients with other participating banks through the ICS® network. One-Way Sell® deposits help us manage excess deposits by moving them off our balance sheet, while reciprocal deposits allow us to exchange deposit balances with other banks, ensuring those deposits remain insured. Both strategies help us to optimize our liquidity position while earning deposit placement fees, which contribute to our noninterest income. Conversely, One-Way Buy® deposits involve receiving deposits from other banks’ customers through the ICS® network. This mechanism can provide an additional source of liquidity by allowing us to increase our deposits without reciprocating. These transactions involve certain expenses, which include interest on the deposits and any associated fees, which we consider within our broader liquidity planning. \n\nManagement estimates that up to 81.4% of deposits were uninsured as of September 30, 2024. To obtain FDIC insurance for deposits exceeding the $250 thousand threshold, some clients enroll in the ICS®, which is described in greater detail under “— Deposits” above. As of September 30, 2024, deposit balances totaling $432.3 million were enrolled in the ICS® program. All of these deposits were positioned as One-Way Sell® deposits and are therefore not reflected on the balance sheet. The Bank has the flexibility to convert these One-Way Sell® deposits into reciprocal deposits, which would then appear on the balance sheet. To fund the outflow of deposits during phases of the federal election cycle when campaigns and committees are actively spending, management will rely on the Bank’s cash balances at the Federal Reserve and conversion of One-Way Sell® accounts to reciprocal as its primary sources of liquidity. Similar to other deposits, depositors may withdraw their One-Way Sell® deposits at any time, which could impact the volume of One-Way Sell® deposits available for conversion to reciprocal. \n\nIn addition to the primary sources of liquidity discussed above, we maintain secured lines of credit with the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Discount Window, for which we can borrow up to the allowable amount of pledged collateral. The Bank can advance FHLB funds of up to 25% of assets as reported in its latest Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (“FFIEC”) Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income, which the Bank files with the FFIEC on a quarterly basis (“Call Report”), using pledged collateral such as qualifying mortgages and investment securities. Based on the September 30, 2024 Call Report, 25% of total assets equates to credit availability of $388.8 million. As of September 30, 2024, we had no collateral pledged or outstanding balance with the FHLB or Federal Reserve. \n\nThe Bank has access to additional unsecured funding through its account with ICS®. The Bank can request funding of up to 10% of total assets, which equates to $155.5 million as of the Bank’s September 30, 2024 Call Report, in a One-Way Buy® of daily maturing or term deposit products. Requesting One-Way Buy® deposits requires us to submit a bid including the rate we are willing to pay for the deposits, and such request may be fulfilled in whole, in part, or not at all. If demand for One-Way Buy® deposits is high, then the rate required to successfully bid for One-Way Buy® deposits would be expected to increase, and so One-Way Buy® deposits may be a less reliable source of liquidity. As of September 30, 2024, there was no outstanding balance. \n\nThe Bank maintains unsecured lines of credit with three correspondent banks that provide combined availability of $68.0 million. There were no outstanding balances as of September 30, 2024. \n\nAs an intermediate source of liquidity, we may sell AFS securities or allow AFS and HTM securities to mature without reinvestment in the securities portfolio. As of September 30, 2024, our AFS securities portfolio had a fair value of $294.8 million, and our total AFS and HTM debt securities portfolio had a carrying value of $603.0 million, including $183.5 million of bonds maturing within a year and $287.5 million of bonds maturing between one and five years. Our bond portfolio is structured to provide liquidity when management anticipates it will be needed, and a portion of our AFS bonds are invested in liquid investments like U.S. Treasury securities. In the event liquidity is needed from the bond portfolio, management will take into consideration a number of factors when determining which investments to sell. Variables include the marketability of the bonds, current prices and estimated losses, and other factors. \n\n64\n\n[Table of ](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[Con](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[t](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[e](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[n](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[t](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[s](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)\n\nLiquidity Risk Management \n\nLiquidity risk refers to the potential that the Bank’s financial condition or overall safety and soundness could be adversely affected by a real or perceived inability to meet contractual obligations. This risk category includes potential challenges in managing unplanned decreases or changes in funding sources. Liquidity risk management involves efforts to identify, measure, monitor and control liquidity events. \n\nThe Bank’s Asset/Liability Committee (“ALCO”) of the Board typically reviews current and projected liquidity scenarios, including stressed scenarios, at its quarterly meetings. The ALCO seeks to ensure that measurement systems are designed to identify and quantify the Bank’s liquidity exposure, and that reporting systems and practices are intended to communicate relevant information about the level and sources of that exposure. Management is responsible for implementing board-approved policies, strategies, and procedures, and for monitoring liquidity on both a daily and long-term basis. \n\nCapital Resources \n\nCapital adequacy is generally considered an important indicator of financial stability and performance. Our objectives include maintaining capitalization at levels that we believe are sufficient to support asset growth and to promote confidence among our depositors, investors, and regulators. We recognize that robust capital management practices are integral to addressing various financial and operational challenges, which may include managing credit risk, liquidity risk, balance sheet growth, new products, regulatory changes and competitive pressures. \n\nStockholders’ equity as of September 30, 2024 was $104.8 million, an increase of $21.4 million compared to $83.4 million as of December 31, 2023. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 contributed $17.2 million to the increase in stockholders’ equity. Forming the remaining balance of the change, accumulated other comprehensive loss decreased $4.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which is primarily related to the improvement in the market value of the AFS securities portfolio. \n\nThe Company has a $10.0 million line of credit from a correspondent bank that it uses to provide capital to the Bank. As of September 30, 2024, $10.0 million was outstanding on this line of credit. On October 10, 2024, the Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the IPO to fully repay the $10.0 million outstanding balance. The Company subsequently closed the line on October 11, 2024.\n\nGiving effect to the stock Reclassification completed on October 3, 2024, book value per share as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $22.95 and $18.26, respectively. The increase between periods is primarily the result of earnings, which were $3.77 per share during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The remaining increase is due to the improvement in the market value of the AFS securities portfolio which caused the accumulated other comprehensive loss to decline. \n\nBecause total assets on a consolidated basis are less than $3.0 billion, we are not subject to the consolidated capital requirements imposed by federal regulations. However, the Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Certain regulatory measurements of capital adequacy are “risk based,” meaning they utilize a formula that considers the individual risk profile of the financial institution’s assets. For example, certain assets, such as cash at the Federal Reserve and investments in U.S. Treasury securities, are deemed to carry zero risk by the regulators because of explicit or implied federal government guarantees. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, 56.3% and 42.5% of the Bank’s total assets were invested in such zero-risk assets. The tier 1 leverage ratio, another regulatory capital measurement, does not consider the riskiness of assets. The leverage ratio is computed as tier 1 capital divided by total average assets for the quarter. \n\n65\n\n[Table of ](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[Con](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[t](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[e](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[n](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[t](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[s](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)\n\nThe Bank’s capital level is characterized as “well capitalized” under the Basel III Capital Rules. A summary of the Bank’s regulatory capital ratios, and minimum requirement to be considered “well capitalized” are presented below: \n\nWell-capitalizedrequirement  \n---  \nSeptember 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023  \n($ in thousands) | Amount | Ratio | Amount | Ratio | Ratio  \nTotal risk-based capital ratio | $ | 127,080  | 31.90  | % | $ | 104,523  | 25.44  | % | 10.00  | %  \nTier 1 risk-based capital ratio | 122,613  | 30.78  | % | 99,856  | 24.30  | % | 8.00  | %  \nCommon equity tier one risk-based capital ratio | 122,613  | 30.78  | % | 99,856  | 24.30  | % | 6.50  | %  \nTier 1 leverage ratio | 122,613  | 8.29  | % | 99,856  | 9.21  | % | 5.00  | %  \n  \nDuring periods of growth in deposits due to seasonality, our assets could reach a level that would require the Bank to control the level of these deposits or require the Company to obtain additional capital to maintain a Tier 1 leverage ratio that exceeds our internal regulatory capital policies or targets and satisfies regulatory requirements. We use the ICS® network to help manage our Tier 1 leverage ratio by moving certain deposit accounts off our balance sheet by placing the deposits at other banks as One-Way Sell® deposits. As of September 30, 2024, our deposits enrolled in the ICS® program totaled $432.3 million, and were all in a One-Way Sell® position. If these deposits were included on our balance sheet as of September 30, 2024, we estimate the Bank’s Tier 1 leverage ratio would have been 6.22%. \n\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nInterest Rate Sensitivity and Market Risk \n\nOur business activities include attracting deposits and using those deposits to invest in cash, securities, and loans. These activities involve interest rate risk, which arises from factors such as timing and volume differences in the repricing of our rate-sensitive assets and liabilities, changes in credit spreads, fluctuations in the general level of market interest rates, and shifts in the shape and level of market yield curves. Changes in interest rates affects our current and future earnings by impacting our net interest income and the level of other interest-sensitive income and operating expenses. Interest rate fluctuations also influence the underlying economic value of our assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items. This is because the present value of future cash flows, and in some cases the cash flows themselves, may change when interest rates vary. \n\nInterest rate risk is generally considered a significant market risk for financial institutions. We have developed an interest rate risk policy that aims to provide management with guidelines for funds management. We have also established a system for monitoring our net interest rate sensitivity position. However, it’s important to note that despite these measures, significant changes in interest rates could potentially impact our earnings, liquidity and capital positions. \n\nWe had a total one-year cumulative gap in rate-sensitive assets and rate-sensitive liabilities of $787.8 million and $319.4 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, indicating that, overall, our assets will reprice before our liabilities. Generally, when interest-earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities, decreasing interest rates could reduce net interest income and increasing interest rates could increase net interest income. \n\nOur ALCO is composed of our CEO and at least two independent directors and meets at least quarterly to manage interest rate risk in accordance with policies approved by the Bank’s board of directors. Members of management from various departments also participate in the ALCO meetings. The board of directors receives monthly interest rate risk measurement results. The ALCO monitors the volume, maturities, pricing and mix of assets and funding sources with the objective of managing assets and funding sources to provide results that are consistent with liquidity, growth, risk limits and profitability goals. \n\nWe use interest rate risk models and rate shock simulations to assess the interest rate risk (“IRR”) sensitivity of net interest income and the economic value of equity over a variety of parallel and non-parallel rate scenarios. Many assumptions are used to calculate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our net interest income, such as asset prepayments, non-maturity deposit price sensitivity and decay rates, and rate drivers. Due to the inherent use of estimates and assumptions in the model, our actual results may, and most likely will, differ from our simulated results. Management reviews the assumptions on an as-needed basis and at least annually through a thorough examination. Key changes are presented to the ALCO. \n\n66\n\n[Table of ](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[Con](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[t](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[e](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[n](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[t](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[s](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)\n\nThe table below summarizes the results of our IRR analysis in simulating the change in net interest income over a 12-month horizon as of the indicated dates. The “ramped” scenario below presents the anticipated percentage change in net interest income when rates are increased or decreased in a parallel manner evenly over the 12-month time horizon, and the “immediate” scenario assumes that the parallel rate shift occurs immediately. \n\nChange in interest rates (ramped) | -400 bps | -300 bps | -200 bps | -100 bps | +100 bps | +200 bps | +300 bps | +400 bps  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nSeptember 30, 2024 | (23.30  | %) | (17.48  | %) | (11.63  | %) | (5.82  | %) | 5.87  | % | 11.64  | % | 17.43  | % | 23.27  | %  \nDecember 31, 2023 | (16.22  | %) | (12.11  | %) | (8.06  | %) | (4.04  | %) | 4.00  | % | 8.02  | % | 12.14  | % | 16.11  | %  \n  \nChange in interest rates (immediate) | -400 bps | -300 bps | -200 bps | -100 bps | +100 bps | +200 bps | +300 bps | +400 bps  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nSeptember 30, 2024 | (52.78  | %) | (40.46  | %) | (26.82  | %) | (13.33  | %) | 13.26  | % | 26.44  | % | 39.63  | % | 52.89  | %  \nDecember 31, 2023 | (34.76  | %) | (25.74  | %) | (16.98  | %) | (8.41  | %) | 8.34  | % | 16.54  | % | 24.88  | % | 33.27  | %  \n  \nThe results show that we are asset-sensitive, further indicating that we can expect net interest income to increase as rates rise and to decrease as rates decline. See “Risk Factors — Changes in interest rates may adversely affect our earnings and financial condition.” in our Prospectus. Interest rates do not normally move all at once or evenly over time, but this analysis assists in our understanding of the potential direction and magnitude of net interest income changes due to changing interest rates. \n\nThe following table illustrates the results of our interest rate risk analysis in simulating the change in fair value of equity as of the indicated dates. \n\nChange in interest rates | -400 bps | -300 bps | -200 bps | -100 bps | +100 bps | +200 bps | +300 bps | +400 bps  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nSeptember 30, 2024 | (12.00  | %) | (7.12  | %) | (3.66  | %) | (1.49  | %) | 1.54  | % | 3.96  | % | 5.63  | % | 7.49  | %  \nDecember 31, 2023 | 14.25  | % | 12.33  | % | 8.27  | % | 3.21  | % | (4.81  | %) | (8.85  | %) | (12.35  | %) | (15.45  | %)  \n  \nDue to the nature of our client base, and the resulting balance sheet cyclicality, we will sometimes hold high volumes of immediately repricing assets (i.e., cash) to fund impending political organization deposit outflows. The changes in our balance sheet over the course of a two-year election cycle causes a degree of variability among our interest rate risk results over time. \n\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\n\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nThe Company’s management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file and submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nThere have been no changes, in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n\n67\n\n[Table of ](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[Con](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[t](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[e](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[n](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[t](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)[s](#ice108c4f29f04d2db3b0ba3cd9cf34ad_7)\n\nPart II - Other Information\n\nItem 1.

Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\n\nUse of Proceeds\n\nOn October 7, 2024, the Company completed the issuance and sale of 1,850,000 shares of Class A Common Stock, at a public offering price of $22.00 per share. The Company received net proceeds of approximately $33.6 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately $2.8 million, and estimated offering expenses, including legal, accounting, and other expenses, of approximately $4.3 million. On October 10, 2024, the Company used a portion of the net proceeds to fully repay the $10.0 million outstanding principal balance on its unsecured line of credit with a correspondent bank. \n\nOn November 1, 2024, the Company issued an additional 142,897 shares of Class A Common Stock as a result of the underwriters’ exercise of their 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 277,500 shares of its Class A Common Stock at the public offering price less underwriting discounts and commissions, or $20.46 per share. The issuance resulted in net proceeds to the Company of approximately $2.9 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately $220 thousand. The Company intends to use the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include supporting continued organic deposit growth and funding potential strategic expansion.\n\nAll shares sold were registered pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-282102), as amended, which was declared effective by the SEC on October 3, 2024 and registered 2,127,500 shares of our Class A Common Stock with a maximum aggregate offering price of $55.3 million. Piper Sandler & Co., Raymond James & Associates, Inc., and Hovde Group, LLC acted as representatives of the underwriters for the offering.

The “Bank” and “Chain Bridge Bank, N.A” refer to Chain Bridge\nBank, National Association, a nationally chartered bank.\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. You should not place undue reliance on forward-\nlooking statements because they are subject to numerous uncertainties and factors relating to our operations and business, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which\nare beyond our control. Forward-looking statements include information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations, including descriptions of our business\nstrategy. These forward-looking statements are generally identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, including the terms “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “estimate,”\n“expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “target,” “will,” “would” and, in each case, their negative or other variations or comparable\nterminology and expressions. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including statements regarding our\nstrategies, future operations, future financial position, future revenue, projected costs, prospects, plans, objectives of management and expected market growth are forward-\nlooking statements. The forward-looking statements are contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include, but are not limited to, statements relating to:\n• Changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies of, and other activities undertaken by, governments, agencies, central banks and similar organizations, including the\neffects of United States federal government spending;\n• The level of, or changes in the level of, interest rates and inflation, including the effects on our net interest income and the market value of our investment and loan\nportfolios;\n• The level and composition of our deposits, including our ability to attract and retain, and the seasonality of, client deposits, including those in the IntraFi Cash\nService (“ICS®”) network, as well as the amount and timing of deposit outflows through the end of the fourth quarter of 2024 and into early 2025;\n• The level and composition of our loan portfolio, including our ability to maintain the credit quality of our loan portfolio;\n• Current and future business, economic and market conditions in the United States generally or in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area in particular;\n• The effects of disruptions or instability in the financial system, including as a result of the failure of a financial institution or other participants in it, or geopolitical\ninstability, including war, terrorist attacks, pandemics and man-made and natural disasters;\n• The impact of, and changes, in applicable laws, regulations, regulatory expectations and accounting standards and policies;\n• Our likelihood of success in, and the impact of, legal, regulatory or other actions, investigations or proceedings related to our business;\n• Adverse publicity or reputational harm to us, our senior officers, directors, employees or clients;\n• Our ability to effectively execute our growth plans or other initiatives;\n• Changes in demand for our products and services;\n• Our levels of, and access to, sources of liquidity and capital;\n• The ability to attract and retain essential personnel or changes in our essential personnel;\n• Our ability to effectively compete with banks, non-bank financial institutions, and financial technology firms and the effects of competition in the financial services\nindustry on our business;\n• The effectiveness of our risk management and internal disclosure controls and procedures;\n• Any failure or interruption of our information and technology systems, including any components provided by a third party;\n• Our ability to identify and address cybersecurity threats and breaches;\n• Our ability to keep pace with technological changes;\n• Our ability to receive dividends from the Bank and satisfy our obligations as they become due;\n• The one-time and incremental costs of operating as a public company;\n• Our ability to meet our obligations as a public company, including our obligation under Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley; and\n3\nTable of Contents\n• The effect of our dual-class structure and the concentrated ownership of our Class B common stock, including beneficial ownership of our shares by the lineal\ndescendants of Gerald Francis Fitzgerald, deceased, and Marjorie Gosselin Fitzgerald, their spouses or surviving spouses, children, and grandchildren, and the spouses of their\nchildren and grandchildren (the “Fitzgerald Family”).\nYou should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We have based the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on\nForm 10-Q primarily on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition, results of\noperations and prospects. The outcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors described in the section\ntitled “Risk Factors” included in our prospectus dated October 3, 2024, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in accordance with Rule 424(b) of the\nSecurities Act of 1933, as amended, on October 7, 2024 (the “Prospectus”). Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and\nuncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all risks and uncertainties that could have an impact on the forward-looking statements contained\nin this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The results, events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur, and actual results,\nevents, or circumstances could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.\nThe forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q relate only to events as of the date on which the statements are made. We undertake no\nobligation to update any forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Quarterly Report on\nForm 10-Q or to reflect new information or the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law. We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations\ndisclosed in our forward-looking statements and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements do not reflect the\npotential impact of any future acquisitions, mergers, dispositions, joint ventures, or investments we may make.\nIn addition, statements that “we believe” and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements are based upon information\navailable to us as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. And while we believe such information provides a reasonable basis for such statements, such information\nmay be limited or incomplete. Our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant\ninformation. These statements are inherently uncertain and you are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these statements. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results or\nreturns and no representation or warranty is made regarding future performance.\n4\nTable of Contents\nPart I - Financial Information\nItem 1.

Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nOrganization and Nature of Operations\nChain Bridge Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”) is a Delaware corporation and is the registered bank holding company for Chain Bridge Bank, National Association (the “Bank”).\nBoth the Company and Bank have their headquarters and sole executive office in McLean, Virginia.\nThe Bank operates a model that combines electronic banking channels with its physical banking headquarters in McLean, Virginia, allowing it to serve clients nationally.\nThe Bank provides a wide range of commercial and personal banking services, including deposit accounts, mortgage financing, various loan products, trust administration,\nwealth management, and asset custody. The core deposit products offered by the Bank include noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing checking accounts, along with savings\naccounts. The Bank’s lending portfolio is comprised primarily of mortgage-related loans, with the majority being consumer residential mortgages in the Washington, D.C. area.\nThe Bank offers tailored solutions to individuals, families, businesses, non-profit organizations, and political organizations. The term “political organizations” refers to\ncampaign committees, party committees, separate segregated funds (including trade association political action committees (“PACs”) and corporate PACs), non-connected\ncommittees (including independent expenditure-only committees (“Super PACs”), committees maintaining separate accounts for direct contributions and independent\nexpenditures (“Hybrid PACs”), and committees other than authorized campaign committees, or those affiliated therewith, maintained or controlled by a candidate or federal\nofficeholder (“Leadership PACs”)), and other tax-exempt 527 organizations.\nThe accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica (“GAAP”) for interim financial information. The statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.\nIn the opinion of the Company’s management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, which are necessary for a fair presentation of the consolidated\nfinancial statements, have been included. These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated\nfinancial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the notes thereto.\nThe results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other interim period or for the full\nyear.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Chain Bridge Bancorp, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Chain Bridge Bank, National Association. All\nsignificant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nReclassification\nCertain amounts reported in prior years may be reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation. There were no reclassifications for the periods reported.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nThe accounting and reporting policies of the Company are in accordance with GAAP and conform to general practices within the banking industry. The Company’s significant\naccounting policies are described in the Note 1 of the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” included in the audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal\nyear ended December 31, 2023. There have been no significant changes to the application of significant accounting policies since December 31, 2023.\n12\nTable of Contents\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements\nIn preparing financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities\nas of the date of the balance sheet and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis. Actual results could\ndiffer from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for credit\nlosses (“ACL”) on loans and held to maturity debt securities.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.” The\namendments in this ASU require an entity to disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a\nquantitative threshold, which is greater than five percent of the amount computed by multiplying pretax income by the entity’s applicable statutory rate, on an annual basis.\nAdditionally, the amendments in this ASU require an entity to disclose the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign\ntaxes and the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by individual jurisdictions that are equal to or greater than five percent of total income taxes\npaid (net of refunds received). Lastly, the amendments in this ASU require an entity to disclose income (or loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense (or\nbenefit) disaggregated between domestic and foreign and income tax expense (or benefit) from continuing operations disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign. This ASU is\neffective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments should be applied on a prospective basis; however, retrospective\napplication is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2023-09 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, “Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40):\nDisaggregation of Income Statement Expenses.” ASU 2024-03 requires public companies to disclose, in the notes to the financial statements, specific information about certain\ncosts and expenses at each interim and annual reporting period. This includes disclosing amounts related to employee compensation, depreciation, and intangible asset\namortization. In addition, public companies will need to provide qualitative description of the amounts remaining in relevant expense captions that are not separately\ndisaggregated quantitatively. ASU 2024-03 is effective for public business entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting\nperiods beginning after December 15, 2027. Implementation of ASU 2024-03 may be applied prospectively or retrospectively. The Company does not expect the adoption of\nASU 2024-03 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nOther accounting standards that have been issued by the FASB or other standard setting bodies are not currently expected to have material effect on the Company’s financial\nposition, results of operations or cash flows.\n13\nTable of Contents\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 2. Capital Structure\nOn September 13, 2024, the Company filed a Registration Statement on Form S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) in connection with its initial\npublic offering (“IPO”), as amended on September 30, 2024, and declared effective by the SEC on October 3, 2024 (the “Registration Statement”). On October 7, 2024, the\nCompany issued 1,850,000 shares of Class A common stock, par value of $0.01 (“Class A Common Stock”), at a public offering price of $22.00 per share. On October 7, 2024,\nthe Company completed its IPO and received total net proceeds of $37.1 million, after deducting the underwriters’ discount and reimbursements for the underwriters’ legal and\nother out of pocket expenditures. The net proceeds less other related expenses, including audit fees, legal fees, listing fees, and other expenses, totaled $33.6 million.\nOn October 10, 2024, the Company used a portion of the net proceeds to fully repay $10.0 million in short-term borrowings. The Company subsequently closed the line of\ncredit on October 11, 2024.\nOn November 1, 2024, the Company issued an additional 142,897 shares of Class A Common Stock as a result of the underwriters' exercise of their 30-day option to purchase\nup to an additional 277,500 shares of its Class A Common Stock. The issuance resulted in net proceeds to the Company of approximately $2.9 million, after deducting\nunderwriting discounts and commissions.\nIn connection with the IPO, on October 3, 2024, the Company filed an Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware,\nwhich established two new classes of common stock, the Class A Common Stock and Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Class B Common Stock”), and\nreclassified and converted each outstanding share of the Company’s existing common stock, par value $1.00 per share (“Old Common Stock”), into 170 shares of Class B\nCommon Stock (the “Reclassification”). The Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware also changed the number\nof authorized shares of Preferred Stock from 100,000 to 10,000,000.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had 26,876 shares of Old Common Stock issued and outstanding and no shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock\nissued and outstanding. After giving effect to the Reclassification, which was retroactively applied to the financial statements, the Company had no shares of Old Common\nStock and Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding and 4,568,920 shares of Class B Common Stock issued and outstanding. Because the Reclassification was applied\nretroactively to all periods presented, a share that was previously reported as Old Common stock at $1.00 par value and Additional Paid in Capital, is now reported as 170\nshares of Class B Common Stock at $0.01 par value and Additional Paid in Capital. The following table sets forth selected balance sheet components as of September 30, 2024:\n• On an unadjusted basis, giving no effect to the Reclassification;\n• On an as adjusted basis, giving effect to the Reclassification transactions described above; and\n• On an as further adjusted basis after giving effect to (1) the Reclassification, (2) the Company’s receipt of\nthe net proceeds from the IPO, after deducting underwriting discounts and commission and other direct expenses of the offering, and (3) the use of a portion\nof the net proceeds to repay the outstanding principal balance of $10.0 million of borrowings under the Company’s unsecured line of credit with a\ncorrespondent bank.\n14\nTable of Contents\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements\nAs of September 30, 2024\nAs adjusted for\nUnadjusted Reclassification As Further Adjusted for IPO\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nCash and cash equivalents $ 639,767 $ 639,767 $ 666,293\nDebt: Short-term borrowings $ 10,000 $ 10,000 $ —\nStockholders’ equity:\nPreferred Stock, no par value; 100,000 shares authorized, none issued and\noutstanding, unadjusted; no par value, 10,000,000 shares authorized,\nnone issued and outstanding, as adjusted for Reclassification and as\nfurther adjusted for IPO $ — $ — $ —\nOld Common Stock, $1.00 par value; 200,000 shares authorized, 26,876\nshares issued and outstanding, unadjusted; no shares authorized, no\nshares issued and outstanding, as adjusted for Reclassification and as\nfurther adjusted for IPO $ 27 $ — $ —\nClass A Common Stock, $0.01 par value; no shares authorized, no shares\nissued and outstanding, unadjusted; 20,000,000 shares authorized, no\nshares issued and outstanding, as adjusted for Reclassification;\n20,000,000 shares authorized, 1,992,897 shares issued and outstanding,\nas further adjusted for IPO $ — $ — $ 20\nClass B Common Stock, $0.01 par value; no shares authorized, no shares\nissued and outstanding, unadjusted; 10,000,000 shares authorized,\n4,568,920 shares issued and outstanding, as adjusted for Reclassification\nand as further adjusted for IPO $ — $ 46 $ 46\nAdditional paid-in capital $ 38,295 $ 38,276 $ 74,782\nRetained earnings $ 73,901 $ 73,901 $ 73,901\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss $ (7,380) $ (7,380) $ (7,380)\nTotal stockholders’ equity $ 104,843 $ 104,843 $ 141,369\n15\nTable of Contents\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 3. Securities & Allowance for Securities Credit Losses\nThe Company invests in a variety of debt securities, principally obligations of the U.S. government and federal agencies, mortgage backed securities, state and municipal\nagencies, and corporations. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, all debt securities were classified as held to maturity (“HTM”) or available for sale (“AFS”).\nManagement considers the appropriateness of the accounting treatment applied to the Company’s debt securities portfolio on an ongoing basis. During a prior year, certain AFS\nbonds were transferred to the HTM portfolio. Bonds selected for transfer included U.S. government and federal agencies, corporate bonds, and state and municipal bonds. The\nunrealized loss at the time of transfer is being amortized monthly over the remaining lives of the debt securities with an increase to the carrying value of the debt securities and\na decrease to the related accumulated other comprehensive loss, which is included in the stockholders’ equity section of the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe following tables summarize the amortized cost, gross unrealized gains and losses, fair value and allowance for credit losses of AFS and HTM debt securities at\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024\nGross Gross Allowance\nAmortized Unrealized Unrealized Fair for Credit\nCost Gains (Losses) Value Losses\nSecurities available for sale:\nU.S. government and federal agencies $ 131,089 $ 52 $ (1,416) $ 129,725 $ —\nMortgage backed securities 8,658 — (429) 8,229 —\nCorporate bonds 53,283 62 (750) 52,595 —\nState and municipal securities 107,323 88 (3,206) 104,205 —\nTotal securities available for sale $ 300,353 $ 202 $ (5,801) $ 294,754 $ —\nSecurities held to maturity:\nU.S. government and federal agencies $ 122,447 $ 6 $ (7,236) $ 115,217 $ —\nMortgage backed securities 1,173 — (1) 1,172 —\nCorporate bonds 58,409 90 (1,545) 56,954 (230)\nState and municipal securities 120,580 23 (8,166) 112,437 (31)\nTotal securities held to maturity $ 302,609 $ 119 $ (16,948) $ 285,780 $ (261)\nTotal securities $ 602,962 $ 321 $ (22,749) $ 580,534 $ (261)\nDecember 31, 2023\nGross Gross Allowance\nAmortized Unrealized Unrealized Fair for Credit\nCost Gains (Losses) Value Losses\nSecurities available for sale:\nU.S. government and federal agencies $ 95,129 $ 32 $ (2,864) $ 92,297 $ —\nMortgage backed securities 9,247 11 (609) 8,649 —\nCorporate bonds 57,304 5 (1,837) 55,472 —\nState and municipal securities 106,472 34 (4,810) 101,696 —\nTotal securities available for sale $ 268,152 $ 82 $ (10,120) $ 258,114 $ —\nSecurities held to maturity:\nU.S. government and federal agencies $ 123,938 $ — $ (10,069) $ 113,869 $ —\nMortgage backed securities 1,190 — (17) 1,173 —\nCorporate bonds 59,629 59 (3,027) 56,661 (322)\nState and municipal securities 123,649 6 (11,442) 112,213 (26)\nTotal securities held to maturity $ 308,406 $ 65 $ (24,555) $ 283,916 $ (348)\nTotal securities $ 576,558 $ 147 $ (34,675) $ 542,030 $ (348)\n16\nTable of Contents\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements\nThere were no holdings of municipal or corporate debt that equaled or exceeded 10.0% of stockholders’ equity at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nThere were no securities pledged to secure a line of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nProceeds from calls, maturities, paydowns and sales of debt securities available for sale totaled $81.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and $28.4 million\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Proceeds from calls, maturities, and paydowns of debt securities held to maturity totaled $5.5 million and $248 thousand for the\nnine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Bank sold an AFS bond that was charged off during a prior year for $210 thousand. The proceeds were recorded as a\nrecapture of credit loss. Because this sale did not result in a realized gain or loss on sale of securities, it is excluded from the related tables below.\nThe proceeds, gross realized gains and losses from sales of debt securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows (dollars in\nthousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2024\nAvailable for Sale Held to Maturity Available for Sale Held to Maturity\nProceeds from sales of securities $ — $ 953 $ — $ 953\nGross gains — — — —\nGross losses — (65) — (65)\nNet losses on sale of a securities $ — $ (65)$ — $ (65)\nIncome tax benefit attributable to realized net losses on sale of securities $ — $ 14 $ — $ 14\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 September 30, 2023\nAvailable for Sale Held to Maturity Available for Sale Held to Maturity\nProceeds from sales of securities $ 977 $ — $ 1,929 $ —\nGross gains — — — —\nGross losses (30) — (312) —\nNet losses on sale of a securities $ (30)$ — $ (312)$ —\nIncome tax benefit attributable to realized net losses on sale of securities $ 6 $ — $ 66 $ —\nManagement classifies bonds as HTM only when the Company has the ability and intent to hold the bond to maturity, and certain sales or transfers of HTM could call into\nquestion management’s ability or intent to hold the remaining HTM bond portfolio to maturity, thereby “tainting” the entire portfolio and triggering a reclassification of the\nentire portfolio to available for sale. However, there are limited situations, including evidence of deterioration in the issuer’s creditworthiness, in which the Company could sell\nan HTM bond without tainting the remaining HTM portfolio. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company sold two HTM bonds from a single issuer due to significant\ndocumented deterioration of the issuer’s creditworthiness evidenced by the downgrading of the issuer’s public credit rating. The sales are included in the tables above. Under\nthese circumstances, the sale did not taint the HTM portfolio.\nThe amortized cost and fair value of debt securities by contractual maturity at September 30, 2024 is as follows (dollars in thousands):\n17\nTable of Contents\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements\nAvailable for Sale Held to Maturity\nAmortized Fair Amortized Fair\nCost Value Cost Value\nWithin one year $ 166,593 $ 166,033 $ 16,873 $ 16,668\nAfter one year through five years 98,391 95,808 189,090 181,392\nAfter five years through ten years 29,950 27,843 92,329 83,923\nOver ten years 5,419 5,070 4,317 3,797\nTotal $ 300,353 $ 294,754 $ 302,609 $ 285,780\nExpected maturities may differ from contractual maturities if issuers have the right to call or repay obligations with or without prepayment penalties.\nThe following table shows the gross unrealized losses and fair value of the Company’s AFS debt securities with unrealized losses aggregated by investment category and length\nof time that individual debt securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024\nLess Than Twelve\nMonths Over Twelve Months Total\nGross Gross Gross\nUnrealized Fair Unrealized Fair Unrealized Fair\nLoss Value Loss Value Loss Value\nSecurities available for sale:\nU.S. government and federal agencies $ (1) $ 10,997 $ (1,415) $ 46,445 $ (1,416) $ 57,442\nMortgage backed securities — 27 (429) 8,170 (429) 8,197\nCorporate bonds (17) 5,454 (733) 37,865 (750) 43,319\nState and municipal securities (27) 6,061 (3,179) 83,089 (3,206) 89,150\nTotal securities available for sale $ (45) $ 22,539 $ (5,756) $ 175,569 $ (5,801) $ 198,108\nDecember 31, 2023\nLess Than Twelve\nMonths Over Twelve Months Total\nGross Gross Gross\nUnrealized Fair Unrealized Fair Unrealized Fair\nLoss Value Loss Value Loss Value\nSecurities available for sale:\nU.S. government and federal agencies $ (16) $ 5,860 $ (2,848) $ 70,906 $ (2,864) $ 76,766\nMortgage backed securities — — (609) 8,604 (609) 8,604\nCorporate bonds (3) 2,482 (1,834) 51,987 (1,837) 54,469\nState and municipal securities (31) 3,675 (4,779) 89,828 (4,810) 93,503\nTotal securities available for sale $ (50) $ 12,017 $ (10,070) $ 221,325 $ (10,120) $ 233,342\nIn the AFS portfolio at September 30, 2024, 46 out of 61 debt securities of the U.S. government and federal agencies, 15 out of 20 mortgage backed securities, 89 out of 108\ncorporate bonds, and 269 out of 306 state and municipal securities were in an unrealized loss position. All of the Company’s investment portfolio was evaluated under the\nmonitoring process described in Note 1 of the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, and all investments were deemed investment\ngrade. All of the unrealized losses are attributed to changes in market interest rates, and are not a result of deterioration of creditworthiness among any of the issuers.\nOf the total AFS and HTM portfolio at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 792 and 880 debt securities had unrealized losses with aggregate impairment of 3.8% and\n6.0%, respectively, of the Company’s amortized cost basis. These unrealized losses related principally to interest rate movements and not the creditworthiness of the issuer. In\nanalyzing an issuer’s financial condition, management considers whether the debt securities are issued by the federal government or its\n18\nTable of Contents\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements\nagencies, whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, and industry analysts’ reports. Credit loss allowances for the AFS and HTM portfolios are described in\nthe following sections.\nAllowance for Credit Losses—AFS Securities\nManagement evaluates debt securities to determine whether the unrealized loss is due to credit-related factors or non-credit-related factors. This analysis occurs on a quarterly\nbasis. Consideration is given to the extent to which fair value is less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the intent and ability of the\nCompany to retain its investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for full recovery of its amortized cost. If the assessment reveals that a credit loss exists,\nthe present value of the expected cash flows of the security is compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of future cash flows expected to be\ncollected is less than the amortized cost, an allowance for the credit loss is recorded. The loss is limited by the amount that the amortized cost exceeds fair value.\nAs of the reporting date, the Company did not intend to sell any of the AFS debt securities, did not expect to be required to sell these debt securities, and expected to recover the\nentire amortized cost basis of all of the debt securities.\nThe Company did not record an ACL on the AFS debt securities at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company has evaluated these debt securities for credit-\nrelated impairment at the reporting date and concluded that no impairment existed. In analyzing an issuer’s financial condition, management considers whether the debt\nsecurities are issued by the federal government or its agencies, whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, industry analysts’ reports, and correlations between\nfair value changes and interest rate changes among instruments that are not credit sensitive. All AFS debt securities were current with no debt securities past due or on non-\naccrual as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company considers the unrealized losses on the debt securities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023 to be related to fluctuations in market conditions, primarily interest rates, and is not reflective of deterioration in credit.\nThe table below presents a rollforward by major security type of the allowance for credit losses on AFS debt securities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\n(dollars in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024\nU.S.\nGovernment Mortgage State and\nand Federal Backed Corporate Municipal Total AFS\nFor the nine months ended Agencies Securities Bonds Securities Securities\nAllowance for credit losses:\nBeginning balance, December 31, 2023 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nProvision for (recapture of) credit losses — — (210) — (210)\nWrite offs charged against the allowance — — — — —\nRecoveries of amounts previously written off — — 210 — 210\nEnding balance, September 30, 2024 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\n19\nTable of Contents\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements\nAt September 30, 2024, there was no allowance for credit losses on AFS debt securities recorded.

The entire ACL provision recorded for the AFS\nportfolio during 2023 was recorded in the first quarter and pertained to a holding from a single corporate issuer whose business was ultimately closed by a regulatory authority.\nThe bond, initially classified as HTM, was transferred to the AFS portfolio based on the unlikely collectability of the unsecured bond and significant documented credit\ndeterioration. A portion of the bond was subsequently sold at a loss, and the remaining unsold portion was written off entirely.\nCredit Quality Indicators and Allowance for Credit Losses - HTM Securities\nThe Company evaluates the credit risk of its HTM debt securities on a quarterly basis. The Company estimates expected credit losses on HTM debt securities using an\ninstrument -level process described in Note 1 of the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. The primary indicators of credit quality\nfor the Company’s HTM portfolio are security type, time remaining to maturity, and credit rating. Credit ratings may be influenced by a number of factors including obligor\ncash flows, geography, seniority and others. The HTM portfolio includes debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury and agencies of the federal government, and mortgage-\nbacked securities issued by government agencies. These types of investments carry implicit or explicit backing of the U.S. Treasury, and therefore are deemed to carry no credit\nrisk for purposes of the ACL evaluation.\nThe following table presents the amortized cost of HTM debt securities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 by security type and credit rating (dollars in\nthousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024\nU.S.\nGovernment Mortgage State and\nand Federal Backed Corporate Municipal Total HTM\nAgencies Securities Bonds Securities Securities\nAAA / AA / A $ 122,447 $ 1,173 $ 18,447 $ 120,580 $ 262,647\nBBB / BB / B — — 39,962 — 39,962\nTotal $ 122,447 $ 1,173 $ 58,409 $ 120,580 $ 302,609\n20\nTable of Contents\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2023\nU.S.\nGovernment Mortgage State and\nand Federal Backed Corporate Municipal Total HTM\nAgencies Securities Bonds Securities Securities\nAAA / AA / A $ 123,938 $ 1,190 $ 20,091 $ 123,168 $ 268,387\nBBB / BB / B — — 39,538 481 40,019\nTotal $ 123,938 $ 1,190 $ 59,629 $ 123,649 $ 308,406\nThe following tables summarize the change in the allowance for credit losses on HTM debt securities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and the\ntwelve months ended December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024\nU.S.\nGovernment Mortgage State and\nand Federal Backed Corporate Municipal Total HTM\nFor the three months ended Agencies Securities Bonds Securities Securities\nAllowance for credit losses:\nBeginning balance, June 30, 2024 $ — $ — $ 215 $ 33 $ 248\nProvision for (recapture of) credit losses — — 15 (2) 13\nWrite offs charged against the allowance — — — — —\nRecoveries of amounts previously written off — — — — —\nEnding balance, September 30, 2024 $ — $ — $ 230 $— $ 31 $— $ 261\nSeptember 30, 2023\nU.S.\nGovernment Mortgage State and\nand Federal Backed Corporate Municipal Total HTM\nFor the three months ended Agencies Securities Bonds Securities Securities\nAllowance for credit losses:\nBeginning balance, June 30, 2023 $ — $ — $ 316 $ 26 $ 342\nProvision for (recapture of) credit losses — — (8) 14 6\nWrite offs charged against the allowance — — — — —\nRecoveries of amounts previously written off — — — — —\nEnding balance, September 30, 2023 — — 308 40 348\nSeptember 30, 2024\nU.S.\nGovernment Mortgage State and\nand Federal Backed Corporate Municipal Total HTM\nFor the nine months ended Agencies Securities Bonds Securities Securities\nAllowance for credit losses:\nBeginning balance, December 31, 2023 $ — $ — $ 322 $ 26 $ 348\nProvision for (recapture of) credit losses — — (92) 5 (87)\nWrite offs charged against the allowance — — — — —\nRecoveries of amounts previously written off — — — — —\nEnding balance, September 30, 2024 $ — $ — $ 230 $ 31 $ 261\n21\nTable of Contents\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements\nSeptember 30, 2023\nU.S.\nGovernment Mortgage State and\nand Federal Backed Corporate Municipal Total HTM\nFor the nine months ended Agencies Securities Bonds Securities Securities\nAllowance for credit losses:\nBeginning balance, December 31, 2022 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nImpact of adopting ASC 326 — — 303 26 329\nProvision for credit losses — — 5 14 19\nWrite offs charged against the allowance — — — — —\nRecoveries of amounts previously written off — — — — —\nEnding balance, September 30, 2023 $ — $ — $ 308 $ 40 $ 348\nAt September 30, 2024, the Company had no HTM debt securities that were 30 days or more past due as to principal and interest payments.

Whether the underlying collateral is\nexpected to be a substantial source of repayment for an asset depends on the availability, reliability, and capacity of sources other than the collateral to repay the debt.\nCollateral-dependent loans are individually evaluated for expected credit losses as of the reporting date, and they are removed from their respective pools of collectively\nevaluated assets. Expected credit losses for these types of assets are based on the fair value of the collateral at the measurement date, adjusted for estimated selling costs. There\nwere no collateral-dependent loans that were individually evaluated for purposes of determining the allowance for credit loss under FASB ASC Topic 326 as of September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023.\nModifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty\nThe Company may modify loans to borrowers in financial distress by providing principal forgiveness, term extension, and other-than-insignificant payment delay or interest\nrate reduction. When principal forgiveness is provided, the amount of forgiveness is charged-off against the allowance for credit losses. There were no loan modifications\nprovided to borrowers exhibiting financial distress during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and there were no such prior modifications in existence during\nthe periods reported. During the reported periods, there were no payment defaults from any such loans during the twelve months preceding the modification because no such\nmodifications were in existence during the periods.\nRelated Party Loan Transactions\nOfficers, directors and their affiliates had loans outstanding with the Company of $8.6 million and $6.9 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nThe increase in loans outstanding relates to the cumulative effect of changes in the composition of related parties, due to the hiring of a new officer. These transactions occurred\nin the ordinary course of business on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with unrelated persons.\nNote 5. Deposits\nThe Bank held no deposits classified as brokered as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. To achieve full insurance from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\n(“FDIC”), some of the Bank’s depositors have enrolled in the\n26\nTable of Contents\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements\nIntraFi Cash Service® (“ICS®”) program offered by the Bank through the IntraFi® network. When accounts are enrolled in this service, the Bank must elect, for each account,\nwhether it will receive a reciprocal deposit balance or sell the deposit balance. There were no reciprocal deposits held as of September 30, 2024. At December 31, 2023, the\nBank held $177.3 million of reciprocal deposits through ICS® on its consolidated balance sheets. Total ICS® One-Way Sell® deposits of $432.3 million and $130.1 million as of\nSeptember 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively, were sold to the network and excluded from the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The Company receives fee\nincome for sold accounts, which is included in deposit placement services income on the consolidated statements of income.\nThe Bank’s deposit balances have consistently followed the trend of historic seasonality surrounding federal election cycles, where political organization deposits generally\nincrease in the quarters leading up to federal elections and decline in the quarters during and after the elections. Consistent with this trend, as of September 30, 2024, the Bank\nmaintained elevated deposit levels ahead of the November 2024 federal elections, with deposits reported on the balance sheet totaling $1.4 billion, and One-Way Sell® deposits\ntotaling $432.3 million. Entering the fourth quarter of 2024—the quarter of the 2024 presidential election—between October 1, 2024 and November 12, 2024, the date prior to\nthe filing of this quarterly report, total deposits, including reciprocal ICS® deposits, have ranged from approximately $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion, and ICS® One-Way Sell®\naccounts have approximately ranged from a minimum of $85.4 million to a maximum of $462.5 million. At the close of business on November 12, 2024, total deposits were\n$1.2 billion and ICS® One-Way Sell® accounts were $85.4 million. Declines in the volume of deposits retained on the balance sheet will cause net interest income to decrease,\nand declines in ICS® One-Way Sell® balances will cause noninterest income to decrease. The amount and timing of these deposit inflows and outflows are difficult to predict\nand may differ from historical patterns.\nFDIC deposit insurance covers $250 thousand per depositor, per FDIC-insured bank, for each account ownership category. The Company estimates uninsured deposits held at\nthe Bank as of September 30, 2024 are $1.2 billion, which is 81.4% of total deposits. The Company estimated uninsured deposits as of December 31, 2023 were $648.0 million,\nwhich is 58.3% of total deposits.\nThere were two clients with an individual deposit balance exceeding 5.0% of total deposits as of September 30, 2024. The total deposit balance related to these clients as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 was $226.6 million or 15.8% of total deposits. There were no clients whose individual deposit balances exceeded 5.0% of total deposits as of December 31,\n2023.\nNote 6. Borrowings\nFederal Home Loan Bank Advance\nThe Bank has a secured line of credit with the Federal Home Loan Bank, which is renewed annually in December. The Bank has historically pledged 1-4 family residential real\nestate loans within the Bank’s loan portfolio to establish credit availability. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the secured line of credit had no collateral pledged\nand therefore no available or outstanding balance.\nShort-Term Borrowings\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had an unsecured line of credit from a correspondent bank totaling $10.0 million with an outstanding balance of\n$10.0 million as of September 30, 2024 and $5.0 million as of December 31, 2023. On October 10, 2024, the Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the IPO to fully\nrepay the $10.0 million outstanding balance. The Company subsequently closed the line on October 11, 2024. The interest rate on the line of credit was 7.85% and 7.95% at\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of December 6, 2023, the agreement was amended to require payment of a quarterly unused commitment fee at\nthe rate of 1.00% per annum on the undisbursed and uncanceled daily balance during the preceding quarter.\nThe Bank has unsecured federal fund purchase lines of credit with Community Bankers’ Bank totaling $8.0 million maturing March 12, 2025, First National Bankers’ Bank\ntotaling $10.0 million maturing on June 30, 2025, and Pacific Coast Bankers’ Bank totaling $50.0 million maturing June 30, 2025. The federal funds lines renew annually and\nbalances may remain outstanding for period of up to 10 to 90 consecutive days. The use of the facilities is subject to certain terms and conditions, including those related to the\nBank’s financial condition. There were no outstanding federal funds purchased balances as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n27\nTable of Contents\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 7. Fair Value Measurements\nDetermination of Fair Value\nFair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the\nasset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The fair value measurements and disclosure topic specifies a hierarchy of\nvaluation techniques based on whether the inputs to these valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from\nindependent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s market assumptions. U.S. GAAP requires that valuation techniques maximize the use of observable\ninputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.\nFair Value Hierarchy\nU.S. GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy which categorizes the valuation inputs into three broad levels. Based on the underlying inputs, each fair value measurement in its\nentirety is reported in one of the three levels. These levels are:\nLevel 1 - Valuation is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.\nLevel 1 assets and liabilities generally include debt and equity securities that are traded in an active exchange market. Valuations are obtained from readily available\npricing sources for market transactions involving identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 - Valuation is based on inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. The\nvaluation may be based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be\ncorroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\nLevel 3 - Valuation is based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as\nwell as instruments for which determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.\nAn asset or liability’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nThe following describes the valuation techniques used by the Company to measure certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis in the\nfinancial statements:\nSecurities Available for Sale & Equity Securities\nDebt securities available for sale and equity securities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value measurement is based upon quoted market prices, when\navailable (Level 1). If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are measured utilizing independent valuation techniques of identical or similar securities for which\nsignificant assumptions are derived primarily from or corroborated by observable market data (Level 2). If the inputs used to provide the evaluation for certain securities are\nunobservable and/or there is little, if any, market activity then the security would fall to the lowest level of the hierarchy (Level 3).\nThe Company’s investment portfolio is valued using fair value measurements that are considered to be Level 1 or Level 2 but may also use Level 3 measurements if required by\nthe composition of the portfolio. The Bank has contracted with a securities portfolio accounting service provider for valuation of its securities portfolio. Most security types are\npriced using the securities accounting provider’s internally developed pricing software which appraises securities from an online real-time database. Subscription pricing\nservices such as ICE Data Services and Bloomberg Valuation Services may be used to supplement the internal pricing system for security types where the underlying collateral,\ncash flow projections or trade data is not readily available. If Level 1 or Level 2 inputs are not available, the software may rely upon a discounted cash flow analysis based on\nthe net present value of a security’s projected cash flow to arrive at fair market value. Valuations for direct obligations of the U.S. Treasury, exchange listed stock and preferred\nstock are obtained from on-line real-time databases.\n28\nTable of Contents\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe securities accounting service provider utilizes proprietary valuation matrices for valuing all municipal securities. The initial curves for determining the price, movement,\nand yield relationships within the municipal matrices are derived from industry benchmark curves or sourced from a municipal trading desk. The securities are further broken\ndown according to issuer, credit support, state of issuance and rating to incorporate additional spreads to the industry benchmark curves.\nThe following table presents the balances of financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis (dollars in thousands):\nFair Value Measurements Using\nFinancial Assets Balances Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nAs of September 30, 2024:\nAvailable for sale securities:\nU.S. government and federal agencies $ 129,725 $ 125,773 $ 3,952 $ —\nMortgage backed securities 8,229 — 8,229 —\nCorporate bonds 52,595 492 52,103 —\nState and municipal securities 104,205 — 104,205 —\nTotal available for sale securities $ 294,754 $ 126,265 $ 168,489 $ —\nEquity securities 527 527 — —\nTotal $ 295,281 $ 126,792 $ 168,489 $ —\nAs of December 31, 2023:\nAvailable for sale securities:\nU.S. government and federal agencies $ 92,297 $ 78,817 $ 13,480 $ —\nMortgage backed securities 8,649 — 8,649 —\nCorporate bonds 55,472 475 54,997 —\nState and municipal securities 101,696 — 101,696 —\nTotal available for sale securities $ 258,114 $ 79,292 $ 178,822 $ —\nEquity securities 505 505 — —\nTotal $ 258,619 $ 79,797 $ 178,822 $ —\nAssets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis\nCertain assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Adjustments to the fair value of these assets\nusually result from the application of lower-of-cost-or-market accounting or write-downs of individual assets.\nCollateral Dependent Loans\nIndividually evaluated loans are analyzed to determine whether they are collateral dependent. Any individually evaluated loans, which are deemed to be collateral dependent,\nwith an allocation to the ACL are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Any fair value adjustments are recorded in the period incurred as provision for credit losses\non the consolidated statements of income.\nThe measurement of loss associated with collateral dependent loans can be based on either the observable market price of the loan or fair value of the collateral. Fair value is\nmeasured based on the value of the collateral securing the loans. Collateral may be in the form of real estate or business assets including equipment, inventory, and accounts\nreceivable. The vast majority of the collateral is real estate. The value of real estate collateral is determined utilizing a market valuation approach based on an appraisal\nconducted by an independent, licensed appraiser outside of the Company using observable market data (Level 2). However, if the collateral is a house or building in the process\nof construction or if an appraisal of the real estate property using an income approach or is over two years old, then the fair value is considered Level 3. The value of business\nequipment is based upon an outside appraisal if deemed significant, or the net book value on the applicable business’s financial statements if not considered significant using\nobservable market data. Likewise, values for inventory and accounts receivables collateral are based on financial statement balances or aging reports (Level 3). Any fair\n29\nTable of Contents\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements\nvalue adjustments are recorded in the period incurred as a provision for loan credit losses on the consolidated statements of income. There were no collateral dependent loans\nwith a recorded reserve as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nOther Real Estate Owned\nOther real estate owned (“OREO”) is measured at fair value less costs to sell. Valuation of OREO is determined using current appraisals from independent parties, a Level 2\ninput. If current appraisals cannot be obtained, or if declines in value are identified after a recent appraisal is received, appraisal values may be discounted, resulting in a Level\n3 estimate. If the Company markets the property with a realtor, estimated selling costs reduce the fair value, resulting in a valuation based on Level 3 inputs. Fair value\nadjustments are recorded in the period incurred and expensed against current earnings. The Bank held no OREO at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nLoans Held for Sale\nLoans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value. These loans currently consist of 1-4 family residential loans originated for sale in the secondary market. Fair\nvalue is based on the price secondary markets are currently offering for similar loans using observable market data which is not materially different than cost due to the short\nduration between origination and sale (Level 2). As such, the Company records any fair value adjustments on a nonrecurring basis. No nonrecurring fair value adjustments were\nrecorded on loans held for sale at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.\nThere were no assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe following tables present the carrying value and estimated fair value including the level within the fair value hierarchy of the Company’s financial instruments as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands):\nFair Value Measurements Using\nCarrying Total\nAmount Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Fair Value\nAs of September 30, 2024:\nFinancial assets:\nCash and due from banks $ 639,767 $ 639,767 $ — $ — $ 639,767\nSecurities available for sale 294,754 126,265 168,489 — 294,754\nSecurities held to maturity, net 302,348 109,514 176,266 — 285,780\nEquity securities 527 527 — — 527\nRestricted securities 2,886 — 2,886 — 2,886\nLoans, net 295,826 — — 286,987 286,987\nAccrued interest receivable 5,360 — 5,360 — 5,360\nFinancial liabilities:\nDemand and savings deposits $ 1,421,999 $ — $ 1,249,724 $ 163,186 $ 1,412,910\nTime deposits 11,869 — — 11,829 11,829\nShort-term borrowings 10,000 — 10,000 — 10,000\nAccrued interest payable 25 — 25 — 25\n30\nTable of Contents\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements\nFair Value Measurements Using\nCarrying Total\nAmount Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Fair Value\nAs of December 31, 2023:\nFinancial assets:\nCash and due from banks $ 316,767 $ 316,767 $ — $ — $ 316,767\nSecurities available for sale 258,114 79,292 178,822 — 258,114\nSecurities held to maturity, net 308,058 106,837 177,079 — 283,916\nEquity securities 505 505 — — 505\nRestricted securities 2,613 — 2,613 — 2,613\nLoans, net 299,825 — — 280,352 280,352\nAccrued interest receivable 4,354 — 4,354 — 4,354\nFinancial liabilities:\nDemand and savings deposits $ 1,095,283 $ — $ 766,933 $ 299,765 $ 1,066,698\nTime deposits 16,742 — — 16,600 16,600\nShort-term borrowings 5,000 — 5,000 — 5,000\nAccrued interest payable 61 — 61 — 61\nNote 8.

Earnings Per Share\nEffective October 3, 2024, and pursuant to the stock Reclassification described in Note 2 - Capital Structure, the Company’s stock is comprised of two classes: Class A\nCommon Stock and Class B Common Stock. Except in regard to voting and conversion rights, the rights of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock are identical,\nand the classes rank equally and share ratably with regard to all other matters. Each share of Class B Common Stock is convertible at any time into one share of Class A\nCommon Stock.\nOn October 3, 2024, 26,876 existing shares of Old Common Stock held by the company’s pre-IPO investors were reclassified into 4,568,920 shares of Class B Common Stock.\nIn connection with the IPO, the Company issued 1,850,000 shares of Class A Common Stock on October 7, 2024 and 142,897 shares of Class A Common Stock on November\n1, 2024. See Note 2—Capital Structure in the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements contained within this Form 10-Q for further information regarding the\nstock Reclassification and the IPO.\nWhen declared by the Company’s Board of Directors, holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock are entitled to receive dividends equally and ratably on a\nper-share basis. The Company did not pay dividends to any stockholder during 2023 or the nine-month period ending September 30, 2024.\nUnder the two-class method, earnings available to common stockholders are allocated ratably on a per-share basis between Class A Common Stock and Class B Common\nStock. The table below provides a reconciliation of the combined Class A and Class B Common Stock numerators and denominators of the earnings per share computations.\nThe table gives effect to the Reclassification of 26,876 shares of Old Common Stock into 4,568,920 shares of Class B Common Stock on October 3, 2024.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and\nrelated notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes and the discussion under the\nheading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in our Prospectus. In\naddition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual\nresults to differ materially from our expectations. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q, particularly in the section entitled “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” as well as the section entitled “Risk Factors” in our\nProspectus. We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements except to the extent required by law.\nThe following discussion relates to our historical results, on a consolidated basis. Because we conduct all our material business operations through our wholly owned\nsubsidiary, Chain Bridge Bank, N.A., the discussion and analysis primarily focus on activities conducted at the subsidiary level.\nIntroduction\nChain Bridge Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”) is a Delaware-chartered bank holding company and the parent of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Chain Bridge Bank, N.A.\n(the “Bank”), a nationally chartered commercial bank with fiduciary powers granted by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC”). The Company was\nincorporated on May 26, 2006, and the Bank opened on August 6, 2007. The Company conducts substantially all of its operations through the Bank and has no other\nsubsidiaries.\nWe offer a range of commercial and personal banking services, including deposits, treasury management, payments, loans, commercial lending, residential mortgage\nfinancing, consumer loans, trusts and estate administration, wealth management, and asset custody.\nOur mission is to deliver exceptional banking and trust services nationwide, blending financial strength, personalized service, and advanced technology to offer tailored\nsolutions to businesses, non-profit organizations, political organizations, individuals, and families. We aspire to grow responsibly by adapting our personalized service and\nadvanced technology solutions to our clients’ evolving needs while emphasizing liquidity, asset quality, and financial strength. We aim to be recognized for our “Strength,\nService, Solutions: Your Bridge to Better Banking Nationwide.”\nReclassification and Initial Public Offering\nOn October 3, 2024, in connection with its initial public offering (the “IPO”) Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Class A Common Stock”), the Company\nreclassified and converted each outstanding share of the Company’s existing common stock, par value $1.00 per share, into 170 shares of Class B common stock, par value\n$0.01 per share (“Class B Common Stock”) (the “Reclassification”).\nOn October 7, 2024, the Company completed an offering of 1,850,000 shares of Class A Common Stock and received net proceeds of approximately $33.6 million after\ndeducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. On November 1, 2024, the Company issued an additional 142,897, shares of Class A\nCommon Stock as a result of the underwriters’ exercise of their 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 277,500 shares of its Class A Common Stock, resulting in net\nproceeds to the Company of approximately $2.9 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses.\nShare information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is presented on an as adjusted basis giving effect to the Reclassification.\n35\nTable of Contents\nNine Months ended September 30, 2024 Highlights\nHighlights of our results of operations and financial condition as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are provided below.\nFinancial Performance\n• Consolidated net income was $17.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $5.5 million for the nine months ended September 30,\n2023. Earnings per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $3.77, compared to $1.21 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.4\n• Net interest income, before provision for, or recapture of, credit losses, was $33.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $20.0\nmillion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net interest income, after provision for, or recapture of, credit losses was $33.4 million for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, compared to $19.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n• Return on average equity was 25.00% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 10.10% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Return\non average assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.79%, compared to 0.72% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n• Yield on average earning assets was 3.77% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.05% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nCost of funds decreased to 0.32% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 0.44% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nBalance Sheet\n• Total assets were $1.6 billion as of September 30, 2024, compared to $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2023. Total deposits were $1.4 billion as of September 30,\n2024, compared to $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2023. Excluded from these totals are One-Way Sell® deposits, which were placed at other banks through the\nIntraFi Cash Service® (“ICS®”) network. These One-Way Sell® deposits amounted to $432.3 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $130.1 million as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\n• No non-performing assets or other real estate owned (“OREO”) were reported as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.\n• Cash balances held at the Federal Reserve were $627.0 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $309.8 million as of December 31, 2023.\n• As of September 30, 2024, the Bank’s total investment debt securities portfolio balance was $597.1 million, compared to $566.2 million as of December 31, 2023.\n• Book value per share was $22.95 as of September 30, 2024, compared to $18.26 as of December 31, 2023.\n• As of September 30, 2024, the Bank exceeded the minimum requirements to be well-capitalized for bank regulatory purposes, with a total risk-based capital ratio\nof 29.29% and a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 28.17%.\n• As of September 30, 2024, our liquidity ratio was 85.31%, compared to 78.75% as of December 31, 2023.\nSignificant Factors Impacting Our Business, Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nSeveral key factors impact our financial performance:\nShort-term interest rates: The cyclical nature of our balance sheet and our focus on liquidity cause our primary revenue source, net interest income, to be highly\ncorrelated to short-term interest rates. We strive to maintain high liquidity and low loan-to-deposit ratios. Higher rates generally increase our net interest income because of our\nhigh levels of liquid interest-earning assets and low levels of interest-bearing deposits and borrowings. Conversely, if short-term interest rates fall, our net interest income\nwould likely decrease due to our high levels of cash. The Federal Reserve began reducing its target federal funds rate in September 2024, and as short-term rates decline, our\nnet interest income will be adversely affected. This relationship between our revenue and the yield curve may differ from that of banks that have lower levels of cash and\nliquidity and higher loan-to-deposit ratios.\nPolitical organizations and federal election cycles: We provide deposit services to a wide range of political organizations, including political committees registered with\nthe Federal Election Commission (“FEC”), such as campaign committees, party committees, and PACs and Super PACs, and other tax-exempt 527 organizations. These\naccounts are often associated with firms that provide treasury, legal or regulatory compliance services to political organizations. We estimate that at least a majority of our\ndeposits were sourced from political organizations as of September 30, 2024.\n4 All earnings are attributed to Class B shares because no Class A shares were outstanding during the periods presented.\n36\nTable of Contents\nFederal election cycles significantly affect our deposit levels. These cycles also impact revenue-generating activities, such as wire transfers, payments, check processing,\ndebit card usage, and treasury management services. Historically, in the quarters leading up to federal elections, especially presidential elections, our deposits, net interest\nincome, and noninterest income generally increase. In the quarters during and after a federal election, we usually experience an outflow of our political organization deposits,\ncausing our balance sheet and revenue to decline until clients resume fundraising for the next election cycle. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank experienced elevated deposit\nlevels ahead of the November 2024 presidential election, consistent with patterns observed in previous election cycles.\nBetween October 1, 2024, and November 12, 2024, deposits from political organizations declined. The Bank expects deposit outflows to continue through the end of the\nfourth quarter of 2024 and into early 2025. The deposit outflows observed between October 1, 2024, and November 12, 2024, occurred at levels consistent with patterns we\nhave experienced during prior federal election cycles. See Note 5—Deposits in the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements contained within this Form 10-Q.\nHowever, future deposit levels and the timing of deposit fluctuations are difficult to predict and may differ from historical patterns. Our political organization clients are\noverwhelmingly affiliated with the Republican Party, and, as a result of the November 2024 federal elections, our clients’ post-election fundraising activities and deposit\ntrajectories may be impacted. While we have previously provided banking services to certain key political organizations during election cycles, there is no assurance that we\nwill be selected to provide such services in the future. Changes in deposit levels could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations, as discussed in the\n“Risk Factors” section in our Prospectus. To mitigate the risks associated with deposit seasonality, we aim to maintain a relatively high level of cash reserve deposits at the\nFederal Reserve.\nLending approach: Our lending policies are designed to manage credit risk. We seek borrowers with a strong capacity to repay, who have good financial habits, are\ngenerally debt averse, and prefer to repay loans quickly. We aim to mitigate credit risk on commercial loans with appropriate structuring, reasonably margined collateral,\npersonal guarantees, a primary deposit relationship, and sometimes compensating balances. Our lending policies typically attract borrowers who may qualify for lower\nborrowing rates, which may result in lower yields for us.\nEconomic conditions: General economic conditions, including conditions in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, and government spending influence our deposit\nlevels and earnings. As of September 30, 2024, we estimate that at least a majority of our deposit balances were sourced from political organizations, which we believe makes\nus less dependent on the broader economy. However, if the economy worsens, some political donors may contribute less, negatively impacting our deposit levels and income. In\naddition, a national or regional recession could increase the risk of loan defaults and negatively affect our municipal and corporate bonds, potentially leading to defaults. In\nparticular, significant changes in government spending, particularly federal budget cuts, could adversely affect the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area economy and,\nconsequently, our loan performance and deposit levels. Such changes may also impact the value of our investment securities portfolio, which includes U.S. government,\nmunicipal, and corporate bonds. Finally, rising inflation can increase our operational costs, including labor and technology expenses, while also potentially diminishing the\npurchasing power of our clients, further impacting our deposit and loan levels.\nMonetary Policy: We rely on the Federal Reserve’s payment of interest on reserve balances as a source of interest income. The rate of interest on reserve balances is\ndetermined by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has historically adjusted its interest on reserves rate in conjunction with the federal funds rate. Because this rate affects\nother money market yields, it can have a significant impact on our interest income. We are most exposed to monetary policy during federal election years such as in 2024 when\ncampaign-related deposits rise and we match those liabilities with short-term assets such as Federal Reserve cash balances, which reprice immediately, and Treasury bills.\nAlthough higher interest rates decrease the value of our investment securities portfolio, they increase our interest income. While we have recently benefited from high short-\nterm rates, the Federal Reserve began reducing its target federal funds rate in 2024. To the extent short-term rates decline, our net interest income will be adversely affected.\nThe Federal Reserve has additional monetary tools that can impact our interest income through changes in rates, such as the overnight reverse repo rate and open market\noperations.\nRegulatory and Supervisory Environment: We incur significant costs due to our regulation and supervision by the federal government. As a bank holding company, we\nare subject to comprehensive supervision and regulatory oversight by the Federal Reserve. The Bank’s primary regulator and supervisor is the OCC, which through regular\nexaminations oversees our operations, risk management, compliance, and corporate governance. The Bank is also subject to FDIC secondary regulatory oversight that focuses\non insurance standards, risk management practices, and overall regulatory compliance. We pay assessments to the FDIC and the OCC for their insurance and supervision. In\naddition, we manage our balance sheet to meet regulatory standards, such as capital ratio requirements. Failure to meet these standards may result in corrective actions,\nrestrictions, and increased scrutiny from federal regulators. By adhering to these requirements, we aim to maintain our financial health and strengthen our market position. See\n“Supervision and Regulation.”\n37\nTable of Contents\nUninsured Deposits: Most of our deposits come from commercial clients rather than retail clients, resulting in a relatively high level of account balances exceeding the\nFDIC coverage limits. As of September 30, 2024, we estimate that approximately 81.4% of our total deposits were not insured by the FDIC. To manage the associated risks, we\naim to maintain high levels of liquidity, asset quality, and financial strength.\nFor clients with uninsured balances, we offer access to additional FDIC insurance coverage by placing their deposits in increments within the insurance limits at other\nbanks through the ICS® network. We typically earn fee income from ICS® for deposits that are placed at other banks as One-Way Sell® deposits, or we earn interest income\nwhen we choose to receive reciprocal deposits through ICS®. Using the ICS® program helps us to manage the size of our balance sheet. See “— Financial Condition —\nDeposits” below.\nPublic Company Costs: In preparation for, and following the completion of, our IPO, we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, additional costs associated with\noperating as a public company. We expect that these costs will include additional personnel, legal, consulting, regulatory, insurance, accounting, investor relations and other\nexpenses that we did not incur as a private company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules adopted by the SEC and national securities exchanges, requires public companies\nto implement specified corporate governance practices that are now applicable to us as a public company. These additional rules and regulations will increase our legal,\nregulatory and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time consuming and costly.\nPrimary Factors Used to Evaluate Our Business\nThe most significant factors we use to evaluate our business and results of operations are net income, return on average equity, return on average assets and return on\naverage risk-weighted assets. We also use net interest income, noninterest income and noninterest expense.\nNet Income. Our net income depends substantially on net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets (usually interest-\nbearing cash, investment securities and loans) and the interest expense incurred in connection with interest-bearing liabilities (usually interest-bearing deposits and borrowings).\nOur net income also depends on noninterest income, which is income generated other than by our interest-earning assets. Other factors that influence our net income include\nour provisions for credit losses, income taxes, and noninterest expenses, which include our fixed and variable overhead costs and other miscellaneous operating expenses.\nReturn on Average Equity. We use return on average equity to assess our effectiveness in utilizing stockholders’ equity to generate net income. In determining return on\naverage equity for a given period, net income is divided by the average stockholders’ equity for that period.\nReturn on Average Assets. We monitor return on average assets to measure our operating performance and to determine how efficiently our assets are being used to\ngenerate net income. In determining return on average assets for a given period, net income is divided by the average total assets for that period.\nReturn on Average Risk-Weighted Assets. We use return on average risk-weighted assets to measure how efficiently our assets are being used to generate net income on a\nrisk-adjusted basis. Return on average risk-weighted assets is calculated as annualized net income divided by the average of quarter end risk-weighted assets over the period\nobserved.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income, representing interest income less interest expense, is the largest component of our net income. The level of net interest income\nis primarily a function of the average balance of interest-earning assets, the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities and the spread between the realized yield on such\nassets and the cost of such liabilities. Net interest income is impacted by the relative mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and movements in market\ninterest rates. Net interest income and net interest margin in any one period can be significantly affected by a variety of factors, including the mix and overall size of our\nearning assets portfolio and the cost of funding those assets. Management calculates the cost of funds performance indicator to monitor funding costs. Cost of funds is\ncalculated as total interest expense divided by the sum of average total interest-bearing liabilities and average demand deposits.\nNoninterest Income. Noninterest income consists primarily of service charge income earned from deposit placement services, service charges on accounts, revenue from\ntrust and wealth management services, gains on sale of mortgage loans, net gains or losses on sales of securities and other income. The Company records as noninterest income\ndeposit placement services income for One-Way Sell® deposits which are sold into the ICS® network. See “— Financial Condition\n38\nTable of Contents\n— Deposits” for more information on these deposits. Service charges on deposit accounts include fees earned from monthly service charges, account analysis charges and\ninterchange fee income. It also includes fees charged for transaction activities such as wire transfers, cash letters and overdrafts. Trust and wealth management income\nrepresents monthly service charges due from clients for managing and administering clients’ assets. Services include investment management and advisory services, custody of\nassets, trust services, and financial planning. Other income primarily relates to rental income and other minor items.\nNoninterest Expense. Noninterest expense relates to fixed and variable overhead costs, the largest component of which is personnel expenses, including salaries and\nemployee benefits. Certain expenses tend to vary based on the volume of activity and other factors, including data processing and communication expenses, occupancy,\nequipment expense, regulatory assessments and fees, marketing and business development costs, insurance expenses and other operating expenses.\nData processing and communication expenses primarily relate to expenses paid to third party providers of core processing, cloud computing and cybersecurity, a\nsubstantial component of which is paid to a core technology provider we rely on for the banking software used by our clients and back office functions. Professional services\nexpenses include internal and external audit, legal, loan review, compliance audit and compliance monitoring fees. Occupancy and equipment expenses include depreciation for\nbuildings and improvements, fixtures and furniture, equipment, and technology related items as well as building related expenses such as utilities and maintenance costs. The\nCommonwealth of Virginia levies a capital-based franchise tax on banks operating within the state, replacing the state income tax. FDIC and regulatory assessments represent\ncosts incurred to cover quarterly or semi-annual payments to the FDIC or OCC for their insurance or supervision. FDIC assessments are based on a complicated matrix of\nfactors to form an assessment rate, which is then applied to a base of quarterly average assets less quarterly tangible equity. Directors’ fees represent fees paid to our directors\nfor board or committee meetings. Marketing and business development costs include sponsorships, membership dues, as well as marketing and advertising costs, which are\nsubject to normal variability based on the volume and cost of sponsorship and business development activities. Insurance expenses include costs for coverage of fidelity bond,\nprofessional liability, property and casualty, workers compensation and cyber liability policies. Other operating costs include other operating and administrative costs such as\nother vendor and employee costs, postage and printing, office supplies, and subscriptions.\nAs discussed above, we expect our noninterest expenses to increase as a result of the additional costs associated with being a public company.\nPrimary Factors Used to Evaluate Our Financial Condition\nThe most significant factors we use to evaluate and manage our financial condition include liquidity, asset quality and capital.\nLiquidity. Maintaining an adequate level of liquidity depends on our ability to efficiently meet both expected and unexpected cash flows and collateral needs without\nadversely affecting our daily operations or the financial condition of the Bank. Because transaction account deposits form a primary source of our funding, and generally can be\nwithdrawn on demand, managing our liquidity is a top priority. Our account at the Federal Reserve, which held $627.0 million as of September 30, 2024, is a primary source of\nour liquidity for daily and ongoing activities.\nAsset Quality. We monitor the quality of our assets based upon several factors, including the level and severity of deterioration in borrower cash flows and asset quality.\nWe aim to adjust the allowance for credit losses to reflect loan volumes, identified credit and collateral conditions, economic conditions and other qualitative factors.\nCapital. We manage capital to comply with our internal planning targets and regulatory capital standards. We monitor capital levels on an ongoing basis, perform periodic\nevaluations under stress scenarios and project capital levels in connection with our strategic goals to ensure appropriate capital levels. We evaluate a number of capital ratios,\nincluding Tier 1 capital to total quarterly average assets (the leverage ratio) and total Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements according to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). Preparing these statements\nrequires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and the reported amounts of revenues and\nexpenses during\n39\nTable of Contents\nthe reporting period. We believe that the estimates most susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to determining the allowance for credit losses on loans and\nheld-to-maturity securities. Our significant accounting policies and the effects of new accounting pronouncements are detailed in Note 1, “Organization and Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies,” to our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our Prospectus.\nResults of Operations\nNet Income\nThe following table sets forth the principal components of net income for the periods indicated.\nFor Three Months Ended September 30, For Nine Months Ended September 30,\n$ % $ %\n(dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Change 2024 2023 Change Change\nInterest and dividend income $ 14,668 $ 8,143 $ 6,525 80.1 % $ 35,858 $ 23,082 $ 12,776 55.4 %\nInterest expense 1,022 957 65 6.8 % 2,846 3,106 (260) (8.4 %)\nNet interest income 13,646 7,186 6,460 89.9 % 33,012 19,976 13,036 65.3 %\n(Recapture of) provision for credit\nlosses (118) 7 (125) N/M (410) 722 (1,132) N/M\nNet interest income after (recapture\nof) provision for credit losses 13,764 7,179 6,585 91.7 % 33,422 19,254 14,168 73.6 %\nNoninterest income 3,080 1,221 1,859 152.3 % 7,358 1,941 5,417 279.1 %\nNoninterest expense 7,432 4,881 2,551 52.3 % 19,178 14,441 4,737 32.8 %\nNet income before taxes 9,412 3,519 5,893 167.5 % 21,602 6,754 14,848 219.8 %\nIncome tax expense 1,925 676 1,249 184.8 % 4,393 1,237 3,156 255.1 %\nNet income $ 7,487 $ 2,843 $ 4,644 163.3 % $ 17,209 $ 5,517 $ 11,692 211.9 %\n__________\nNM — Comparisons from positive to negative values or to zero values are considered not meaningful.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, our net income increased by $4.6 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a\n$6.5 million, or 89.9%, increase in net interest income. Earnings also benefited from a $1.9 million increase in noninterest income, derived primarily from fee income earned\nfrom One-Way Sell® deposit accounts. An increase of $2.6 million in noninterest expense, driven most notably by increases in employment and professional services costs,\npartially offset these positive earnings components.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net income increased by $11.7 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a\n$13.0 million, or 65.3%, increase in net interest income. Earnings also benefited from a $5.4 million increase in noninterest income, derived primarily from fee income earned\nfrom One-Way Sell® deposit accounts, and a $1.1 million reduction of the credit loss provision, primarily resulting from the partial recovery of a bond in the first quarter of\n2024 that was charged off during the first quarter of 2023, and a recapture of the provision for bond credit losses as shorter maturity periods result in a lower credit risk rating.\nAn increase of $4.7 million in noninterest expense, driven most notably by increases in employment and professional services costs associated with the stock Reclassification,\npartially offset these positive earnings components.\n40\nTable of Contents\nNet Interest Income Analysis\nOur operating results depend primarily on our net interest income, which is calculated as the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets and interest\nexpense on interest-bearing liabilities. Interest and dividend income consists of interest and fees on loans, interest and dividends on taxable and tax-exempt securities, and\ninterest on interest-bearing deposits in banks.

This increase was primarily\ndue to cyclical inflows of deposits from political organizations ahead of the 2024 federal elections, which started building in the second half of 2023 and were invested in\ninterest-earning assets, such as reserves at the Federal Reserve. As a result, our net interest margin increased to 3.73% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from\n2.78% for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net interest income increased by $13.0 million, or 65.3%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023,\nprimarily driven by a $285.0 million increase in the average volume of interest-bearing deposits in other banks, principally at the Federal Reserve. This increase was primarily\ndue to cyclical inflows of deposits from political organizations ahead of the 2024 federal elections, which started building in the second half of 2023 and were invested in\ninterest-earning assets, such as reserves at the Federal Reserve. As a result, our net interest margin increased to 3.47% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from\n2.64% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nInterest Income\nInterest and fees on loans. Loan interest income is comprised of fixed and adjustable-rate structures related to residential and commercial real estate loan products,\ncommercial loans and other consumer loan products. Deferred loan origination fees, net of deferred loan origination costs, accrete to the loan’s yield over the life of the loan.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, our interest and fees on loans increased 0.8% to $3.4 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023\nprimarily driven by a 0.2% increase in average yield which was offset by a reduction of the average total loan balance of $11.4 million. The Company has strategically allowed\na decline in the commercial real estate portfolio. Rising interest rates have increased the cost of borrowing and remote work trends continue to be a concern\n44\nTable of Contents\nfor this portfolio. These factors negatively impact the value of commercial properties, making commercial real estate loans less attractive.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our interest and fees on loans decreased 0.1% to $10.1 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023\nprimarily driven by a 0.2% increase in average yield which was offset by a reduction of the average total loan balance of $14.5 million. The months following a general\nelection, including the first nine months of 2023, often see elevated commercial and industrial loan balances, as political organizations typically utilize their lines of credit\naround election periods and may replay these balances over the subsequent six to twelve months, or as cash flows allow. In addition, rising interest rates caused a reduction in\ndemand for consumer loans during the time between interim periods, and management has strategically allowed a decline in the commercial real estate portfolio. Rising interest\nrates have increased the cost of borrowing and remote work trends continue to be a concern for this portfolio. These factors negatively impact the value of commercial\nproperties, making commercial real estate loans less attractive.\nSee “— Financial Condition — Loan Portfolio” below for an analysis of the composition of our loan portfolio.\nInterest and dividends on securities, taxable. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our interest and dividends on taxable securities increased 30.4% to $3.6\nmillion from $2.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The average balance for all taxable securities increased $27.1 million when comparing the periods,\nand the yield improved 0.50%. As portions of maturing bonds have been reinvested, we have observed a steady increase in the average yield for the taxable securities portfolio.\nIn addition to actively reinvesting maturing bonds during the second half of 2024, the Company invested funds from temporarily elevated deposit levels in short term U.S.\nTreasury bonds that will mature during the fourth quarter of 2024, which is intended to align with the timing of expected deposit outflows following the 2024 federal elections.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our interest and dividends on taxable securities increased 11.4% to $9.3 million from $8.4 million for the nine months\nended September 30, 2023. The average balance for all taxable securities decreased $8.0 million when comparing the periods, although the decline was fully offset by a 0.27%\nincrease in yield. As portions of maturing bonds have been reinvested, we have observed a steady increase in the average yield for the taxable securities portfolio.\nInterest on securities, tax-exempt. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our interest on tax-exempt securities decreased 6.6% from the prior period due\nprimarily to a $3.8 million decline in the average balance of tax-exempt securities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our interest on tax-exempt securities\ndecreased 6.0% from the prior period due primarily to a $3.7 million decline in the average balance of tax-exempt securities. In recent years, the attainable yields for any new\ninvestment in this segment and the investment landscape have left tax-exempt securities less attractive than their taxable counterparts. Accordingly, as tax-exempt securities\nhave matured, those proceeds have been invested into taxable municipal securities.\nSee “— Financial Condition — Securities” below for an analysis of the composition of the securities portfolio, including taxable and tax-exempt securities.\nInterest on interest-bearing deposits in banks. Chain Bridge earns interest for accounts held at certain correspondent banks, which are primarily reserves held at the\nFederal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has historically adjusted its interest on reserves rate in conjunction with the federal funds rate. The interest rate paid by the Federal\nReserve on reserve balances increased from 5.15% to 5.40% on July 27, 2023 and decreased from 5.40% to 4.90% on September 29, 2024. For the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, our interest on interest-bearing deposits in banks increased by $5.7 million compared to the prior period, primarily driven by a $417.5 million increase in\naverage balances. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our interest on interest-bearing deposits in banks increased by $11.9 million compared to the prior period,\nprimarily driven by a $285.0 million increase in average balances, in addition to a 0.33% increase in the average yield for the period.\nInterest Expense\nInterest on deposits. The Bank pays a variable interest rate to depositors for their non-maturing savings, interest-bearing checking, and money market accounts. In\naddition, the Bank issues time deposits that pay a fixed rate of interest until the instrument matures. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our interest expense on\ndeposits decreased 5.6% compared to the prior period. The decrease was primarily driven by a $64.7 million decrease in average interest-bearing deposit balances, partially\noffset by a 0.27% increase in the average rate. For the nine months ended September 30,\n45\nTable of Contents\n2024, our interest expense on deposits decreased 13.6% compared to the prior period. The decrease was primarily driven by a $75.0 million decrease in average interest-bearing\ndeposit balances, partially offset by a 0.16% increase in the average rate. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximately 87.2% and 69.0%, respectively, of\nour deposits were noninterest bearing.\nSee “— Financial Condition — Deposits” for an analysis of the composition of the deposits portfolio, including its interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing components.\nInterest on short-term borrowings. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an outstanding balance of $10.0 million on its $10.0 million unsecured line of credit with\na correspondent bank. The interest rate applicable to advances under this unsecured line of credit is determined by the reference rate the Company elects to have applied to the\nadvance, which may be the correspondent bank’s base rate, the daily Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) or a term SOFR rate, plus a credit spread adjustment. This\nline of credit is held by the Company, not the Bank. On October 10, 2024, the Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the IPO to fully repay the $10.0 million\noutstanding principal balance on this line of credit and closed the line on October 11, 2024. Substantially all interest on short-term borrowings is related to this line of credit.\nThe Bank currently has no borrowings, and there are no outstanding draws on its lines of credit with the FHLB, the Federal Reserve, or other third-party institutions.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, interest on short-term borrowings increased by 117.7% compared to the prior period, primarily due to a $5.0 million\nincrease in the average outstanding balance as well as an increase in the average rate from 7.62% to 8.31%. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest on short-\nterm borrowings increased by 44.0% compared to the prior period, due to a $1.5 million increase in the average outstanding balance as well as an increase in the average rate\nfrom 7.27% to 8.09%.\nProvision for Credit Losses\nThe allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) represents an amount which, in management’s judgment, is adequate to absorb the lifetime expected credit losses that may be\nsustained on outstanding loans and investments at the balance sheet date. The provision for credit losses represents the amount of expense charged to current earnings to fund\nan increase in the ACL. Conversely, a recapture of credit loss is recorded to earnings when the ACL is reduced. Our provisions for or recaptures of credit losses arising from\nwithin the loan and securities portfolios were as follows:\nFor the three months ended September 30, For the nine months ended September 30,\n$ % $ %\n(dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Change 2024 2023 Change Change\nProvision for (recapture of) credit losses\nProvision for (recapture of) loan credit losses $ (131) $ 1 $ (132) NM $ (113) $ (82) $ (31) 37.8 %\nProvision for (recapture of) securities credit\nlosses 13 6 7 116.7 % (297) 804 (1,101) NM\nTotal provision for (recapture of) credit\nlosses $ (118) $ 7 $ (125) (1785.7 %) $ (410) $ 722 $ (1,132) (156.8 %)\n__________\nNM — Comparisons from positive to negative values or to zero values are considered not meaningful.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, our provision for credit losses consisted of a net recapture of $118 thousand, primarily attributable to the reduction in\nour loan portfolio, compared to a net provision of $7 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our provision for credit losses consisted of a net recapture of $410 thousand, compared to a net provision of $722\nthousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received proceeds totaling $210 thousand for a bond we wrote\noff in its entirety during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 related to a single corporate issuer whose business was ultimately closed by a regulatory authority. In\naddition, we recaptured provisions totaling $297 thousand because the shortening time to maturity of our held to maturity securities portfolio resulted in a lower required\nreserve in accordance with our ACL\n46\nTable of Contents\nmethodology, compared to the $804 thousand provision for securities credit losses recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 which pertains to a single corporate\nbond discussed above.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income consists of deposit placement services income, service charges on deposit accounts, trust and wealth management income, gains on sale of mortgage\nloans, net gains or losses on sales of securities and other income.\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n$ % $ %\n(dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Change 2024 2023 Change Change\nNoninterest income\nDeposit placement services income $ 2,464 $ 859 $ 1,605 186.8 % $ 5,617 $ 1,106 $ 4,511 407.9 %\nService charges on accounts 376 227 149 65.6 % 1,008 651 357 54.8 %\nTrust and wealth management income 243 149 94 63.1 % 669 407 262 64.4 %\nGain on sale of mortgage loans 13 — 13 NM 25 — 25 NM\nLoss on sale of securities (65) (30) (35) 116.7 % (65) (312) 247 (79.2 %)\nOther income 49 16 33 206.3 % 104 89 15 16.9 %\nTotal noninterest income $ 3,080 $ 1,221 $ 1,859 152.3 % $ 7,358 $ 1,941 $ 5,417 279.1 %\n__________\nNM — Comparisons from positive to negative values or to zero values are considered not meaningful.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, our noninterest income increased by $1.9 million, or 152.3%, to $3.1 million compared to the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 primarily driven by an increase in deposit placement services income, which is fee income we earn on One-Way Sell® deposits sold through the ICS®\nnetwork. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our noninterest income increased by $5.4 million, or 279.1%, to 7.4 million compared to the prior period primarily\ndriven by an increase in fee income on One-Way Sell® deposits sold through the ICS® network, and partially offset by a loss on the sale of corporate bonds.\nDeposit placement services income. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our deposit placement services income increased by $1.6 million compared to the\nthree months ended September 30, 2023 on account of higher One-Way Sell® deposit balances. As of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, One-Way Sell® deposits\ntotaled $432.3 million and $106.3 million, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, our average One-Way Sell® deposits were\n$491.3 million and $178.1 million, respectively.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our deposit placement services income increased by $4.5 million to $5.6 million compared to the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. During both comparative periods, the increase in deposit placement services income is a direct result of the increase in the volume of One-Way Sell®\ndeposits, and changes in the rate paid by ICS® for those deposits which typically adjust in a manner parallel to federal funds rate adjustments. Accounts enrolled in the ICS®\nnetwork are further discussed under “— Financial Condition — Deposits” below.\nService charges on accounts. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our service charges on accounts increased by $149 thousand, or 65.6%, compared to the\nthree months ended September 30, 2023 primarily driven by higher transaction volume, particularly among check processing, wire transfers and debit card usage. Our fee\nincome is typically higher during the fiscal quarters prior to and during the general election as political organization deposit account activity causes an increase in bank\ntransactions. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our service charges on accounts increased 54.8% compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 also due\nto the higher transaction volume associated with an election year.\nTrust and wealth management income. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our trust and wealth management income increased by 63.1% and\n64.4%, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. These increases were primarily due to a rise in the volume of total assets under administration,\nwhich grew to $384.0 million at September 30, 2024 from $185.8 million at September 30, 2023. The size and mix of the assets under administration drove the income growth.\nAssets under management, which produce a higher rate of income under our fee structure, increased 56.9% from September 30, 2023, while assets under custody increased\n137.3% over the same period.\n47\nTable of Contents\nOur trust and wealth management services utilize service charge structures for assets under management (“AUM”) and assets under custody (“AUC”) that are distinct\nwith respect to the level and range of services used. Service charges for AUM are calculated as a percentage of the assets managed, with the rate varying based on the type of\nservice provided, such as investment management or fiduciary services, and tiered based on the value of the assets under management. These service charges are not\nperformance-based. Service charges for AUC are also tiered based on the value of the assets under custody, and are generally lower than the service charges for AUM,\nreflecting the more limited services provided, such as safekeeping and administrative functions.\nThe service charges we collect for AUM are subject to fluctuations in the total value of assets managed, which can vary with changes in market conditions, including\nstock prices and bond yields. Therefore, any significant market volatility or changes in interest rates could impact the valuation of the assets we manage, thereby affecting the\nservice fees we collect.\nThe growth in AUC during the periods was largely driven by clients seeking higher interest rates. A material decline in interest rates could result in a reduction of custody\nbalances, negatively impacting our revenue from these accounts. Additionally, a substantial portion of our custody account balances are related to political organizations, which\nare seasonal and are expected to decline following periods of high spending around federal elections.\nGain on sale of mortgage loans. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the gain on sale of mortgages increased by $13 thousand and $25 thousand\ncompared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, which had no gains from sales of mortgage loans because there was no sales activity during the 2023 period.\nLoss on sale of securities. Because Chain Bridge historically has not actively engaged in bond sales, gains and losses from sales of securities are irregular. For the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, we incurred $65 thousand in losses on sales of securities compared to a $30 thousand loss for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our loss on sale of securities was $65 thousand, compared to a $312 thousand loss for the nine months ended September 31,\n2023. Sales for all periods in 2024 and 2023 were a result of decisions to divest of specific corporate issuers.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense consists of salaries and employee benefits, data processing and communication expenses, professional services, occupancy and equipment expenses,\nVirginia bank franchise tax, FDIC and regulatory assessments, directors’ fees, marketing and business development costs, insurance expenses, and other operating expenses.\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n$ % $ %\n(dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Change 2024 2023 Change Change\nNoninterest expenses\nSalaries and employee benefits $ 4,280 $ 3,116 $ 1,164 37.4 % $ 11,553 $ 9,237 $ 2,316 25.1 %\nProfessional services 1,206 207 999 482.6 % 2,154 623 1,531 245.7 %\nData processing and communication expenses 669 570 99 17.4 % 1,928 1,683 245 14.6 %\nVirginia bank franchise tax 253 188 65 34.6 % 604 695 (91) (13.1 %)\nOccupancy and equipment expenses 236 232 4 1.7 % 748 564 184 32.6 %\nFDIC and regulatory assessments 212 159 53 33.3 % 560 443 117 26.4 %\nDirectors fees 191 100 91 91.0 % 523 286 237 82.9 %\nInsurance expenses 61 54 7 13.0 181 166 15 9.0 %\nMarketing and business development costs 47 48 (1) (2.1 %) 169 170 (1) (0.6 %)\nOther operating expenses 277 207 70 33.8 % 758 574 184 32.1 %\nTotal noninterest expenses $ 7,432 $ 4,881 $ 2,551 52.3 % $ 19,178 $ 14,441 $ 4,737 32.8 %\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, our noninterest expense increased by $2.6 million, or 52.3%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023,\nprimarily driven by increases in salaries and employee benefits and professional service expenses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our noninterest expense\nincreased by\n48\nTable of Contents\n$4.7 million, or 32.8%, compared to the prior year, primarily driven by increases in salaries and employee benefits costs, as well as an increase in professional services costs\nrelated to the process of becoming a public company and costs associated with the Reclassification.\nSalaries and employee benefits. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our salaries and employee benefits increased by $1.2 million, or 37.4%, compared to the\nthree months ended September 30, 2023, resulting from higher headcount and salary increases. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our salaries and employee\nbenefits increased $2.3 million, or 25.1%, compared to the corresponding period in the prior year driven by salary increases and higher employee benefits plan costs. Deferred\nloan origination costs have the effect of reducing salaries expense during the period when a loan is originated. When loan origination volume declines, so too does the amount\nof deferred loan origination costs.\nProfessional services. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our professional services expense increased $999 thousand, or 482.6%, compared to the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by legal and consulting expenses incurred in connection with the Reclassification and public company readiness. For\nsimilar reasons, our professional services expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased $1.5 million, or 245.7%.\nData processing and communication expenses. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our data processing and communication expenses increased $99\nthousand, or 17.4%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, driven by higher data processing expenses charged by our core provider, the installation of a new\nfinancial reporting tool, and increased costs associated with enhanced information technology (“IT”) functionality. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our data\nprocessing and communication expenses increased $245 thousand, or 14.6%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by increased data\nprocessing fees charged by our core provider arising from periodic rate increases and purchases of new products, increased cloud computing and cybersecurity costs incurred\nwith our IT-managed services provider, and an increase in core processing expenses incurred by the Trust & Wealth Department on account of growth in managed assets and\ncustody accounts.\nVirginia bank franchise tax. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our Virginia bank franchise tax increased $65 thousand, or 34.6%, compared to the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. Our Virginia bank franchise tax decreased 13.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the corresponding period in\nthe prior year. The franchise tax expense is based on estimated accruals throughout the year, and the Bank's adjusted capital serves as the basis for tax to be paid. Changes to\ncapital expectations, total asset at each quarter end, and other factors that offset the taxable base cause the expense to fluctuate slightly throughout a year.\nOccupancy and equipment expenses. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our occupancy and equipment expenses remained steady compared to the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our occupancy and equipment expenses increased $184 thousand, or 32.6%, compared to\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by building maintenance costs.\nFDIC and regulatory assessments. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our FDIC and regulatory assessments expense increased $53 thousand, or 33.3%, due\nto the growth in the Bank’s assets between the comparative periods. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our FDIC and regulatory assessments increased $117\nthousand, or 26.4%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by high year-over-year asset growth and a declining leverage ratio compared to\n2023, a non-election year.\nDirectors’ fees. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our directors’ fees increased by $91 thousand and $237 thousand, respectively, compared to the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by an increase in the number of board and committee meetings and training for newly appointed members.\nInsurance expenses. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our insurance expenses were relatively unchanged, compared to the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2023.\nMarketing and business development costs. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our marketing and business development costs were relatively\nunchanged, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nOther operating costs. This segment includes other operating and administrative costs such as other vendor and employee costs, postage and printing, office supplies and\nsubscriptions. None of the components or fluctuations are\n49\nTable of Contents\nindividually significant, and the increase in our other operating costs during both periods were driven primarily by increased administrative costs.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense incurred is based upon our pre-tax income adjusted for tax exempt income and temporary deferred tax assets or liabilities. For the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, our income tax expense was $1.9 million, representing an increase of 184.8%, compared to $676 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe increase was driven by the increase in pre-tax earnings, which increased 167.5% during the comparable period.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our income tax expense was $4.4 million, representing an increase of 255.1%, compared to $1.2 million for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. The increase was driven by the increase in pre-tax earnings, which increased 219.7% during the comparable period.\nOur effective income tax rate was 20.45% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 1.24% from 19.21% for the three months ended September 30,\n2023. Our effective income tax rate was 20.35% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 2.03% from 18.32% for the nine months ended September 30,\n2023. During 2024, the effective income tax rate increased compared to the corresponding prior period because pre-tax income increased while tax-exempt income decreased,\ncausing tax-exempt income to comprise a lower proportion of income before taxes.\nFinancial Condition\nSecurities\nOur securities portfolio is used to provide liquidity, manage risk, meet capital requirements, and generate interest income. Our securities portfolio consists of U.S.\ngovernment and federal agencies, mortgage backed securities, corporate bonds, and state and municipal securities. Securities that management has the positive intent and ability\nto hold to maturity are classified as “held to maturity” (“HTM”) and recorded at amortized cost. Securities not classified as held to maturity or trading are classified as\n“available for sale” (“AFS”) and recorded at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive loss. We do not hold\ntrading securities.\n50\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the amortized cost and weighted average yield of securities as of September 30, 2024 by contractual maturities.\nBalance as of September 30, 2024\nAvailable-for-Sale Held-to-Maturity\nWeighted Weighted\nAmortized Average Amortized Average\n(dollars in thousands) Cost Yield Cost Yield\nU.S. government and federal agencies\nDue in one year or less $ 111,707 3.82 % $ 6,964 1.79 %\nDue after one year through five years 14,467 2.09 % 85,492 1.79 %\nDue after five years through ten years 4,915 1.32 % 27,429 1.77 %\nDue after ten years — — 2,562 1.77 %\n131,089 3.54 % 122,447 1.79 %\nMortgage backed securities\nDue in one year or less 1,300 2.09 % — —\nDue after one year through five years 2,934 2.09 % — —\nDue after five through ten years — — — —\nDue after ten years 4,424 2.94 % 1,173 4.62 %\n8,658 2.53 % 1,173 4.62 %\nCorporate bonds\nDue in one year or less 29,500 3.42 % 6,898 2.19 %\nDue after one year through five years 23,287 3.10 % 51,004 2.61 %\nDue after five years through ten years — — 507 2.83 %\nDue after ten years 496 7.49 % — —\n53,283 3.32 % 58,409 2.56 %\nState and municipal securities\nDue in one year or less 24,086 3.01 % 3,011 3.00 %\nDue after one year through five years 57,703 2.58 % 52,593 2.24 %\nDue after five years through ten years 25,035 2.04 % 64,393 2.29 %\nDue after ten years 499 3.75 % 583 2.59 %\n107,323 2.56 % 120,580 2.29 %\nTotal securities $ 300,353 3.12 % $ 302,609 2.15 %\nThe weighted average yield is calculated using the amortized cost and yield on each security.

As of September 30, 2024, our total debt securities were $597.4 million excluding the allowance for credit loss, representing an increase of $30.8 million,\nor 5.4%, compared to $566.5 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by investments of excess cash into U.S. government treasuries maturing in\nthe fourth quarter of 2024, as well as a decrease in unrealized losses within the available for sale securities portfolio.\nU.S. government treasuries. U.S. government treasuries represent debt securities backed by the U.S. Treasury or the full faith and credit of the U.S. government and are\nguaranteed as to the timely payment of interest and principal when held to maturity. As of September 30, 2024, our U.S. government treasuries increased by $47.0 million, or\n24.0%, compared to December 31, 2023. During 2024, we invested a portion of our excess cash reserves in short term U.S. Treasury securities that mature around the federal\nelections in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nU.S. federal agencies securities. U.S. federal agencies securities represent obligations issued by U.S. federal government agencies or government-sponsored enterprises\nthat guarantee repayment of principal at maturity. As of September 30, 2024, our U.S. federal agencies securities decreased by $11.0 million, or 52.7%, compared to December\n31, 2023. U.S. federal agency bonds were called or matured during 2024, and not replaced with like investments.\nMortgage backed securities. Our mortgage backed securities portfolio consists of pass through and agency-issued collateralized mortgage obligations. As of September\n30, 2024, our mortgage backed securities decreased by $437 thousand, or 4.4%, compared to December 31, 2023. During the period, mortgage backed securities represented\nless than 2.0% of our securities portfolio.\nCorporate bonds. Corporate bonds are debt obligations issued by companies to raise capital and refinance obligations of the issuer. As of September 30, 2024, our\ncorporate bonds decreased by $4.1 million, or 3.6%, compared to December 31, 2023, due to maturities within the portfolio which have not been subsequently replaced with\nsimilar investments.\nState and municipal securities. State and municipal securities are debt obligations issued by state and local governments. As of September 30, 2024, our state and\nmunicipal securities remained unchanged compared to December 31, 2023 declining by only 0.2%.\nAllowance for Credit Losses — Securities\nManagement measures expected credit losses on HTM debt securities on a collective basis by major security type (U.S. government and federal agencies, agency\nmortgage backed securities, corporate bonds and state and municipal securities). We estimate expected credit losses based on our historical credit loss information as adjusted\nfor current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Securities issued by the U.S. Treasury or government agencies are not considered to be credit sensitive as they\nare explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government, and result in expectations of zero credit loss. Accordingly, management’s analysis of credit loss considers only\nthe corporate and municipal segments. Accrued interest receivable on HTM debt securities totaled $1.9 million as of September 30, 2024 and as of December 31, 2023 and is\nexcluded from the estimate of credit losses.\nFor AFS debt securities in an unrealized loss position, management first assesses whether it intends to sell, or if it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell,\nthe security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the\n52\nTable of Contents\ncriteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security’s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. For AFS debt securities that do not meet\nthe aforementioned criteria, management evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, management\nconsiders the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the\nsecurity, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the\namortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists, and an allowance for\ncredit loss is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount by which the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through\nan allowance for credit loss is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss).\nThe following table presents an analysis of the allowance for credit losses on securities:\nAs of and for the three As of and for the nine\nmonths ended months ended\nHeld to Maturity: September 30, September 30,\n(dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nAverage HTM debt securities outstanding $ 305,564 $ 311,302 $ 307,389 $ 311,734\nTotal outstanding HTM debt securities at end of each period 302,609 311,251 302,609 311,251\nAllowance for credit losses at the beginning of period 248 342 348 —\nImpact of adopting ASC 326 — — — 329\nProvision for (recapture of) for credit losses 13 6 (87) 19\nTotal charge-offs — — — —\nTotal recoveries — — — —\nNet (charge-offs) recoveries — — — —\nAllowance for credit losses at end of period 261 348 261 348\nRatio of allowance to total HTM debt securities outstanding at period end 0.09 % 0.11 % 0.09 % 0.11 %\nRatio of nonaccrual HTM securities to total HTM securities outstanding at\nperiod end — — — —\nRatio of allowance to nonaccrual debt securities at period end — — — —\n53\nTable of Contents\nAs of and for the three As of and for the nine\nmonths ended months ended\nAvailable-for-Sale: September 30, September 30,\n(dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nAverage AFS debt securities outstanding $ 295,789 $ 260,772 $ 268,289 $ 271,151\nTotal outstanding AFS debt securities at end of each period 294,754 254,908 294,754 254,908\nAllowance for credit losses at the beginning of period — — — —\nProvision for (recapture of) for credit losses — — (210) 785\nCharge-offs:\nCorporate — — — (785)\nTotal charge-offs — — — (785)\nRecoveries:\nCorporate — — 210 —\nTotal recoveries — — 210 —\nNet (charge-offs) recoveries — — 210 (785)\nAllowance for credit losses at end of period — — — —\nRatio of allowance to total AFS debt securities outstanding at period end — % — % — % — %\nRatio of nonaccrual AFS securities to total AFS securities outstanding at\nperiod end — — — —\nRatio of allowance to nonaccrual debt securities at period end — — — —\nIn 2023, we recorded a charge-off related to a credit loss on a specific bond due to regulatory actions against the issuer. This bond, initially classified as HTM, was\nreclassified to AFS based on significant credit deterioration. The bond was partially sold at a loss, with the remainder written off. During nine months ended September 30,\n2024, we received proceeds totaling $210 thousand for the bond and recorded a recovery of credit loss.

A substantial portion of our loan portfolio is primarily represented by residential real\nestate and commercial real estate loans throughout the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. The ability of our debtors to honor their contracts is dependent upon a number of\nfactors, including the real estate and general economic conditions in this area.\nThe following table summarizes our loan portfolio by the type of loans as of the dates indicated:\nAs of September 30, As of December 31,\n2024 2023 Change\n% of % of\nTotal Total\n(dollars in thousands) Amount Loans Amount Loans $ %\nCommercial real estate $ 51,387 17.1 % $ 60,138 19.8 % $ (8,751) (14.6 %)\nCommercial 11,144 3.7 % 12,438 4.1 % (1,294) (10.4 %)\nResidential real estate, closed-end 218,129 72.7 % 210,358 69.1 % 7,771 3.7 %\nOther consumer loans 19,372 6.5 % 21,210 7.0 % (1,838) (8.7 %)\nTotal $ 300,032 100.0 % $ 304,144 100.0 % $ (4,112) (1.4 %)\nAs of September 30, 2024, our total loans decreased by $4.1 million or 1.4%, compared to December 31, 2023. The decrease reflects the strategic reduction in our\ncommercial real estate lending to reduce our exposure to this sector, which was partially offset by growing consumer demand for residential mortgages as interest rates\ndecreased.\nResidential real estate loans, closed-end. Single family (1-4 units) residential mortgage loans are primarily secured by owner-occupied primary and secondary residences\nand are “closed-end” mortgage loans, which means that the loan amount is fixed at the outset and repaid over a set term without the ability to re-borrow. As of September 30,\n2024, our residential real estate loans increased by $7.8 million, or 3.7%, compared to December 31, 2023 reflecting tempered demand by consumers and a lower prepayment\nlevel amid elevated interest rates.\n55\nTable of Contents\nCommercial real estate loans. Commercial real estate loans are generally long-term loans secured by a commercial property that is either owner-occupied or investor\nowned. This category also includes commercial construction loans and multifamily residential property loans. Management has strategically allowed a decline in the\ncommercial real estate portfolio. Rising interest rates have increased the cost of borrowing and remote work trends continue to be a concern. These factors negatively impact\nthe value of commercial properties, making commercial real estate loans less attractive. As of September 30, 2024, our commercial real estate loans decreased by $8.8 million,\nor 14.6%, compared to December 31, 2023.\nAs of September 30, 2024, our commercial real estate portfolio included owner-occupied and non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans and were concentrated in\ncertain sectors and in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area:\n• Owner-Occupied vs. Non-Owner-Occupied Properties: Our commercial real estate loans include both owner-occupied and non-owner-occupied properties. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had $15.0 million and $16.2 million, respectively, in owner-occupied loans and $32.7 million and $35.5 million,\nrespectively, in non-owner-occupied loans. Non-owner-occupied properties depend on rental income for repayment. Factors such as market conditions, tenant defaults,\nand vacancies could reduce cash flow from these properties, leading to increased delinquencies and potential losses.\n• Sector Concentration: Our commercial real estate loan portfolio is concentrated in the office, retail, multifamily, and hotels sectors. As of September 30, 2024, our non-\nowner-occupied office loans totaled $6.6 million, retail loans totaled $13.0 million, multifamily loans totaled $4.9 million, and hotel loans totaled $4.0 million.\n• Geographic Concentration: Our commercial real estate loan portfolio is concentrated in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. This exposes us to risks tied to local\neconomic conditions, property market trends, and regulatory changes. See “Risk Factors — Other Risks Related to Our Business — The geographic concentration of\nour business in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area makes our business highly susceptible to local economic conditions and reductions or changes in government\nspending,” in our Prospectus.\nCommercial. Commercial loans are commercial and industrial (C&I) term loans or lines of credit and, due to the participation of political organizations in this segment,\nexhibit cyclicality when measured as a percentage of our loan portfolio. C&I loans include unsecured or UCC secured lending, accounts receivable, inventory or equipment\nfinancing loans or working capital loans. As of September 30, 2024, our commercial loans decreased by $1.3 million, or 10.4%, compared to December 31, 2023.\nOther consumer loans. Other consumer loans include residential construction loans, revolving loans secured by residential properties, commonly known as home equity\nlines of credit (“HELOCs”), and loans made directly to individuals for non-business purposes which may be secured or unsecured. As of September 30, 2024, other consumer\nloans decreased by $1.8 million, or 8.7%, from December 31, 2023. The following table presents the components of other consumer loans:\nAs of As of\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n(dollars in thousands) 2024 2023\nResidential construction loans $ 1,497 $ 3,445\nHELOCs 14,461 14,664\nConsumer secured 2,758 2,527\nConsumer unsecured 656 574\nTotal consumer loans $ 19,372 $ 21,210\nLoan Maturity and Sensitivity to Interest Rates\nThe information in the following table is based on the contractual maturities of individual loans, including loans that may be subject to renewal at their contractual\nmaturity. Renewal of these loans is subject to review and credit approval, as well as modification of terms upon maturity. Actual repayments of the loans may differ from the\nmaturities reflected below because consumer borrowers and some commercial borrowers have the right to prepay obligations with or without prepayment penalties. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, variable rate loans, which include floating and adjustable rate structures, comprised 69.4% of our loan portfolio. Our variable rate loans primarily consist\nof adjustable residential real estate loans with initial fixed-rate periods of three, five, seven or ten years, which, depending on the loan program, reprice every one, three, or five\nyears after the initial fixed-rate period. Variable rate loans provide a better match against our deposit liabilities and reduce our interest rate risk.\n56\nTable of Contents\nThe following table details maturities and sensitivity to interest rate changes for our loan portfolio as of September 30, 2024, and the contractual maturity and interest-rate\nprofile of our loan portfolio:\nAt September 30, 2024 Remaining Contractual Maturity Held for Investment\nAfter one After five\nyear years and\nOne year or through five through After fifteen\n(dollars in thousands) less years fifteen years years Total\nFixed rate loans:\nCommercial real estate $ 7 $ 18,310 $ 23,915 $ — $ 42,232\nCommercial 103 281 1,199 — 1,583\nResidential real estate, closed-end 264 1,050 36,247 7,961 45,522\nOther consumer loans 469 2,049 — — 2,518\nTotal fixed rate loans $ 843 $ 21,690 $ 61,361 $ 7,961 $ 91,855\nVariable rate loans:\nCommercial real estate $ — $ 2,867 $ 5,722 $ 566 $ 9,155\nCommercial 8,761 — 500 300 9,561\nResidential real estate, closed-end — 2,179 2,726 167,702 172,607\nOther consumer loans 3,046 5,316 7,153 1,339 16,854\nTotal variable rate loans $ 11,807 $ 10,362 $ 16,101 $ 169,907 $ 208,177\nTotal loans $ 12,650 $ 32,052 $ 77,462 $ 177,868 $ 300,032\nCredit Policies and Procedures\nManagement employs a multi-pronged approach to address credit risk, guided by a defined risk appetite. The approach includes underwriting policies, loan risk\nclassification grading, and an internal and external loan review process. In addition, it involves strategic portfolio management to address loan concentration and oversight by\nour Board. These policies and guidelines are designed with the intention of maintaining the quality of our loan portfolio while aiming to generate a return commensurate with\nthe associated risks. However, it is important to recognize that all risk management strategies have inherent limitations.\nThe commercial underwriting process involves an evaluation of the borrower’s ability to repay, the quality of the available collateral (if applicable), the financial\ncharacter of the borrower and the nature of the credit. It also includes an analysis of the borrower’s needs and an industry analysis to understand relevant external factors that\nmight affect the borrower’s financial stability and repayment capacity. Commercial borrowers are often asked to maintain their primary banking relationship with the Bank to\nattract both loans and transaction deposits. Residential mortgage loans and consumer loans are underwritten based on an evaluation of the borrower’s repayment ability, which\ntypically includes a review of documentation to verify income and assets. Consumers are encouraged to maintain deposit accounts with the Bank, and pricing incentives may be\noffered.\nDuring the underwriting process, loans are assigned a loan risk classification grade. The risk rating scale is intended to provide a framework for analyzing risk across\nvarious credit exposures, regardless of their nature, type or location.\nThe internal loan review process, performed by our credit administration staff, aims to verify that basic requirements for loan origination have been met. Ongoing internal\nloan review processes monitor commercial borrower performance using a risk-based approach, which may result in grade confirmations or change recommendations. Certain\nscenarios such as delinquent payments, overdue taxes, overdrafts, lack of borrower cooperation, delayed financial statements, or significant changes to the borrower’s financial\nposition may be considered potential indicators of problem loans. In such cases, the loan risk classification may be re-evaluated.\nAn external loan review is conducted annually by a third-party firm. This review examines a sample of the loan portfolio, focusing on areas such as underwriting\npractices, adherence to loan policies and banking regulations, loan documentation, watch list, and portfolio concentration.\n57\nTable of Contents\nCredit concentration policies are designed to address risk relative to our regulatory capital. Concentration limits are established for various categories including loans to\nindividual borrowers or industries, specific loan types, collateral types, commercial real estate concentrations, and total real estate loans, among others.\nWe have exposures to certain categories of loans that we believe represent relatively higher credit risk, such as commercial real estate loans. To manage our exposures to\nthese loans, our policy is to require low loan-to-value ratios and high debt service coverage ratios, and to conduct borrower credit assessments. To manage our exposure to\ncommercial real estate, we have set specific concentration limits for commercial real estate loans by property type, and our policy is to monitor these limits quarterly. Our risk\nmanagement practices include annual internal reviews of commercial mortgages with balances over $500 thousand, focusing on early warning signs like payment\ndelinquencies, property performance, and borrower financial condition. We also engage a third party to conduct an external loan review audit of the entire loan portfolio\nannually. Additionally, we perform quarterly stress tests on our loan portfolio, including the commercial real estate segment, to assess the potential impact of adverse economic\nconditions. In response to the inherent risks in higher-risk segments like commercial real estate, we may increase our loan loss reserves to mitigate potential losses due to\nchanging market conditions.\nAsset Quality\nWe seek to maintain a prudent lending approach, which has historically been associated with our asset quality performance. Our loan underwriters employ underwriting\nguidelines, and we assign a loan risk classification grade at origination. These practices are designed to help us evaluate potential risks throughout the life of the loan. The\nBank’s risk classification system utilizes a 10-grade risk-rating scale. The four lowest grade categories (7-10) correspond to the regulatory categories special mention,\nsubstandard, doubtful and loss.\nThe risk classification grade is a key component of our risk management process. Certain grades may result in a loan being added to the watch list report, which is a tool\nused in monitoring loans or commitments that may present elevated risks. This report is overseen by our Chief Credit Officer and presented to the Board monthly. Loan officers\nare responsible for managing credit risk within their loan portfolios and are encouraged to be proactive in considering whether to add a loan to the watch list report.\nManagement uses internal and external review processes, as described under “— Credit Policies and Procedures,” to monitor adherence to loan and credit policies,\nevaluate the loan portfolio, and identify areas that may require additional attention.\nNon-performing Assets\nAn asset is classified as non-performing when it ceases to yield interest or principal repayments for a specified period, usually 90 days or more. This classification\nincludes loans that are 90 days or more past due on scheduled payments, or assets where full repayment of principal and interest is in doubt due to the borrower’s financial\ndifficulties. Additionally, assets that have been restructured due to the borrower’s financial difficulties may also be classified as non-performing if the restructuring does not\nrestore the asset to a performing status.\nA loan is considered non-performing when the borrower is 90 days or more past due on the scheduled payment of principal and interest, or if the loan’s terms have been\nrestricted due to the borrower’s financial difficulties. Additionally, a loan may be classified as non-performing even if it is less than 90 days past due if there is a reasonable\ndoubt about the collectability of the loan’s principal or interest.\nLoans are generally considered delinquent when the required principal and interest payments have not been received by the assigned due date. Loans are typically placed\non non-accrual status when a loan becomes 90 days delinquent, unless the credit is well-secured and in the process of collection. Management may, at its discretion, place loans\non non-accrual status prior to 90 days delinquency if it determines that interest may be uncollectible. Loans determined to be non-performing or potentially uncollectible may\nbe placed in non-accrual status pending further collection efforts or charged off if collection of principal or interest is deemed doubtful.\nFor loans placed in non-accrual status, all interest previously accrued but not collected is generally reversed against interest income. The interest on loans in non-accrual\nstatus is typically accounted for on the cash basis or cost recovery method until qualifying for return to accrual. Loans may be returned to accrual status when all the principal\nand interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.\n58\nTable of Contents\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, based on our internal classifications, we did not identify any assets that met our criteria for classification as non-\nperforming assets or OREO.\nAllowance for Credit Losses — Loans\nThe ACL represents an amount that is intended to absorb the lifetime expected credit losses that may be sustained on outstanding loans at the balance sheet date.\nAdditional information regarding the ACL evaluation can be found in Note 1 and Note 3 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023\nand the notes thereto included elsewhere in our Prospectus.\nThe estimate for expected credit losses is based on an evaluation of the various factors, including, but not limited to, size and current risk characteristics of the loan\nportfolio, past events, current conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions, and prepayment experience as related to credit contractual term\ninformation. The ACL is generally measured on a collective (pool) basis when similar risk characteristics exist and is typically recorded upon the initial recognition of a\nfinancial asset.\nThe ACL may be adjusted by charge-offs, net of recoveries of previous losses, and may be increased or decreased by a provision for or recapture of credit losses, which is\nrecorded in the consolidated statements of income. Management estimates the allowance balance using various information sources, both internal and external, relating to past\nevents, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience typically provides a basis for the estimation of expected credit losses.\nAdjustments to historical loss information may be made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics and changes in environmental conditions. Expected credit\nlosses are typically estimated over the contractual term of the loans, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. The contractual term generally excludes expected\nextensions, renewals, and modifications.\nFor loans that do not share risk characteristics with a pool of other loans, expected credit losses are measured on an individual loan basis. Management individually\nevaluates the expected credit loss for certain loans, such as those that are collateral-dependent, are graded substandard or doubtful, or are identified as having risk characteristics\ndissimilar to those of the established loan pools.\nFor loans considered collateral-dependent, the Company has adopted a practical expedient to the ACL, which allows for recording an ACL based on the fair value of the\ncollateral rather than by estimating expected losses over the life of the loan.\nWhile the ACL on loans follows these guidelines, and management believes the allowance is appropriate based on current information, the judgmental nature of the\ncalculation could lead to fluctuations due to ongoing evaluations of the loan portfolio. These evaluations may be influenced by economic conditions in the Washington, D.C.\nmetropolitan area, changes in asset quality, or loan portfolio growth, among other factors, which could potentially require additional provisions for the allowance for credit\nlosses.\nThe quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance are subject to review by our internal and external auditors as well as our regulators.\n59\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents an analysis of the allowance for credit losses:\nAs of and for the Three As of and for the Nine\nMonths Ended Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nAverage loans outstanding $ 302,547 $ 317,117 $ 302,547 $ 317,117\nTotal loans outstanding at end of each period 300,032 310,514 300,032 310,514\nAllowance for credit losses at the beginning of period 4,337 4,399 4,319 4,482\nProvision for (recapture of) credit losses (131) 1 (113) (82)\nCharge-offs — — — —\nRecoveries — — — —\nAllowance for credit losses at end of period 4,206 4,400 4,206 4,400\nRatio of allowance to total loans outstanding at period end 1.40 % 1.42 % 1.40 % 1.42 %\nRatio of nonaccrual loans to total loans outstanding at period end — — — —\nRatio of allowance to nonaccrual loans at period end — — — —\nThe following table presents the allocation of the allowance for credit losses:\nAs of September 30, As of December 31,\n2024 2023\n% of % of\ntotal total\n(dollars in thousands) Amount loans Amount loans\nCommercial real estate $ 1,022 0.34 %$ 1,233 0.41 %\nCommercial non-real estate 164 0.05 % 189 0.06 %\nResidential real estate 2,774 0.92 % 2,668 0.88 %\nOther consumer loans 246 0.08 % 229 0.08 %\nTotal $ 4,206 1.40 %$ 4,319 1.42 %\nThe allocations of the allowance between loan segments did not vary significantly during the periods presented. However, we note a modest migration of applied\nallowances from the commercial segment as of December 31, 2023 to the residential real estate segment as of September 30, 2024 caused by growth in the consumer residential\nsegment contrasted to an overall balance decline in the commercial segment.\nThere were no loan charge-offs for the interim period ended September 30, 2024 or the year ended December 31, 2023. As a result, the ratio of loan charge-offs to\naverage loans outstanding is 0.00% for all reported periods.\nDeposits\nWe provide a wide range of commercial and personal deposit services. The deposit products we offer include noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing checking accounts,\nsavings accounts, and money market accounts. We aim to attract transaction account deposits, particularly from commercial clients. Our deposit base is largely composed of\nfunds from commercial entities, specifically federal political organizations, trade associations, non-profit organizations and business enterprises. As of September 30, 2024, we\nestimate that at least a majority of our deposit balances were sourced from political organizations. Deposits from political organizations generally exhibit more seasonality than\ntypical commercial or consumer deposits as federal election cycles often influence deposit levels of political organizations.\nWe are a member of the IntraFi® Cash Services network, which allows our deposit clients to enroll in the ICS® program. This program is designed to provide our clients\nwith access to FDIC insurance beyond the standard maximum deposit insurance amount at a single insured depository institution. For accounts enrolled in this service, we\nselect whether each account should be in a reciprocal position or a one-way sell position. A reciprocal position means that we receive an equal amount of network deposits for\nour enrolled accounts, and those deposits are reflected on our balance sheet. If we\n60\nTable of Contents\nelect to receive reciprocal deposits, we are required to pay a fee to IntraFi® equal to our reciprocal deposits balances multiplied by an annualized rate of 0.125% as of\nSeptember 30, 2024. Conversely, we do not receive reciprocal network funding when accounts are positioned as One-Way Sell®, and therefore the deposits are not reported on\nthe balance sheet. For deposits placed at other participating banks as One-Way Sell® deposits, we receive deposit placement services income, which is inversely related to the\ninterest rate on the deposit account, meaning that we receive less deposit placement services income for placing deposits with a higher interest rate.\nDuring periods of increased political organization deposits, which typically occur in connection with election cycles, we may adjust the positioning of certain accounts\nenrolled in the ICS® program. These adjustments can include changing some accounts from a reciprocal position to a One-Way Sell® position, which affects whether and how\nthese deposits are reflected on our balance sheet. These adjustments are part of our overall asset and liability management strategy, which aims to maintain appropriate balance\nsheet metrics in accordance with regulatory guidelines and our risk management policies. As of September 30, 2024, our balance sheet reflected no reciprocal ICS® deposits.\nExcess deposits totaling $432.3 million as of September 30, 2024 were placed at other participating banks as One-Way Sell® deposits. Our deposit placement services income\nwas $2.5 million and $5.6 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. If we were to convert some or all of these deposits into reciprocal\ndeposits, bringing them back onto our balance sheet, we would expect to receive interest income by investing these deposits, but our deposit placement services income would\ndecline and our interest on deposits, FDIC and regulatory assessments and the fee we pay to IntraFi® would increase.\nOur participation in the ICS® network is subject to certain terms and conditions, and there can be no assurances that we will be able to participate in the ICS® network in\nthe future. As of September 30, 2024, the terms and conditions for participation in the ICS® network include a $265.0 million limit on the amount of each participating client’s\nICS® deposits that may be placed at other banks within the ICS® network, a $3.5 billion and $6.5 billion limit on the maximum amount of savings account deposits and demand\naccount deposits, respectively, that a bank may place at other banks as reciprocal deposits, and a $10.0 billion limit on the maximum amount of deposits that a bank may place\nat other banks as One-Way Sell® deposits. The terms and conditions also include limitations on a bank’s ability to receive reciprocal deposits, place One-Way Sell® deposits, or\nreceive One-Way Buy® deposits if the bank is not “well capitalized” under the applicable federal banking regulations.\nWe are subject to various fees associated with the placement and management of deposits within the ICS® network, as outlined in the IntraFi® Participating Institution\nAgreement. When we elect to receive reciprocal deposits, which are network deposits that are matched with equivalent funds placed by other participating institutions, we incur\nan “IntraFi Placement Fee.” As of September 30, 2024, the annualized rate for this fee was 0.125%, which is applied to the reciprocal deposits balance to determine the amount\nof the fee incurred. This fee increases our overall operating expenses, impacting our net income.\nThe fees associated with our participation in the ICS® network require careful management. The IntraFi Placement Fee represents an additional cost that is not incurred\nwith traditional deposit accounts. As such, this fee is factored into our overall asset and liability management strategy with the aim of ensuring that our participation in the ICS®\nnetwork remains financially advantageous. These fees, together with our interest expense on deposits and other operational costs, contribute to the overall cost structure\nassociated with our deposit services.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Bank maintained elevated deposit levels ahead of the November 2024 federal elections. We estimate that at least a majority of our deposit\nbalances as of September 30, 2024 were sourced from political organizations. Deposits from political organizations are currently experiencing outflows, which we expect to\ncontinue through the end of the fourth quarter of 2024 and into early 2025, as the 2024 election cycle concludes. The outflows to date have been consistent with the seasonal\npatterns we have historically observed during federal election cycles. Historically, deposits from political organizations have typically increased in the periods leading up to\nfederal elections and declined in the quarters during and after federal elections. The amount and timing of these deposit inflows and outflows are difficult to predict and may\ndiffer from historical patterns. See Note 5—Deposits in the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements contained within this Form 10-Q.\n61\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents the types of deposits compared to total deposits for the periods indicated:\nAs of September 30, 2024 As of December 31, 2023 Change\n% of % of\ntotal total\n(dollars in thousands) Amount deposits Amount deposits $ %\nNoninterest-bearing $ 1,249,724 87.1 % $ 766,933 69.0 % $ 482,791 63.0 %\nSavings, interest-bearing and money market accounts 172,275 12.0 % 328,350 29.5 % (156,075) (47.5 %)\nTime, $250 and over 6,589 0.5 % 9,385 0.8 % (2,796) (29.8 %)\nOther time 5,280 0.4 % 7,357 0.7 % (2,077) (28.2 %)\nTotal $ 1,433,868 100.0 % $ 1,112,025 100.0 % $ 321,843 28.9 %\nThe following table presents the average balances and average rates paid for the periods indicated:\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nAverage Average Average Average Average Average Average Average\n(dollars in thousands) Balance Rate Balance Rate Balance Rate Balance Rate\nNoninterest-bearing $ 1,134,556 0.00 % $ 663,920 0.00 % $ 944,693 0.00 % $ 626,949 0.00 %\nSavings, interest-bearing\nchecking and money market\naccounts 207,387 1.39 % 266,380 1.10 % 221,488 1.29 % 291,959 1.12 %\nTime, $250 and over 6,584 2.96 % 9,599 2.98 % 7,966 2.95 % 7,885 2.51 %\nOther time 5,303 2.78 % 7,968 2.64 % 5,945 2.88 % 10,517 3.04 %\nTotal average deposits $ 1,353,830 0.08 % $ 947,867 0.11 % $ 1,180,092 0.28 % $ 937,310 0.40 %\nFDIC deposit insurance covers $250 thousand per depositor, per FDIC-insured bank, for each account ownership category. We estimate total uninsured deposits were\n$1.2 billion and $648.0 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, representing approximately 81.4% and 58.3% of our deposit portfolio as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nThe maturity profiles of our uninsured time deposits, those deposits that exceed the FDIC insurance limit, as of September 30, 2024 are as follows:\nMore than\nThree More than\nThree Months to Twelve\nMonths or Twelve Months to More than\n(dollars in thousands) Less Months Three Years Three years Total\nTime deposits, uninsured $ 1,463 $ 5,126 $ — $ — $ 6,589\nBorrowings\nThe Bank has several supplementary funding sources, including a secured line of credit with the FHLB and various available secured and unsecured lines of credit with\ncorrespondent banks.\nFederal Home Loan Bank Advance. The Bank has a secured line of credit with the FHLB, which is renewed annually in December, and which requires the Bank to pledge\ncollateral to establish credit availability. The Bank has historically pledged single-family residential real estate loans within the Bank’s loan portfolio to establish credit\navailability. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the secured line of credit had no collateral pledged and therefore no available or outstanding balance.\n62\nTable of Contents\nShort-Term Borrowings. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had an unsecured line of credit from a correspondent bank totaling $10.0\nmillion with an outstanding balance of $10.0 million as of September 30, 2024 and $5.0 million as of December 31, 2023. On October 10, 2024, the Company used a portion of\nthe net proceeds from the IPO to fully repay the $10.0 million outstanding balance. The Company subsequently closed the line on October 11, 2024.\nThe Bank also maintains federal funds lines of credit agreements with three correspondent banks totaling $68.0 million, which renew annually, are offered on an\nunsecured basis, and may remain outstanding for periods of up to 10 to 90 consecutive days. The three federal funds purchase lines of credit are for $8.0 million, expiring on\nMarch 12, 2025, $10.0 million, expiring on June 30, 2025, and $50.0 million, expiring on June 30, 2025, and the Bank’s use of the facilities is subject to certain terms and\nconditions, including those related to the Bank’s financial condition. There were no outstanding federal funds purchased balances as of September 30, 2024 or December 31,\n2023.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe are party to credit-related financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our clients. These financial\ninstruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Such commitments involve, in varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in\nexcess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets.\nOur exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amount of these commitments. We follow the same credit policies in making commitments as we do for on-\nbalance sheet instruments.\nThe contractual amounts of financial instruments with off-balance sheet commitments are as follows:\nAs of September 30, As of December 31,\n(dollars in thousands) 2024 2023\nCommitments to grant loans $ 1,021 $ —\nUnfunded commitments under lines of credit 37,758 22,947\nStandby letters of credit 3,707 3,598\nUnfunded commitments under lines of credit increased $14.8 million, or 64.5% from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 primarily due to a $17.5 million increase\nin renewed availability under two lines of credit issued to political organizations. These lines were fully drawn subsequent to quarter end on October 16, 2024.\nFor information regarding the arrangement related to the ICS® network and related One-Way Sell® deposits, see “— Deposits” above.\nLiquidity and Capital Management\nLiquidity Management\nLiquidity refers to our capacity to meet cash and collateral obligations in a timely manner. Maintaining appropriate levels of liquidity depends on our ability to address\nboth expected and unexpected cash flows and collateral needs while aiming to avoid adverse effects on our daily operations or the financial condition of the Bank. Effective\nliquidity management is considered essential to our business model, as deposits, which can generally be withdrawn on demand, form a primary source of our funding. We\nemploy various strategies intended to manage liquidity. Our account at the Federal Reserve, which held approximately $627.0 million as of September 30, 2024, serves as a\nprimary source of liquidity for daily and ongoing activities. We also maintain additional supplemental sources of liquidity, as discussed below. For regulatory reporting\npurposes, the liquidity ratio is typically calculated as the sum of our cash and cash equivalents plus unpledged securities classified as investment grade divided by total\nliabilities. Based on this calculation method, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our reported liquidity ratios were 85.31% and 78.75%, respectively. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, we had $432.3 million in One-Way Sell® deposit accounts through the ICS® platform that could be converted to a reciprocal position in order to provide\nadditional near-term liquidity. It is important to note that these ratios and amounts are point-in-time measurements and may not be indicative of future liquidity positions.\nDeposit account balances received from federal political organizations fluctuate due to the seasonality of fundraising and spending around federal elections. Historically,\nin the quarters leading up to federal elections, especially presidential\n63\nTable of Contents\nelections, our deposits generally increase, and decline in the quarters during and after federal elections. The amount and timing of these deposit inflows and outflows are\ndifficult to predict and may differ from historical patterns. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank’s deposits maintained an elevated level ahead of the November 2024 presidential\nelection. Consistent with patterns observed in previous election cycles, deposits from political organizations are currently experiencing outflows, which we expect to continue\nthrough the end of the fourth quarter of 2024 and into early 2025, as the 2024 election cycle concludes. See Note 5—Deposits in the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial\nStatements contained within this Form 10-Q. Management seeks to address liquidity needs related to seasonal outflows by identifying political organization accounts, tracking\nactivity, communicating with clients and retaining high cash balances at the Federal Reserve to fund deposit outflows.\nIn addition to traditional sources of liquidity, such as reciprocal deposits and lines of credit, we also utilize the ICS® network for both One-Way Buy® deposits and One-\nWay Sell® deposits, each serving distinct roles in our liquidity management strategy. One-Way Sell® deposits and reciprocal deposits involve placing deposits from our own\nclients with other participating banks through the ICS® network. One-Way Sell® deposits help us manage excess deposits by moving them off our balance sheet, while\nreciprocal deposits allow us to exchange deposit balances with other banks, ensuring those deposits remain insured. Both strategies help us to optimize our liquidity position\nwhile earning deposit placement fees, which contribute to our noninterest income. Conversely, One-Way Buy® deposits involve receiving deposits from other banks’ customers\nthrough the ICS® network. This mechanism can provide an additional source of liquidity by allowing us to increase our deposits without reciprocating. These transactions\ninvolve certain expenses, which include interest on the deposits and any associated fees, which we consider within our broader liquidity planning.\nManagement estimates that up to 81.4% of deposits were uninsured as of September 30, 2024. To obtain FDIC insurance for deposits exceeding the $250 thousand\nthreshold, some clients enroll in the ICS®, which is described in greater detail under “— Deposits” above. As of September 30, 2024, deposit balances totaling $432.3 million\nwere enrolled in the ICS® program. All of these deposits were positioned as One-Way Sell® deposits and are therefore not reflected on the balance sheet. The Bank has the\nflexibility to convert these One-Way Sell® deposits into reciprocal deposits, which would then appear on the balance sheet. To fund the outflow of deposits during phases of the\nfederal election cycle when campaigns and committees are actively spending, management will rely on the Bank’s cash balances at the Federal Reserve and conversion of One-\nWay Sell® accounts to reciprocal as its primary sources of liquidity. Similar to other deposits, depositors may withdraw their One-Way Sell® deposits at any time, which could\nimpact the volume of One-Way Sell® deposits available for conversion to reciprocal.\nIn addition to the primary sources of liquidity discussed above, we maintain secured lines of credit with the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Discount Window, for which\nwe can borrow up to the allowable amount of pledged collateral. The Bank can advance FHLB funds of up to 25% of assets as reported in its latest Federal Financial\nInstitutions Examination Council (“FFIEC”) Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income, which the Bank files with the FFIEC on a quarterly basis (“Call Report”), using\npledged collateral such as qualifying mortgages and investment securities. Based on the September 30, 2024 Call Report, 25% of total assets equates to credit availability of\n$388.8 million. As of September 30, 2024, we had no collateral pledged or outstanding balance with the FHLB or Federal Reserve.\nThe Bank has access to additional unsecured funding through its account with ICS®. The Bank can request funding of up to 10% of total assets, which equates to $155.5\nmillion as of the Bank’s September 30, 2024 Call Report, in a One-Way Buy® of daily maturing or term deposit products. Requesting One-Way Buy® deposits requires us to\nsubmit a bid including the rate we are willing to pay for the deposits, and such request may be fulfilled in whole, in part, or not at all. If demand for One-Way Buy® deposits is\nhigh, then the rate required to successfully bid for One-Way Buy® deposits would be expected to increase, and so One-Way Buy® deposits may be a less reliable source of\nliquidity. As of September 30, 2024, there was no outstanding balance.\nThe Bank maintains unsecured lines of credit with three correspondent banks that provide combined availability of $68.0 million. There were no outstanding balances as\nof September 30, 2024.\nAs an intermediate source of liquidity, we may sell AFS securities or allow AFS and HTM securities to mature without reinvestment in the securities portfolio. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, our AFS securities portfolio had a fair value of $294.8 million, and our total AFS and HTM debt securities portfolio had a carrying value of $603.0\nmillion, including $183.5 million of bonds maturing within a year and $287.5 million of bonds maturing between one and five years. Our bond portfolio is structured to provide\nliquidity when management anticipates it will be needed, and a portion of our AFS bonds are invested in liquid investments like U.S. Treasury securities. In the event liquidity\nis needed from the bond portfolio, management will take into consideration a number of factors when determining which investments to sell. Variables include the marketability\nof the bonds, current prices and estimated losses, and other factors.\n64\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity Risk Management\nLiquidity risk refers to the potential that the Bank’s financial condition or overall safety and soundness could be adversely affected by a real or perceived inability to meet\ncontractual obligations. This risk category includes potential challenges in managing unplanned decreases or changes in funding sources. Liquidity risk management involves\nefforts to identify, measure, monitor and control liquidity events.\nThe Bank’s Asset/Liability Committee (“ALCO”) of the Board typically reviews current and projected liquidity scenarios, including stressed scenarios, at its quarterly\nmeetings. The ALCO seeks to ensure that measurement systems are designed to identify and quantify the Bank’s liquidity exposure, and that reporting systems and practices are\nintended to communicate relevant information about the level and sources of that exposure. Management is responsible for implementing board-approved policies, strategies,\nand procedures, and for monitoring liquidity on both a daily and long-term basis.\nCapital Resources\nCapital adequacy is generally considered an important indicator of financial stability and performance. Our objectives include maintaining capitalization at levels that we\nbelieve are sufficient to support asset growth and to promote confidence among our depositors, investors, and regulators. We recognize that robust capital management practices\nare integral to addressing various financial and operational challenges, which may include managing credit risk, liquidity risk, balance sheet growth, new products, regulatory\nchanges and competitive pressures.\nStockholders’ equity as of September 30, 2024 was $104.8 million, an increase of $21.4 million compared to $83.4 million as of December 31, 2023. Net income for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 contributed $17.2 million to the increase in stockholders’ equity. Forming the remaining balance of the change, accumulated other\ncomprehensive loss decreased $4.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which is primarily related to the improvement in the market value of the AFS\nsecurities portfolio.\nThe Company has a $10.0 million line of credit from a correspondent bank that it uses to provide capital to the Bank. As of September 30, 2024, $10.0 million was\noutstanding on this line of credit. On October 10, 2024, the Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the IPO to fully repay the $10.0 million outstanding balance. The\nCompany subsequently closed the line on October 11, 2024.\nGiving effect to the stock Reclassification completed on October 3, 2024, book value per share as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $22.95 and $18.26,\nrespectively. The increase between periods is primarily the result of earnings, which were $3.77 per share during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The remaining\nincrease is due to the improvement in the market value of the AFS securities portfolio which caused the accumulated other comprehensive loss to decline.\nBecause total assets on a consolidated basis are less than $3.0 billion, we are not subject to the consolidated capital requirements imposed by federal regulations.\nHowever, the Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Certain regulatory measurements of capital adequacy are\n“risk based,” meaning they utilize a formula that considers the individual risk profile of the financial institution’s assets. For example, certain assets, such as cash at the Federal\nReserve and investments in U.S. Treasury securities, are deemed to carry zero risk by the regulators because of explicit or implied federal government guarantees. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, 56.3% and 42.5% of the Bank’s total assets were invested in such zero-risk assets. The tier 1 leverage ratio, another\nregulatory capital measurement, does not consider the riskiness of assets. The leverage ratio is computed as tier 1 capital divided by total average assets for the quarter.\n65\nTable of Contents\nThe Bank’s capital level is characterized as “well capitalized” under the Basel III Capital Rules. A summary of the Bank’s regulatory capital ratios, and minimum\nrequirement to be considered “well capitalized” are presented below:\nWell-\ncapitalized\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 requirement\n($ in thousands) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Ratio\nTotal risk-based capital ratio $ 127,080 31.90 % $ 104,523 25.44 % 10.00 %\nTier 1 risk-based capital ratio 122,613 30.78 % 99,856 24.30 % 8.00 %\nCommon equity tier one risk-based capital ratio 122,613 30.78 % 99,856 24.30 % 6.50 %\nTier 1 leverage ratio 122,613 8.29 % 99,856 9.21 % 5.00 %\nDuring periods of growth in deposits due to seasonality, our assets could reach a level that would require the Bank to control the level of these deposits or require the\nCompany to obtain additional capital to maintain a Tier 1 leverage ratio that exceeds our internal regulatory capital policies or targets and satisfies regulatory requirements. We\nuse the ICS® network to help manage our Tier 1 leverage ratio by moving certain deposit accounts off our balance sheet by placing the deposits at other banks as One-Way\nSell® deposits. As of September 30, 2024, our deposits enrolled in the ICS® program totaled $432.3 million, and were all in a One-Way Sell® position. If these deposits were\nincluded on our balance sheet as of September 30, 2024, we estimate the Bank’s Tier 1 leverage ratio would have been 6.22%.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate Sensitivity and Market Risk\nOur business activities include attracting deposits and using those deposits to invest in cash, securities, and loans. These activities involve interest rate risk, which arises\nfrom factors such as timing and volume differences in the repricing of our rate-sensitive assets and liabilities, changes in credit spreads, fluctuations in the general level of\nmarket interest rates, and shifts in the shape and level of market yield curves. Changes in interest rates affects our current and future earnings by impacting our net interest\nincome and the level of other interest-sensitive income and operating expenses. Interest rate fluctuations also influence the underlying economic value of our assets, liabilities\nand off-balance sheet items. This is because the present value of future cash flows, and in some cases the cash flows themselves, may change when interest rates vary.\nInterest rate risk is generally considered a significant market risk for financial institutions. We have developed an interest rate risk policy that aims to provide\nmanagement with guidelines for funds management. We have also established a system for monitoring our net interest rate sensitivity position. However, it’s important to note\nthat despite these measures, significant changes in interest rates could potentially impact our earnings, liquidity and capital positions.\nWe had a total one-year cumulative gap in rate-sensitive assets and rate-sensitive liabilities of $787.8 million and $319.4 million as of September 30, 2024 and December\n31, 2023, respectively, indicating that, overall, our assets will reprice before our liabilities. Generally, when interest-earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than interest-\nbearing liabilities, decreasing interest rates could reduce net interest income and increasing interest rates could increase net interest income.\nOur ALCO is composed of our CEO and at least two independent directors and meets at least quarterly to manage interest rate risk in accordance with policies approved\nby the Bank’s board of directors. Members of management from various departments also participate in the ALCO meetings. The board of directors receives monthly interest\nrate risk measurement results. The ALCO monitors the volume, maturities, pricing and mix of assets and funding sources with the objective of managing assets and funding\nsources to provide results that are consistent with liquidity, growth, risk limits and profitability goals.\nWe use interest rate risk models and rate shock simulations to assess the interest rate risk (“IRR”) sensitivity of net interest income and the economic value of equity over\na variety of parallel and non-parallel rate scenarios. Many assumptions are used to calculate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our net interest income, such as asset\nprepayments, non-maturity deposit price sensitivity and decay rates, and rate drivers. Due to the inherent use of estimates and assumptions in the model, our actual results may,\nand most likely will, differ from our simulated results. Management reviews the assumptions on an as-needed basis and at least annually through a thorough examination. Key\nchanges are presented to the ALCO.\n66\nTable of Contents\nThe table below summarizes the results of our IRR analysis in simulating the change in net interest income over a 12-month horizon as of the indicated dates. The\n“ramped” scenario below presents the anticipated percentage change in net interest income when rates are increased or decreased in a parallel manner evenly over the 12-month\ntime horizon, and the “immediate” scenario assumes that the parallel rate shift occurs immediately.\nChange in interest rates (ramped) -400 bps -300 bps -200 bps -100 bps +100 bps +200 bps +300 bps +400 bps\nSeptember 30, 2024 (23.30 %) (17.48 %) (11.63 %) (5.82 %) 5.87 % 11.64 % 17.43 % 23.27 %\nDecember 31, 2023 (16.22 %) (12.11 %) (8.06 %) (4.04 %) 4.00 % 8.02 % 12.14 % 16.11 %\nChange in interest rates (immediate) -400 bps -300 bps -200 bps -100 bps +100 bps +200 bps +300 bps +400 bps\nSeptember 30, 2024 (52.78 %) (40.46 %) (26.82 %) (13.33 %) 13.26 % 26.44 % 39.63 % 52.89 %\nDecember 31, 2023 (34.76 %) (25.74 %) (16.98 %) (8.41 %) 8.34 % 16.54 % 24.88 % 33.27 %\nThe results show that we are asset-sensitive, further indicating that we can expect net interest income to increase as rates rise and to decrease as rates decline. See “Risk\nFactors — Changes in interest rates may adversely affect our earnings and financial condition.” in our Prospectus. Interest rates do not normally move all at once or evenly over\ntime, but this analysis assists in our understanding of the potential direction and magnitude of net interest income changes due to changing interest rates.\nThe following table illustrates the results of our interest rate risk analysis in simulating the change in fair value of equity as of the indicated dates.\nChange in interest rates -400 bps -300 bps -200 bps -100 bps +100 bps +200 bps +300 bps +400 bps\nSeptember 30, 2024 (12.00 %) (7.12 %) (3.66 %) (1.49 %) 1.54 % 3.96 % 5.63 % 7.49 %\nDecember 31, 2023 14.25 % 12.33 % 8.27 % 3.21 % (4.81 %) (8.85 %) (12.35 %) (15.45 %)\nDue to the nature of our client base, and the resulting balance sheet cyclicality, we will sometimes hold high volumes of immediately repricing assets (i.e., cash) to fund\nimpending political organization deposit outflows. The changes in our balance sheet over the course of a two-year election cycle causes a degree of variability among our\ninterest rate risk results over time.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Company’s management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and\nprocedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the period covered by this report.\nBased upon that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that\ninformation required to be disclosed in the reports we file and submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required and (ii)\naccumulated and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions\nregarding required disclosure.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes, in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the\nfiscal quarter to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n67\nTable of Contents\nPart II - Other Information\nItem 1.

Risk Factors\nThere have been no material changes in the risk factors that were disclosed in the section titled “Risk Factors” in our Prospectus.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nUse of Proceeds\nOn October 7, 2024, the Company completed the issuance and sale of 1,850,000 shares of Class A Common Stock, at a public offering price of $22.00 per share. The\nCompany received net proceeds of approximately $33.6 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately $2.8 million, and estimated offering\nexpenses, including legal, accounting, and other expenses, of approximately $4.3 million. On October 10, 2024, the Company used a portion of the net proceeds to fully repay\nthe $10.0 million outstanding principal balance on its unsecured line of credit with a correspondent bank.\nOn November 1, 2024, the Company issued an additional 142,897 shares of Class A Common Stock as a result of the underwriters’ exercise of their 30-day option to\npurchase up to an additional 277,500 shares of its Class A Common Stock at the public offering price less underwriting discounts and commissions, or $20.46 per share. The\nissuance resulted in net proceeds to the Company of approximately $2.9 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately $220 thousand. The\nCompany intends to use the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include supporting continued organic deposit growth and funding potential\nstrategic expansion.\nAll shares sold were registered pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-282102), as amended, which was declared effective by the SEC on October\n3, 2024 and registered 2,127,500 shares of our Class A Common Stock with a maximum aggregate offering price of $55.3 million. Piper Sandler & Co., Raymond James &\nAssociates, Inc., and Hovde Group, LLC acted as representatives of the underwriters for the offering. The offering terminated after the sale of all securities registered pursuant\nto the Registration Statement.\nNo payments for the offering expenses were made directly or indirectly to (i) any of our officers or directors or their associates, (ii) any persons owning 10% or more of\nany class of our equity securities, or (iii) any of our affiliates.\nItem 3.

Upon any conversion of a share or shares of Class B Common Stock to a share or shares of Class A Common\nStock, subject only to rights to receive any dividends or other distributions payable in respect of such share or shares of Class B Common Stock\nwith a record date prior to the date of such conversion, all rights of the holder of such share or shares of Class B Common Stock shall cease with\nrespect to such share or shares of Class B Common Stock and such Person shall be treated for all purposes as having become the registered holder\nof such share or shares of Class A Common Stock.

The Board is hereby empowered, by majority vote of a quorum of disinterested directors, to cause the Corporation to\nindemnify or contract in advance to indemnify any person not specified in this Section 6.4 against liabilities, fines, penalties and claims imposed\nupon or asserted against him or her (including amounts paid in settlement) by reason of having been an employee, agent or consultant of the\nCorporation, whether or not then continuing so to be, and against all expenses (including counsel fees) reasonably incurred by him or her in\nconnection therewith, to the same extent as if such person were specified as one to whom indemnification is granted.\n6.4.2.Expenses reasonably incurred by an Indemnitee in defending any Proceeding shall be promptly advanced or reimbursed by\nthe Corporation upon receipt of (i) a written request therefor and (ii) a written undertaking of such Indemnitee to repay such Expenses if it shall\nultimately be determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation or, where indemnification is granted, to the extent the\nExpenses so advanced or reimbursed exceed the amount to which such Indemnitee is entitled; provided that such Indemnitee shall cooperate in\ngood faith with any request by the Corporation that common counsel be utilized by the parties to an action or proceeding who are similarly\nsituated unless to do so would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between or among such parties. An Indemnitee’s\nobligation to reimburse the Corporation shall be unsecured and no interest shall be charged thereon.\n6.4.3.The Corporation shall not indemnify an Indemnitee or advance or reimburse an Indemnitee’s Expenses in connection with\nany Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding):\n6.4.3.1.for which payment has actually been made to or on behalf of such Indemnitee under any statute, insurance policy,\nindemnity provision, vote or otherwise, except with respect to any excess beyond the amount paid;\n6.4.3.2.for an accounting or disgorgement of profits pursuant to Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, or similar provisions of\nfederal, state or local statutory law or common law, if such Indemnitee is held liable therefor (including pursuant to any settlement arrangements);\n6.4.3.3.relating to violations of the Corporation’s Code of Conduct and Ethics or Insider Trading Policy; or\n6.4.3.4.relating to violations of Federal or state insider trading laws,\n-22-\n4861-3069-5119 v.5\nunless, in each case, such Indemnitee has been successful on the merits, received the written consent to incur the Expense or settled the case with\nthe written consent of the Corporation, in which case the Corporation shall indemnify and reimburse the Expenses of such Indemnitee. In addition,\nthe Corporation shall not indemnify an Indemnitee or advance or reimburse Indemnitee’s Expenses if such indemnification or payment would\nconstitute a “prohibited indemnification payment” under the regulations of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (or any successor\nprovisions) or any other applicable laws, rules or regulations.\n6.4.4.No claim for indemnification shall be paid by the Corporation unless the Corporation has determined that such Indemnitee\nacted in good faith and in a manner such Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation and,\nwith respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful. The termination of\nany Proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a\npresumption that an Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which such Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to\nthe best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal Proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that such Indemnitee’s\nconduct was unlawful. Unless ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction, such determinations shall be made by (i) a majority vote of the\ndirectors who are not parties to the Proceeding for which indemnification is sought, even though less than a quorum, (ii) by a committee of such\ndirectors designated by a majority vote of directors, even though less than a quorum, (iii) if there are no such directors, or if such directors so\ndirect, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, a copy of which shall be received by such Indemnitee or (iv) by a majority vote of the\nstockholders. If such determination is not made by the Corporation within 30 days of a demand by such Indemnitee for indemnification or\nadvancement or reimbursement of Expenses, such Indemnitee shall be deemed to have met such standard. An Indemnitee shall submit to the\nCorporation such documentation and information as is reasonably available to such Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine\nwhether and to what extent such Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the\nextent that an Indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any Proceeding, or any claim, issue or matter therein, such\nIndemnitee shall be indemnified against Expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such Indemnitee in connection\ntherewith, without the necessity of authorization in the specific case.\n6.4.5.If a claim for indemnification or advancement of Expenses under this Section 6.4 is not paid in full within 90 days after\nreceipt by the Corporation of the written request therefor, an Indemnitee shall be entitled to an adjudication by a court of competent jurisdiction\nof his or her entitlement to such indemnification or advancement of Expenses. The Corporation shall indemnify such Indemnitee against any and\nall Expenses that are incurred by such Indemnitee in connection with any action for indemnification or advancement of Expenses from the\nCorporation under this Section\n-23-\n4861-3069-5119 v.5\n6.4(e), to the extent such Indemnitee is successful in such action, and to the extent not prohibited by applicable law. In any such suit, the\nCorporation shall, to the fullest extent not prohibited by law, have the burden of proving that such Indemnitee is not entitled to the requested\nindemnification or advancement of Expenses.\n6.4.6.An Indemnitee shall promptly notify the Corporation in writing upon the sooner of (i) becoming aware of a Proceeding\nwhere indemnification or the advance payment or reimbursement of Expenses may be sought or (ii) being served with any summons, citation,\nsubpoena, complaint, indictment, information or other document relating to any matter which may be subject to indemnification or the advance\npayment or reimbursement of Expenses covered hereunder. The failure of Indemnitee to so notify the Corporation shall not relieve the\nCorporation of any obligation which it may have to Indemnitee pursuant to this Section 6.4.\n6.4.7.As a condition to indemnification or the advance payment or reimbursement of Expenses, any demand for payment by an\nIndemnitee hereunder shall be in writing and shall provide reasonable accounting by such Indemnitee’s legal counsel for the Expenses to be paid\nby the Corporation.\n6.4.8.All rights conferred to an Indemnitee in this Section 6.4, as to indemnification, advancement of Expenses and otherwise,\nshall not be exclusive of any other rights to which such Indemnitee seeking indemnification or advancement of Expenses may be entitled or\nhereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or the Board or\notherwise.

In case any provision in this Section 6.4 shall be determined at any time to be unenforceable in any respect, the other\nprovisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby, and the affected provision shall be given the fullest possible enforcement in the\ncircumstances, it being the intention of the Corporation to afford indemnification and advancement of Expenses to its directors or officers, acting\nin such capacities or in the other capacities mentioned herein, to the fullest extent permitted by law.\n6.5.

The objective of the Plan is to promote a culture of safety, profitability, and growth\nwhile emphasizing robust risk management. The Plan underscores the importance of diligent risk controls and aims to foster a prudent risk\nmanagement framework while promoting the sustainable and profitable growth of both the Company and the Bank. The Plan offers potential\nfinancial incentives to all participating employees in recognition and reward for their efforts and achievements in these critical areas. However, the\nfinal approval and distribution of any awards under this Plan are at the sole discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors.\nSection 2. Definitions\n2.1 Definitions.\n(a) “Award Year” means the twelve (12) month period whose last day coincides with the end of the Company’s annual accounting period.\n(b) “Board” means the Board of Directors of the Company.\n(c) “Participant” means an employee designated by the Board to participate in the Plan.\n(d) “Tier I Officers” means the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President, and Chief Financial Officer of the Bank.\n(e) “Tier II Officers” means the Executive Vice Presidents of the Bank and Section 16 officers of the Company not otherwise classified as Tier\nI Officers who are designated as such by the Board as set forth in Section 6 hereof.\n(f) “Tier III Officers” means the Senior Vice Presidents and Vice Presidents of the Bank who are designated as such by the Board as set forth\nin Section 6 hereof.\n(g) “Tier IV Officers” means those officers of the Bank designated as such by the Board as set forth in Section 6 hereof.\n(h) “Tier V Employees” means those non-officer employees of the Bank designated as such by the Board as set forth in Section 6 hereof.\n(i) Each individual in Tiers I-V is considered a “Participant” in the Plan.\n(j) “Salary” refers to the regular gross income paid to an officer or employee by the Company for services rendered as part of the terms of\nemployment. This includes compensation paid on a periodic (e.g., weekly, bi-weekly, monthly) basis, excluding any and all forms of\nvariable pay. For the purposes of this Plan, “salary” does not include any additional compensation or benefits, including but not limited to\ndeferred compensation, bonuses, commissions, employer contributions to retirement plans, fringe benefits, allowances, reimbursements,\ninsurance premiums, equity awards, stock options, stock appreciation rights, or any payments made under long-term incentive programs.\n(k) No employee shall be excluded from being a Participant in the Plan by virtue of service as a Chain Bridge Director.\n(l) “Retirement Date” means the date upon which a Participant attains age 65.\n2.2 Gender and Number.

First, you start with the provisions set aside for potential credit losses, known as the ‘Credit Loss Provisions.’ From this,\nsubtract the amounts written off as uncollectible, which we call ‘Charge-Offs of Bad Credits.’ Then, add back “Recoveries” which are any\npreviously written-off amounts that have since been recovered. Further adjustments are made by adding or subtracting changes in the\nspecific reserves for individual credits. The final total is adjusted to reflect the corresponding tax effects, either increasing or decreasing the\ntotal as necessary.\n(c) “Budget Adjustments” means the total income impact, net of tax effect, of decisions adopted by the Board which deviate materially from\nthe budget adopted by the Board.

In the case of extraordinary or temporary average asset growth or decline, in the current or previous year, the Board shall\nhave the discretion to include or exclude all or part of the extraordinary or temporary asset fluctuation for the calculation of current or\nprevious year Average Assets for the Plan. For example, assume actual Average Assets for the Plan during ‘year one’ were $550 million\nwhich exceeded the maximum Average Assets growth levels on the “Grid” of $500 million. When calculating growth in ‘year two,’\nAverage Assets from ‘year one’ may be adjusted to $500 million that was the maximum growth level recognized on the “Grid” during\n‘year one.’\n(i) “Average Equity for the Plan” means the arithmetic daily average equity of Chain Bridge, computed from January 1 through December 31,\nplus unrealized losses and less unrealized gains on securities, net of tax effect, plus the average balance of Allowance for Credit Losses, net\nof tax effect.\n(j) “Return on Average Equity for the Plan” means the Net Income for the Plan, divided by Average Equity for the Plan in each case for the\nAward Year.\n(k) “Asset Growth” means Average Assets for the Plan for the Award Year less Average Assets for the Plan for the previous year divided by\nAverage Assets for the Plan for the previous year.

The Board shall have full power and authority to select Participants from among those\neligible, which includes all full-time and permanent employees of Chain Bridge, and to classify them as delineated in Section 6 below. The Board\nis also empowered to adopt and revise such rules and procedures as it deems necessary for the effective administration of the Plan.\nNotwithstanding any other provision contained herein, the decision of the Board regarding any question that arises concerning the\nindividuals selected for awards, the amount, terms, form, and time of payment of awards, and the interpretation of this Plan shall be final,\nconclusive, and binding.\nSection 4.

Audit\nThe Audit Committee, at the direction of the Board, shall reserve the right to annually engage a qualified audit firm to review and validate\nPlan calculations prior to payments being made to Participants.\nSection 6. Participation\nEmployees of the Bank who are approved by the Board are eligible to participate in the Plan. Each Participant in the Plan shall be\nclassified as a Tier I Officer, Tier II Officer, Tier III Officer, Tier IV Officer, or Tier V Employee for purposes of the Plan. In selecting and\nclassifying Participants, the Board shall consider an individual’s position and potential impact on the Company’s and Bank’s business results and\nperformance. The selection of Participants, their classification as a Tier I Officer, Tier II Officer, Tier III Officer, Tier IV Officer, or Tier V\nEmployee and thus their respective portions of the target incentive compensation, shall be determined annually by the Board and promptly\ncommunicated in writing to Participants.\nSection 7. Awards\n7.1Total Incentive Compensation: The aggregate incentive compensation granted to all Participants within the present Award Year will be\nlimited to 20% of the Plan’s net income used to calculate the Return on Average Equity for the Plan. This limit pertains to the incentive\ncompensation award, excluding other amounts such as taxes and 401k contributions.\n7.2Incentive Compensation Components: Incentive compensation calculation is comprised of two elements: financial performance and risk\nmanagement performance. Points from each category will be accumulated to compute the total points earned. Negative points in one\ncomponent will offset points acquired in the other. Incentive compensation points can be obtained from each component as detailed below.\n7.3Incentive Compensation Financial Component: Participants can accrue incentive compensation points contingent on Chain Bridge’s\nfinancial performance, particularly Average Asset Growth and Return on Average Equity. A Grid, provided in Exhibit 1, details the\npotential points achievable based on various combinations of Average Asset\nGrowth and Return on Average Equity, representing their respective importance to stockholders. Fractional points can be obtained in both\ncategories, calculated on a pro-rated basis.\n7.4Incentive Compensation Risk Management Component: Participants can also accrue or forfeit incentive compensation points based on the\nCompany’s risk management performance. Risk management performance is quantitatively measured by considering a mix of factors\n[***]. Points are assigned or deducted based on performance in each domain, with a summary of the calculation process provided in\nExhibit 1. [***]. Points will be assigned or deducted on a pro-rated basis according to the fractional performance rating.\n7.8Incentive Compensation Calculation: The calculation of each Participant’s incentive compensation involves adding financial compensation\npoints and risk management component points for the Award year. The incentive compensation award for each Tier I to V Officer or\nEmployee will be their respective salary paid multiplied by a certain percentage of the incentive compensation points divided by 100. For\nTier I, it is 100%; Tier II, 85%; Tier III, 75%; Tier IV, 65%, and Tier V, 55%. Refer to Section 8 for payments to Participants not employed\nby the Bank for the entire Award Year.\n7.9Compliance Training Requirement: Participants must satisfactorily complete all training mandated by the Bank’s compliance policy to be\neligible for the incentive compensation award. Those failing to complete the required compliance training by December 31st of the current\nPlan year will be ineligible for the award.\nSection 8. Payment\n8.1Normal Payment. Incentive compensation awards shall be earned as of the last business day of the Award Year. Participants must be Chain\nBridge employees in active status, or on approved leave of absence, on the last business day of the Award Year with the exception of\nsituations described in Section 8.2. Payment of incentive compensation awards shall be made via payroll, less applicable tax and other\nwithholding, in cash within sixty (60) days following the end of the Award Year, but in no event before the Bank has filed its year-end Call\nReport.\n8.2Payment Under Conditions of Termination. If termination of employment occurs during an Award Year due to retirement post the\nRetirement Date, death, or total disability, the Participant will be deemed to have earned an incentive award proportional to their actual\nsalary paid in the Award Year. The distribution of this payment will be in accordance with Section 8.1.\nHowever, if the termination of employment transpires for reasons other than retirement post the Retirement Date, death, total disability, or\napproved leave of absence, no incentive compensation will be considered earned for the Award Year in which the termination takes place.\n8.3Payment to Participants who are not Employees as of the first business day of the Award Year. Participants must be employed on or before\nDecember 1 of the current award year and must be employed continuously through the last day of the award year to be eligible for the\nincentive awards. All Participants’ incentive awards will be based on their actual salary paid in the Award Year.\nSection 9. Clawback Provision\nIncentive compensation awarded under this Plan shall be subject recovery or “clawback” as set forth in the Company’s Policy for\nRecoupment of Incentive Compensation, as adopted by the Board.\nSection 10. Dissolution or Merger\nIf the Company or the Bank should be liquidated and/or dissolved or if the Company or the Bank should become a party to a merger or\nconsolidation in which it is not the surviving corporation, the Plan shall be frozen, and the amount of the Participants’ incentive compensation\nshall be determined based on results through the date of such dissolution, merger, or consolidation.\nSection 11. Amendment and Termination\nThe Board may, at any time, terminate, modify or amend this Plan. No termination or amendment shall, without the consent of the\nParticipants, adversely affect the rights of such Participants in previously earned incentive compensation awards. No awards may be made under\nthis Plan at any time if, in the opinion of the Board, the overall financial condition of the Company or the Bank is unsound.\nSection 12. Other Conditions\n12.1 Assignment. No right or interest of any Participant in the Plan shall be assignable or transferable, or subject to any lien, directly or\nindirectly, by operation of law, or otherwise, including execution, levy, garnishment, attachment, pledge, and bankruptcy. In the event of\nParticipant’s death, payment shall be made to the Participant’s designated beneficiary, or in the absence of such designation, to the\nParticipant’s estate.\n12.2 Right of Employment. The receipt of an award under the Plan shall not give any employee any right to continued employment by\nthe Bank, and the right to dismiss any employee is specifically reserved to the Bank. The receipt of an award with respect to any one year\nshall not give an employee the right to receive an award with respect to any subsequent year.\n12.3 Withholding for Taxes. The Bank shall have the right to deduct from all payments under this Plan any federal or state taxes required\nby law to be withheld with respect to such payments.\n12.4 In the sole discretion of the Board, the Award may be reduced or eliminated if the Participant has not demonstrated satisfactory\nperformance or conduct consistent with Chain Bridge’s Code of Business Ethics and Conduct, mission, shared values, and leadership\nskills.\nSection 13. Legal Considerations\nIn the event that the terms of this Plan conflict with any law, the conflicting terms will be deemed to be modified to the minimum extent\nnecessary to comply with that law. This Plan shall be governed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia.\nSection 14. Effective Date\nThe effective date of this Plan shall be the date of its adoption by the Board.\nAcknowledgement:\nEmployee acknowledges receipt of this Incentive Compensation Plan and further acknowledges that he or she has read and agrees to the terms\noutlined herein.\nBy:___________________________________________\nPrinted Name:___________________________________\nDate:__________________________________________\nExhibit 31.1\nCERTIFICATION\nI, John J.
