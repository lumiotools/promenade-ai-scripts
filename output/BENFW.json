Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical statements of fact, including related to statements about the continued listing of the Company’s securities on Nasdaq. In addition, any statements that refer to projections, forecasts, or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. The words “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “might,” “plan,” “possible,” “potential,” “predict,” “will,” “would,” and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking.\n\nForward-looking statements are predictions, projections and other statements about future events that are based on current expectations and assumptions and, as a result, are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control, and could cause future events or results to be materially different from those stated or implied in this release. It is not possible to predict or identify all such risks. These risks include, but are not limited to, our ability to maintain compliance with Nasdaq listing standards and the risk factors that are described under the section titled “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other documents we file with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. Readers are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements, and we assume no obligation and do not intend to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.\n\n**Contacts** Matt Kreps: 214-597-8200, [mkreps@darrowir.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=CJtes9e2ykl_mW6goAclVMVhF-hfjpEkDU6hDnbwPtfeFBWV18hpLurtQ8lnt-JlD6zJuZ6AtoZ2I_cvlrnPodOjxOO6SwO9F8F1W4cOwew=)Michael Wetherington: 214-284-1199, [mwetherington@darrowir.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=RmBzPuyerhq8Aj-BxizDTT8RsEDIGZglp0pUHfbvAnfrvNZ35JhZIidr-QnxGqkfohFMvEPkFEd45A-l-KNqrgxZzckcnAPX5zN4sm8MYUbycjcqNPrlT9aqy-cDYna0)Investor Relations: [investors@beneficient.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=stLDcHinMMNfjxMVv-jc2k7_EZB6O7DaosT8bhRenk6AzgB7B5tPAQli7oRVuYDQDqAzLFG-h9o_BwDw9D1XfyOUNXtNt4J9TuFbmSQyPcI2Lla1ffYpkz8e0FnM5Qak)\n\n![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/NDJhZTQxYTktMDk2My00NGU5LWE0OWYtMzU2OTViMjE5Y2Q1LTEyMzU0MjI=/tiny/Beneficient.png)\n"

Although management believes that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that these expectations will prove to have been correct.

These risks include, but are not limited to, the risk factors that are described under the section titled “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). These factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are included in this document and in our SEC filings.
