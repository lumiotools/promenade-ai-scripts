DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\nNioCorp Developments Ltd. (“we,” “us,” “our,” “NioCorp” or the “Company”) was incorporated on February 27, 1987, under the laws of the Province of British\nColumbia and currently operates in one reportable operating segment consisting of exploration and development of mineral deposits in North America, specifically,\nthe Elk Creek development-stage property (the “Elk Creek Project”) located in southeastern Nebraska.\nThese interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis that contemplates the realization of assets and discharge of\nliabilities at their carrying values in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. These financial statements do not reflect any adjustments that may be\nnecessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.\nThe Company currently earns no operating revenues and will require additional capital in order to advance the Elk Creek Project to construction and commercial\noperation. As further discussed in Note 3, these matters raised substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, and the Company is\ndependent upon the generation of profits from mineral properties, obtaining additional financing and maintaining continued support from its shareholders and\ncreditors.\n2. BASIS OF PREPARATION\na) Basis of Preparation and Consolidation\nThe accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples of the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The interim\ncondensed consolidated financial statements include the consolidated accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries with all significant\nintercompany transactions eliminated. The accounting policies followed in preparing these interim condensed consolidated financial statements are those used by\nthe Company as set out in the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2023. Certain transactions include reference to Canadian\ndollars (“C$”) where applicable.\nIn the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary (including normal recurring adjustments) for a fair statement of the financial position,\nresults of operations, and cash flows at September 30, 2023, and for all periods presented, have been included in these interim condensed consolidated financial\nstatements. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP\nhave been condensed or omitted pursuant to appropriate SEC rules and regulations. These interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in\nconjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2023. The interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for\nthe full year ending June 30, 2024, or future operating periods.\nb) Recent Accounting Standards\nIssued and Not Effective\nFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) that are adopted by the Company as of\nthe specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, management believes that the impact of recently issued standards did not or will not have a material\nimpact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements upon adoption.\nc) Use of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of\nexpenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the carrying value of long-term assets, deferred\nincome tax assets and related valuations, liabilities related to the Earnout Shares, Private Warrants, and Contingent Consent Warrants (each, as defined below),\nand share-\n6\nNioCorp Developments Ltd.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\nSeptember 30, 2023\n(expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except per share amounts or as otherwise stated) (unaudited)\nbased compensation. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience, and various other factors that it believes to be\nreasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the other sources. The actual results experienced by the\nCompany may differ materially and adversely from the Company’s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between estimates and the actual\nresults, future results of operations will be affected.\nd) Basic and Diluted Earnings per Share\nThe Company utilizes the weighted average method to determine the impact of changes in a participating security on the calculation of loss per share. The\nfollowing table sets forth the computation of the Company’s basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common shareholders:\nFor the Three Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2023 2022\nNet loss $ 3,387 $ 3,877\nAdjust: Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest (174) -\nNet loss available to participating securities 3,213 3,877\nNet loss attributable to vested shares of ECRC Class B common stock (257) -\nNet loss attributed to common shareholders - basic and diluted $ 2,956 $ 3,877\nDenominator:\nWeighted average shares outstanding – basic and diluted 31,967,091 27,792,631\nLoss per Common Share outstanding – basic and diluted $ 0.09 $ 0.14\nThe following common shares, no par value, of the Company (“Common Shares”) underlying options to purchase Common Shares (“Options”), Common Share\npurchase warrants (“Warrants”), and outstanding convertible debt were antidilutive due to a net loss in the periods presented and, therefore, were excluded from\nthe dilutive securities computation for the three-month periods indicated below.\nFor the Three Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2023 2022\nExcluded potentially dilutive securities (1)(2):\nOptions 1,319,000 1,446,400\nWarrants 19,066,304 1,851,622\nConvertible debt 2,448,730 103,000\nTotal potential dilutive securities 22,834,034 3,401,022\n(1) The number of shares is based on the maximum number of shares issuable on exercise or conversion of the related securities as of the period end. Such\namounts have not been adjusted for the treasury stock method or weighted average outstanding calculations as required if the securities were dilutive.\n(2) Earnout Shares are excluded as the vesting terms were not met as of the end of the reporting period.\n3. GOING CONCERN ISSUES\nThe Company incurred a loss of $3,387 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 (2022 - $3,877) and had a working capital deficit of $10,491 and an\naccumulated deficit of $153,690 as of September 30, 2023. As a development stage issuer, the Company has not yet commenced its mining operations and\naccordingly does not generate any revenue. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had cash of $1,098, which will not be sufficient to fund normal operations for\nthe next twelve months without deferring payment on certain liabilities or raising additional funds. In addition, the Company will be required to raise additional funds\nfor construction and\n7\nNioCorp Developments Ltd.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\nSeptember 30, 2023\n(expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except per share amounts or as otherwise stated) (unaudited)\ncommencement of operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe Company’s ability to continue operations and fund its expenditures, which have averaged approximately $2,450 per quarter over the preceding three-year period,\nis dependent on management’s ability to secure additional financing. NioCorp expects to have access to up to $62,030 in net proceeds from the Standby Equity\nPurchase Agreement, dated January 26, 2023 (the “Yorkville Equity Facility Financing Agreement”), between the Company and YA II PN, Ltd., an investment fund\nmanaged by Yorkville Advisors Global, LP (“Yorkville”), through April 1, 2026. In addition, the Company may pursue additional sources of financing, and while it\nhas been successful in doing so in the past, there can be no assurance it will be able to do so in the future. Other than the potential issuance of Common Shares under\nthe Yorkville Equity Facility Financing Agreement, the Company did not have any further funding commitments or arrangements for additional financing as of\nSeptember 30, 2023. These interim condensed consolidated financial statements do not give effect to any adjustments required to realize the Company’s assets and\ndischarge its liabilities in other than the normal course of business and at amounts different from those reflected in the accompanying financial statements.\nRecent worldwide events have created general global economic uncertainty as well as uncertainty in capital markets, supply chain disruptions, increased interest rates\nand inflation, and the potential for geographic recessions. We believe this could have an adverse impact on our ability to obtain financing, development plans, results\nof operations, financial position, and cash flows during the current fiscal year. The full extent to which these events and our precautionary measures may continue to\nimpact our business will depend on future developments, which continue to be highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time.\n4. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES\nAs of\nSeptember 30, June 30,\n2023 2023\nAccounts payable, trade $ 2,521 $ 1,990\nTrade payable accruals 1,018 1,324\nIncome taxes payable - 101\nEnvironmental accruals 48 48\nLoan origination fees payable to related party 28 28\nTotal accounts payable and accrued liabilities $ 3,615 $ 3,491\n5. CONVERTIBLE DEBT\nThe unsecured convertible debentures (the “Convertible Debentures”) issued to Yorkville pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, dated January 26, 2023 (as\namended, the “Yorkville Convertible Debt Financing Agreement”), between the Company and Yorkville, have a maturity date of September 17, 2024, and are a\nclassified as a current liability as of September 30, 2023. Changes in the Convertible Debentures are as follows:\nAmount\nOpening balance, June 30, 2023 $ 10,561\nAccretion expense 2,075\nPrincipal and accrued interest converted (5,729)\nBalance, September 30, 2023 $ 6,907\nAdd: Unamortized debt issuance costs 1,093\nRemaining principal balance, September 30, 2023 $ 8,000\nBased on the Company’s closing Common Share price of $3.63 as of September 30, 2023, conversion of the remaining Convertible Debenture balance, including\naccrued interest, would require the issuance of approximately 2,448,730 Common Shares. For each $0.10 change in the fair value of one Common Share, the total\nshares the Company would be obligated to issue would change by approximately 69,400 shares.\n8\nNioCorp Developments Ltd.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\nSeptember 30, 2023\n(expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except per share amounts or as otherwise stated) (unaudited)\n6. CLASS B COMMON STOCK OF ECRC\nThe shares of Class B common stock of Elk Creek Resource Corporation (“ECRC”), an indirect, majority-owned subsidiary of NioCorp formerly known as GX\nAcquisition Corp. II (“GXII”), the rights of the holders of which to exchange such shares into Common Shares are subject to certain vesting conditions (such shares\nof ECRC Class B common stock, the “Earnout Shares”), were valued utilizing a Monte Carlo Simulation pricing model with the following primary inputs:\nSeptember 30,\nKey Valuation Input 2023\nClosing Common Share price $3.63\nTerm (expiry) March 17, 2033\nVolatility 47.0%\nRisk-free rate 4.59%\nThe following table sets forth a summary of the changes in the fair value of the Earnout Shares liability for the three months ended September 30, 2023:\nAmount\nFair value as of June 30, 2023 $ 10,521\nChange in fair value (2,093)\nFair value as of September 30, 2023 $ 8,428\n7. COMMON SHARES\na) Issuance\nOn September 1, 2023, the Company closed a non-brokered private placement (the “September 2023 Private Placement”) of units of the Company (the “September\n2023 Units”). A total of 250,000 September 2023 Units were issued at a price per September 2023 Unit of $4.00, for total gross proceeds to the Company of $1,000.\nEach September 2023 Unit consists of one Common Share and one Warrant (“September 2023 Warrant”). Each September 2023 Warrant entitles the holder to\nacquire one Common Share at a price of $4.60 at any time prior to September 1, 2025. Proceeds of the September 2023 Private Placement will be used for continued\nadvancement of the Company’s Elk Creek Critical Minerals Project and for working capital and general corporate purposes.\nThe September 2023 Warrants were classified as an equity instrument and accordingly, the net proceeds of $962 were allocated based on the relative fair values of\nthe Common Shares and the September 2023 Warrants on the date of issuance. The amount allocated to the fair value of the September 2023 Warrants was $254 and\nthe balance of the proceeds of $708 was allocated to the Common Shares. The fair value of the September 2023 Warrants issued was computed using the Black\nScholes option pricing model using the following assumptions: an expected life of 2.0 years, a risk-free interest rate of 4.85%, an expected volatility of 71.63%, and\nan expected dividend rate of 0%.\nThe Company issued the following Common Shares under the Yorkville Equity Facility Financing Agreement during the three months ended September 30, 2023:\nCommon Shares Gross Funds Market Value of Loss on\nDate Issued Received Shares Issued Transaction\nSeptember 12, 2023 70,000 $ 259 $ 271 $ 12\nSeptember 18, 2023 75,000 273 314 41\nLoss on transaction represents a non-cash expense equal to the difference between the proceeds received and the fair value of the Common Shares issued based on\nThe Nasdaq Stock Market LLC closing price per Common Share on the issuance date and is recorded in other operating expenses in the consolidated statement of\noperations and comprehensive loss.\nb) Stock Options\nNumber of Weighted Average\nOptions Exercise Price\nBalance, June 30, 2023 1,541,500 C$ 9.64\nCancelled/expired (222,500) 9.04\nBalance, September 30, 2023 1,319,000 C$ 9.74\n9\nNioCorp Developments Ltd.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\nSeptember 30, 2023\n(expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except per share amounts or as otherwise stated) (unaudited)\nThe following table summarizes information about Options outstanding at September 30, 2023:\nNumber Aggregate Number Aggregate\nExercise Price Expiry Date Outstanding Intrinsic Value Exercisable Intrinsic Value\nC$ 5.40 November 15, 2023 208,500 C$ - 208,500 C$ -\nC$ 7.50 December 14, 2023 170,000 - 170,000 -\nC$ 7.50 December 16, 2023 2,500 - 2,500 -\nC$ 13.60 December 17, 2024 350,000 - 350,000 -\nC$ 11.00 May 30, 2025 50,000 - 50,000 -\nC$ 9.52 March 27, 2026 538,000 - 538,000 -\n1,319,000 C$ - 1,319,000 C$ -\nc) Warrants\nPrivate Warrants\nIn connection with the closing of the previously publicly disclosed business combination transaction on March 17, 2023 (the “Closing”), the Company assumed\nGXII’s obligations under the agreement governing the GXII Warrants, as amended by an assignment, assumption and amendment agreement (the “NioCorp Assumed\nWarrant Agreement”), and issued an aggregate of 15,666,626 Warrants (the “NioCorp Assumed Warrants”). The Company issued (a) 9,999,959 public NioCorp\nAssumed Warrants (the “Public Warrants”) in respect of the GXII Warrants that were publicly traded prior to the Closing and (b) 5,666,667 NioCorp Assumed\nWarrants (the “Private Warrants”) to GX Sponsor II LLC (the “Sponsor”).\nEach Private Warrant entitles the holder to the right to purchase 1.11829212 Common Shares at an exercise price of $11.50 per 1.11829212 Common Shares (subject\nto adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like). No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of any Private\nWarrants, and fractional shares that would otherwise be due to the exercising holder will be rounded down to the nearest whole Common Share. In no event will the\nCompany be required to net cash settle any Private Warrant.\nThe Private Warrants: (i) will be exercisable either for cash or on a cashless basis at the holder’s option and (ii) will not be redeemable by the Company, in either case\nas long as the Private Warrants are held by the Sponsor, its members or any of their permitted transferees (as prescribed in the NioCorp Assumed Warrant\nAgreement). In accordance with the NioCorp Assumed Warrant Agreement, any Private Warrants that are held by someone other than the Sponsor, its members or\nany their permitted transferees are treated as Public Warrants.\nThe Company classifies Private Warrants as Level 2 instruments under the fair value hierarchy and estimated the fair value using a Black Scholes model with the\nfollowing assumptions:\nSeptember 30,\nKey Valuation Input 2023\nStock price on valuation date $ 3.63\nStrike price $ 11.50\nImplied volatility of Public Warrants 47%\nRisk free rate 4.65%\nDividend yield 0%\nExpected warrant life in years 4.47\nThe change in the Private Warrants liability is presented below:\nAmount\nFair value at June 30, 2023 $ 3,279\nChange in fair value (181)\nFair value at September 30, 2023 $ 3,098\n10\nNioCorp Developments Ltd.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\nSeptember 30, 2023\n(expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except per share amounts or as otherwise stated) (unaudited)\nContingent Consent Warrants\nAs consideration for entering into the previously publicly disclosed Waiver and Consent Agreement, dated September 25, 2022 (the “Lind Consent”), between the\nCompany and Lind Global Asset Management III, LLC (“Lind”), Lind received, amongst other things, the right to receive additional Warrants (the “Contingent\nConsent Warrants”) if on September 17, 2024, the closing trading price of the Common Shares on the TSX or such other stock exchange on which such shares may\nthen be listed, is less than C$10.00, subject to adjustments. The number of Contingent Consent Warrants to be issued, if any, is based on the Canadian dollar\nequivalent (based on the then current Canadian to US dollar exchange rate as reported by Bloomberg, LP) of $5,000 divided by the five-day volume weighted\naverage price of the Common Shares on the date of issuance. Further, the number of Contingent Consent Warrants issued will be proportionately adjusted based on\nthe percentage of Warrants currently held by Lind that are exercised, if any, prior to the issuance of any Contingent Consent Warrants.\nThe Contingent Consent Warrants are classified as a Level 3 financial instrument and were valued utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation pricing model, which calculates\nmultiple potential outcomes for future share prices based on historic volatility of the Common Shares to determine the probability of issuance at 18 months following\nthe applicable valuation date and to determine the value of the Contingent Consent Warrants. The following table discloses the primary inputs into the Monte Carlo\nmodel at the balance sheet date and the probability of issuance calculated by the model.\nSeptember 30,\nKey Valuation Input 2023\nShare price on valuation date $ 3.63\nVolatility 62.0%\nRisk free rate 4.60%\nProbability of issuance 92.7%\nThe change in the fair value of the Contingent Consent Warrants is presented below:\nAmount\nFair value at June 30, 2023 $ 1,710\nChange in fair value 254\nFair value at September 30, 2023 $ 1,964\nThe measurement date for the potential issuance of Contingent Consent Warrants is September 17, 2024, and therefore, as of September 30, 2023, the Contingent\nConsent Warrants are classified as a current liability.\n8.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nThe following tables present information about the assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2023, and June 30,\n2023, respectively, and indicate the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques the Company utilized to determine such fair value. In general, fair values\ndetermined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical instruments. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize data\npoints that are observable, such as quoted prices, interest rates, and yield curves. Fair values determined by Level 3 inputs are unobservable data points for the\nfinancial instrument and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the instrument.\nAs of September 30, 2023\nNote Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nAssets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 1,098 $ 1,098 $ - $ -\nInvestment in equity securities 8 8 - -\nTotal $ 1,106 $ 1,106 $ - $ -\nLiabilities:\nEarnout Shares liability 6 $ 8,428 $ - $ - $ 8,428\nWarrant liabilities 7c 5,062 - 3,098 1,964\nTotal $ 13,490 $ - $ 3,098 $ 10,392\n12\nNioCorp Developments Ltd.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\nSeptember 30, 2023\n(expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except per share amounts or as otherwise stated) (unaudited)\nAs of June 30, 2023\nTotal Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nAssets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 2,341 $ 2,341 $ - $ -\nInvestment in equity securities 9 9 - -\nTotal $ 2,350 $ 2,350 $ - $ -\nLiabilities:\nEarnout Shares liability $ 10,521 $ - $ - $ 10,521\nWarrant liabilities 4,989 - 3,279 1,710\nTotal $ 15,510 $ - $ 3,279 $ 12,231\nThe Convertible Debentures discussed in Note 5 were initially recorded at fair value, which represented a nonrecurring fair value measurement using a Level 3 input.\nAt September 30, 2023, the estimated fair value of this instrument approximated carrying value given that the instrument was issued in March 2023 and has a short\ntime period until maturity.\n13\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of, and for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United\nStates (“U.S. GAAP”). This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements and forward-looking information that involve risks, uncertainties, and\nassumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements and information as a result of many factors, including,\nbut not limited to, those set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. See “Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” below.\nAll currency amounts are stated in U.S. dollars unless noted otherwise.\nAs used in this report, unless the context otherwise indicates, references to “we,” “our,” the “Company,” “NioCorp,” and “us” refer to NioCorp Developments Ltd. and\nits subsidiaries, collectively.\nNote Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the exhibits attached hereto contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of\n1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and “forward-looking information”\nwithin the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation (collectively, “forward-looking statements”). Such forward-looking statements concern our anticipated\nresults and developments in the operations of the Company in future periods, planned exploration activities, the adequacy of the Company’s financial resources, and other\nevents or conditions that may occur in the future.\nForward-looking statements have been based upon our current business and operating plans, as approved by the Company’s Board of Directors, and may include\nstatements regarding the anticipated benefits of the transactions (the “Transactions”) contemplated by the previously disclosed Business Combination Agreement, dated\nSeptember 25, 2022 (the “Business Combination Agreement”), among the Company, GX Acquisition Corp.

Any statements that express or involve discussions with respect to predictions, expectations, beliefs, plans, projections, objectives,\nassumptions, or future events or performance (often, but not always, using words or phrases such as “expects” or “does not expect,” “is expected,” “anticipates” or “does\nnot anticipate,” “plans,” “estimates,” or “intends,” or stating that certain actions, events, or results “may,” “could,”\n14\n“would,” “might,” or “will” be taken, occur or be achieved) are not statements of historical fact and may be forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements\nreflect the Company’s current views with respect to future events and are subject to certain known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Many factors could\ncause actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance, or achievements that may be expressed or implied by\nsuch forward-looking statements, including, among others, risks related to the following: NioCorp’s ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the Transactions,\nincluding NioCorp’s ability to access the full amount of the expected net proceeds under the Yorkville Equity Facility Financing Agreement over the next three years;\nunexpected costs related to the Transactions; the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against NioCorp following closing of the Transactions;\nNioCorp’s ability to receive a final commitment of financing from EXIM on the anticipated timeline, on acceptable terms, or at all; NioCorp’s ability to continue to meet\nNasdaq listing standards; NioCorp’s ability to operate as a going concern; risks relating to the Common Shares, including price volatility, lack of dividend payments and\ndilution or the perception of the likelihood any of the foregoing; NioCorp’s requirement of significant additional capital; the extent to which NioCorp’s level of\nindebtedness and/or the terms contained in agreements governing NioCorp’s indebtedness or the Yorkville Equity Facility Financing Agreement may impair NioCorp’s\nability to obtain additional financing; covenants contained in agreements with NioCorp’s secured creditors that may affect its assets; NioCorp’s limited operating history;\nNioCorp’s history of losses; the restatement of NioCorp’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 and the interim\nperiods ended September 30, 2021, December 31, 2021, March 31, 2022, September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2022 and the impact of such restatement on NioCorp’s\nfuture financial statements and other financial measures; the material weaknesses in NioCorp’s internal control over financial reporting, NioCorp’s efforts to remediate\nsuch material weaknesses and the timing of remediation; the possibility that NioCorp may qualify as a PFIC under the Code; the potential that the Transactions could\nresult in NioCorp becoming subject to materially adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences as a result of the application of Section 7874 and related sections of the\nCode; cost increases for NioCorp’s exploration and, if warranted, development projects; a disruption in, or failure of, NioCorp’s information technology systems,\nincluding those related to cybersecurity; equipment and supply shortages; variations in the market demand for, and prices of, niobium, scandium, titanium and rare earth\nproducts; current and future offtake agreements, joint ventures, and partnerships; NioCorp’s ability to attract qualified management; the effects of global health crises on\nNioCorp’s business plans, financial condition and liquidity; estimates of mineral resources and reserves; mineral exploration and production activities; feasibility study\nresults; the results of metallurgical testing; changes in demand for and price of commodities (such as fuel and electricity) and currencies; competition in the mining\nindustry; changes or disruptions in the securities markets; legislative, political or economic developments, including changes in federal and/or state laws that may\nsignificantly affect the mining industry; the impacts of climate change, as well as actions taken or required by governments related to strengthening resilience in the face\nof potential impacts from climate change; the need to obtain permits and comply with laws and regulations and other regulatory requirements; the timing and reliability of\nsampling and assay data; the possibility that actual results of work may differ from projections/expectations or may not realize the perceived potential of NioCorp’s\nprojects; risks of accidents, equipment breakdowns, and labor disputes or other unanticipated difficulties or interruptions; the possibility of cost overruns or unanticipated\nexpenses in development programs; operating or technical difficulties in connection with exploration, mining, or development activities; the management of the water\nbalance at the Elk Creek Project site; land reclamation requirements related to the Elk Creek Project; the speculative nature of mineral exploration and development,\nincluding the risks of diminishing quantities of grades of reserves and resources; claims on the title to NioCorp’s properties; potential future litigation; and NioCorp’s lack\nof insurance covering all of NioCorp’s operations.\nShould one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described\nherein. This list is not exhaustive of the factors that may affect any of the Company’s forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements about the\nfuture and are inherently uncertain, and actual achievements of the Company or other future events or conditions may differ materially from those reflected in the\nforward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties, and other factors, including without limitation those discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” in our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, as well as other factors described elsewhere in this report and the Company’s other reports filed\nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).\nThe Company’s forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are based on the beliefs, expectations, and opinions of management as of\nthe date of this report. The Company does not assume any obligation to update forward-looking statements if circumstances or management’s beliefs, expectations, or\nopinions should\n15\nchange, except as required by law. For the reasons set forth above, investors should not attribute undue certainty to, or place undue reliance on, forward-looking\nstatements.\nQualified Person\nAll technical and scientific information that forms the basis for the Elk Creek Project disclosure included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q has been reviewed and\napproved by Scott Honan, M.Sc., SME-RM, NioCorp’s Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Honan is a “Qualified Person” as such term is defined in National Instrument 43-101\n– Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects and subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K.\nCompany Overview\nNioCorp is developing the Elk Creek Project, located in southeast Nebraska. The Elk Creek Project is a development-stage property that has disclosed niobium,\nscandium, and titanium mineral reserves and resources and disclosed rare earth oxide mineral resources. The Company is continuing technical and economic studies\naround the rare earths contained in the Project’s Mineral Resource. Niobium is used to produce various superalloys that are extensively used in high performance aircraft\nand jet turbines. It also is used in High-Strength, Low-Alloy steel, a stronger steel used in automobiles, bridges, structural systems, buildings, pipelines, and other\napplications that generally increases strength and/or reduces weight, which can result in environmental benefits, including reduced fuel consumption and material usage\nand fewer air emissions. Scandium can be combined with aluminum to make high-performance alloys with increased strength and improved corrosion resistance.\nScandium also is a critical component of advanced solid oxide fuel cells, an environmentally preferred technology for high-reliability, distributed electricity generation.\nTitanium is a component of various superalloys and other applications that are used for aerospace applications, weapons systems, protective armor, medical implants, and\nmany others. It also is used in pigments for paper, paint, and plastics. Rare earths are critical to electrification and decarbonization initiatives and can be used to\nmanufacture the strongest permanent magnets commercially available.\nOur primary business strategy is to advance our Elk Creek Project to commercial production. We are focused on obtaining additional funds to carry out our near-term\nplanned work programs associated with securing the project financing necessary to complete mine development and construction of the Elk Creek Project.\nRecent Corporate Events\nOn September 1, 2023, the Company closed a non-brokered private placement (the “September 2023 Private Placement”) of units of the Company (the “September 2023\nUnits”). A total of 250,000 September 2023 Units were issued at a price per September 2023 Unit of $4.00, for total gross proceeds to the Company of $1.0 million. Each\nSeptember 2023 Unit consists of one Common Share and one Common Share purchase warrant (a “Warrant” and, as a part of a September 2023 Unit, a “September 2023\nWarrant”). Each September 2023 Warrant entitles the holder to acquire one Common Share at a price of $4.60 at any time prior to September 1, 2025. Proceeds of the\nSeptember 2023 Private Placement will be used for continued advancement of the Company’s Elk Creek Critical Minerals Project and for working capital and general\ncorporate purposes.\nIn May 2023, we announced an aluminum-scandium (“Al-Sc”) master alloy initiative (the “Al-Sc master alloy initiative”), in partnership with Boston-based Nanoscale\nPowders LLC (“Nanoscale”). This Al-Sc master alloy initiative is expected to result in the production of several ingots of Al-Sc master alloy at potentially commercial\namounts of scandium content using a proprietary process developed by Nanoscale that is expected to increase efficiency and reduce environmental impacts of Al-Sc\nproduction over traditional approaches. Al-Sc master alloy, which generally contains 2% by weight scandium, is used to introduce scandium into aluminum for the\npurpose of producing various Al-Sc alloys, which generally contain a fraction of a percent scandium by weight. These alloys help to reduce weight, increase strength and\ncorrosion resistance, and make the material weldable in automotive and mass transit, aerospace, defense, space, and other systems. NioCorp’s goal is to demonstrate the\nability to make Al-Sc master alloy containing from 2% by weight scandium to as much as 10% by weight scandium.\nOn August 14, 2023, the Company announced the production of scandium metal at pilot-scale at a facility owned and operated by Creative Engineers in New Freedom,\nPennsylvania. The production of scandium metal represented the first phase in the Al-Sc master alloy initiative. Subsequently, on October 18, 2023, the Company\nannounced the successful pilot-scale production of a 1-kilogram ingot of Al-Sc alloy at the Creative Engineers facility.\n16\nElk Creek Project Update\nThe Company completed the installation and commissioning of a continuous groundwater level monitoring system during the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The\nsystem collects and records data in three geologic strata of interest: the upper glacial till, the Pennsylvanian limestone that underlies the glacial till, and the carbonatite\nthat underlies the limestone. The data collected from this effort will assist the Company’s contract hydrogeologists to refine and improve the hydrogeologic model for the\nElk Creek Project.\nThe Company completed a mine geotechnical review and a site visit by a qualified person, as defined in National Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for\nMineral Projects and subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K (a “Qualified Person”), during the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The Company’s contract geotechnical\nengineering firm inspected drill core and conducted a site inspection. As funding becomes available, the geotechnical firm will review and update their geomechanical\nmodel of the project to ensure that the mining operation will be conducted under safe and stable ground conditions.\nThe Company’s demonstration plant completed metallurgical operations during the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The impetus for the demonstration plant was to\naddress recommendations in the Company’s most recent technical report and to establish metallurgical performance criteria for the rare earths. The demonstration plant\nwas successful in this regard, and the measured improvements in metallurgical performance are summarized in the following table:\nThe remaining work at the demonstration plant entails producing sufficient quantities of waste materials for follow-on characterization to support tailings impoundment\nand paste backfill engineering designs. Additional work at the demonstration plant may be undertaken to support potential offtake agreements, where the counterparty to\nthe offtake requests product samples for evaluation.\nThe metallurgical data presented above has been provided to the Qualified Persons responsible for the Company’s previously disclosed mineral resource and mineral\nreserve estimates, and these firms have been tasked with updating the mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates. This data, along with updated capital and operating\ncosts for the prospective Elk Creek operation, will form the basis of an updated economic evaluation of the Elk Creek Project that will reflect the improved metallurgical\nperformance as well as the impact of potential rare earth production.\nOther Activities\nOur long-term financing efforts continued during the quarter ended September 30, 2023. As previously disclosed, on March 6, 2023, the Company announced the receipt\nof a Letter of Interest from the EXIM for potential debt financing of up to $800 million through EXIM’s “Make More In America” initiative to fund a portion of the\nproject costs of the Elk Creek Project. A project finance letter of interest from EXIM represents only a preliminary step in the formal\n17\nEXIM application process, and the Letter of Interest states that the communication “does not represent a financing commitment” and “is not an explicit indication of the\nfinancial or commercial viability of a transaction.” As stated in the Letter of Interest, “Upon receipt of NioCorp’s application for financing, EXIM will conduct all\nrequisite due diligence necessary to determine if a Final Commitment may be issued for this transaction.” The process from submission of an application to a final\ncommitment of financing by EXIM, if any, is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. As explained in the Letter of Interest, “Any final commitment will be\ndependent on meeting EXIM’s underwriting criteria, authorization process, and finalization and satisfaction of terms and conditions. All Final Commitments must be in\ncompliance with EXIM policies as well as program, legal, and eligibility requirements.” The debt financing is subject to the satisfactory completion of due diligence, the\nnegotiation and settlement of final terms, and the negotiation of definitive documentation.\nNioCorp submitted a formal application to EXIM for a loan under EXIM’s “Make More in America” initiative on June 6, 2023. The Company was informed that its\napplication received approval by the first of three reviews by the EXIM Transaction Review Committee on October 2, 2023. EXIM has indicated that they will now\ndevote additional resources to the processing of the Company’s application and will require the Company to execute indemnity fee agreements with external consultants\nwho will be tasked with conducting detailed reviews of the financial and technical (including environmental) aspects of the Company’s application. We are currently\nunable to estimate how long the application process may take, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully negotiate a final commitment of debt\nfinancing from EXIM.\nAs funds become available through the Company’s fundraising efforts, we expect to undertake the following activities:\n● Continuation of the Company’s efforts to secure federal, state and local operating permits;\n● Continued evaluation of the potential to produce rare earth products and sell such products under offtake agreements;\n● Negotiation and completion of offtake agreements for the remaining uncommitted production of niobium, scandium, and titanium from the project, including\nthe potential sale of titanium as titanium tetrachloride;\n● Negotiation and completion of engineering, procurement, and construction agreements;\n● Completion of the final detailed engineering for the underground portion of the Elk Creek Project;\n● Initiation and completion of the final detailed engineering for surface project facilities;\n● Construction of natural gas and electrical infrastructure under existing agreements to serve the Elk Creek Project site;\n● Completion of water supply agreements and related infrastructure to deliver fresh water to the project site;\n● Initiation of revised mine groundwater investigation and control activities;\n● Initiation of long-lead equipment procurement activities; and\n● As a follow-on to the Company’s demonstration plant operations, complete characterization and testing of waste materials to support tailings impoundment\nand paste backfill plant designs.\n18\nFinancial and Operating Results\nThe Company has no revenues from mining operations. Operating expenses incurred related primarily to costs incurred for the advancement of the Elk Creek Project and\nthe activities necessary to support corporate and shareholder duties, and are detailed in the following table.\nFor the Three Months\nEnded September 30,\n2023 2022\nOperating expenses (000s)\nEmployee-related costs $ 322 $ 293\nProfessional fees 1,187 164\nExploration expenditures 1,100 1,288\nOther operating expenses 834 337\nTotal operating expenses 3,443 2,082\nChange in fair value of Earnout Shares liability (2,093) -\nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities 73 (257)\nLoss on debt extinguishment - 1,622\nInterest expense 2,075 258\nForeign exchange (gain) loss (11) 173\nLoss (gain) on equity securities 1 (1)\nIncome tax benefit (101) -\nLoss attributable to noncontrolling interest 174 -\nNet loss attributable to the Company $ 3,213 $ 3,877\nThree-month period ended September 30, 2023 compared to the three-month period ended September 30, 2022\nSignificant items affecting operating expenses are noted below:\nEmployee-related costs increased in 2023 as compared to 2022, primarily due to the impact of board-authorized employee salary increases, which became effective\nApril 1, 2023.\nProfessional fees increased in 2023 as compared to 2022, primarily due to the timing of legal services associated with the Company’s SEC registration statements\nfiled in October 2023, as well as increased audit fees associated with the Company’s June 30, 2023 financial statements.\nExploration expenditures decreased in 2023 as compared to 2022, as 2022 costs included demonstration plant development and start-up costs, as well as costs related\nto the completion and filing of the Technical Report Summary based on the Company’s 2022 Feasibility Study for the Elk Creek Project, which was filed with the\nSEC on September 6, 2022.\nOther operating expenses include costs related to investor relations, general office expenditures, equity offering and proxy expenditures, board-related expenditures,\nand other miscellaneous costs. These costs increased in 2023 as compared to 2022 primarily due to the impact of increased director and officer insurance costs\nassociated with the Company’s listing on the Nasdaq, which began in March 2023.\nOther significant items impacting the change in the Company’s net loss are noted below:\nChange in fair value of Earnout Shares liability represents the change in fair value related to the shares of Class B common stock of Elk Creek Resource Corporation\n(“ECRC”), an indirect, majority-owned subsidiary of NioCorp formerly known as GX Acquisition Corp. II, the rights of the holders of which to exchange such shares\ninto Common Shares are subject to certain vesting conditions (such shares of ECRC Class B common stock, the “Earnout Shares”) for 2023, based on the results of\nMonte Carlo financial modeling. The Company recognized this liability in connection with the Transactions, which closed in March 2023.\nChange in fair value of warrant liability primarily represents the change in fair value related to Lind Global Asset Management III, LLC’s (“Lind”) right to receive\nadditional Warrants (the “Contingent Consent Warrants”) as consideration for entering into the previously disclosed Waiver and Consent Agreement, dated September\n25, 2022 (the “Lind Consent”), between the Company and Lind, based on the impact of a lower closing Common Share price, which increases the probability of\nthese Contingent Consent Warrants being issued on the 18-month\n19\nanniversary. This expense was partially offset by a slight decrease in the valuation of the Warrants issued to GX Sponsor II LLC (the “Sponsor”) in connection with\nthe closing of the Transactions (the “Private Warrants”).\nInterest expense increased in 2023 as compared to 2022 due to accretion expense associated with the unsecured convertible debentures (the “Convertible\nDebentures”) issued to Yorkville, which were issued in March 2023.\nForeign exchange loss is primarily due to changes in the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar. During 2022, the functional currency of the parent company was\nCanadian dollars, and the loss for the period was primarily due to changes in the foreign exchange rates applied to U.S. dollar-denominated debt instruments.\nEffective March 17, 2023, the parent company’s functional currency became the U.S. dollar.\nLoss attributable to noncontrolling interest represents the portion of net loss in ECRC not owned by the Company.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have no revenue generating operations from which we can internally generate funds. To date, our ongoing operations have been financed by the sale of our equity\nsecurities by way of private placements, convertible securities issuances, the exercise of incentive options to purchase Common Shares (“Options”) and Warrants, and\nrelated party loans. With respect to currently outstanding Options and Warrants, we believe that exercise of these instruments, and cash proceeds from such exercises, will\nnot occur unless and until the market price for our Common Shares equals or exceeds the related exercise price of each instrument.\nThe Yorkville Equity Facility Financing Agreement is expected to provide near-term and longer-term access to capital. The ability of the Company to draw down on the\nYorkville Equity Facility Financing Agreement, at its discretion, is subject to certain limitations and the satisfaction of certain conditions and, when available, provides an\nopportunity to actively manage the cash needs of the Company more closely. Historically, cash has generally been available to the Company through private placements\nof equity for which the timing did not always coincide with the Company’s cash needs. The Company may utilize the Yorkville Equity Facility Financing Agreement to\npotentially generate funds at a time when they are in need. Alternatively, the Company can also utilize the Yorkville Equity Facility Financing Agreement for\nopportunistic share sales.\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had cash of $1.1 million and a working capital deficit of $10.5 million, compared to cash of $2.3 million and working capital of\n$0.2 million on June 30, 2023.\nWe expect that the Company will operate at a loss for the foreseeable future. The Company’s current planned cash needs are approximately $9.25 million until June 30,\n2024. In addition to outstanding accounts payable and short-term liabilities, our average monthly planned expenditures through June 30, 2024 are expected to be\napproximately $745,000 per month where approximately $495,000 is for corporate overhead and estimated costs related to securing financing necessary for advancement\nof the Elk Creek Project. Approximately $250,000 per month is planned for expenditures relating to the advancement of the Elk Creek Project by ECRC. The Company’s\nability to continue operations and fund our current work plan is dependent on management’s ability to secure additional financing.\nThe Company anticipates that it does not have sufficient cash on hand to continue to fund basic operations for the next twelve months, and additional funds totaling $10.0\nmillion to $11.0 million are likely to be necessary to continue advancing the project in the areas of financing, permitting, and detailed engineering. While the Yorkville\nEquity Facility Financing Agreement may provide the Company with access to additional capital, the Company may require additional capital to meet its cash needs.\nManagement is actively pursuing such additional sources of debt and equity financing, and while it has been successful in doing so in the past, there can be no assurance\nit will be able to do so in the future.\nElk Creek property lease commitments are $18,000 until June 30, 2024. To maintain our currently held properties and fund our currently anticipated general and\nadministrative costs and planned exploration and development activities at the Elk Creek Project for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024, the Company will likely require\nadditional financing during the current fiscal year. Should such financing not be available in that timeframe, we will be required to reduce our activities and will not be\nable to carry out all our presently planned activities at the Elk Creek Project.\n20\nOn June 6, 2023, the Company announced that it had submitted an application to EXIM for debt financing (the “EXIM Financing”) to fund the project costs for the Elk\nCreek Project, under EXIM’s “Make More in America” initiative. The EXIM Financing is subject to, among other matters, the satisfactory completion of due diligence,\nthe negotiation and settlement of final terms, and the negotiation of definitive documentation. There can be no assurance that the EXIM Financing will be completed on\nthe terms described herein or at all.\nExcept for potential funding under the Yorkville Equity Facility Financing Agreement, discussed above, and the potential exercise of Options and Warrants, we currently\nhave no further funding commitments or arrangements for additional financing at this time, and there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such additional\nfinancing on acceptable terms, if at all. Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, dated as of March 17, 2023 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, the\n“Exchange Agreement”), by and among NioCorp, ECRC and the Sponsor, NioCorp is restricted from issuing equity or equity-linked securities (other than Common\nShares) or any preferred equity or non-voting equity if such issuance would adversely impact the rights of the holders of the shares of Class B common stock of ECRC,\nwithout the consent of the holders of a majority of the shares of Class B common stock of ECRC. The Yorkville Convertible Debt Financing Agreement also contains\ncertain covenants that, among other things, limit NioCorp’s ability to use the proceeds from the issuance of the securities pursuant to the Yorkville Convertible Debt\nFinancing Agreement to repay related party debt or to enter into any variable rate transaction, including issuances of equity or debt securities that are convertible into\nCommon Shares at variable rates and any equity line of credit, ATM agreement or other continuous offering of Common Shares, other than with Yorkville, subject to\ncertain exceptions. Notwithstanding the restrictions set forth in the Exchange Agreement and the Yorkville Convertible Debt Financing Agreement, there is significant\nuncertainty that we would be able to secure any additional financing in the current equity or debt markets. The quantity of funds to be raised and the terms of any\nproposed equity or debt financing that may be undertaken will be negotiated by management as opportunities to raise funds arise. Management may pursue funding\nsources of both debt and equity financing, including but not limited to the issuance of equity securities in the form of Common Shares, Warrants, subscription receipts, or\nany combination thereof in units of the Company pursuant to private placements to accredited investors or pursuant to public offerings in the form of\nunderwritten/brokered offerings, registered direct offerings, or other forms of equity financing and public or private issuances of debt securities including secured and\nunsecured convertible debt instruments or secured debt project financing. Management does not currently know the terms pursuant to which such financings may be\ncompleted in the future, but any such financings will be negotiated at arm’s-length. Future financings involving the issuance of equity securities or derivatives thereof will\nlikely be completed at a discount to the then-current market price of the Company’s securities and will likely be dilutive to current shareholders. In addition, we could\nraise funds through the sale of interests in our mineral properties, although current market conditions and other recent worldwide events have substantially reduced the\nnumber of potential buyers/acquirers of any such interests. However, we cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to be successful in raising such funds.\nBased on the conditions described within, management has concluded, as supported by the notes that accompany our financial statements for the year ended June 30,\n2023, that substantial doubt exists as to our ability to continue in business. The financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been prepared\nunder the assumption that we will continue as a going concern. We are a development stage issuer and we have incurred losses since our inception. We may not have\nsufficient cash to fund normal operations and meet debt obligations for the next twelve months without deferring payment on certain current liabilities and raising\nadditional funds. Recent worldwide events have created general global economic uncertainty as well as uncertainty in capital markets, supply chain disruptions, increased\ninterest rates and inflation, and the potential for geographic recessions. During fiscal year 2023 and continuing into fiscal year 2024, these events continued to create\nuncertainty with respect to overall project funding and timelines. We believe that the going concern uncertainty cannot be alleviated with confidence until the Company\nhas entered into a business climate where funding of its planned ongoing operating activities is secured. Therefore, these factors raise substantial doubt as to our ability to\ncontinue as a going concern.\nWe have no exposure to any asset-backed commercial paper. Other than cash held by our subsidiaries for their immediate operating needs in Colorado and Nebraska, all\nof our cash reserves are on deposit with major U.S. and Canadian chartered banks. We do not believe that the credit, liquidity, or market risks with respect thereto have\nincreased as a result of the current market conditions. However, in order to achieve greater security for the preservation of our capital, we have, of necessity, been required\nto accept lower rates of interest, which has also lowered our potential interest income.\n21\nOperating Activities\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company’s operating activities consumed $2.7 million of cash (2022: $1.7 million). The cash used in operating\nactivities for the three months ended September 30, 2023, reflects the Company’s funding of losses of $3.4 million and Convertible Debenture accretion, partially offset\nby a reduction in the Earnout Shares liability and other non-cash transactions. Overall, operational outflows during the three months ended September 30, 2023, increased\nfrom the corresponding period of 2022 due to increased professional services performed in 2023. Going forward, the Company’s working capital requirements are\nexpected to increase substantially in connection with the development of the Elk Creek Project.\nFinancing Activities\nFinancing inflows were $1.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 (2022: $0.02 million outflow), with 2023 inflows reflecting the receipt of $1.0\nmillion from the September 2023 Private Placement and $0.5 million from Common Share issuances under the Yorkville Equity Facility Financing Agreement.\nCash Flow Considerations\nThe Company has historically relied upon debt and equity financings to finance its activities. Subject to the restrictions set forth in the Exchange Agreement and the\nYorkville Convertible Debt Financing Agreement, the Company may pursue additional debt and/or equity financing in the medium term; however, there can be no\nassurance the Company will be able to obtain any required financing in the future on acceptable terms.\nThe Company has limited financial resources compared to its proposed expenditures, no source of operating income, and no assurance that additional funding will be\navailable to it for current or future projects, although the Company has been successful in the past in financing its activities through the sale of equity securities.\nThe ability of the Company to arrange additional financing in the future will depend, in part, on the prevailing capital market conditions, and its success in developing the\nElk Creek Project. Any quoted market for the Common Shares may be subject to market trends generally, notwithstanding any potential success of the Company in\ncreating revenue, cash flows, or earnings, and any depression of the trading price of the Common Shares could impact its ability to obtain equity financing on acceptable\nterms.\nHistorically, the Company has used net proceeds from issuances of Common Shares to provide sufficient funds to meet its near-term exploration and development plans\nand other contractual obligations when due. However, development and construction of the Elk Creek Project will require substantial additional capital resources. This\nincludes near-term funding and, ultimately, funding for Elk Creek Project construction and other costs. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” above for the Company’s\ndiscussion of arrangements related to possible future financings.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThere have been no material changes in our critical accounting estimates discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations” under the heading “Critical Accounting Estimates and Recent Accounting Pronouncements” as of June 30, 2023, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nfiscal year ended June 30, 2023.\nCertain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations\nIf NioCorp (or a subsidiary) is a “passive foreign investment company” (“PFIC”) for any taxable year (or portion thereof) that is included in the holding period of a U.S.\nholder of Common Shares or other NioCorp securities (as determined under applicable U.S. federal income tax law), then certain significant adverse tax consequences\ncould apply to such U.S. holder, including requirements to treat any gain realized upon a disposition of Common Shares (or other securities) as ordinary income, to\ninclude certain “excess distributions” on Common Shares in income, and to pay an interest charge on a portion of any such gain or distribution. NioCorp believes that it\nwas classified as a PFIC during the taxable years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, and, based on the current composition of its income and assets, as well as current\nbusiness plans and financial expectations, that it may be classified as a PFIC for its current taxable year or in future taxable years. No opinion of legal counsel or ruling\nfrom the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”)\n22\nconcerning the PFIC status of NioCorp or any subsidiary has been obtained or is currently planned to be requested. The determination of whether any corporation was, or\nwill be, a PFIC for a taxable year depends, in part, on the application of complex U.S. federal income tax rules, which are subject to differing interpretations. In addition,\nwhether any corporation will be a PFIC for any taxable year depends on the assets and income of such corporation over the course of each such taxable year and, as a\nresult, cannot be predicted with certainty as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition, even if NioCorp concluded that it or any subsidiary was not\nclassified as a PFIC, the IRS could challenge such determination and a court could sustain the challenge. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that NioCorp or any\nsubsidiary will not be classified as a PFIC for any taxable year. Each holder of Common Shares or other NioCorp securities should consult its own tax advisors regarding\nthe PFIC status of NioCorp and each subsidiary thereof and the resulting tax consequences to the holder, as well as any potential to mitigate such tax consequences\nthrough a “QEF” or “mark-to-market” election. See the “Risk Factors” section of NioCorp’s Annual Quarterly Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30,\n2023.\nOther\nThe Company has one class of shares, being Common Shares. A summary of outstanding shares, Options, Warrants, and convertible debt as of November 13, 2023, is set\nout below, on a fully-diluted basis.\nCommon Shares\nOutstanding\n(Fully Diluted)\nCommon Shares 33,142,280\nVested shares of ECRC Class B common stock1 4,565,808\nStock options2 1,319,000\nWarrants3 18,917,199\nConvertible debt4 2,147,800\n1 Each exchangeable into one Common Share at any time, and from time to time, until March 17, 2033.\n2 Each exercisable into one Common Share.\n3 Includes 15,666,626 NioCorp Assumed Warrants that are each exercisable into 1.11829212 Common Shares, and 3,250,573 Warrants that are each\nexercisable into one Common Share.\n4 Represents Common Shares issuable on conversion of Convertible Debentures with an aggregate outstanding principal and accrued interest\namount of $7.6 million as of November 13, 2023, assuming a market price per Common Share of $3.91 on that date.\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nInterest rate risk\nThe Company’s exposure to changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Company’s earned interest income on cash deposits and short-term investments. The\nCompany maintains a balance between the liquidity of cash assets and the interest rate return thereon. The carrying amount of financial assets, net of any provisions for\nlosses, represents the Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk.\nForeign currency exchange risk\nThe Company incurs expenditures in both U.S. dollars and Canadian dollars. Canadian dollar expenditures are primarily related to certain Common Share-related costs\nand corporate professional services. As a result, currency exchange fluctuations may impact the costs of our operating activities. To reduce this risk, we maintain\nsufficient cash balances in Canadian dollars to fund expected near-term expenditures.\nCommodity price risk\nThe Company is exposed to commodity price risk related to the elements associated with the Elk Creek Project. A significant decrease in the global demand for these\nelements may have a material adverse effect on our business. The Elk Creek Project is not in production, and the Company does not currently hold any commodity\nderivative positions.\n23\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nAt the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision of\nand with the participation of our management, including the CEO and the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), of the effectiveness of the design and operations of our\ndisclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, the CEO and the CFO have\nconcluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weaknesses in\ninternal control over financial reporting described below.\nThe Company’s disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to ensure that: (i) information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit to the\nSEC under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in applicable rules and forms and (ii) material\ninformation required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and the CFO, as\nappropriate, to allow for accurate and timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all error and all fraud. The effectiveness of our or any system of disclosure controls\nand procedures, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the objectives of the system will be met and is subject to certain\nlimitations, including the exercise of judgment in designing, implementing, and evaluating controls and procedures and the assumptions used in identifying the likelihood\nof future events.\nMaterial Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financing Reporting Existing as of September 30, 2023\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material\nmisstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nManagement concluded that the material weaknesses disclosed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 continued to exist\nas of September 30, 2023. Specifically, management concluded that the following material weaknesses exist as of September 30, 2023:\n● Control Environment: Management did not design and maintain an effective control environment based on the criteria established by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations Integrated Framework (2013) (“COSO Framework”). Specifically, the Company does not have sufficient personnel with the\nappropriate levels of knowledge, experience, and training in accounting and internal control over financial reporting commensurate with the complexity of the\nCompany’s business. This material weakness contributed to additional material weaknesses related to the Company’s control activities as further described\nbelow.\n● Risk Assessment: Management did not design and maintain effective controls over the risk assessment process. Specifically, management does not have a formal\nprocess to identify, update, and assess risks due to changes in the Company’s business practices, including entering into increasingly complex transactions that\ncould significantly impact the design and operation of the Company’s control activities.\n● Control Activities: Management did not design and maintain effective controls, including management review controls, related to non-routine transactions.\nSpecifically, management did not maintain effective controls over monitoring and assessing the work of third-party specialists, including the evaluation of the\nappropriateness of accounting conclusions that has resulted in misstatements. In addition, the Company did not design and maintain effective controls related to\nthe evaluation of certain inputs and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of instruments and features associated with complex debt and equity transactions.\nFinally, management did not have policies and procedures for the reconsideration of existing agreements when infrequent transactions occur.\n24\n● Monitoring Activities: Management did not design and maintain effective monitoring controls to support timely evaluation of remediation of identified internal\ncontrol deficiencies.\nAs previously disclosed, these material weaknesses were initially identified at various points during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 in connection with the Company’s\nnormal quarterly close and review procedures, and certain of these material weaknesses resulted in errors that required the restatement of Company’s consolidated\nfinancial statements as of and for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, as well as the restatement of the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements\nas of and for the interim periods ended September 30, 2021, December 31, 2021, March 31, 2022, September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2022. Additionally, these\nmaterial weaknesses could result in a misstatement of the account balances or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim\nconsolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or timely detected.\nRemediation Plan for the Material Weaknesses\nTo address our material weaknesses existing as of September 30, 2023, we are currently devising a detailed plan to address each individual material weakness identified,\nas well as the overall monitoring process, including the following:\n● In order to remediate the material weaknesses relating to the Company’s control environment and risk assessment process, we plan to develop and implement\ncontrols to ensure work performed by Company personnel and other experts is reviewed by individuals with the appropriate level of U.S. GAAP knowledge and\nexperience. This may include separating the performance and review of certain close procedures among current accounting personnel and/or engaging third party\naccounting consultants with the requisite U.S. GAAP knowledge and experience to perform work under the control and oversight of Company personnel. In\naddition, we plan to enhance the design of our controls over the consideration of all related relevant accounting guidance for the initial recording and subsequent\nmeasurements of non-routine transactions.\n● In order to remediate the material weakness relating to the Company’s controls activities, we are in the process of designing and implementing controls over the\ncompleteness and accuracy of identifying and adequately assessing the assumptions utilized in the valuation analysis of complex financial instruments, as well as\nengaging third party consultants with the relevant background and expertise to perform the appropriate complex valuation analyses under the control and\noversight of Company personnel.\n● In order to remediate the material weakness relating to the Company’s controls over monitoring activities, we plan to design and implement controls to manage\nand monitor our progress towards the remediation of internal control deficiencies and material weaknesses, including oversight by, and periodic reporting to, the\nAudit Committee.\nTo assist us in devising and implementing our remediation plan, we have recently engaged a third-party consulting firm.\nThe process of designing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting is a continuous effort that requires management to anticipate and react to\nchanges in our business, economic and regulatory environments and to expend significant resources. As we continue to evaluate our internal control over financial\nreporting, we may take additional actions to remediate the material weaknesses or modify the remediation actions described above.\nWhile we continue to devote significant time and attention to these remediation efforts, the material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until management\ncompletes the design and implementation of the actions described above and the controls operate for a sufficient period of time, and management has concluded, through\ntesting, that these controls are effective.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOther than as discussed above, there have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2023,\nthat have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n25\nPART II — OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nWe know of no material, active, or pending legal proceedings against the Company, nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any material proceeding or pending litigation.\nThere are no proceedings in which any of our directors, officers, or affiliates, or any registered or beneficial shareholder, is an adverse party or has a material interest\nadverse to our interest.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThere have been no changes to the risk factors set forth under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023.\nITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES, USE OF PROCEEDS, AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nThe Company issued and sold the following Common Shares in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act:\nDate Gross Proceeds Shares Issued Price/Share\nJuly 7, 2023(1) $760,685 166,521 $4.5681\nJuly 12, 2023(1) 760,068 165,577 4.5904\nJuly 26, 2023(1) 520,479 122,480 4.2495\nAugust 8, 2023(1) 519,589 127,241 4.0835\nAugust 17, 2023(1) 512,945 134,268 3.8203\nAugust 29, 2023(1) 517,808 157,489 3.2879\nSeptember 11, 2023(1) 766,918 230,714 3.3241\nSeptember 12, 2023(2) 258,984 70,000 3.6998\nSeptember 18, 2023(2) 272,933 75,000 3.6391\nSeptember 22, 2023(1) 761,986 211,998 3.5943\n(1) Issued in reliance on Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act, in connection with the voluntary conversion of a portion of the amount outstanding under the\nConvertible Debentures and based upon representations and warranties of Yorkville in connection therewith.\n(2) Issued in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act in connection with the closing of an advance under the Yorkville Equity Facility Financing Agreement\nand based upon representations and warranties of Yorkville in connection therewith.\nITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES\nNone.\nITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nPursuant to Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, issuers that are operators, or that have a subsidiary that is an operator, of a coal or other mine in the United States are\nrequired to disclose specified information about mine health and safety in their periodic reports. These reporting requirements are based on the safety and health\nrequirements applicable to mines under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the “Mine Act”) which is administered by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Mine\nSafety and Health Administration (“MSHA”). During the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, the Company and its subsidiaries and their properties or\noperations were not subject to regulation by MSHA under the Mine Act and thus no disclosure is required under Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act.\n26\nITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2023, no director or officer (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act) of the Company adopted or\nterminated a “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” or “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” (as each term is defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K).\nITEM 6.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\nNioCorp Developments Ltd. (“we,” “us,” “our,” “NioCorp” or the “Company”) was incorporated on February 27, 1987, under the laws of the Province of British\nColumbia and currently operates in one reportable operating segment consisting of exploration and development of mineral deposits in North America, specifically,\nthe Elk Creek development-stage property (the “Elk Creek Project”) located in southeastern Nebraska.\nThese interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis that contemplates the realization of assets and discharge of\nliabilities at their carrying values in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. These financial statements do not reflect any adjustments that may be\nnecessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.\nThe Company currently earns no operating revenues and will require additional capital in order to advance the Elk Creek Project to construction and commercial\noperation. As further discussed in Note 3, these matters raised substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, and the Company is\ndependent upon the generation of profits from mineral properties, obtaining additional financing and maintaining continued support from its shareholders and\ncreditors.\n2. BASIS OF PREPARATION\na) Basis of Preparation and Consolidation\nThe accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples of the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The interim\ncondensed consolidated financial statements include the consolidated accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries with all significant\nintercompany transactions eliminated. The accounting policies followed in preparing these interim condensed consolidated financial statements are those used by\nthe Company as set out in the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2023. Certain transactions include reference to Canadian\ndollars (“C$”) where applicable.\nIn the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary (including normal recurring adjustments) for a fair statement of the financial position,\nresults of operations, and cash flows at September 30, 2023, and for all periods presented, have been included in these interim condensed consolidated financial\nstatements. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP\nhave been condensed or omitted pursuant to appropriate SEC rules and regulations. These interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in\nconjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2023. The interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for\nthe full year ending June 30, 2024, or future operating periods.\nb) Recent Accounting Standards\nIssued and Not Effective\nFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) that are adopted by the Company as of\nthe specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, management believes that the impact of recently issued standards did not or will not have a material\nimpact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements upon adoption.\nc) Use of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of\nexpenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the carrying value of long-term assets, deferred\nincome tax assets and related valuations, liabilities related to the Earnout Shares, Private Warrants, and Contingent Consent Warrants (each, as defined below),\nand share-\n6\nNioCorp Developments Ltd.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\nSeptember 30, 2023\n(expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except per share amounts or as otherwise stated) (unaudited)\nbased compensation. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience, and various other factors that it believes to be\nreasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the other sources. The actual results experienced by the\nCompany may differ materially and adversely from the Company’s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between estimates and the actual\nresults, future results of operations will be affected.\nd) Basic and Diluted Earnings per Share\nThe Company utilizes the weighted average method to determine the impact of changes in a participating security on the calculation of loss per share. The\nfollowing table sets forth the computation of the Company’s basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common shareholders:\nFor the Three Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2023 2022\nNet loss $ 3,387 $ 3,877\nAdjust: Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest (174) -\nNet loss available to participating securities 3,213 3,877\nNet loss attributable to vested shares of ECRC Class B common stock (257) -\nNet loss attributed to common shareholders - basic and diluted $ 2,956 $ 3,877\nDenominator:\nWeighted average shares outstanding – basic and diluted 31,967,091 27,792,631\nLoss per Common Share outstanding – basic and diluted $ 0.09 $ 0.14\nThe following common shares, no par value, of the Company (“Common Shares”) underlying options to purchase Common Shares (“Options”), Common Share\npurchase warrants (“Warrants”), and outstanding convertible debt were antidilutive due to a net loss in the periods presented and, therefore, were excluded from\nthe dilutive securities computation for the three-month periods indicated below.\nFor the Three Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2023 2022\nExcluded potentially dilutive securities (1)(2):\nOptions 1,319,000 1,446,400\nWarrants 19,066,304 1,851,622\nConvertible debt 2,448,730 103,000\nTotal potential dilutive securities 22,834,034 3,401,022\n(1) The number of shares is based on the maximum number of shares issuable on exercise or conversion of the related securities as of the period end. Such\namounts have not been adjusted for the treasury stock method or weighted average outstanding calculations as required if the securities were dilutive.\n(2) Earnout Shares are excluded as the vesting terms were not met as of the end of the reporting period.\n3. GOING CONCERN ISSUES\nThe Company incurred a loss of $3,387 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 (2022 - $3,877) and had a working capital deficit of $10,491 and an\naccumulated deficit of $153,690 as of September 30, 2023. As a development stage issuer, the Company has not yet commenced its mining operations and\naccordingly does not generate any revenue. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had cash of $1,098, which will not be sufficient to fund normal operations for\nthe next twelve months without deferring payment on certain liabilities or raising additional funds. In addition, the Company will be required to raise additional funds\nfor construction and\n7\nNioCorp Developments Ltd.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\nSeptember 30, 2023\n(expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except per share amounts or as otherwise stated) (unaudited)\ncommencement of operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe Company’s ability to continue operations and fund its expenditures, which have averaged approximately $2,450 per quarter over the preceding three-year period,\nis dependent on management’s ability to secure additional financing. NioCorp expects to have access to up to $62,030 in net proceeds from the Standby Equity\nPurchase Agreement, dated January 26, 2023 (the “Yorkville Equity Facility Financing Agreement”), between the Company and YA II PN, Ltd., an investment fund\nmanaged by Yorkville Advisors Global, LP (“Yorkville”), through April 1, 2026. In addition, the Company may pursue additional sources of financing, and while it\nhas been successful in doing so in the past, there can be no assurance it will be able to do so in the future. Other than the potential issuance of Common Shares under\nthe Yorkville Equity Facility Financing Agreement, the Company did not have any further funding commitments or arrangements for additional financing as of\nSeptember 30, 2023. These interim condensed consolidated financial statements do not give effect to any adjustments required to realize the Company’s assets and\ndischarge its liabilities in other than the normal course of business and at amounts different from those reflected in the accompanying financial statements.\nRecent worldwide events have created general global economic uncertainty as well as uncertainty in capital markets, supply chain disruptions, increased interest rates\nand inflation, and the potential for geographic recessions. We believe this could have an adverse impact on our ability to obtain financing, development plans, results\nof operations, financial position, and cash flows during the current fiscal year. The full extent to which these events and our precautionary measures may continue to\nimpact our business will depend on future developments, which continue to be highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time.\n4.

CONVERTIBLE DEBT\nThe unsecured convertible debentures (the “Convertible Debentures”) issued to Yorkville pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, dated January 26, 2023 (as\namended, the “Yorkville Convertible Debt Financing Agreement”), between the Company and Yorkville, have a maturity date of September 17, 2024, and are a\nclassified as a current liability as of September 30, 2023.

For each $0.10 change in the fair value of one Common Share, the total\nshares the Company would be obligated to issue would change by approximately 69,400 shares.\n8\nNioCorp Developments Ltd.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\nSeptember 30, 2023\n(expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except per share amounts or as otherwise stated) (unaudited)\n6. CLASS B COMMON STOCK OF ECRC\nThe shares of Class B common stock of Elk Creek Resource Corporation (“ECRC”), an indirect, majority-owned subsidiary of NioCorp formerly known as GX\nAcquisition Corp. II (“GXII”), the rights of the holders of which to exchange such shares into Common Shares are subject to certain vesting conditions (such shares\nof ECRC Class B common stock, the “Earnout Shares”), were valued utilizing a Monte Carlo Simulation pricing model with the following primary inputs:\nSeptember 30,\nKey Valuation Input 2023\nClosing Common Share price $3.63\nTerm (expiry) March 17, 2033\nVolatility 47.0%\nRisk-free rate 4.59%\nThe following table sets forth a summary of the changes in the fair value of the Earnout Shares liability for the three months ended September 30, 2023:\nAmount\nFair value as of June 30, 2023 $ 10,521\nChange in fair value (2,093)\nFair value as of September 30, 2023 $ 8,428\n7. COMMON SHARES\na) Issuance\nOn September 1, 2023, the Company closed a non-brokered private placement (the “September 2023 Private Placement”) of units of the Company (the “September\n2023 Units”). A total of 250,000 September 2023 Units were issued at a price per September 2023 Unit of $4.00, for total gross proceeds to the Company of $1,000.\nEach September 2023 Unit consists of one Common Share and one Warrant (“September 2023 Warrant”). Each September 2023 Warrant entitles the holder to\nacquire one Common Share at a price of $4.60 at any time prior to September 1, 2025. Proceeds of the September 2023 Private Placement will be used for continued\nadvancement of the Company’s Elk Creek Critical Minerals Project and for working capital and general corporate purposes.\nThe September 2023 Warrants were classified as an equity instrument and accordingly, the net proceeds of $962 were allocated based on the relative fair values of\nthe Common Shares and the September 2023 Warrants on the date of issuance. The amount allocated to the fair value of the September 2023 Warrants was $254 and\nthe balance of the proceeds of $708 was allocated to the Common Shares. The fair value of the September 2023 Warrants issued was computed using the Black\nScholes option pricing model using the following assumptions: an expected life of 2.0 years, a risk-free interest rate of 4.85%, an expected volatility of 71.63%, and\nan expected dividend rate of 0%.\nThe Company issued the following Common Shares under the Yorkville Equity Facility Financing Agreement during the three months ended September 30, 2023:\nCommon Shares Gross Funds Market Value of Loss on\nDate Issued Received Shares Issued Transaction\nSeptember 12, 2023 70,000 $ 259 $ 271 $ 12\nSeptember 18, 2023 75,000 273 314 41\nLoss on transaction represents a non-cash expense equal to the difference between the proceeds received and the fair value of the Common Shares issued based on\nThe Nasdaq Stock Market LLC closing price per Common Share on the issuance date and is recorded in other operating expenses in the consolidated statement of\noperations and comprehensive loss.\nb) Stock Options\nNumber of Weighted Average\nOptions Exercise Price\nBalance, June 30, 2023 1,541,500 C$ 9.64\nCancelled/expired (222,500) 9.04\nBalance, September 30, 2023 1,319,000 C$ 9.74\n9\nNioCorp Developments Ltd.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\nSeptember 30, 2023\n(expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except per share amounts or as otherwise stated) (unaudited)\nThe following table summarizes information about Options outstanding at September 30, 2023:\nNumber Aggregate Number Aggregate\nExercise Price Expiry Date Outstanding Intrinsic Value Exercisable Intrinsic Value\nC$ 5.40 November 15, 2023 208,500 C$ - 208,500 C$ -\nC$ 7.50 December 14, 2023 170,000 - 170,000 -\nC$ 7.50 December 16, 2023 2,500 - 2,500 -\nC$ 13.60 December 17, 2024 350,000 - 350,000 -\nC$ 11.00 May 30, 2025 50,000 - 50,000 -\nC$ 9.52 March 27, 2026 538,000 - 538,000 -\n1,319,000 C$ - 1,319,000 C$ -\nc) Warrants\nPrivate Warrants\nIn connection with the closing of the previously publicly disclosed business combination transaction on March 17, 2023 (the “Closing”), the Company assumed\nGXII’s obligations under the agreement governing the GXII Warrants, as amended by an assignment, assumption and amendment agreement (the “NioCorp Assumed\nWarrant Agreement”), and issued an aggregate of 15,666,626 Warrants (the “NioCorp Assumed Warrants”). The Company issued (a) 9,999,959 public NioCorp\nAssumed Warrants (the “Public Warrants”) in respect of the GXII Warrants that were publicly traded prior to the Closing and (b) 5,666,667 NioCorp Assumed\nWarrants (the “Private Warrants”) to GX Sponsor II LLC (the “Sponsor”).\nEach Private Warrant entitles the holder to the right to purchase 1.11829212 Common Shares at an exercise price of $11.50 per 1.11829212 Common Shares (subject\nto adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like). No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of any Private\nWarrants, and fractional shares that would otherwise be due to the exercising holder will be rounded down to the nearest whole Common Share. In no event will the\nCompany be required to net cash settle any Private Warrant.\nThe Private Warrants: (i) will be exercisable either for cash or on a cashless basis at the holder’s option and (ii) will not be redeemable by the Company, in either case\nas long as the Private Warrants are held by the Sponsor, its members or any of their permitted transferees (as prescribed in the NioCorp Assumed Warrant\nAgreement). In accordance with the NioCorp Assumed Warrant Agreement, any Private Warrants that are held by someone other than the Sponsor, its members or\nany their permitted transferees are treated as Public Warrants.\nThe Company classifies Private Warrants as Level 2 instruments under the fair value hierarchy and estimated the fair value using a Black Scholes model with the\nfollowing assumptions:\nSeptember 30,\nKey Valuation Input 2023\nStock price on valuation date $ 3.63\nStrike price $ 11.50\nImplied volatility of Public Warrants 47%\nRisk free rate 4.65%\nDividend yield 0%\nExpected warrant life in years 4.47\nThe change in the Private Warrants liability is presented below:\nAmount\nFair value at June 30, 2023 $ 3,279\nChange in fair value (181)\nFair value at September 30, 2023 $ 3,098\n10\nNioCorp Developments Ltd.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\nSeptember 30, 2023\n(expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except per share amounts or as otherwise stated) (unaudited)\nContingent Consent Warrants\nAs consideration for entering into the previously publicly disclosed Waiver and Consent Agreement, dated September 25, 2022 (the “Lind Consent”), between the\nCompany and Lind Global Asset Management III, LLC (“Lind”), Lind received, amongst other things, the right to receive additional Warrants (the “Contingent\nConsent Warrants”) if on September 17, 2024, the closing trading price of the Common Shares on the TSX or such other stock exchange on which such shares may\nthen be listed, is less than C$10.00, subject to adjustments. The number of Contingent Consent Warrants to be issued, if any, is based on the Canadian dollar\nequivalent (based on the then current Canadian to US dollar exchange rate as reported by Bloomberg, LP) of $5,000 divided by the five-day volume weighted\naverage price of the Common Shares on the date of issuance. Further, the number of Contingent Consent Warrants issued will be proportionately adjusted based on\nthe percentage of Warrants currently held by Lind that are exercised, if any, prior to the issuance of any Contingent Consent Warrants.\nThe Contingent Consent Warrants are classified as a Level 3 financial instrument and were valued utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation pricing model, which calculates\nmultiple potential outcomes for future share prices based on historic volatility of the Common Shares to determine the probability of issuance at 18 months following\nthe applicable valuation date and to determine the value of the Contingent Consent Warrants. The following table discloses the primary inputs into the Monte Carlo\nmodel at the balance sheet date and the probability of issuance calculated by the model.\nSeptember 30,\nKey Valuation Input 2023\nShare price on valuation date $ 3.63\nVolatility 62.0%\nRisk free rate 4.60%\nProbability of issuance 92.7%\nThe change in the fair value of the Contingent Consent Warrants is presented below:\nAmount\nFair value at June 30, 2023 $ 1,710\nChange in fair value 254\nFair value at September 30, 2023 $ 1,964\nThe measurement date for the potential issuance of Contingent Consent Warrants is September 17, 2024, and therefore, as of September 30, 2023, the Contingent\nConsent Warrants are classified as a current liability.\n8.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nThe following tables present information about the assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2023, and June 30,\n2023, respectively, and indicate the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques the Company utilized to determine such fair value. In general, fair values\ndetermined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical instruments. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize data\npoints that are observable, such as quoted prices, interest rates, and yield curves. Fair values determined by Level 3 inputs are unobservable data points for the\nfinancial instrument and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the instrument.\nAs of September 30, 2023\nNote Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nAssets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 1,098 $ 1,098 $ - $ -\nInvestment in equity securities 8 8 - -\nTotal $ 1,106 $ 1,106 $ - $ -\nLiabilities:\nEarnout Shares liability 6 $ 8,428 $ - $ - $ 8,428\nWarrant liabilities 7c 5,062 - 3,098 1,964\nTotal $ 13,490 $ - $ 3,098 $ 10,392\n12\nNioCorp Developments Ltd.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\nSeptember 30, 2023\n(expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except per share amounts or as otherwise stated) (unaudited)\nAs of June 30, 2023\nTotal Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nAssets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 2,341 $ 2,341 $ - $ -\nInvestment in equity securities 9 9 - -\nTotal $ 2,350 $ 2,350 $ - $ -\nLiabilities:\nEarnout Shares liability $ 10,521 $ - $ - $ 10,521\nWarrant liabilities 4,989 - 3,279 1,710\nTotal $ 15,510 $ - $ 3,279 $ 12,231\nThe Convertible Debentures discussed in Note 5 were initially recorded at fair value, which represented a nonrecurring fair value measurement using a Level 3 input.\nAt September 30, 2023, the estimated fair value of this instrument approximated carrying value given that the instrument was issued in March 2023 and has a short\ntime period until maturity.\n13\nITEM 2.

This list is not exhaustive of the factors that may affect any of the Company’s forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements about the\nfuture and are inherently uncertain, and actual achievements of the Company or other future events or conditions may differ materially from those reflected in the\nforward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties, and other factors, including without limitation those discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” in our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, as well as other factors described elsewhere in this report and the Company’s other reports filed\nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).\nThe Company’s forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are based on the beliefs, expectations, and opinions of management as of\nthe date of this report. The Company does not assume any obligation to update forward-looking statements if circumstances or management’s beliefs, expectations, or\nopinions should\n15\nchange, except as required by law. For the reasons set forth above, investors should not attribute undue certainty to, or place undue reliance on, forward-looking\nstatements.\nQualified Person\nAll technical and scientific information that forms the basis for the Elk Creek Project disclosure included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q has been reviewed and\napproved by Scott Honan, M.Sc., SME-RM, NioCorp’s Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Honan is a “Qualified Person” as such term is defined in National Instrument 43-101\n– Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects and subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K.\nCompany Overview\nNioCorp is developing the Elk Creek Project, located in southeast Nebraska. The Elk Creek Project is a development-stage property that has disclosed niobium,\nscandium, and titanium mineral reserves and resources and disclosed rare earth oxide mineral resources. The Company is continuing technical and economic studies\naround the rare earths contained in the Project’s Mineral Resource. Niobium is used to produce various superalloys that are extensively used in high performance aircraft\nand jet turbines. It also is used in High-Strength, Low-Alloy steel, a stronger steel used in automobiles, bridges, structural systems, buildings, pipelines, and other\napplications that generally increases strength and/or reduces weight, which can result in environmental benefits, including reduced fuel consumption and material usage\nand fewer air emissions. Scandium can be combined with aluminum to make high-performance alloys with increased strength and improved corrosion resistance.\nScandium also is a critical component of advanced solid oxide fuel cells, an environmentally preferred technology for high-reliability, distributed electricity generation.\nTitanium is a component of various superalloys and other applications that are used for aerospace applications, weapons systems, protective armor, medical implants, and\nmany others. It also is used in pigments for paper, paint, and plastics. Rare earths are critical to electrification and decarbonization initiatives and can be used to\nmanufacture the strongest permanent magnets commercially available.\nOur primary business strategy is to advance our Elk Creek Project to commercial production. We are focused on obtaining additional funds to carry out our near-term\nplanned work programs associated with securing the project financing necessary to complete mine development and construction of the Elk Creek Project.\nRecent Corporate Events\nOn September 1, 2023, the Company closed a non-brokered private placement (the “September 2023 Private Placement”) of units of the Company (the “September 2023\nUnits”). A total of 250,000 September 2023 Units were issued at a price per September 2023 Unit of $4.00, for total gross proceeds to the Company of $1.0 million. Each\nSeptember 2023 Unit consists of one Common Share and one Common Share purchase warrant (a “Warrant” and, as a part of a September 2023 Unit, a “September 2023\nWarrant”). Each September 2023 Warrant entitles the holder to acquire one Common Share at a price of $4.60 at any time prior to September 1, 2025. Proceeds of the\nSeptember 2023 Private Placement will be used for continued advancement of the Company’s Elk Creek Critical Minerals Project and for working capital and general\ncorporate purposes.\nIn May 2023, we announced an aluminum-scandium (“Al-Sc”) master alloy initiative (the “Al-Sc master alloy initiative”), in partnership with Boston-based Nanoscale\nPowders LLC (“Nanoscale”). This Al-Sc master alloy initiative is expected to result in the production of several ingots of Al-Sc master alloy at potentially commercial\namounts of scandium content using a proprietary process developed by Nanoscale that is expected to increase efficiency and reduce environmental impacts of Al-Sc\nproduction over traditional approaches. Al-Sc master alloy, which generally contains 2% by weight scandium, is used to introduce scandium into aluminum for the\npurpose of producing various Al-Sc alloys, which generally contain a fraction of a percent scandium by weight. These alloys help to reduce weight, increase strength and\ncorrosion resistance, and make the material weldable in automotive and mass transit, aerospace, defense, space, and other systems. NioCorp’s goal is to demonstrate the\nability to make Al-Sc master alloy containing from 2% by weight scandium to as much as 10% by weight scandium.\nOn August 14, 2023, the Company announced the production of scandium metal at pilot-scale at a facility owned and operated by Creative Engineers in New Freedom,\nPennsylvania. The production of scandium metal represented the first phase in the Al-Sc master alloy initiative. Subsequently, on October 18, 2023, the Company\nannounced the successful pilot-scale production of a 1-kilogram ingot of Al-Sc alloy at the Creative Engineers facility.\n16\nElk Creek Project Update\nThe Company completed the installation and commissioning of a continuous groundwater level monitoring system during the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The\nsystem collects and records data in three geologic strata of interest: the upper glacial till, the Pennsylvanian limestone that underlies the glacial till, and the carbonatite\nthat underlies the limestone. The data collected from this effort will assist the Company’s contract hydrogeologists to refine and improve the hydrogeologic model for the\nElk Creek Project.\nThe Company completed a mine geotechnical review and a site visit by a qualified person, as defined in National Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for\nMineral Projects and subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K (a “Qualified Person”), during the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The Company’s contract geotechnical\nengineering firm inspected drill core and conducted a site inspection. As funding becomes available, the geotechnical firm will review and update their geomechanical\nmodel of the project to ensure that the mining operation will be conducted under safe and stable ground conditions.\nThe Company’s demonstration plant completed metallurgical operations during the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The impetus for the demonstration plant was to\naddress recommendations in the Company’s most recent technical report and to establish metallurgical performance criteria for the rare earths. The demonstration plant\nwas successful in this regard, and the measured improvements in metallurgical performance are summarized in the following table:\nThe remaining work at the demonstration plant entails producing sufficient quantities of waste materials for follow-on characterization to support tailings impoundment\nand paste backfill engineering designs. Additional work at the demonstration plant may be undertaken to support potential offtake agreements, where the counterparty to\nthe offtake requests product samples for evaluation.\nThe metallurgical data presented above has been provided to the Qualified Persons responsible for the Company’s previously disclosed mineral resource and mineral\nreserve estimates, and these firms have been tasked with updating the mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates. This data, along with updated capital and operating\ncosts for the prospective Elk Creek operation, will form the basis of an updated economic evaluation of the Elk Creek Project that will reflect the improved metallurgical\nperformance as well as the impact of potential rare earth production.\nOther Activities\nOur long-term financing efforts continued during the quarter ended September 30, 2023. As previously disclosed, on March 6, 2023, the Company announced the receipt\nof a Letter of Interest from the EXIM for potential debt financing of up to $800 million through EXIM’s “Make More In America” initiative to fund a portion of the\nproject costs of the Elk Creek Project. A project finance letter of interest from EXIM represents only a preliminary step in the formal\n17\nEXIM application process, and the Letter of Interest states that the communication “does not represent a financing commitment” and “is not an explicit indication of the\nfinancial or commercial viability of a transaction.” As stated in the Letter of Interest, “Upon receipt of NioCorp’s application for financing, EXIM will conduct all\nrequisite due diligence necessary to determine if a Final Commitment may be issued for this transaction.” The process from submission of an application to a final\ncommitment of financing by EXIM, if any, is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. As explained in the Letter of Interest, “Any final commitment will be\ndependent on meeting EXIM’s underwriting criteria, authorization process, and finalization and satisfaction of terms and conditions. All Final Commitments must be in\ncompliance with EXIM policies as well as program, legal, and eligibility requirements.” The debt financing is subject to the satisfactory completion of due diligence, the\nnegotiation and settlement of final terms, and the negotiation of definitive documentation.\nNioCorp submitted a formal application to EXIM for a loan under EXIM’s “Make More in America” initiative on June 6, 2023. The Company was informed that its\napplication received approval by the first of three reviews by the EXIM Transaction Review Committee on October 2, 2023. EXIM has indicated that they will now\ndevote additional resources to the processing of the Company’s application and will require the Company to execute indemnity fee agreements with external consultants\nwho will be tasked with conducting detailed reviews of the financial and technical (including environmental) aspects of the Company’s application. We are currently\nunable to estimate how long the application process may take, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully negotiate a final commitment of debt\nfinancing from EXIM.\nAs funds become available through the Company’s fundraising efforts, we expect to undertake the following activities:\n● Continuation of the Company’s efforts to secure federal, state and local operating permits;\n● Continued evaluation of the potential to produce rare earth products and sell such products under offtake agreements;\n● Negotiation and completion of offtake agreements for the remaining uncommitted production of niobium, scandium, and titanium from the project, including\nthe potential sale of titanium as titanium tetrachloride;\n● Negotiation and completion of engineering, procurement, and construction agreements;\n● Completion of the final detailed engineering for the underground portion of the Elk Creek Project;\n● Initiation and completion of the final detailed engineering for surface project facilities;\n● Construction of natural gas and electrical infrastructure under existing agreements to serve the Elk Creek Project site;\n● Completion of water supply agreements and related infrastructure to deliver fresh water to the project site;\n● Initiation of revised mine groundwater investigation and control activities;\n● Initiation of long-lead equipment procurement activities; and\n● As a follow-on to the Company’s demonstration plant operations, complete characterization and testing of waste materials to support tailings impoundment\nand paste backfill plant designs.\n18\nFinancial and Operating Results\nThe Company has no revenues from mining operations. Operating expenses incurred related primarily to costs incurred for the advancement of the Elk Creek Project and\nthe activities necessary to support corporate and shareholder duties, and are detailed in the following table.\nFor the Three Months\nEnded September 30,\n2023 2022\nOperating expenses (000s)\nEmployee-related costs $ 322 $ 293\nProfessional fees 1,187 164\nExploration expenditures 1,100 1,288\nOther operating expenses 834 337\nTotal operating expenses 3,443 2,082\nChange in fair value of Earnout Shares liability (2,093) -\nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities 73 (257)\nLoss on debt extinguishment - 1,622\nInterest expense 2,075 258\nForeign exchange (gain) loss (11) 173\nLoss (gain) on equity securities 1 (1)\nIncome tax benefit (101) -\nLoss attributable to noncontrolling interest 174 -\nNet loss attributable to the Company $ 3,213 $ 3,877\nThree-month period ended September 30, 2023 compared to the three-month period ended September 30, 2022\nSignificant items affecting operating expenses are noted below:\nEmployee-related costs increased in 2023 as compared to 2022, primarily due to the impact of board-authorized employee salary increases, which became effective\nApril 1, 2023.\nProfessional fees increased in 2023 as compared to 2022, primarily due to the timing of legal services associated with the Company’s SEC registration statements\nfiled in October 2023, as well as increased audit fees associated with the Company’s June 30, 2023 financial statements.\nExploration expenditures decreased in 2023 as compared to 2022, as 2022 costs included demonstration plant development and start-up costs, as well as costs related\nto the completion and filing of the Technical Report Summary based on the Company’s 2022 Feasibility Study for the Elk Creek Project, which was filed with the\nSEC on September 6, 2022.\nOther operating expenses include costs related to investor relations, general office expenditures, equity offering and proxy expenditures, board-related expenditures,\nand other miscellaneous costs. These costs increased in 2023 as compared to 2022 primarily due to the impact of increased director and officer insurance costs\nassociated with the Company’s listing on the Nasdaq, which began in March 2023.\nOther significant items impacting the change in the Company’s net loss are noted below:\nChange in fair value of Earnout Shares liability represents the change in fair value related to the shares of Class B common stock of Elk Creek Resource Corporation\n(“ECRC”), an indirect, majority-owned subsidiary of NioCorp formerly known as GX Acquisition Corp. II, the rights of the holders of which to exchange such shares\ninto Common Shares are subject to certain vesting conditions (such shares of ECRC Class B common stock, the “Earnout Shares”) for 2023, based on the results of\nMonte Carlo financial modeling. The Company recognized this liability in connection with the Transactions, which closed in March 2023.\nChange in fair value of warrant liability primarily represents the change in fair value related to Lind Global Asset Management III, LLC’s (“Lind”) right to receive\nadditional Warrants (the “Contingent Consent Warrants”) as consideration for entering into the previously disclosed Waiver and Consent Agreement, dated September\n25, 2022 (the “Lind Consent”), between the Company and Lind, based on the impact of a lower closing Common Share price, which increases the probability of\nthese Contingent Consent Warrants being issued on the 18-month\n19\nanniversary. This expense was partially offset by a slight decrease in the valuation of the Warrants issued to GX Sponsor II LLC (the “Sponsor”) in connection with\nthe closing of the Transactions (the “Private Warrants”).\nInterest expense increased in 2023 as compared to 2022 due to accretion expense associated with the unsecured convertible debentures (the “Convertible\nDebentures”) issued to Yorkville, which were issued in March 2023.\nForeign exchange loss is primarily due to changes in the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar. During 2022, the functional currency of the parent company was\nCanadian dollars, and the loss for the period was primarily due to changes in the foreign exchange rates applied to U.S. dollar-denominated debt instruments.\nEffective March 17, 2023, the parent company’s functional currency became the U.S. dollar.\nLoss attributable to noncontrolling interest represents the portion of net loss in ECRC not owned by the Company.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have no revenue generating operations from which we can internally generate funds. To date, our ongoing operations have been financed by the sale of our equity\nsecurities by way of private placements, convertible securities issuances, the exercise of incentive options to purchase Common Shares (“Options”) and Warrants, and\nrelated party loans. With respect to currently outstanding Options and Warrants, we believe that exercise of these instruments, and cash proceeds from such exercises, will\nnot occur unless and until the market price for our Common Shares equals or exceeds the related exercise price of each instrument.\nThe Yorkville Equity Facility Financing Agreement is expected to provide near-term and longer-term access to capital. The ability of the Company to draw down on the\nYorkville Equity Facility Financing Agreement, at its discretion, is subject to certain limitations and the satisfaction of certain conditions and, when available, provides an\nopportunity to actively manage the cash needs of the Company more closely. Historically, cash has generally been available to the Company through private placements\nof equity for which the timing did not always coincide with the Company’s cash needs. The Company may utilize the Yorkville Equity Facility Financing Agreement to\npotentially generate funds at a time when they are in need. Alternatively, the Company can also utilize the Yorkville Equity Facility Financing Agreement for\nopportunistic share sales.\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had cash of $1.1 million and a working capital deficit of $10.5 million, compared to cash of $2.3 million and working capital of\n$0.2 million on June 30, 2023.\nWe expect that the Company will operate at a loss for the foreseeable future. The Company’s current planned cash needs are approximately $9.25 million until June 30,\n2024. In addition to outstanding accounts payable and short-term liabilities, our average monthly planned expenditures through June 30, 2024 are expected to be\napproximately $745,000 per month where approximately $495,000 is for corporate overhead and estimated costs related to securing financing necessary for advancement\nof the Elk Creek Project. Approximately $250,000 per month is planned for expenditures relating to the advancement of the Elk Creek Project by ECRC. The Company’s\nability to continue operations and fund our current work plan is dependent on management’s ability to secure additional financing.\nThe Company anticipates that it does not have sufficient cash on hand to continue to fund basic operations for the next twelve months, and additional funds totaling $10.0\nmillion to $11.0 million are likely to be necessary to continue advancing the project in the areas of financing, permitting, and detailed engineering. While the Yorkville\nEquity Facility Financing Agreement may provide the Company with access to additional capital, the Company may require additional capital to meet its cash needs.\nManagement is actively pursuing such additional sources of debt and equity financing, and while it has been successful in doing so in the past, there can be no assurance\nit will be able to do so in the future.\nElk Creek property lease commitments are $18,000 until June 30, 2024. To maintain our currently held properties and fund our currently anticipated general and\nadministrative costs and planned exploration and development activities at the Elk Creek Project for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024, the Company will likely require\nadditional financing during the current fiscal year. Should such financing not be available in that timeframe, we will be required to reduce our activities and will not be\nable to carry out all our presently planned activities at the Elk Creek Project.\n20\nOn June 6, 2023, the Company announced that it had submitted an application to EXIM for debt financing (the “EXIM Financing”) to fund the project costs for the Elk\nCreek Project, under EXIM’s “Make More in America” initiative. The EXIM Financing is subject to, among other matters, the satisfactory completion of due diligence,\nthe negotiation and settlement of final terms, and the negotiation of definitive documentation. There can be no assurance that the EXIM Financing will be completed on\nthe terms described herein or at all.\nExcept for potential funding under the Yorkville Equity Facility Financing Agreement, discussed above, and the potential exercise of Options and Warrants, we currently\nhave no further funding commitments or arrangements for additional financing at this time, and there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such additional\nfinancing on acceptable terms, if at all. Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, dated as of March 17, 2023 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, the\n“Exchange Agreement”), by and among NioCorp, ECRC and the Sponsor, NioCorp is restricted from issuing equity or equity-linked securities (other than Common\nShares) or any preferred equity or non-voting equity if such issuance would adversely impact the rights of the holders of the shares of Class B common stock of ECRC,\nwithout the consent of the holders of a majority of the shares of Class B common stock of ECRC. The Yorkville Convertible Debt Financing Agreement also contains\ncertain covenants that, among other things, limit NioCorp’s ability to use the proceeds from the issuance of the securities pursuant to the Yorkville Convertible Debt\nFinancing Agreement to repay related party debt or to enter into any variable rate transaction, including issuances of equity or debt securities that are convertible into\nCommon Shares at variable rates and any equity line of credit, ATM agreement or other continuous offering of Common Shares, other than with Yorkville, subject to\ncertain exceptions. Notwithstanding the restrictions set forth in the Exchange Agreement and the Yorkville Convertible Debt Financing Agreement, there is significant\nuncertainty that we would be able to secure any additional financing in the current equity or debt markets. The quantity of funds to be raised and the terms of any\nproposed equity or debt financing that may be undertaken will be negotiated by management as opportunities to raise funds arise. Management may pursue funding\nsources of both debt and equity financing, including but not limited to the issuance of equity securities in the form of Common Shares, Warrants, subscription receipts, or\nany combination thereof in units of the Company pursuant to private placements to accredited investors or pursuant to public offerings in the form of\nunderwritten/brokered offerings, registered direct offerings, or other forms of equity financing and public or private issuances of debt securities including secured and\nunsecured convertible debt instruments or secured debt project financing. Management does not currently know the terms pursuant to which such financings may be\ncompleted in the future, but any such financings will be negotiated at arm’s-length. Future financings involving the issuance of equity securities or derivatives thereof will\nlikely be completed at a discount to the then-current market price of the Company’s securities and will likely be dilutive to current shareholders. In addition, we could\nraise funds through the sale of interests in our mineral properties, although current market conditions and other recent worldwide events have substantially reduced the\nnumber of potential buyers/acquirers of any such interests. However, we cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to be successful in raising such funds.\nBased on the conditions described within, management has concluded, as supported by the notes that accompany our financial statements for the year ended June 30,\n2023, that substantial doubt exists as to our ability to continue in business. The financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been prepared\nunder the assumption that we will continue as a going concern. We are a development stage issuer and we have incurred losses since our inception. We may not have\nsufficient cash to fund normal operations and meet debt obligations for the next twelve months without deferring payment on certain current liabilities and raising\nadditional funds. Recent worldwide events have created general global economic uncertainty as well as uncertainty in capital markets, supply chain disruptions, increased\ninterest rates and inflation, and the potential for geographic recessions. During fiscal year 2023 and continuing into fiscal year 2024, these events continued to create\nuncertainty with respect to overall project funding and timelines. We believe that the going concern uncertainty cannot be alleviated with confidence until the Company\nhas entered into a business climate where funding of its planned ongoing operating activities is secured. Therefore, these factors raise substantial doubt as to our ability to\ncontinue as a going concern.\nWe have no exposure to any asset-backed commercial paper. Other than cash held by our subsidiaries for their immediate operating needs in Colorado and Nebraska, all\nof our cash reserves are on deposit with major U.S. and Canadian chartered banks. We do not believe that the credit, liquidity, or market risks with respect thereto have\nincreased as a result of the current market conditions. However, in order to achieve greater security for the preservation of our capital, we have, of necessity, been required\nto accept lower rates of interest, which has also lowered our potential interest income.\n21\nOperating Activities\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company’s operating activities consumed $2.7 million of cash (2022: $1.7 million). The cash used in operating\nactivities for the three months ended September 30, 2023, reflects the Company’s funding of losses of $3.4 million and Convertible Debenture accretion, partially offset\nby a reduction in the Earnout Shares liability and other non-cash transactions. Overall, operational outflows during the three months ended September 30, 2023, increased\nfrom the corresponding period of 2022 due to increased professional services performed in 2023. Going forward, the Company’s working capital requirements are\nexpected to increase substantially in connection with the development of the Elk Creek Project.\nFinancing Activities\nFinancing inflows were $1.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 (2022: $0.02 million outflow), with 2023 inflows reflecting the receipt of $1.0\nmillion from the September 2023 Private Placement and $0.5 million from Common Share issuances under the Yorkville Equity Facility Financing Agreement.\nCash Flow Considerations\nThe Company has historically relied upon debt and equity financings to finance its activities. Subject to the restrictions set forth in the Exchange Agreement and the\nYorkville Convertible Debt Financing Agreement, the Company may pursue additional debt and/or equity financing in the medium term; however, there can be no\nassurance the Company will be able to obtain any required financing in the future on acceptable terms.\nThe Company has limited financial resources compared to its proposed expenditures, no source of operating income, and no assurance that additional funding will be\navailable to it for current or future projects, although the Company has been successful in the past in financing its activities through the sale of equity securities.\nThe ability of the Company to arrange additional financing in the future will depend, in part, on the prevailing capital market conditions, and its success in developing the\nElk Creek Project. Any quoted market for the Common Shares may be subject to market trends generally, notwithstanding any potential success of the Company in\ncreating revenue, cash flows, or earnings, and any depression of the trading price of the Common Shares could impact its ability to obtain equity financing on acceptable\nterms.\nHistorically, the Company has used net proceeds from issuances of Common Shares to provide sufficient funds to meet its near-term exploration and development plans\nand other contractual obligations when due. However, development and construction of the Elk Creek Project will require substantial additional capital resources. This\nincludes near-term funding and, ultimately, funding for Elk Creek Project construction and other costs. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” above for the Company’s\ndiscussion of arrangements related to possible future financings.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThere have been no material changes in our critical accounting estimates discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations” under the heading “Critical Accounting Estimates and Recent Accounting Pronouncements” as of June 30, 2023, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nfiscal year ended June 30, 2023.\nCertain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations\nIf NioCorp (or a subsidiary) is a “passive foreign investment company” (“PFIC”) for any taxable year (or portion thereof) that is included in the holding period of a U.S.\nholder of Common Shares or other NioCorp securities (as determined under applicable U.S. federal income tax law), then certain significant adverse tax consequences\ncould apply to such U.S. holder, including requirements to treat any gain realized upon a disposition of Common Shares (or other securities) as ordinary income, to\ninclude certain “excess distributions” on Common Shares in income, and to pay an interest charge on a portion of any such gain or distribution. NioCorp believes that it\nwas classified as a PFIC during the taxable years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, and, based on the current composition of its income and assets, as well as current\nbusiness plans and financial expectations, that it may be classified as a PFIC for its current taxable year or in future taxable years. No opinion of legal counsel or ruling\nfrom the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”)\n22\nconcerning the PFIC status of NioCorp or any subsidiary has been obtained or is currently planned to be requested. The determination of whether any corporation was, or\nwill be, a PFIC for a taxable year depends, in part, on the application of complex U.S. federal income tax rules, which are subject to differing interpretations. In addition,\nwhether any corporation will be a PFIC for any taxable year depends on the assets and income of such corporation over the course of each such taxable year and, as a\nresult, cannot be predicted with certainty as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition, even if NioCorp concluded that it or any subsidiary was not\nclassified as a PFIC, the IRS could challenge such determination and a court could sustain the challenge. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that NioCorp or any\nsubsidiary will not be classified as a PFIC for any taxable year. Each holder of Common Shares or other NioCorp securities should consult its own tax advisors regarding\nthe PFIC status of NioCorp and each subsidiary thereof and the resulting tax consequences to the holder, as well as any potential to mitigate such tax consequences\nthrough a “QEF” or “mark-to-market” election. See the “Risk Factors” section of NioCorp’s Annual Quarterly Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30,\n2023.\nOther\nThe Company has one class of shares, being Common Shares. A summary of outstanding shares, Options, Warrants, and convertible debt as of November 13, 2023, is set\nout below, on a fully-diluted basis.\nCommon Shares\nOutstanding\n(Fully Diluted)\nCommon Shares 33,142,280\nVested shares of ECRC Class B common stock1 4,565,808\nStock options2 1,319,000\nWarrants3 18,917,199\nConvertible debt4 2,147,800\n1 Each exchangeable into one Common Share at any time, and from time to time, until March 17, 2033.\n2 Each exercisable into one Common Share.\n3 Includes 15,666,626 NioCorp Assumed Warrants that are each exercisable into 1.11829212 Common Shares, and 3,250,573 Warrants that are each\nexercisable into one Common Share.\n4 Represents Common Shares issuable on conversion of Convertible Debentures with an aggregate outstanding principal and accrued interest\namount of $7.6 million as of November 13, 2023, assuming a market price per Common Share of $3.91 on that date.\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nInterest rate risk\nThe Company’s exposure to changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Company’s earned interest income on cash deposits and short-term investments. The\nCompany maintains a balance between the liquidity of cash assets and the interest rate return thereon. The carrying amount of financial assets, net of any provisions for\nlosses, represents the Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk.\nForeign currency exchange risk\nThe Company incurs expenditures in both U.S. dollars and Canadian dollars. Canadian dollar expenditures are primarily related to certain Common Share-related costs\nand corporate professional services. As a result, currency exchange fluctuations may impact the costs of our operating activities. To reduce this risk, we maintain\nsufficient cash balances in Canadian dollars to fund expected near-term expenditures.\nCommodity price risk\nThe Company is exposed to commodity price risk related to the elements associated with the Elk Creek Project. A significant decrease in the global demand for these\nelements may have a material adverse effect on our business. The Elk Creek Project is not in production, and the Company does not currently hold any commodity\nderivative positions.\n23\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nAt the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision of\nand with the participation of our management, including the CEO and the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), of the effectiveness of the design and operations of our\ndisclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, the CEO and the CFO have\nconcluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weaknesses in\ninternal control over financial reporting described below.\nThe Company’s disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to ensure that: (i) information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit to the\nSEC under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in applicable rules and forms and (ii) material\ninformation required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and the CFO, as\nappropriate, to allow for accurate and timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all error and all fraud. The effectiveness of our or any system of disclosure controls\nand procedures, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the objectives of the system will be met and is subject to certain\nlimitations, including the exercise of judgment in designing, implementing, and evaluating controls and procedures and the assumptions used in identifying the likelihood\nof future events.\nMaterial Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financing Reporting Existing as of September 30, 2023\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material\nmisstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nManagement concluded that the material weaknesses disclosed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 continued to exist\nas of September 30, 2023. Specifically, management concluded that the following material weaknesses exist as of September 30, 2023:\n● Control Environment: Management did not design and maintain an effective control environment based on the criteria established by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations Integrated Framework (2013) (“COSO Framework”). Specifically, the Company does not have sufficient personnel with the\nappropriate levels of knowledge, experience, and training in accounting and internal control over financial reporting commensurate with the complexity of the\nCompany’s business. This material weakness contributed to additional material weaknesses related to the Company’s control activities as further described\nbelow.\n● Risk Assessment: Management did not design and maintain effective controls over the risk assessment process. Specifically, management does not have a formal\nprocess to identify, update, and assess risks due to changes in the Company’s business practices, including entering into increasingly complex transactions that\ncould significantly impact the design and operation of the Company’s control activities.\n● Control Activities: Management did not design and maintain effective controls, including management review controls, related to non-routine transactions.\nSpecifically, management did not maintain effective controls over monitoring and assessing the work of third-party specialists, including the evaluation of the\nappropriateness of accounting conclusions that has resulted in misstatements. In addition, the Company did not design and maintain effective controls related to\nthe evaluation of certain inputs and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of instruments and features associated with complex debt and equity transactions.\nFinally, management did not have policies and procedures for the reconsideration of existing agreements when infrequent transactions occur.\n24\n● Monitoring Activities: Management did not design and maintain effective monitoring controls to support timely evaluation of remediation of identified internal\ncontrol deficiencies.\nAs previously disclosed, these material weaknesses were initially identified at various points during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 in connection with the Company’s\nnormal quarterly close and review procedures, and certain of these material weaknesses resulted in errors that required the restatement of Company’s consolidated\nfinancial statements as of and for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, as well as the restatement of the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements\nas of and for the interim periods ended September 30, 2021, December 31, 2021, March 31, 2022, September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2022. Additionally, these\nmaterial weaknesses could result in a misstatement of the account balances or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim\nconsolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or timely detected.\nRemediation Plan for the Material Weaknesses\nTo address our material weaknesses existing as of September 30, 2023, we are currently devising a detailed plan to address each individual material weakness identified,\nas well as the overall monitoring process, including the following:\n● In order to remediate the material weaknesses relating to the Company’s control environment and risk assessment process, we plan to develop and implement\ncontrols to ensure work performed by Company personnel and other experts is reviewed by individuals with the appropriate level of U.S. GAAP knowledge and\nexperience. This may include separating the performance and review of certain close procedures among current accounting personnel and/or engaging third party\naccounting consultants with the requisite U.S. GAAP knowledge and experience to perform work under the control and oversight of Company personnel. In\naddition, we plan to enhance the design of our controls over the consideration of all related relevant accounting guidance for the initial recording and subsequent\nmeasurements of non-routine transactions.\n● In order to remediate the material weakness relating to the Company’s controls activities, we are in the process of designing and implementing controls over the\ncompleteness and accuracy of identifying and adequately assessing the assumptions utilized in the valuation analysis of complex financial instruments, as well as\nengaging third party consultants with the relevant background and expertise to perform the appropriate complex valuation analyses under the control and\noversight of Company personnel.\n● In order to remediate the material weakness relating to the Company’s controls over monitoring activities, we plan to design and implement controls to manage\nand monitor our progress towards the remediation of internal control deficiencies and material weaknesses, including oversight by, and periodic reporting to, the\nAudit Committee.\nTo assist us in devising and implementing our remediation plan, we have recently engaged a third-party consulting firm.\nThe process of designing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting is a continuous effort that requires management to anticipate and react to\nchanges in our business, economic and regulatory environments and to expend significant resources. As we continue to evaluate our internal control over financial\nreporting, we may take additional actions to remediate the material weaknesses or modify the remediation actions described above.\nWhile we continue to devote significant time and attention to these remediation efforts, the material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until management\ncompletes the design and implementation of the actions described above and the controls operate for a sufficient period of time, and management has concluded, through\ntesting, that these controls are effective.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOther than as discussed above, there have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2023,\nthat have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n25\nPART II — OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1.
