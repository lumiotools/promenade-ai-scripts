(Nasdaq/TSX: BITF) (“Bitfarms”), a global vertically integrated Bitcoin data center company, and Stronghold Digital Mining, Inc. (Nasdaq: SDIG) (“Stronghold”) have entered into a definitive merger agreement (the “Merger Agreement”) under which Bitfarms will acquire Stronghold in a stock-for-stock merger transaction (the “Transaction”). The Transaction is valued at approximately US$125 million equity value plus the assumption of debt valued at approximately US$50 million.\n\nStronghold is a vertically integrated crypto asset mining company focused on mining Bitcoin and environmental remediation and reclamation services. As of June 30, 2024, Stronghold has a hashrate of 4.0 EH/s and 165 MW of current nameplate generated power capacity, with the potential to bring its hashrate to approximately 10 EH/s in 2025 with fleet upgrades. In addition, Stronghold has 142 MW of current Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection (PJM) import capacity and provides a path to import as much as 790 MW of incremental potential power beyond 2025.\n\nStronghold owns over 750 acres of land with options on over 1,100 additional acres along with two merchant power plants: the Scrubgrass and Panther Creek Facilities in Pennsylvania. These two power plants are recognized by Pennsylvania as a Tier 2 Alternative Energy Source (the same category as large-scale hydro) for their proven and significant environmental benefits. Stronghold’s footprint also has access to the strategically valuable PJM grid, the largest wholesale electricity market in the U.S., and, subject to regulatory approvals, the ability to import 142 MW of power from this source. This strategic location within the PJM region creates significant opportunity for the combined company to both generate and utilize competitively priced and flexible grid power that can be used for Bitcoin mining, energy trading and HPC/AI. Together, in coordination with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, these facilities remove hundreds of thousands of tons of mining waste and convert it into power through a highly specialized process.\n\nThe Transaction could add up to 307 MW of power capacity and is expected to put Bitfarms on track to increase its energy portfolio to over 950 MW by year-end 2025. There are multiple studies underway to potentially increase the total import capacity with an additional 648 MW beyond 2025 as well as numerous opportunities to leverage Bitfarms’ proven expertise to successfully enhance energy efficiency and hashrate and merge HPC/AI with Bitcoin mining operations.\n\nBen Gagnon, Chief Executive Officer of Bitfarms, said, “After three years of ongoing discussions, I am proud to announce this transformative acquisition, which is a decisive step in securing a strong future for Bitfarms. With this transaction, we expect to expand and rebalance our energy portfolio to 950 MW with nearly 50% in the U.S. by the end of 2025 and have visibility on multi-year expansion capacity up to 1.6 GW with approximately 66% in the U.S., up from approximately 6% today. By vertically integrating with power generation, expanding our energy trading capabilities and securing two high potential sites for HPC/AI with significant multi-year expansion potential, we are executing our strategy to diversify beyond Bitcoin mining to create greater long-term shareholder value.”\n\n“Having mined over 25,000 Bitcoin with renewable energy to date, Bitfarms is also extending its environmental leadership with the acquisition of these reclamation facilities. Stronghold has reclaimed thousands of acres of toxic waste, reducing the environmental footprint of historical mining activities and eliminating acid mine drainage that has been contaminating U.S. waterways since the 1800’s. Additionally, Stronghold’s Carbon Capture Projects have the potential to capture over 60,000 tons of carbon dioxide annually, providing Bitfarms additional revenue and making it one of the largest potential carbon capture projects globally,” said Arnold Lee, Director of Sustainability at Bitfarms.\n\nGregory Beard, Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of Stronghold, said, “We have been in conversation with Bitfarms for a long time. Having received and reviewed numerous bids in our Strategic Alternatives Review process, we believe that we found the ideal partner. Bitfarms has the vision and financial fortitude to unlock the value of Stronghold’s assets, and, given the accretion and future growth of the combined business, we are pleased that our shareholders will have the opportunity to participate in the significant upside potential. We look forward to leveraging Bitfarms’ operational expertise and proprietary data analytics system to further optimize our sites and return once-blighted land to local communities. I am confident that this combination is a unique opportunity to maximize value for the shareholders of both companies.”\n\n**Transaction Details** The Transaction has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025, subject to the receipt of Stronghold shareholder approval, applicable regulatory approvals, certain third-party consents and other customary closing conditions. Upon closing, Mr. Beard will contribute to the combined company in an advisory capacity.\n\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, Stronghold shareholders will receive 2.52 shares of Bitfarms for each share of Stronghold they own, representing consideration per share of U.S. $6.02 and a 71% premium to the Stronghold 90-day volume-weighted average price on Nasdaq as of August 16, 2024. At close, Stronghold shareholders are expected to own just under 10% of the combined company, based on the current issued and outstanding shares of each company.\n\nThe Transaction delivers compelling transaction economics while achieving an estimated $10 million in annual run-rate cost synergies.\n\n**Investor Conference Call** Bitfarms and Stronghold will conduct a conference call with investors to discuss the Transaction today, August 21, 2024, at 8:30am ET.

(Nasdaq/TSX: BITF), a global vertically integrated Bitcoin data center company, reported its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. All financial references are in U.S. dollars.\n\nDuring the quarter, Bitfarms continued to execute its transformational fleet upgrade and executed upon its strategic rebalancing and expansion of its operations in the U.S.\n\nTo that end, Bitfarms announced its acquisition of Stronghold Digital Mining, Inc. (Nasdaq: SDIG) (\"Stronghold\"), which is expected to put Bitfarms on track to increase its energy portfolio to over 950 MW by year-end 2025 with potential for multi-year expansion capacity of up to 1.6 GW. This represents a significant shift of Bitfarms' portfolio towards the U.S., which will come to represent approximately 66% of the Company's total portfolio, an eleven-fold increase from 6% operating power in the U.S. today. Bitfarms has already begun maximizing the utility of the Stronghold sites with two consecutive hosting agreements totaling 20,000 miners, signed in September and October, supporting approximately 4 EH/s. Upon close of the Stronghold acquisition, these hosting agreements will revert to self-mining operations.\n\nThe Company continues to make progress on its fleet upgrade program, deploying 5,400 additional miners during the quarter and achieving its efficiency target of 21 w/TH three months ahead of schedule. This efficiency represents a 40% improvement year-to-date, reducing direct operating costs per terahash and improving gross margins.\n\nIn addition, Bitfarms will be upgrading the remaining 18,853 T21 miners to be delivered by Bitmain as part of Bitfarms’ fleet upgrade program announced last year. Under the agreement, Bitfarms will be installing more powerful and efficient S21 Pro miners, operating at 234 TH/s and 15 w/TH, which represents more than a 20% improvement from the T21 miners in both energy efficiency and hashrate.\n\nDuring the quarter, Bitfarms took significant steps to strengthen its leadership team with new hires and a new management structure, providing greater scalability and accountability in data center development and operations, and laying the foundation for the establishment of HPC/AI operations. Bitfarms also strengthened its corporate governance with the appointment of two new directors and the appointment of the former Lead Director to Independent Chairman. The Bitfarms Board of Directors now consists of five members, four of whom are independent. The Company will hold a Special Meeting on November 20th to vote on an expansion of the Board from five to six members, the nomination of Andrew J. Chang to the Board, and the ratification of the Company’s Shareholder Rights Plan.\n\nIn line with its strategy to diversify beyond Bitcoin mining and maximize the value of its power assets, Bitfarms has selected two U.S. sites for a one to two MW HPC/AI pilot site. While still early stages, the land and power are secured at both sites, with active conversations taking place with potential partners and suppliers to discuss potential accelerated deployment in 2025. The Company is currently in the process of finalizing terms, plans and budgets as the first step in executing a comprehensive long-term HPC/AI strategy.\n\nCFO Jeff Lucas concluded, “Despite third quarter headwinds of record low hashprices for the Bitcoin mining industry, a 62% year-over-year increase in network difficulty, and the first full quarter following the April Halving Event, our mining operations remained profitable and continued to drive free cash flow. While we achieved our year-end efficiency target of 21 w/TH in the third quarter, shipping delays and continued miner servicing of our Bitmain T21s impacted our ability to reach 21 EH/s in 2024. We are working closely with Bitmain on warranty servicing and miner upgrades and expect to reach 21 EH/s in the first half of 2025.”\n\n“As previously communicated, 2024 has been a transformative year for Bitfarms,” stated CEO Ben Gagnon. “Year-to-date, we’ve refreshed nearly our entire fleet of miners, significantly improving our mining economics, acquired one new site and entered agreements to acquire two additional new sites in the U.S., and completely revamped our operational and Board structure, strengthening our leadership and corporate governance. We are now uniquely positioned with a strategic pipeline of over 950 MW in 2025 with nearly half a gigawatt of power infrastructure unallocated with miners. This represents a massive, secured, and cost-effective near-term growth opportunity with the flexibility necessary to maximize shareholder value as we approach the anticipated 2025 Bitcoin bull cycle.”\n\n**Q3 2024 & Recent Operating Highlights**\n\n**Operations**\n\n  * Current hashrate of 11.9 EH/s, up from 10.4 EH/s in Q2 2024.\n  * Averaged 7.6 BTC per day in daily production for Q3 2024.\n\n\n\n**Data Center Portfolio Expansion & Fleet Upgrade **\n\n  * Deployed 5,400 additional miners across three data centers in Canada, U.S., and Paraguay, for a total of approximately 47,900 miners deployed year-to-date in 2024.\n  * Entered into a definitive merger agreement, pursuant to which the Company will acquire Stronghold, a vertically integrated crypto asset mining company with operations located in Pennsylvania, in a stock-for-stock merger transaction.\n  * Closed the lease agreement in Sharon, Pennsylvania, providing the Company with an immediate capacity of 12 MW of electricity with up to 98 MW of additional development capacity.

It also does not include the revaluation losses on the mark-to-market of its Bitcoin holdings in Adjusted EBITDA, which is a measure of the cash profitability of its operations and does not reflect the change in value of its assets and liabilities.\n\nThe Company uses Adjusted EBITDA to measure its operating activities' financial performance and cash generating capability.\n\n**2023 Restatement** During the preparation of the Company's financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company reassessed the application of IFRS Accounting Standards on the accounting for warrants issued in connection with private placement financings conducted in 2021 and, as such, restated (the “Restatement”) its consolidated statements of financial position as of December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022, its consolidated statements of profit or loss and comprehensive profit or loss for the year ended December 31, 2022,and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and its consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 and the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which were previously filed on SEDAR+ and EDGAR.

As described in the interim MD&A for three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, available on SEDAR+ and EDGAR, the Company is undertaking remediation efforts in light of the Restatement and in order to improve the overall effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting for the accounting of complex financial instruments.\n\n**About Bitfarms Ltd.** Founded in 2017, Bitfarms is a global Bitcoin data center company that contributes its computational power to one or more mining pools from which it receives payment in Bitcoin.

Such factors, risks and uncertainties include, among others: receipt of the approval of the shareholders of Stronghold and the Toronto Stock Exchange for the Stronghold acquisition as well as other applicable regulatory approvals; that the Stronghold acquisition may not close within the timeframe anticipated or at all or may not close on the terms and conditions currently anticipated by the parties for a number of reasons including, without limitation, as a result of a failure to satisfy the conditions to closing of the Stronghold acquisition; the construction and operation of new facilities may not occur as currently planned, or at all; expansion of existing facilities may not materialize as currently anticipated, or at all; new miners may not perform up to expectations;

the inability to maintain reliable and economical sources of power to operate cryptocurrency mining assets; the risks of an increase in electricity costs, cost of natural gas, changes in currency exchange rates, energy curtailment or regulatory changes in the energy regimes in the jurisdictions in which Bitfarms and Stronghold operate and the potential adverse impact on profitability; future capital needs and the ability to complete current and future financings, including Bitfarms’ ability to utilize an at-the-market offering program ( “ATM Program”) and the prices at which securities may be sold in such ATM Program, as well as capital market conditions in general; share dilution resulting from an ATM Program and from other equity issuances; volatile securities markets impacting security pricing unrelated to operating performance; the risk that a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting could result in a misstatement of financial position that may lead to a material misstatement of the annual or interim consolidated financial statements if not prevented or detected on a timely basis; historical prices of digital currencies and the ability to mine digital currencies that will be consistent with historical prices; and the adoption or expansion of any regulation or law that will prevent Bitfarms from operating its business, or make it more costly to do so.

(Nasdaq/TSX: BITF), a global vertically integrated Bitcoin data center company, reported its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. All financial references are in U.S. dollars.\n\nDuring the quarter, Bitfarms continued to execute its transformational fleet upgrade and executed upon its strategic rebalancing and expansion of its operations in the U.S.\n\nTo that end, Bitfarms announced its acquisition of Stronghold Digital Mining, Inc. (Nasdaq: SDIG) (\"Stronghold\"), which is expected to put Bitfarms on track to increase its energy portfolio to over 950 MW by year-end 2025 with potential for multi-year expansion capacity of up to 1.6 GW. This represents a significant shift of Bitfarms' portfolio towards the U.S., which will come to represent approximately 66% of the Company's total portfolio, an eleven-fold increase from 6% operating power in the U.S. today. Bitfarms has already begun maximizing the utility of the Stronghold sites with two consecutive hosting agreements totaling 20,000 miners, signed in September and October, supporting approximately 4 EH/s. Upon close of the Stronghold acquisition, these hosting agreements will revert to self-mining operations.\n\nThe Company continues to make progress on its fleet upgrade program, deploying 5,400 additional miners during the quarter and achieving its efficiency target of 21 w/TH three months ahead of schedule. This efficiency represents a 40% improvement year-to-date, reducing direct operating costs per terahash and improving gross margins.\n\nIn addition, Bitfarms will be upgrading the remaining 18,853 T21 miners to be delivered by Bitmain as part of Bitfarms’ fleet upgrade program announced last year. Under the agreement, Bitfarms will be installing more powerful and efficient S21 Pro miners, operating at 234 TH/s and 15 w/TH, which represents more than a 20% improvement from the T21 miners in both energy efficiency and hashrate.\n\nDuring the quarter, Bitfarms took significant steps to strengthen its leadership team with new hires and a new management structure, providing greater scalability and accountability in data center development and operations, and laying the foundation for the establishment of HPC/AI operations. Bitfarms also strengthened its corporate governance with the appointment of two new directors and the appointment of the former Lead Director to Independent Chairman. The Bitfarms Board of Directors now consists of five members, four of whom are independent. The Company will hold a Special Meeting on November 20th to vote on an expansion of the Board from five to six members, the nomination of Andrew J. Chang to the Board, and the ratification of the Company’s Shareholder Rights Plan.\n\nIn line with its strategy to diversify beyond Bitcoin mining and maximize the value of its power assets, Bitfarms has selected two U.S. sites for a one to two MW HPC/AI pilot site. While still early stages, the land and power are secured at both sites, with active conversations taking place with potential partners and suppliers to discuss potential accelerated deployment in 2025. The Company is currently in the process of finalizing terms, plans and budgets as the first step in executing a comprehensive long-term HPC/AI strategy.\n\nCFO Jeff Lucas concluded, “Despite third quarter headwinds of record low hashprices for the Bitcoin mining industry, a 62% year-over-year increase in network difficulty, and the first full quarter following the April Halving Event, our mining operations remained profitable and continued to drive free cash flow. While we achieved our year-end efficiency target of 21 w/TH in the third quarter, shipping delays and continued miner servicing of our Bitmain T21s impacted our ability to reach 21 EH/s in 2024. We are working closely with Bitmain on warranty servicing and miner upgrades and expect to reach 21 EH/s in the first half of 2025.”\n\n“As previously communicated, 2024 has been a transformative year for Bitfarms,” stated CEO Ben Gagnon. “Year-to-date, we’ve refreshed nearly our entire fleet of miners, significantly improving our mining economics, acquired one new site and entered agreements to acquire two additional new sites in the U.S., and completely revamped our operational and Board structure, strengthening our leadership and corporate governance. We are now uniquely positioned with a strategic pipeline of over 950 MW in 2025 with nearly half a gigawatt of power infrastructure unallocated with miners. This represents a massive, secured, and cost-effective near-term growth opportunity with the flexibility necessary to maximize shareholder value as we approach the anticipated 2025 Bitcoin bull cycle.”\n\n**Q3 2024 & Recent Operating Highlights**\n\n**Operations**\n\n  * Current hashrate of 11.9 EH/s, up from 10.4 EH/s in Q2 2024.\n  * Averaged 7.6 BTC per day in daily production for Q3 2024.\n\n\n\n**Data Center Portfolio Expansion & Fleet Upgrade **\n\n  * Deployed 5,400 additional miners across three data centers in Canada, U.S., and Paraguay, for a total of approximately 47,900 miners deployed year-to-date in 2024.\n  * Entered into a definitive merger agreement, pursuant to which the Company will acquire Stronghold, a vertically integrated crypto asset mining company with operations located in Pennsylvania, in a stock-for-stock merger transaction.\n  * Closed the lease agreement in Sharon, Pennsylvania, providing the Company with an immediate capacity of 12 MW of electricity with up to 98 MW of additional development capacity. Bitfarms also signed a letter of intent for a lease to an additional 10 MW site, which would bring total site capacity to 120 MW.\n  * Entered into two miner hosting agreements with Stronghold as of October 31, 2024, which will accelerate the deployment of 20,000 miners supporting approximately 4.0 EH/s.\n  * On November 12, 2024, the Company amended its agreements with Bitmain to upgrade the remaining 18,853 Bitmain T21 miners to be delivered by Bitmain to superior performing S21 Pro miners. The upgrade will cost an incremental $33.2 million payable in cash or Bitcoin with the option for the Company to redeem the Bitcoin for cash in four quarterly payments based on the price of Bitcoin at the time the Bitcoin is originally tendered. \n\n\n\n**Personnel Appointments & Corporate Updates **\n\n  * Appointed Ben Gagnon as Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Director of the Board of Directors (“the Board”), Liam Wilson as Chief Operating Officer, Benoit Gobeil as Chief Infrastructure Officer, Alex Brammer as SVP of Mining Operations, and Rachel Silverstein as U.S. General Counsel.\n  * Appointed Amy Freedman as Independent Director of the Board and Lead Director Brian Howlett as Independent Chairman of the Board; accepted the resignations of Nicolas Bonta and Andrés Finkielsztain from the Board.\n  * Entered into a settlement agreement with Riot Platforms, Inc. on September 24, 2024\n  * Settled the employment dispute with the former CEO.\n  * Nominated Andrew Chang for election to the Board at the Special Meeting of Shareholders, taking place on November 20, 2024. \n\n\n\n**Q3 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * Total revenue of $45 million, up 8% Q/Q.\n  * Gross mining profit* and gross mining margin* of $17 million and 38%, respectively, down from $21 million and 51% in Q2 2024, respectively.\n  * General and administrative expenses of $28 million, up 123% Q/Q.\n  * Operating loss of $44 million, which included $10 million accelerated depreciation on older miners in connection with the transformative fleet upgrade, compared to an operating loss of $24 million in Q2 2024, which included $46 million accelerated depreciation on older miners.\n  * Net loss of $37 million, or $(0.08) per basic and diluted share which included a $6 million non-cash gain for revaluation of warrant liabilities in connection with 2023 financing activities. This compares to a net loss of $27 million, or $(0.07) per basic and diluted share in Q2 2024, which included a $1 million non-cash expense for revaluation of warrant liabilities in connection with 2021 and 2023 financing activities.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA* of $6 million, or 14% of revenue, down from $12 million, or 28% of revenue, in Q2 2024.\n  * The Company earned 703 BTC at an average direct cost of production per BTC* of $36,000, compared to $30,600 in Q2 2024.\n  * Total cash cost of production per BTC* was $52,400 in Q3 2024, up from $47,300 in Q2 2024 due to higher energy cost, increased network difficulty and lower transaction fees.\n\n\n\n**Liquidity**** As of September 30, 2024, the Company had total liquidity** of $146 million, comprised of $73 million in cash and 1,147 BTC valued at $73 million based on a BTC price of $63,300 at September 30, 2024.

It also does not include the revaluation losses on the mark-to-market of its Bitcoin holdings in Adjusted EBITDA, which is a measure of the cash profitability of its operations and does not reflect the change in value of its assets and liabilities.\n\nThe Company uses Adjusted EBITDA to measure its operating activities' financial performance and cash generating capability.\n\n**2023 Restatement** During the preparation of the Company's financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company reassessed the application of IFRS Accounting Standards on the accounting for warrants issued in connection with private placement financings conducted in 2021 and, as such, restated (the “Restatement”) its consolidated statements of financial position as of December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022, its consolidated statements of profit or loss and comprehensive profit or loss for the year ended December 31, 2022,and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and its consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 and the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which were previously filed on SEDAR+ and EDGAR.

As described in the interim MD&A for three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, available on SEDAR+ and EDGAR, the Company is undertaking remediation efforts in light of the Restatement and in order to improve the overall effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting for the accounting of complex financial instruments.\n\n**About Bitfarms Ltd.** Founded in 2017, Bitfarms is a global Bitcoin data center company that contributes its computational power to one or more mining pools from which it receives payment in Bitcoin.

Such factors, risks and uncertainties include, among others: receipt of the approval of the shareholders of Stronghold and the Toronto Stock Exchange for the Stronghold acquisition as well as other applicable regulatory approvals; that the Stronghold acquisition may not close within the timeframe anticipated or at all or may not close on the terms and conditions currently anticipated by the parties for a number of reasons including, without limitation, as a result of a failure to satisfy the conditions to closing of the Stronghold acquisition; the construction and operation of new facilities may not occur as currently planned, or at all; expansion of existing facilities may not materialize as currently anticipated, or at all; new miners may not perform up to expectations; revenue may not increase as currently anticipated, or at all; the ongoing ability to successfully mine digital currency is not assured; failure of the equipment upgrades to be installed and operated as planned; the availability of additional power may not occur as currently planned, or at all; expansion may not materialize as currently anticipated, or at all; the power purchase agreements and economics thereof may not be as advantageous as expected; potential environmental cost and regulatory penalties due to the operation of the Stronghold plants which entail environmental risk and certain additional risk factors particular to the business of Stronghold including, land reclamation requirements may be burdensome and expensive, changes in tax credits related to coal refuse power generation could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and future development efforts, competition in power markets may have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and the market value of the assets, the business is subject to substantial energy regulation and may be adversely affected by legislative or regulatory changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future energy regulations or requirements, the operations are subject to a number of risks arising out of the threat of climate change, and environmental laws, energy transitions policies and initiatives and regulations relating to emissions and coal residue management, which could result in increased operating and capital costs and reduce the extent of business activities, operation of power generation facilities involves significant risks and hazards customary to the power industry that could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations, and there may not have adequate insurance to cover these risks and hazards, employees, contractors, customers and the general public may be exposed to a risk of injury due to the nature of the operations, limited experience with carbon capture programs and initiatives and dependence on third-parties, including consultants, contractors and suppliers to develop and advance carbon capture programs and initiatives, and failure to properly manage these relationships, or the failure of these consultants, contractors and suppliers to perform as expected, could have a material adverse effect on the business, prospects or operations;

an increase in network difficulty may have a significant negative impact on operations; the volatility of digital currency prices; the anticipated growth and sustainability of hydroelectricity for the purposes of cryptocurrency mining in the applicable jurisdictions; the inability to maintain reliable and economical sources of power to operate cryptocurrency mining assets; the risks of an increase in electricity costs, cost of natural gas, changes in currency exchange rates, energy curtailment or regulatory changes in the energy regimes in the jurisdictions in which Bitfarms and Stronghold operate and the potential adverse impact on profitability; future capital needs and the ability to complete current and future financings, including Bitfarms’ ability to utilize an at-the-market offering program ( “ATM Program”) and the prices at which securities may be sold in such ATM Program, as well as capital market conditions in general; share dilution resulting from an ATM Program and from other equity issuances; volatile securities markets impacting security pricing unrelated to operating performance; the risk that a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting could result in a misstatement of financial position that may lead to a material misstatement of the annual or interim consolidated financial statements if not prevented or detected on a timely basis; historical prices of digital currencies and the ability to mine digital currencies that will be consistent with historical prices; and the adoption or expansion of any regulation or law that will prevent Bitfarms from operating its business, or make it more costly to do so.

(Nasdaq/TSX: BITF), a global vertically integrated Bitcoin data center\ncompany, reported its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. All\nfinancial references are in U.S. dollars.\nDuring the quarter, Bitfarms continued to execute its transformational fleet upgrade and\nexecuted upon its strategic rebalancing and expansion of its operations in the U.S.\nTo that end, Bitfarms announced its acquisition of Stronghold Digital Mining, Inc. (Nasdaq:\nSDIG) (\"Stronghold\"), which is expected to put Bitfarms on track to increase its energy\nportfolio to over 950 MW by year-end 2025 with potential for multi-year expansion capacity\nof up to 1.6 GW. This represents a significant shift of Bitfarms' portfolio towards the U.S.,\nwhich will come to represent approximately 66% of the Company's total portfolio, an eleven-\nfold increase from 6% operating power in the U.S. today. Bitfarms has already begun\nmaximizing the utility of the Stronghold sites with two consecutive hosting agreements\ntotaling 20,000 miners, signed in September and October, supporting approximately 4 EH/s.\nUpon close of the Stronghold acquisition, these hosting agreements will revert to self-mining\noperations.\nThe Company continues to make progress on its fleet upgrade program, deploying 5,400\nadditional miners during the quarter and achieving its efficiency target of 21 w/TH three\nmonths ahead of schedule. This efficiency represents a 40% improvement year-to-date,\nreducing direct operating costs per terahash and improving gross margins.\nIn addition, Bitfarms will be upgrading the remaining 18,853 T21 miners to be delivered by\nBitmain as part of Bitfarms’ fleet upgrade program announced last year. Under the\nagreement, Bitfarms will be installing more powerful and efficient S21 Pro miners, operating\nat 234 TH/s and 15 w/TH, which represents more than a 20% improvement from the T21\nminers in both energy efficiency and hashrate.\nDuring the quarter, Bitfarms took significant steps to strengthen its leadership team with new\nhires and a new management structure, providing greater scalability and accountability in\ndata center development and operations, and laying the foundation for the establishment of\nHPC/AI operations. Bitfarms also strengthened its corporate governance with the\nappointment of two new directors and the appointment of the former Lead Director to\nIndependent Chairman. The Bitfarms Board of Directors now consists of five members, four\nof whom are independent. The Company will hold a Special Meeting on November 20th to\nvote on an expansion of the Board from five to six members, the nomination of Andrew J.\nChang to the Board, and the ratification of the Company’s Shareholder Rights Plan.\nIn line with its strategy to diversify beyond Bitcoin mining and maximize the value of its\npower assets, Bitfarms has selected two U.S. sites for a one to two MW HPC/AI pilot site.\nWhile still early stages, the land and power are secured at both sites, with active\nconversations taking place with potential partners and suppliers to discuss potential\naccelerated deployment in 2025. The Company is currently in the process of finalizing terms,\nplans and budgets as the first step in executing a comprehensive long-term HPC/AI strategy.\nCFO Jeff Lucas concluded, “Despite third quarter headwinds of record low hashprices for\nthe Bitcoin mining industry, a 62% year-over-year increase in network difficulty, and the first\nfull quarter following the April Halving Event, our mining operations remained profitable and\ncontinued to drive free cash flow. While we achieved our year-end efficiency target of 21\nw/TH in the third quarter, shipping delays and continued miner servicing of our Bitmain T21s\nimpacted our ability to reach 21 EH/s in 2024. We are working closely with Bitmain on\nwarranty servicing and miner upgrades and expect to reach 21 EH/s in the first half of 2025.”\n“As previously communicated, 2024 has been a transformative year for Bitfarms,” stated\nCEO Ben Gagnon. “Year-to-date, we’ve refreshed nearly our entire fleet of miners,\nsignificantly improving our mining economics, acquired one new site and entered\nagreements to acquire two additional new sites in the U.S., and completely revamped our\noperational and Board structure, strengthening our leadership and corporate governance.\nWe are now uniquely positioned with a strategic pipeline of over 950 MW in 2025 with nearly\nhalf a gigawatt of power infrastructure unallocated with miners. This represents a massive,\nsecured, and cost-effective near-term growth opportunity with the flexibility necessary to\nmaximize shareholder value as we approach the anticipated 2025 Bitcoin bull cycle.”\nQ3 2024 & Recent Operating Highlights\nOperations\nCurrent hashrate of 11.9 EH/s, up from 10.4 EH/s in Q2 2024.\nAveraged 7.6 BTC per day in daily production for Q3 2024.\nData Center Portfolio Expansion & Fleet Upgrade\nDeployed 5,400 additional miners across three data centers in Canada, U.S., and\nParaguay, for a total of approximately 47,900 miners deployed year-to-date in 2024.\nEntered into a definitive merger agreement, pursuant to which the Company will\nacquire Stronghold, a vertically integrated crypto asset mining company with\noperations located in Pennsylvania, in a stock-for-stock merger transaction.\nClosed the lease agreement in Sharon, Pennsylvania, providing the Company with an\nimmediate capacity of 12 MW of electricity with up to 98 MW of additional development\ncapacity. Bitfarms also signed a letter of intent for a lease to an additional 10 MW site,\nwhich would bring total site capacity to 120 MW.\nEntered into two miner hosting agreements with Stronghold as of October 31, 2024,\nwhich will accelerate the deployment of 20,000 miners supporting approximately 4.0\nEH/s.\nOn November 12, 2024, the Company amended its agreements with Bitmain to\nupgrade the remaining 18,853 Bitmain T21 miners to be delivered by Bitmain to\nsuperior performing S21 Pro miners. The upgrade will cost an incremental $33.2\nmillion payable in cash or Bitcoin with the option for the Company to redeem the\nBitcoin for cash in four quarterly payments based on the price of Bitcoin at the time the\nBitcoin is originally tendered.\nPersonnel Appointments & Corporate Updates\nAppointed Ben Gagnon as Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Director of the Board of\nDirectors (“the Board”), Liam Wilson as Chief Operating Officer, Benoit Gobeil as Chief\nInfrastructure Officer, Alex Brammer as SVP of Mining Operations, and Rachel\nSilverstein as U.S. General Counsel.\nAppointed Amy Freedman as Independent Director of the Board and Lead Director\nBrian Howlett as Independent Chairman of the Board; accepted the resignations of\nNicolas Bonta and Andrés Finkielsztain from the Board.\nEntered into a settlement agreement with Riot Platforms, Inc. on September 24, 2024\nSettled the employment dispute with the former CEO.\nNominated Andrew Chang for election to the Board at the Special Meeting of\nShareholders, taking place on November 20, 2024.\nQ3 2024 Financial Highlights\nTotal revenue of $45 million, up 8% Q/Q.\nGross mining profit* and gross mining margin* of $17 million and 38%, respectively,\ndown from $21 million and 51% in Q2 2024, respectively.\nGeneral and administrative expenses of $28 million, up 123% Q/Q.\nOperating loss of $44 million, which included $10 million accelerated depreciation on\nolder miners in connection with the transformative fleet upgrade, compared to an\noperating loss of $24 million in Q2 2024, which included $46 million accelerated\ndepreciation on older miners.\nNet loss of $37 million, or $(0.08) per basic and diluted share which included a $6\nmillion non-cash gain for revaluation of warrant liabilities in connection with 2023\nfinancing activities.

unaudited)\nNOTE 1: NATURE OF OPERATIONS\nBitfarms Ltd. was incorporated under the Canada Business Corporations Act on October 11, 2018 and\ncontinued under the Business Corporations Act (Ontario) on August 27, 2021. The consolidated financial\nstatements of the corporation comprise the accounts of Bitfarms Ltd. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries\n(together referred to as the “Company” or “Bitfarms”). The common shares of the Company are listed on the\nNasdaq Stock Market and the Toronto Stock Exchange (Nasdaq/TSX: BITF). Its registered office is located at\n110 Yonge Street, Suite 1601, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, M5C 1T4.\nThe activities of the Company are mainly comprised of selling its computational power used for hashing\ncalculations for the purpose of cryptocurrency mining in multiple jurisdictions as described in Note 24\n“Geographical Information”. The Company’s operations are currently located in Canada, the United States,\nArgentina and Paraguay. Volta, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, assists the Company in building\nand maintaining its data centers and provides electrician services to both commercial and residential\ncustomers in Quebec.\nBitfarms owns and operates data centers housing computers (referred to as “Miners”) designed for the\npurpose of validating transactions on the Bitcoin Blockchain (referred to as “Mining”). Bitfarms generally\noperates its Miners 24 hours per day to produce computational power used for hashing calculations\n(measured by hashrate) that Bitfarms sells to a Mining pool operator under a formula-driven rate commonly\nknown in the industry as Full Pay Per Share (“FPPS”). Under FPPS, Mining pool operators compensate Mining\ncompanies for their computational power used for hashing calculations, measured through hashrate, based on\nwhat the Mining pool operator would expect to generate in revenue for a given time period if there was no\nrandomness involved. The fee paid by a Mining pool operator to Bitfarms for its computational power used for\nhashing calculations may be in cryptocurrency, U.S. dollars, or another currency. However, the fees are\ngenerally paid to the Company on a daily basis in BTC (as defined below). Bitfarms accumulates the\ncryptocurrency fees it receives or exchanges them for U.S. dollars through reputable and established\ncryptocurrency trading platforms.\nTerms and definitions\nIn these financial statements, the terms below have the following definitions:\nTerm Definition\n1 Backbone Backbone Hosting Solutions Inc.\n2 Volta 9159-9290 Quebec Inc.\n3 Backbone Argentina Backbone Hosting Solutions SAU\n4 Backbone Paraguay Backbone Hosting Solutions Paraguay SA\n5 Backbone Mining Backbone Mining Solutions LLC\n6 BTC Bitcoin\n7 BVVE Blockchain Verification and Validation Equipment (primarily Miners)\n8 CAD Canadian Dollars\n9 USD U.S. Dollars\n10 ARS Argentine Pesos\n7 Page\nBITFARMS LTD.\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except data relating to number of PPE, shares, warrants, options and digital assets - unaudited)\nNOTE 2: LIQUIDITY\nBitfarms is primarily engaged in the Bitcoin Mining industry, a highly volatile industry subject to significant\ninherent risk. Declines in the market prices of cryptocurrencies, an increase in the difficulty of BTC mining,\ndelays in the delivery of Mining equipment, changes in the regulatory environment and adverse changes in\nother inherent risks can significantly and negatively impact the Company’s operations and cash flows and its\nability to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet its financial obligations. Adverse changes to the factors\nmentioned above have impacted the recoverability of the Company’s digital assets and property, plant and\nequipment (\"PPE\"), resulting in impairment losses being recorded.\nThe Company’s current operating budget and future estimated cash flows indicate that the Company will\ngenerate positive cash flow in excess of the Company's cash commitments within the twelve-month period\nfollowing the date these interim condensed consolidated financial statements were authorized for issuance\n(the \"twelve-month period\"). These analyses are based on BTC market factors including price, difficulty and\nnetwork hashrate for the twelve-month period.\nA BTC Halving event is scheduled to occur once every 210,000 blocks, or roughly every four years, until the\ntotal amount of BTC rewards issued reaches 21 million, which is expected to occur around 2140. The most\nrecent BTC Halving event occurred on April 19, 2024, at which time BTC block rewards decreased from 6.25\nBTC per block to 3.125 BTC per block. Once 21 million BTC are generated, the network will stop producing\nmore BTC, and the industry will then need to rely on transaction fees and/or other sources of revenue. While\nBTC prices have had a history of significant fluctuations around BTC Halving events, there is no guarantee that\nthe price change will be favorable or would compensate for the reduction in Mining rewards and the\ncompensation from Mining Pools. Similar to past BTC Halvings events, the BTC price did not have an\nimmediate favorable impact after the BTC Halving that occurred on April 19, 2024. It took approximately six\nmonths for the Company's revenue per terahash to return to the level experienced prior to the May 2020 BTC\nHalving event. Since the BTC halving on April 19, 2024, revenue per terahash has not yet returned to pre-\nhalving levels.\nAt current BTC prices, the Company’s existing cash resources and the proceeds from sales of its BTC treasury\nand BTC earned may not be sufficient to fund capital investments to fully support its growth objectives. If the\nproceeds from the sale of BTC are not sufficient, the Company would be required to raise additional funds\nfrom external sources to meet these requirements. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to\nraise such additional funds on acceptable terms, if at all.\nIf the Company raises additional funds by issuing securities, existing shareholders' ownership in the Company\nmay be diluted. If the Company is unable to obtain financing, including by issuing securities, or if funds from\noperations and proceeds from sales of the Company's BTC holdings are negatively impacted by the BTC price,\nthe Company may have difficulty meeting its payment obligations.\n8 Page\nBITFARMS LTD.\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except data relating to number of PPE, shares, warrants, options and digital assets - unaudited)\nNOTE 3: BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION\na. Basis of preparation and measurement\nThe interim condensed consolidated financial statements (“Financial Statements”) of the Company comprise\nthe accounts of Bitfarms Ltd. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. These Financial Statements have been\nprepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International\nAccounting Standards Board (\"IFRS Accounting Standards\") applicable to the preparation of interim financial\nstatements, including International Accounting Standard 34, Interim Financial Reporting. These Financial\nStatements were approved by the Board of Directors (the \"Board\") on November 12, 2024.\nThese Financial Statements do not include all the information required for full annual financial statements and\nshould be read in conjunction with the audited annual consolidated financial statements of the Company and\nthe notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThese Financial Statements have been prepared under the same accounting policies used in the audited\nannual consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, except for new accounting\nstandards issued and adopted by the Company which are described below. The accounting policies have been\napplied consistently by the Company’s entities and to all periods presented in these Financial Statements,\nunless otherwise indicated.\nThe Financial Statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain\nfinancial instruments and digital assets recorded at fair value, and assets held for sale measured at the lower\nof their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.\n9 Page\nBITFARMS LTD.\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except data relating to number of PPE, shares, warrants, options and digital assets - unaudited)\nNOTE 3: BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (Continued)\nb. New accounting amendments issued and adopted by the Company\nThe following amendments to existing standards were adopted by the Company as of January 1, 2024:\nAmendments to IFRS 16, Leases (“IFRS 16”)\nAmendments to IFRS 16 require a seller-lessee to subsequently measure lease liabilities arising from a\nleaseback in a manner that does not recognize any amount of the gain or loss that relates to the right-of-use\nretained. The new requirements do not prevent a seller-lessee from recognizing in profit or loss any gain or\nloss relating to the partial or full termination of a lease.\nAmendments to IAS 1, Presentation of the Financial Statements (“IAS 1”)\nAmendments to IAS 1 clarify how to classify debt and other liabilities as current or non-current. The\namendments help to determine whether, in the interim consolidated statements of financial position, debt\nand other liabilities with an uncertain settlement date should be classified as current (due or potentially due\nto be settled within one year) or non-current. The amendments also include clarifying the classification\nrequirements for debt that an entity might settle by converting into equity.\nAmendments to IAS 1 specify that covenants to be complied with after the reporting date do not affect the\nclassification of debt as current or non-current at the reporting date. Instead, the amendments require\ninformation about these covenants be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.\nAmendments to IAS 7, Statement of Cash Flows (“IAS 7”) and IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures\n(“IFRS 7”)\nAmendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 7 introduce disclosure requirements to enhance the transparency of supplier\nfinance arrangements and their effects on an entity’s liabilities, cash flows and exposure to liquidity risk.\nThe adoption by the Company of the amendments listed above did not have a significant impact on the\nCompany’s Financial Statements.\nc. New accounting amendments and standard issued to be adopted at a later date\nThe following amendments to existing standards have been issued and are applicable to the Company for its\nannual period beginning on January 1, 2025, with an earlier application permitted:\nAmendments to IAS 21, The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates (“IAS 21”)\nAmendments to IAS 21 require an entity to apply a consistent approach in assessing whether a currency can\nbe exchanged into another currency and, when it cannot, in determining the exchange rate to use and the\ndisclosures to provide.\nThe Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the amendments on the Company's Financial\nStatements.\n10 Page\nBITFARMS LTD.\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except data relating to number of PPE, shares, warrants, options and digital assets - unaudited)\nNOTE 3: BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (Continued)\nc. New accounting amendments and standard issued to be adopted at a later date (Continued)\nThe following amendments to existing standards have been issued and are applicable to the Company for its\nannual period beginning on January 1, 2026, with an earlier application permitted:\nAmendments to IFRS 9, Financial Instruments (“IFRS 9”) and IFRS 7\nAmendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7 clarify that financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized and\nderecognized at settlement date except for regular way purchases or sales of financial assets and financial\nliabilities meeting conditions for the new exception. The new exception permits companies to elect to\nderecognize certain financial liabilities settled via electronic payment systems earlier than the settlement\ndate.\nThese amendments also provide guidelines to assess contractual cash flow characteristics of financial assets,\nwhich apply to all contingent cash flows, including those arising from environmental, social, and governance\n(ESG)-linked features.\nIn addition, the amendments for investments in equity instruments reported at fair value through other\ncomprehensive income require separately disclosing the fair value gain or loss for investments derecognized\nin the period and investments held. The amendments added disclosure requirements for financial instruments\nwith contingent features that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows that do not relate\ndirectly to basic lending risks and costs.\nThe Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the amendments on the Company's Financial\nStatements.\nThe following new standard has been issued and is applicable to the Company for its annual period beginning\non January 1, 2027, with an earlier application permitted:\nIFRS 18, Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements (“IFRS 18”)\nOn April 9, 2024, the International Accounting Standards Board issued IFRS 18, the new standard on\npresentation and disclosure in financial statements, which will replace IAS 1, with a focus on updates to the\nstatement of profit or loss. The key new concepts introduced in IFRS 18 relate to:\n• The structure of the statement of profit or loss, including specified totals and subtotals;\n• Required disclosures in the financial statements for certain profit or loss performance measures that\nare reported outside an entity’s financial statements (i.e., management-defined performance\nmeasures); and\n• Enhanced principles on aggregation and disaggregation which apply to the primary financial\nstatements and notes in general.\nThe Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new standard on the Company's Financial\nStatements.\n11 Page\nBITFARMS LTD.\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except data relating to number of PPE, shares, warrants, options and digital assets - unaudited)\nNOTE 3: BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (Continued)\nd. Restatement\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company identified errors in its accounting for warrants issued\nin connection with certain private placement financings in 2021. The warrants and broker warrants are\nconvertible for a fixed number of common shares of the Company but have a contingent cashless exercise\nclause which results in a classification of the warrants and broker warrants as a financial liability and\nmeasurement of such warrants at fair value through profit or loss, not equity.\nThe effects of the restatement on the affected financial statement line items for the prior period are as\nfollows:\nInterim consolidated statements of profit or loss and comprehensive profit or loss extract for the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2023 - Restatement\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n2023 (as Warrant 2023 (as 2023 (as Warrant 2023 (as\nreported) adjustments restated) reported) adjustments restated)\nOperating loss (18,638) — (18,638) (59,392) — (59,392)\nNet financial income (expenses) 336 2,196 2,532 12,706 (214) 12,492\nNet loss before income taxes (18,302) 2,196 (16,106) (46,686) (214) (46,900)\nIncome tax recovery (expense) (401) — (401) 23 — 23\nNet loss (18,703) 2,196 (16,507) (46,663) (214) (46,877)\nOther comprehensive income (loss)\nItem that will not be reclassified to profit or loss:\nChange in revaluation surplus - digital assets,\nnet of tax (824) — (824) 1,567 — 1,567\nTotal comprehensive loss, net of tax (19,527) 2,196 (17,331) (45,096) (214) (45,310)\nLoss per share\nBasic and diluted (0.07) 0.01 (0.06) (0.19) — (0.19)\nInterim consolidated statements of cash flows extract for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 -\nRestatement\nNine months ended September 30,\n2023 (as reported) Warrant adjustments 2023 (as restated)\nCash flows from operating activities\nNet loss (46,663) (214) (46,877)\nAdjustments for:\nNet financial income (expenses) (12,706) 214 (12,492)\nNet change in cash related to operating activities 10,028 — 10,028\n12 Page\nBITFARMS LTD.\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except data relating to number of PPE, shares, warrants, options and digital assets - unaudited)\nNOTE 4: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of the Financial Statements requires Bitfarms' management team (\"Management\") to\nundertake judgments, estimates and assumptions about recognition and measurement of assets, liabilities,\nincome and expenses. These estimates and judgments are based on Management's best knowledge of the\nevents or circumstances and actions the Company may take in the future. The actual results may differ from\nthese assumptions and estimates.\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to assumptions and\nestimates are recognized in the period in which the assumption or estimate is revised if the revision affects\nonly that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and\nfuture periods.\nThe significant judgements made by Management in applying the Company’s accounting policies and the key\nsources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those described in the audited annual consolidated\nfinancial statements for year ended December 31, 2023, except for the following:\nProperty, plant and equipment\nEstimates of useful lives, residual values and methods of depreciation are reviewed annually. Any changes\nbased on additional available information are accounted for prospectively as a change in accounting estimate.\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, in connection with the replacement of older Miners following the Company's\ntransformative fleet upgrade as described in Note 10 - Property, Plant and Equipment, the Company reviewed\nand adjusted the useful lives, residual values and method of depreciation of older Miners that will be replaced\nby the new fleet in 2024.\nFor these Miners, the depreciation was accelerated to bring the book value to the estimated recoverable value\nat the time they are expected to be replaced. The residual values were adjusted to reflect the expected\nproceeds from the eventual sale and the depreciation method was modified from sum-of-years to straight-line\nmethod.\nNOTE 5: OTHER ASSETS\nAs of September 30, As of December 31,\n2024 2023\nSales taxes receivable* 10,847 805\nOther receivables 593 689\n11,440 1,494\n* Refer to Note 23d for more details about the provision applied to the Argentine value-added tax (VAT) receivable included in sales\ntaxes receivable.\n13 Page\nBITFARMS LTD.\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except data relating to number of PPE, shares, warrants, options and digital assets - unaudited)\nNOTE 6: DIGITAL ASSETS\nBTC transactions and the corresponding values for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023 were as follows:\nThree months ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nQuantity Value Quantity Value\nBalance of digital assets including digital assets pledged as\ncollateral as of July 1, 905 56,748 549 16,734\nBTC earned* 703 42,838 1,172 32,899\nBTC exchanged for cash and services (461) (27,938) (1,018) (28,354)\nRealized gain (loss) on disposition of digital assets** — 769 — (425)\nChange in unrealized gain (loss) on revaluation of digital assets** — 212 — (1,879)\nBalance of digital assets including digital assets pledged as\n1,147 72,629 703 18,975\ncollateral as of September 30,\nLess digital assets pledged as collateral as of September 30,*** — — (80) (2,166)\nBalance of digital assets excluding digital assets pledged as\ncollateral as of September 30, 1,147 72,629 623 16,809\nNine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nQuantity Value Quantity Value\nBalance of digital assets including digital assets pledged as\ncollateral as of January 1, 804 33,971 405 6,705\nBTC earned* 2,260 132,644 3,692 96,350\nBTC exchanged for cash and services (1,917) (111,264) (3,394) (87,724)\nRealized gain on disposition of digital assets** — 17,635 — 1,272\nChange in unrealized gain (loss) on revaluation of digital assets** — (357) — 2,372\nBalance of digital assets including digital assets pledged as\n1,147 72,629 703 18,975\ncollateral as of September 30,\nLess digital assets pledged as collateral as of September 30,*** — — (80) (2,166)\nBalance of digital assets excluding digital assets pledged as\ncollateral as of September 30, 1,147 72,629 623 16,809\n* Management estimates the fair value of BTC earned on a daily basis as the quantity of cryptocurrency received multiplied by the\nprice quoted on Coinbase on the day it was received.

Background\nIn 2022, the Company entered into agreements with external import brokers to be able to proceed with the\nimportation of its miners into Argentina. Under the agreements, the Company was required to make advance\ndeposits to the external import brokers, which were classified as short-term prepaid deposits on the\nconsolidated statements of financial position. During the second quarter of 2023, the Company decided to\nterminate the importation agreements with the external import brokers as of June 30, 2023.\nii. Impairment loss\nThe Company assumed the cost of terminating the importation agreements with the brokers in order to\nexecute its new importation strategy, resulting in the Company forgoing a deposits balance of $6,982.\nAccordingly, during the second quarter of 2023, the Company impaired $6,982 of short-term prepaid deposits.\nThis impairment is presented in the consolidated statements of profit or loss and comprehensive profit or loss\nunder Impairment on short-term prepaid deposits, equipment and construction prepayments, property, plant\nand equipment and right-of-use assets.\nImpairment on mineral assets during the second quarter of 2023\ni. Background\nThe Suni mineral asset was acquired in connection with the reverse acquisition of Bitfarms Ltd (Israel) on April\n12, 2018, and its value at the time was estimated at $9,000 based on an independent appraiser's valuation.\nSuni is an iron ore deposit located in Canada that was held by the acquiree. Since its acquisition, following the\npresence of impairment indicators, the Suni mineral asset was written down to a net book value of $3,000 as\nof December 31, 2022.\nii. Impairment loss\nDuring the second quarter of 2023, in connection with the planned disposal of the Suni mineral asset,\nManagement tested the cash-generating unit for impairment, resulting in a further impairment charge of\n$3,000 and reducing the carrying amount to nil. This impairment charge is presented in the consolidated\nstatements of profit or loss and comprehensive profit or loss under Impairment on short-term prepaid\ndeposits, equipment and construction prepayments, property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets.\nOn July 27, 2023, the Company sold the Suni mineral asset for a nominal amount to a third party.\n18 Page\nBITFARMS LTD.\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except data relating to number of PPE, shares, warrants, options and digital assets - unaudited)\nNOTE 10: PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, PPE consisted of the following:\nBVVE and\nelectrical Mineral Land and Leasehold\nNotes components assets buildings improvements Vehicles Total\nCost\nBalance as of January 1, 2024 354,803 — 5,740 50,728 1,262 412,533\nAdditions 182,461 — 20,845 4,112 337 207,755\nDispositions (174) — — (560) (25) (759)\nTransfer to assets held for sale 8 (194,931) — — — — (194,931)\nSales tax recovery 23 (14,763) — (428) (657) (18) (15,866)\nBalance as of September 30, 2024 327,396 — 26,157 53,623 1,556 408,732\nAccumulated Depreciation\nBalance as of January 1, 2024 199,794 — 424 25,656 647 226,521\nDepreciation 25 119,069 — 239 3,068 150 122,526\nSales tax recovery - depreciation 23, 25 (8,624) — (28) (104) (4) (8,760)\nDispositions (37) — — (423) (16) (476)\nTransfer to assets held for sale 8 (184,425) — — — — (184,425)\nImpairment on deposits transferred to PPE 6,750 — — 82 — 6,832\nBalance as of September 30, 2024 132,527 — 635 28,279 777 162,218\nNet book value as of September 30, 2024 194,869 — 25,522 25,344 779 246,514\nBVVE and\nelectrical Mineral Land and Leasehold\nNotes components assets buildings improvements Vehicles Total\nCost\nBalance as of January 1, 2023 308,205 9,000 4,392 45,278 1,082 367,957\nAdditions 63,598 — 1,348 5,924 272 71,142\nAdditions related to asset acquisitions 13 — — 30 — 43\nDispositions (7,325) (9,000) — (5) (92) (16,422)\nTransfer to assets held for sale 8 (9,688) — — — — (9,688)\nEffect of change in discount rate — — — (499) — (499)\nBalance as of December 31, 2023 354,803 — 5,740 50,728 1,262 412,533\nAccumulated Depreciation\nBalance as of January 1, 2023 120,097 6,000 270 21,636 526 148,529\nDepreciation 77,551 — 154 3,556 194 81,455\nDispositions (5,756) (9,000) — (5) (73) (14,834)\nTransfer to assets held for sale 8 (8,418) — — — — (8,418)\nImpairment 1,882 3,000 — — — 4,882\nImpairment on deposits transferred to PPE 14,438 — — 469 — 14,907\nBalance as of December 31, 2023 199,794 — 424 25,656 647 226,521\nNet book value as of December 31, 2023 155,009 — 5,316 25,072 615 186,012\n19 Page\nBITFARMS LTD.\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except data relating to number of PPE, shares, warrants, options and digital assets - unaudited)\nNOTE 10: PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (Continued)\nBVVE\nFurther details of the quantity and models of BTC BVVE held by the Company as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023 are as follows :\nMicroBT Bitmain Bitmain Bitmain\nNotes WhatsMiner* S19j Pro T21 S21 Total\nQuantity as of January 1, 2024 51,738 16,361 — — 68,099\nAdditions 1,943 — 44,532 3,975 50,450\nDispositions (6,491) (300) — — (6,791)\nQuantity as of September 30, 2024 47,190 16,061 44,532 3,975 111,758\nClassified as assets held for sale 8 (32,819) (8,395) — — (41,214)\nPresented as property, plant and equipment 14,371 7,666 44,532 3,975 70,544\n* Includes 30,257 M30 of which 20,554 are classified as assets held for sale, 12,517 M31 of which 11,733 are classified as assets held\nfor sale, 1,943 M50 of which 532 are classified as assets held for sale and 2,473 M53 Miners.\nRefer to Note 8 for more details on assets held for sale.\nMicroBT Bitmain Innosilicon Bitmain\nNotes WhatsMiner* S19j Pro T3 & T2T S19XP Total\nQuantity as of January 1, 2023 45,375 7,172 5,711 — 58,258\nAdditions 8,281 9,289 — 409 17,979\nDispositions (1,918) (100) (5,711) (409) (8,138)\nQuantity as of December 31, 2023 51,738 16,361 — — 68,099\nClassified as assets held for sale 8 (731) (300) — — (1,031)\nPresented as property, plant and equipment 51,007 16,061 — — 67,068\n* Includes 731 M20S classified as assets held for sale, 36,018 M30S, 12,517 M31S and 2,473 M50 Miners.\nRefer to Note 8 for more details on assets held for sale.\n20 Page\nBITFARMS LTD.\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except data relating to number of PPE, shares, warrants, options and digital assets - unaudited)\nNOTE 10: PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (Continued)\nChanges in the useful life, residual value and depreciation method of certain BVVE\ni. Background\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, the Company exercised its purchase option for 28,000 Bitmain T21 Miners\nand entered into purchase agreements to acquire 19,280 Bitmain T21 Miners, 3,888 Bitmain S21 Miners and\n740 Bitmain S21 hydro Miners. Refer to Note 12 for more details. The Company intends to liquidate its older\nMiners that are expected to be replaced with the Bitmain T21 Miners, Bitmain S21 Miners, Bitmain S21 hydro\nMiners and other hydro Miners. Refer to Note 8 for more details about the Miners held for sale.\nii. Accelerated depreciation\nThe older Miners will remain in service until the new Miners are installed to replace them. The Company has\nchanged the usage and the retention strategy of the older Miners and, accordingly, revised their specific\nuseful life, residual value and depreciation method.\nThe changes are summarized as follows:\n• decreasing the specific useful life of the older Miners from five years to two years to reflect their\neventual disposal in 2024;\n• decreasing the residual values to reflect the expected proceeds from the eventual disposals; and\n• accelerating the depreciation method from sum-of-years over five years to straight-line method over\ntwo years to represent the change in pattern in which their future economic benefits are expected to\nbe consumed by the Company.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded accelerated\ndepreciation of $9,921 and $74,579, respectively, on its older Miners. These assets are expected to be\ndepreciated to their residual values by the end of 2024.\nThe decision to replace the older Miners, as well as a review of the useful life, residual value and depreciation\nmethod were indicators for impairment testing during the first quarter of 2024. As a result, the Company\nperformed evaluations of the recoverable amount of the assets for operating the data centers separately in\nQuebec, Washington State, Argentina and Paraguay. Based on its calculations, which were based on\ndiscounted cash flow models, the Company determined that no impairment loss should be recorded.\n21 Page\nBITFARMS LTD.\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except data relating to number of PPE, shares, warrants, options and digital assets - unaudited)\nNOTE 11: INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nAccess rights to\nSystems software electricity Total\nCost\nBalance as of January 1, 2024 5,150 3,801 8,951\nAdditions — 912 912\nBalance as of September 30, 2024 5,150 4,713 9,863\nAccumulated amortization\nBalance as of January 1, 2024 5,138 113 5,251\nAmortization 9 395 404\nBalance as of September 30, 2024 5,147 508 5,655\nNet book value as of September 30, 2024 3 4,205 4,208\nAccess rights to\nSystems software electricity Total\nCost\nBalance as of January 1, 2023 5,150 — 5,150\nAdditions related to asset acquisitions — 3,801 3,801\nBalance as of December 31, 2023 5,150 3,801 8,951\nAccumulated amortization\nBalance as of January 1, 2023 5,117 — 5,117\nAmortization 21 113 134\nBalance as of December 31, 2023 5,138 113 5,251\nNet book value as of December 31, 2023 12 3,688 3,700\nAdditions related to access rights to electricity\nIn April 2023, the Company received approval from the power supplier in Washington State for a 6 MW\nexpansion.

The annual interest rate is lower than the rate used in\ndetermining the fair value, resulting in the deposit being recorded at a fair value of $7,125 upon initial\nrecognition. Subsequently, the Refundable deposit is recorded at amortized cost.

This may result in damages payable by the Company and forced continuance of the contractual\narrangement. Under such circumstances, the Company’s growth plans and ongoing operations could be\nadversely impacted.\ne. Contingent liabilities\nIn 2021, the Company imported Miners into Washington State that the vendor located in China claimed\noriginated in Malaysia. In early 2022, U.S. Customs and Border Protection challenged the origination of the\nMiners, asserting that the Miners were manufactured in China, and notified the Company of a potential\nassessment of a U.S. importation duty of 25%.\nDuring the third quarter of 2023, the Company submitted supporting documentation to U.S. Customs and\nBorder Protection in defense of its position that the Miners were manufactured outside China and the\nassociated custom duties in the amount of $9,424 do not apply. While the final outcome of this matter is\nuncertain at this time, Management has determined it is not probable that it will result in a future cash\noutflow for the Company and, as such, no provision was recorded as of September 30, 2024.\n26 Page\nBITFARMS LTD.\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except data relating to number of PPE, shares, warrants, options and digital assets - unaudited)\nNOTE 13: TRADE PAYABLES AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES\nAs of September 30, As of December 31,\n2024 2023\nTrade accounts payable and accrued liabilities 31,690 9,077\nGovernment remittances* 2,624 11,662\n34,314 20,739\n* Refer to Note 23b for more details about the reversal of Canadian government remittances payable.\nNOTE 14: WARRANT LIABILITIES\nThe fair value of warrant liabilities is as follows:\nAs of September 30, As of December 31,\n2024 2023\n2023 private placement 14,327 34,276\n2021 private placements — 6,150\n14,327 40,426\nIn November 2023, the Company completed a private placement that included 22,222,223 warrants and\n3,000,000 broker warrants to purchase common shares (the \"2023 private placement\").

Building financing\nIn March 2024, the Company sold its Garlock building in Sherbrooke, Quebec for $1,695 and immediately\nleased it back for 10 years. Since the lease agreement included a substantive repurchase option of the building\nin a form of a call option, the Company has not transferred the control of the asset to the buyer, and the\ntransaction does not qualify as a sale. Accordingly, it is accounted for as a financing arrangement for the\nproceeds received from the buyer, and the building continues to be recognized as property, plant and\nequipment of the Company.\nb. Equipment financing activity\nRepayment of NYDIG Loan\nIn June 2022, Backbone entered into an equipment financing agreement, referred to as the “NYDIG Loan”, for\ngross proceeds of $36,860 collateralized by 10,395 WhatsMiner M30S Miners. The net proceeds received by\nthe Company were $36,123, net of origination and closing fees of $737. As part of the agreement, the\nCompany was required to maintain in a segregated wallet an approximate quantity of BTC whose value\nequates to at least one month of interest and principal payments on the outstanding loan. The pledged BTC\nwas held in a segregated Coinbase Custody account and owned by the Company unless there was an event of\ndefault under the NYDIG Loan.\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, the NYDIG Loan balance was fully repaid, and the Company's Miners\ncollateralizing the loan and BTC pledged as collateral became unencumbered.\nRepayment of Foundry Loans #2, #3 and #4\nIn April and May 2021, the Company entered into four loan agreements for the acquisition of 2,465\nWhatsMiner Miners referred to as “Foundry Loans #1, #2, #3 and #4.” During 2022, Foundry Loan #1 matured\nand was fully repaid. In January 2023, the principal amounts of the remaining Foundry Loans #2, #3 and #4\nwere fully repaid before their maturity date with forgiveness of prepayment penalties totaling $829.\nSettlement of the loan with BlockFi Lending LLC (“BlockFi”)\nIn February 2022, Backbone Mining entered into an equipment financing agreement for gross proceeds of\n$32,000 collateralized by 6,100 Bitmain S19j Pro Miners referred to as the “BlockFi Loan“. The net proceeds\nreceived by the Company were $30,994 after capitalizing origination, closing and other transaction fees of\n$1,006.\nIn December 2022, Backbone Mining ceased making installment payments, which constituted a default under\nthe loan agreement, and the BlockFi Loan was classified as current.\nOn February 8, 2023, BlockFi and the Company negotiated a settlement of the loan in its entirety with a then-\noutstanding debt balance of $20,330 for cash consideration of $7,750, discharging Backbone Mining of all\nfurther obligations and resulting in a gain on extinguishment of long-term debt of $12,580 recognized in Net\nfinancial (expenses) income in the consolidated statements of profit or loss and comprehensive profit or loss\nduring the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Electrical component inventory\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the cost of electrical component inventory\nrecognized as an expense and included in cost of revenues was $1,085 and $2,060, respectively (three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2023: $681 and $1,521, respectively).\nb. Canadian sales tax refund\nIn April 2024, the Company received confirmation from the provincial tax authorities that Canadian sales taxes\npaid by the Company from February 5, 2022 onwards are refundable. Between February 5, 2022, the date on\nwhich the new crypto currency sales tax legislation came into effect, and April 2024, the Company filed\nmonthly sales tax refund claims totaling approximately $24,400 (CAD$33,000) that were not paid to the\nCompany, pending the finalization of the aforementioned legislation. The refund of sales taxes relates to sales\ntaxes charged on various expenditures including, but not limited to, electricity costs, cost of property, plant\nand equipment, professional services, etc. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the $24,400\nsales tax claims were refunded by the Canadian tax authorities.\nIn addition to not receiving its Canadian sales tax refund claims, the Company was self-assessing sales taxes\npayable when appropriate. During the second quarter of 2024, the Company reversed $9,560 of government\nremittances previously included in PPE and accrued in trade accounts payable and accrued liabilities, as\ndisclosed in Note 13. Of this amount, $5,360 was recorded as a decrease to cost of revenues, $520 was\nrecorded as a decrease to general and administrative expense and $3,680 was recorded as a decrease to PPE.\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, sales tax recoveries of $22,200 for previous years (i.e., 2022 and 2023) and\n$2,200 for the period of January to April 2024 were recognized and presented as direct adjustments in their\nrespective expense and asset categories.\nc. Gain on disposition of marketable securities\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company funded its expansion in\nArgentina through the acquisition of marketable securities and the in-kind contribution of those securities to\nthe Company's subsidiary in Argentina. The subsequent disposition of those marketable securities in exchange\nfor ARS gave rise to a gain as the amount received in ARS exceeded the amount of ARS the Company would\nhave received from a direct foreign currency exchange.\nd. Provision income (expense) on VAT receivable\nDue to the political and economic uncertainties in Argentina, the Company is uncertain when, or if at all, the\nArgentine VAT receivable will be settled. As a result, the Company recorded a provision to reduce the\nArgentine VAT receivable to nil starting in the fourth quarter of 2023. During the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024, the provision expense is classified within the respective expense and asset\ncategories. Prior to October 1, 2023, the Argentine VAT not expected to be settled within the next 12 months\nwas classified as a long-term receivable in Note 12 with the short-term portion included in sales tax receivable\nin Note 5.\n40 Page\nBITFARMS LTD.\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except data relating to number of PPE, shares, warrants, options and digital assets - unaudited)\nNOTE 24: GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION\nReportable segment\nThe reporting segments are identified on the basis of information that is reviewed by the chief operating\ndecision maker (\"CODM\") to make decisions about resources to be allocated and to assess performance.\nAccordingly, for Management purposes, the Company is organized into operating segments based on the\nproducts and services of its business units and has one material reportable segment, cryptocurrency Mining,\nwhich is the operation of data centers that support the validation and verification of transactions on the BTC\nblockchain, earning cryptocurrency for providing these services, as described in Note 1.\nRevenues\nRevenues* by country are as follows:\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNorth America\nCanada 24,901 24,230 85,168 74,177\nUSA 2,171 3,491 10,354 11,675\n27,072 27,721 95,522 85,852\nSouth America\nArgentina 6,033 5,129 25,588 9,221\nParaguay 11,748 1,746 15,608 5,052\n17,781 6,875 41,196 14,273\n44,853 34,596 136,718 100,125\n*Revenues are presented based on the geographical contribution of computational power used for hashing calculations (measured by\nhashrate) or sales to external customers.

COMPANY OVERVIEW\nFounded in 2017, Bitfarms (Nasdaq/TSX: BITF) is a global, publicly traded Bitcoin mining company. Bitfarms\noperates vertically integrated Bitcoin data centers with in-house management and company-owned electrical\nengineering, installation service, and multiple onsite technical repair centers. The Company’s proprietary data\nanalytics system delivers best-in-class operational performance and uptime.\nBitfarms owns and operates data centers housing computers (referred to as “Miners”) designed for the\npurpose of validating transactions on the Bitcoin Blockchain (referred to as “Mining”). Bitfarms generally\noperates its Miners 24 hours per day to produce computational power used for hashing calculations\n(measured by hashrate) that Bitfarms sells to a Mining pool operator under a formula-driven rate commonly\nknown in the industry as Full Pay Per Share (“FPPS”). Under FPPS, Mining pool operators compensate Mining\ncompanies for their computational power used for hashing calculations, measured through hashrate, based on\nwhat the Mining pool operator would expect to generate in revenue for a given time period if there was no\nrandomness involved. The fee paid by a Mining pool operator to Bitfarms for its computational power used for\nhashing calculations may be in cryptocurrency, U.S. dollars, or another currency. However, the fees are\ngenerally paid to the Company on a daily basis in Bitcoin (“BTC”). Bitfarms accumulates the cryptocurrency\nfees it receives or exchanges them for U.S. dollars through reputable and established cryptocurrency trading\nplatforms.\nBitfarms currently has 12 operating Bitcoin data centers, two under development, and two under Hosting\nagreements, situated in four countries: Canada, the United States, Paraguay and Argentina. Powered\npredominately by environmentally friendly hydro-electric and long-term power contracts, Bitfarms is\ncommitted to using sustainable and often underutilized energy infrastructure.\nThe Company’s ability to operate and secure power through its production sites is summarized as follows:\nOperating power as of Contracted power as of\nCountry November 12, 2024 November 12, 2024\nNorth America\n1, 2\nCanada 159 MW 180 MW\n2, 3\nUnited States 18 MW 215 MW\n177 MW 395 MW\nSouth America\n2\nParaguay 80 MW 280 MW\nArgentina 54 MW 210 MW 2\n134 MW 490 MW\n311 MW 885 MW\n1\nThe Company has secured the rights for 10 MW of hydro-electricity in the province of Quebec but does not currently have an expansion plan for\nthose 10 MW of power.

EXPANSION PROJECTS\nThe Company describes its expansion plans below under the sections entitled “United States Expansion”,\n“Paraguay Expansion”, “Canada Expansion”, and “Argentina Expansion”. These expansion projects only include\nupdates for 2024. For background or historical information on these expansions, refer to the Company’s\nMD&A for the year ended December 31, 2023, dated March 6, 2024, and the 2023 AIF.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company operated 11.3 EH/s, an increase of 5.2 EH/s, or 85%, compared to\nSeptember 30, 2023, with the installation of additional Miners in Paso Pe, Paraguay; Baie-Comeau, Quebec;\nand Rio Cuarto, Argentina, and the Company upgrading its overall fleet with more efficient Miners. In October\n2024 the Company achieved 11.5 EH/s, and in November 2024 the Company achieved 11.9 EH/s, mainly due\nto fleet-wide operational excellence initiatives. Through its expansion projects and the investment in its\ntransformative fleet upgrade, the Company achieved its target of 21 w/TH before the end of 2024 and is\nexecuting towards its revised targets of 18 EH/s by March 31, 2025 and 21 EH/s by June 30, 2025.\nThe Company’s revised target reflects the adoption of a more conservative approach in determining its\nforward guidance and is driven primarily by delays in Miner deliveries including the reassignment of Miners\nfrom Paraguay to the two Stronghold hosting sites. The Company is also upgrading 18,853 Bitmain T21s\nremaining in its Purchase Option and March 2024 Purchase Order, as defined below, to the more efficient\nBitmain S21 Pro, with scheduled deliveries in December 2024 and January 2025.\nThe most recent BTC halving event occurred on April 19, 2024, and the Company continues to prudently\nexplore further opportunities to expand its infrastructure and improve its Mining hardware to increase the\nCompany’s Hashrate and Miner efficiency.\nCautionary statements\nThe estimated costs and timelines to achieve these expansion plans may change based on, among other\nfactors, the cost and supply of Bitcoin Mining equipment, the ability to import equipment into countries where\nit operates in a cost-effective and timely manner, the supply of electrical and other supporting infrastructure\nequipment, the availability of construction materials, currency exchange rates and the impact of geopolitical\nevents on the supply chains described above. Adding reliable, environmentally-friendly hydro power is an\nelement of the Company’s strategy to expand cost-effectively its operating footprint. The Company’s\nexpansion plans rely on a consistent supply of electricity at cost-effective rates; refer to Section 19 - Risk\nFactors (Section Economic Dependence on Regulated Terms of Service and Electricity Rates Risks) of the\nCompany’s MD&A for the year ended December 31, 2023, dated March 6, 2024 for further details, including a\ndescription of these and other factors.\nTransformative Fleet Upgrade\nThe transformative fleet upgrade plan described above underpins the Company’s 2024 expansion strategy.\nSecuring additional Miners is a key element of the Company’s strategy to benefit from increasing Bitcoin prices\nand to drive rapid and meaningful improvements across three key operating metrics: Hashrate, energy\nefficiency and operating costs per TH.\nOn November 27, 2023, the Company placed a firm purchase order for 35,888 Bitmain T21 Miners\n(the “Purchase Order”) totaling $95.5 million, or $14/TH, which were delivered in 2024. In addition, the\nCompany secured a purchase option for an additional 28,000 Bitmain T21 Miners (the “Purchase Option”) for\nan aggregate purchase price of $74.5 million, or $14/TH.\n10 Page\nBITFARMS LTD.\nManagement’s Discussion & Analysis\n(In U.S. dollars, except where otherwise indicated)\n6. EXPANSION PROJECTS (Continued)\nTransformative Fleet Upgrade (Continued)\nOn March 11, 2024, the Company exercised the Purchase Option. On that date, the Company also purchased\nan additional 19,280 Bitmain T21 Miners for $14/TH, and 3,888 Bitmain S21 Miners and 740 Bitmain S21 hydro\nMiners for $17.50/TH, for an aggregate purchase price of $69.2 million (collectively defined as the ''March\n2024 Purchase Order'').\nOn November 12, 2024, the Company amended the Purchase Option and the March 2024 Purchase Order and\nupgraded 18,853 Bitmain T21 Miners with more efficient Bitmain S21 Pro Miners for an additional $33.2\nmillion which are expected to be delivered in December 2024 and January 2025. The amended aggregate\npurchase price for the Purchase Option is $85.1 million and the March 2024 Purchase Order is $91.9 million.\nThe March 2024 Purchase Order, combined with the Purchase Order and Purchase Option, is expected to\nenable the Company to reach 21 EH/s operating capacity and has enabled the Company to already achieve 21\nw/TH efficiency in 2024 without redeploying its older Miners. The Company intends to continue liquidating\nthese older Miners to help offset the cost of new Miners. During YTD Q3 2024, the Company sold\napproximately 6,300 older generation Miners to third parties for approximately $1.5 million. Refer to Note 8\nto the Financial Statements.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company paid $206.7 million towards these new orders with remaining\npayments of $31.9 million made during October 2024. The Company commenced the 2024 ATM Program on\nMarch 11, 2024, enabling the Company to access liquidity of up to $375.0 million, with the intention to use the\nproceeds primarily on capital expenditures to support the Company’s growth and development.

EXPANSION PROJECTS (Continued)\nA. United States Expansion\nPlanned 2025 Acquisition of Stronghold\nIn August 2024, the Company and Stronghold entered into the Merger Agreement under which Bitfarms will\nacquire Stronghold in the Stronghold Transaction. The Stronghold Transaction was valued at approximately\n$125.0 million equity value plus the repayment of the debt valued at approximately $50.0 million set to expire\nat closing.\nStronghold is a vertically integrated crypto asset Mining company focused on Bitcoin and environmental\nremediation and reclamation services. Stronghold owns over 750 acres of land with options on over 1,100\nadditional acres along with two merchant power plants: the Scrubgrass and Panther Creek Facilities in\nPennsylvania. These two power plants are recognized by Pennsylvania as a Tier 2 Alternative Energy Source\n(the same category as large-scale hydro) for their proven and significant environmental benefits and have\nremoved hundreds of thousands of tons of mining waste and converted it into power, and reclaiming hundred\nof acres in the process.\nAs of June 30, 2024, Stronghold had a Hashrate of 4.0 EH/s and 165 MW of current nameplate generated\npower capacity, with the potential to bring its Hashrate to approximately 10 EH/s in 2025 with fleet upgrades.\nIn addition, Stronghold has 142 MW of current Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection (PJM)\nimport capacity with multiple studies underway to potentially increase the total import capacity by an\nadditional 648 MW, bringing as much as 790 MW of incremental potential power beyond 2025.\nThe Stronghold Transaction could add up to 307 MW of power capacity to the Company’s operations and is\naligned with the Company's strategic objectives to diversify its operations and expand its presence in the U.S.\nthrough vertical integration of power generation and energy trading capabilities and solidify its position as a\ndominant player in the Bitcoin Mining sector and the potential to solidify its position in the HPC and AI sector.\nThe Stronghold Transaction has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies and\nis expected to close in the first quarter of 2025, subject to the approval of Stronghold’s shareholders and the\nreceipt of applicable regulatory approvals and certain third-party consents, and other customary closing\nconditions. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Stronghold shareholders will receive 2.52 shares of\nBitfarms for each share of Stronghold they own, representing, based on the price of Bitfarms’ shares at August\n16, 2024, consideration per share of U.S. $6.02 and a 71% premium to the Stronghold 90-day volume-\nweighted average price on Nasdaq as of that date.\nPanther Creek Hosting Agreement 2024 plan\nIn September 2024, the Company entered into the Panther Creek Hosting Agreement with Stronghold Digital\nMining Hosting, a subsidiary of Stronghold.\nUnder the terms of the Panther Creek Hosting Agreement, the Company will deploy a mix of 10,000 Bitmain\nT21 and Bitmain S21 Pro Miners at Stronghold’s Panther Creek site which were originally scheduled to come\nonline at the Company’s Yguazu, Paraguay site.

Net financial income (Continued)\nQ3 2024 v. Q3 2023 (Continued)\nThe increase was partially offset by:\n• A $3.3 million decrease in the gain on disposition of marketable securities due to less funds being sent to\nArgentina in Q3 2024 compared to Q3 2023 as the capital expenditures related to the first data center were\nmostly paid in 2022 and 2023. Since the third quarter of 2021, the Company has been utilizing a mechanism\nto fund its Argentina expansion through the acquisition of marketable securities and in-kind contribution of\nthose securities to its wholly-owned Argentinian subsidiary that it controls. The subsequent disposition of\nthose marketable securities in exchange for Argentine Pesos gave rise to a gain as the equivalent amount\nreceived in Argentine Pesos exceeded the amount of Argentine Pesos the Company would have received\nfrom a direct foreign currency exchange.\nYTD Q3 2024 v.

SELECTED QUARTERLY INFORMATION (Continued)\nAlthough the BTC mining industry experiences volatility, it is not generally subject to seasonality or seasonal\neffects. Seasonal fluctuations in energy supply, however, may impact the Company’s operations. The majority\nof the Company’s operations during the above periods were in Quebec, where power was sourced directly\nfrom Hydro-Québec, Hydro-Magog, Hydro-Sherbrooke and the City of Baie-Comeau. The Company also had\noperations in Washington State that were powered by the Grant County Power Utility District as well as\noperations in Paraguay that were powered by ANDE and Compañía de Luz y Fuerza S.A (“CLYFSA”). Energy\nrates in Argentina increase during winter months of May through September, after which they return to their\nregular rates. Among other phenomena, changing weather in Quebec, Washington State, Paraguay or\nArgentina may impact seasonal electricity needs, and periods of extreme cold or extreme hot weather may\ncontribute to service interruptions in cryptocurrency mining operations. Changes to supply and/or demand of\nelectricity may result in curtailment of electricity to the Company’s cryptocurrency mining operations. The\nCompany’s geographical diversification reduces the risk and extent of extreme weather and other external\nfactors unduly affecting the Company’s overall performance.\nFor Q3 2024 details, refer to Section 7A - Financial Performance (Revenues); Section 10A - Liquidity and Capital\nResources (Cash Flows); and Section 6 - Expansion Projects (United States Expansion, Paraguay Expansion,\nArgentina Expansion and Canada Expansion) of this MD&A.\n29 Page\nBITFARMS LTD.\nManagement’s Discussion & Analysis\n(In U.S. dollars, except where otherwise indicated)\n9.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAs discussed below, the Company’s current financing strategy involves (a) strategically selling the BTC it earns\nand the BTC it holds in treasury and (b) utilizing short-term debt, long-term debt and equity instruments\n(including the 2024 ATM Program) to fund its expansion activities, operating expenses and debt service\nrequirements. The Company has sufficient liquidity for its 2024 growth plan and anticipates requiring\nadditional funds to complete its 2025 growth plans discussed in Section 6 - Expansion Projects of this MD&A.\nAlthough the Company operates through its subsidiaries, there are no material legal restrictions and generally\nno practical restrictions on the ability of the subsidiaries to transfer funds to the Company, except that the\nCompany may be subject to practical limitations on transferring funds from its Argentinian subsidiary.\nBeginning in the second half of 2019, the Argentine government instituted certain foreign currency exchange\ncontrols that could restrict the Company’s Argentinian subsidiary’s access to foreign currency, including the US\ndollar, for making payments abroad or transferring funds to its parent without prior authorization from the\nArgentine Central Bank. These regulations have continued to evolve and may become more stringent\ndepending on the Argentine government´s perception of the availability of sufficient national foreign currency\nreserves. Further, recent changes, as well as any future changes, in national and provincial leadership may\nresult in changing governmental perceptions and actions surrounding importation policies and the availability\nof foreign currency reserves for commerce. In late 2023, Argentina held a presidential election resulting in the\nelection of a new president, Javier Milei. Many of the foreign exchange restrictions implemented in 2019 are\nstill in place, particularly for imports and dividend payments related to transactions before December 13,\n2023. The Milei administration has not set a specific date for lifting currency controls, and is not expected to\nbefore Argentina’s mid-term elections, which are scheduled to be held in 2025. The ongoing implications for\neconomic and monetary policy, and its impact on Bitfarms, cannot be ascertained as of the date of this MD&A.\nThe Company sends funds periodically to its Argentinian subsidiary to fund its expansion based on supplier\ninvoices that are paid by the Argentinian subsidiary. The Argentinian subsidiary provides Hashrate services for\na market-based fee to its Canadian parent which, in turn, purchases that Hashrate to consolidate and sell to a\nthird-party Mining Pool for which the Canadian parent is compensated in BTC. Accordingly, the Argentinian\nsubsidiary is not structured or contemplated to generate substantial cash flows above its internal\nrequirements.\n37 Page\nBITFARMS LTD.\nManagement’s Discussion & Analysis\n(In U.S. dollars, except where otherwise indicated)\n10.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (Continued)\nB. Capital Resources\nBitfarms' capital management objective is to provide financial resources that will enable the Company to\nmaximize the return to its shareholders while optimizing its cost of capital and ensuring the Company has\nsufficient liquidity to fund its operating activities. In order to achieve this objective, the Company monitors its\ncapital structure and makes adjustments as required in light of the Company’s funding requirements, changes\nin economic conditions, the cost of providing financing, and the risks to which the Company is exposed. The\nCompany’s financing strategy is to maintain a flexible capital structure that optimizes the cost of capital at an\nacceptable level of risk, to preserve its ability to meet financial obligations as they come due, and to ensure\nthe Company has sufficient financial resources to fund its organic and acquisitive growth.\nBased on the current capital budget and BTC prices, the Company currently anticipates that additional\nfinancing will be required to fund its 2025 expansion plans and to complete construction of additional data\ncenters, if the Company elects to do so. In order to achieve its business objectives, the Company may sell or\nborrow against the BTC that are held in treasury as of the date hereof as well as BTC received from its ongoing\noperations, which may or may not be possible on commercially attractive terms. Bitfarms intends to continue\nto manage its capital structure by striving to reduce operating expenses and unnecessary capital spending,\ndisposing of inefficient or underutilized assets, obtaining short-term and long-term debt financing and issuing\nequity.\nA BTC Halving event is scheduled to occur once every 210,000 blocks, or roughly every four years, until the\ntotal amount of BTC rewards issued reaches 21 million, which is expected to occur around 2140. The most\nrecent BTC Halving event occurred on April 19, 2024, at which time BTC block rewards decreased from 6.25\nBTC per block to 3.125 BTC per block. Once 21 million BTC are generated, the network will stop producing\nmore BTC, and the industry will then need to rely on transaction fees and/or other sources of revenue. While\nBTC prices have had a history of significant fluctuations around BTC Halving events, there is no guarantee that\nthe price change will be favorable or would compensate for the reduction in Mining rewards and the\ncompensation from Mining Pools. Similar to past BTC Halvings events, the BTC price did not have an\nimmediate favorable impact after the BTC Halving that occurred on April 19, 2024. It took approximately six\nmonths for the Company's revenue per terahash to return to the level experienced prior to the May 2020 BTC\nHalving event. Since the BTC halving on April 19, 2024, revenue per terahash has not yet returned to pre-\nhalving levels.\n41 Page\nBITFARMS LTD.\nManagement’s Discussion & Analysis\n(In U.S. dollars, except where otherwise indicated)\n10. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (Continued)\nB. Capital Resources (Continued)\nDigital Asset Management Program\nIn early January 2021, the Company implemented a digital asset management program under which it holds\nBTC for its intrinsic value and as a source of liquidity. The Company has internal controls over the management\nof its digital assets, which it evaluates and, as appropriate, enhances on a quarterly basis. On August 1, 2022,\nManagement received approval from the Board to sell daily production, in addition to any sale of up to 1,000\nBTC from treasury, should market conditions and the Company’s projected financing requirements justify such\nsales in Management’s discretion.\nPresented below are the total BTC sold and proceeds in YTD Q3 2024, a portion of which was used to fully\nrepay equipment-related indebtedness, with the remaining portion used to fund operations and expansion\nplans:\nThree months ended Three months ended Three months ended\n(U.S. $ in thousands except where indicated) September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 March 31, 2024\nQuantity of BTC sold 461 515 941\nTotal proceeds 27,938 33,756 49,570\nThe sale of BTC as described above, while the Company continued to earn BTC, resulted in total holdings of\n1,147 BTC as of September 30, 2024, valued at approximately $72.6 million based on a BTC price of\napproximately $63,300, as of September 30, 2024.\nCustody of digital assets\nThe Company’s BTC received from the Mining Pool for its computational power used for hashing calculations is\ndelivered to multi-signature wallets that the Company controls or directs to external third-party custodians.\nOn a regular basis, the Company transfers BTC from its multi-signature wallets to external third-party\ncustodians, Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC (“Coinbase Custody”), a subsidiary of Coinbase Global, Inc.\n(“Coinbase”) and Anchorage Digital Bank National Association (“Anchorage Digital”). Coinbase Custody\nprovides custody and related services for clients’ digital assets as a fiduciary pursuant to the New York State\nDepartment of Financial Services under Section 100 of the New York Banking Law. Anchorage Digital is the\nonly federally chartered crypto bank in the U.S., serves as a custodian for digital assets, and is licensed and\nregulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Currently, Coinbase Custody and Anchorage Digital\nprovide only custodial services to the Company and do not use a sub-custodian. Coinbase Custody and\nAnchorage Digital are not related parties to the Company.\nThe Company has internal controls in place to evaluate its custodians on a quarterly basis. If the Company was\nto face challenges with one of its custodians, the Company could transfer digital assets between custodians\nand has its own multi-signature wallets as a contingency plan that would have a minimal impact on the\nCompany’s operations.\nAs of November 12, 2024, the Company has 1,205 BTC, valued at $107.2 million on its balance sheet. As of the\ndate of this MD&A, 100% of the Company’s BTC are held in custody with Coinbase Custody and Anchorage\nDigital.\n42 Page\nBITFARMS LTD.\nManagement’s Discussion & Analysis\n(In U.S. dollars, except where otherwise indicated)\n10. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (Continued)\nB. Capital Resources (Continued)\nCustody of digital assets (Continued)\nCoinbase Custody maintains an insurance policy of $320 million for its cold storage and Anchorage Digital\nmaintains an insurance policy of $50 million for its cold and hot storage; however, the Company cannot ensure\nthat the full limits of those policies would be available to the Company or, if available, would be sufficient to\nmake the Company whole for any BTC that are lost or stolen. The Company is unaware of: (i) any security\nbreaches involving Coinbase Custody or Anchorage Digital which have resulted in the Company’s crypto assets\nbeing lost or stolen, or (ii) anything with regards to Coinbase Custody’s or Anchorage Digital’s operations that\nwould adversely affect the Company’s ability to obtain an unqualified audit opinion on its audited financial\nstatements. The Company’s crypto assets held in custody with Coinbase or Anchorage Digital may not be\nrecoverable in the event of bankruptcy by Coinbase, Anchorage Digital or their affiliates. In Coinbase’s\nquarterly report, on Form 10-Q, filed with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission on October 30, 2024,\nCoinbase disclosed that, in the event of a bankruptcy, custodially held crypto assets could be considered to be\nthe property of the bankruptcy estate and that the crypto assets held in custody could be subject to\nbankruptcy proceedings with Coinbase Custody’s customers being treated as general unsecured creditors.\nFurther, regardless of efforts made by the Company to securely store and safeguard assets, there can be no\nassurance that the Company’s cryptocurrency assets will not be defalcated through hacking or other forms of\ntheft.\nHedging program of digital assets\nThe Company’s hedging strategy aims to reduce the risk associated with the variability of cash flows resulting\nfrom future disposals of digital assets and in consideration of the volatility and adverse price movements of\nthe digital assets in the prior months. In March 2023, the Board approved a hedging program and authorized\nManagement, through a risk management committee specifically created for this purpose, to implement\nhedges using various financial derivatives including over-the-counter BTC option and BTC future contracts,\namong others, hedging up to 20% of the Company’s BTC compensation per month and up to three months of\nexpected future BTC compensation. In April 2023, the Board authorized the risk management committee to\nincrease the maximum hedge ratio to up to 50% of the Company’s BTC compensation per month and up to six\nmonths of expected future BTC compensation. As of November 12, 2024, the Company has a hedge in place of\n75 BTC of expected future BTC compensation.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had BTC option contracts to sell\ndigital assets which resulted in losses of $0.4 million and $1.3 million, respectively, mainly related to\npremiums for the option contracts hedging the risk of the BTC price decreasing and protecting the Company’s\nmargins.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (Continued)\nB. Capital Resources (Continued)\nSynthetic HODL program for digital assets management\nAlongside the hedging program, and with the intent to source risk-managed and capital-efficient leverage on\nBTC, in June 2023, the Board approved a HODL strategy, referred to as the Synthetic HODL strategy, which\nallows up to 20% of the Company’s BTC exposure to be replicated using BTC derivatives and volatility-targeting\ninstruments. In October 2023, the Company initiated its Synthetic HODL strategy with the purchase of long-\ndated BTC call options. The primary objective of the Synthetic HODL is to replicate BTC HODL appreciation\npotential upside while utilizing excess cash flow from operations to fund capital growth programs. As of\nNovember 12, 2024, the Company has active call option contracts providing the right to buy up to 634 BTC. It\nremains within the risk management committee’s discretion to dynamically adjust Bitfarms’ hedge and\nSynthetic HODL ratios within the risk limits approved by the Board to more adequately respond to market\nconditions that are beyond the Company’s operational control. During the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Company purchased long-dated BTC call options which resulted in gains of $0.3\nmillion and $1.6 million, respectively, attributable to the change in the BTC price over the respective periods.\nC. Contractual obligations\nThe following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities and gross lease liabilities (non-financial\nliabilities) with estimated future interest payments, as applicable, as of September 30, 2024:\n2028 and\n(U.S. $ in thousands) 2024 2025 2026 2027 thereafter Total\nTrade accounts payable and\naccrued liabilities 31,690 — — — — 31,690\nLong-term debt 56 172 171 176 1,165 1,740\nLease liabilities 734 3,439 4,228 4,340 19,220 31,961\n32,480 3,611 4,399 4,516 20,385 65,391\nD.

This may result in damages payable by the Company and forced continuance of the contractual\narrangement. Under such circumstances, the Company’s growth plans and ongoing operations could be\nadversely impacted.\n44 Page\nBITFARMS LTD.\nManagement’s Discussion & Analysis\n(In U.S. dollars, except where otherwise indicated)\n10. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (Continued)\nE. Contingent liabilities\nIn 2021, the Company imported Miners into Washington State that the vendor located in China claimed\noriginated in Malaysia. In early 2022, U.S. Customs and Border Protection challenged the origination of the\nMiners, asserting that the Miners were manufactured in China, and notified the Company of a potential\nassessment of a U.S. importation duty of 25%. Since the request for information by U.S. Customs and Border\nProtection, the Company has been working with the vendor to validate their origination outside of China by\nvisiting contract manufacturer sites and by examining and documenting the manufacture and assembly of the\nMiners by the vendor and its third-party contractors.\nDuring the third quarter of 2023, the Company submitted supporting documentation to U.S. Customs and\nBorder Protection in defense of its position that the Miners were manufactured outside China and the\nassociated custom duties in the amount of $9.4 million do not apply. While the final outcome of this matter is\nuncertain at this time, Management has determined it is not probable that it will result in a future cash\noutflow for the Company and, as such, no provision was recorded as of September 30, 2024.\n45 Page\nBITFARMS LTD.\nManagement’s Discussion & Analysis\n(In U.S. dollars, except where otherwise indicated)\n11.

The Company also anticipates requiring additional funds to complete its 2025 growth\nplans discussed in Section 6 - Expansion Projects of this MD&A. As of September 30, 2024, Bitfarms had\nworking capital of $138.0 million, compared to $60.8 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase in working\ncapital was mostly due to:\n• A $38.7 million increase in total digital assets resulting from the increase of the Company’s treasury by\n343 BTC and the appreciation of the BTC price during YTD Q3 2024.\n• A $26.1 million decrease in warrant liabilities due to the subsequent decrease in fair value revaluation of\nthe warrants from the 2023 private placements, the exercise of 2023 private placements warrants and the\nexpiration of all 2021 private placement warrants.\n• A $9.9 million increase in other assets resulting from the increase in sales taxes receivable on the\nCompany’s initial capital costs for its expansions in Paraguay.\n• A $9.5 million increase in short-term prepaid deposits mainly related to the prepayment of electricity to an\nenergy supplier in Argentina during YTD Q3 2024.\n• Scheduled capital repayments of $4.0 million to fully pay off the NYDIG loan in the first quarter of 2024. The\neffect on working capital is nil as the repayments decreased the cash balance and the loan balance by\ncorresponding amounts.\nThe increase is partially offset by:\n• A $11.1 million decrease in cash as explained by the cash flows. Refer to Section 10A - Liquidity and Capital\nResources - Cash flows of this MD&A.\n• A $13.6 million increase in trade payables and accrued liabilities, reflecting the ongoing expansion projects\nof the Company, professional services relating to the Stronghold Transaction and Strategic Alternatives\nReview Process and increase in derivative asset positions that are settled for cash on or before contract\nexpiration.\n1 Prior year figures are derived from restated financial statements.

The increase of $60.5 million, or 33%, was primarily due to:\n• The $73.6 million increase in Paraguay PPE primarily due to the construction of the Paso Pe data\ncenters and substation, receipt of approximately 8 hydro containers, the installation of 600 MicroBT\nWhatsMiner M53S and 9,500 Bitmain T21 Miners as well as the ongoing construction of the Yguazu\ndata center and substation during YTD Q3 2024.\n• The $3.8 million increase in Canada PPE mainly due to the Miner fleet upgrade, which exceeded the\nregular depreciation expense and the accelerated depreciation of older Miners.\nThe increase is partially offset by:\n• The decrease of PPE in Argentina and the US by $12.4 million and $4.5 million, respectively, mostly\ndue to regular depreciation expense and the accelerated depreciation of older Miners, which\nexceeded the value of the Miners received in connection with the transformative fleet upgrade\nprogram.

The increase of $9.6 million, or 67%, was mainly due to the Sharon Lease Agreement\nfinalized during Q3 2024 to lease an industrialized site in Sharon, Pennsylvania, providing the Company\nimmediate capacity of 12 MW of electricity and a potential additional 98 MW for a total 110 MW of\ndevelopment capacity by 2025.\nUpon signing the agreement, the Company issued 1,532,745 common shares with a total value of $3.0 million\nas a non-refundable deposit which was capitalized as part of the ROU asset. On initial recognition, the\nCompany recognized $11.4 million of ROU asset and $8.2 million of lease liability with the difference of $3.0\nmillion recorded in share capital. Refer to Note 16 - Leases and Note 18 - Share Capital to the Financial\nStatements for more details.\nD. Intangible assets\nAs of September 30, 2024, Bitfarms had intangible assets of $4.2 million, compared to $3.7 million as of\nDecember 31, 2023. The $0.5 million increase is mainly due to the Washington State access right to electricity\nbeing available for use and reclassified from long-term deposits, equipment, prepayments and other to\nintangible assets. The increase was partially offset by the amortization of the Company’s access rights to\nelectricity in Washington State and access rights to electricity already held in Quebec and Paraguay since 2023.\nThe following table summarizes those access rights to electricity, at cost:\nAdditions to Additional Term of contractual access\nYear Location intangibles ($) capacity rights Amortization method and period\n2024 Washington State, USA 912 6 MW No termination date Declining balance 4%\n912 6 MW\n2023 Baie-Comeau, Quebec 2,315 22 MW No termination date Straight-line over the lease term of the\ndata center\n2023 Paso Pe, Paraguay 1,065 50 MW 1 Ending in December 31, 2027 Straight-line over the access rights period\n2023 Yguazu, Paraguay 421 100 MW 2 Ending in December 31, 2027 Straight-line over the access rights period\n3,801 172 MW\n4,713 178 MW\n1 In November 2023, the Company finalized an amendment to the existing contract for an additional 20 MW of energy capacity for a total capacity of\n70 MW.\n2 In May 2024, the Company finalized an amendment to the existing contract for an additional 100 MW of energy capacity for a total capacity of 200\nMW.\nRefer to Notes 5 and 14 to the 2023 Annual Financial Statements and Note 11 to the Financial Statements for\nmore details.\n48 Page\nBITFARMS LTD.\nManagement’s Discussion & Analysis\n(In U.S. dollars, except where otherwise indicated)\n12. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nThe Company discloses information on the classification and fair value of its financial instruments, as well as\non the nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments, and related risk management in Note 19\nto the Financial Statements and Note 22 to the 2023 Annual Financial Statements. Risks are related to foreign\ncurrency, credit, counterparty, liquidity, and concentration.\n13. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nThe Company discloses information on its related party transactions, as defined in IAS 24, Related Party\nDisclosures, in Note 20 to the Financial Statements.\n14. RESTATEMENT\nIn the Financial Statements, the Company has restated its consolidated statements of profit or loss and\ncomprehensive profit or loss for the three and nine months September 30, 2023 and its consolidated\nstatements of cash flows for the three and nine months September 30, 2023, which were previously filed on\nSEDAR+ and EDGAR. Subsequent to the original issuance of those financial statements, Management, with the\nassistance of outside counsel, conducted a review of the private placement financings which closed in 2021\n(“2021 private placements'') to determine if the warrants issued should be recognized as financial liabilities\nand accounted for at fair value through profit and loss rather than as equity instruments.\nThe 2021 private placement financings were comprised of common shares and warrants. The warrants are\nconvertible into a fixed number of common shares of the Company but have a contingent cashless exercise\nclause (i.e., there was a contingent variability provision). In accordance with IAS 32, Financial Instruments:\nPresentation, variability in the number of its own shares delivered upon exercise of the warrants would result\nin a financial liability.\nIn 2023, the Company concluded that the proper accounting classification of the warrants was as financial\nliabilities and accounted for at fair value through profit and loss. Although the conditional settlement\nprovisions attached to the warrants are unlikely to occur, they are deemed to be genuine, and, accordingly,\nthe warrants should be recognized as financial liabilities.\nThe Company has made adjustments to the figures reported in the previously mentioned financial statements\nperiods and present the warrants issued in connection with the private placement financings as financial\nliabilities as shown in the Financial Statements.\nFor additional information on the financial statements restatement, please refer to Note 3d of the Financial\nStatements.\n49 Page\nBITFARMS LTD.\nManagement’s Discussion & Analysis\n(In U.S. dollars, except where otherwise indicated)\n15. INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nA. Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nManagement, under the supervision of the CEO and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) of the Company, has\ndesigned or caused to be designed under their supervision disclosure controls and procedures (“DC&P”) to\nprovide reasonable assurance that:\ni) material information relating to the Company is made known to them by others, particularly during the\nperiod in which the annual filings are being prepared; and\nii) information required to be disclosed by the Company in its annual filings, interim filings or other reports\nfiled or submitted by the Company under securities legislation is recorded, processed, summarized and\nreported within the time periods specified in securities legislation.\nB. Management’s quarterly report on internal control over financial reporting\nManagement, under the supervision of the CEO and CFO, is also responsible for establishing and maintaining\nadequate internal controls over financial reporting (“ICFR”). Management, under the supervision of the CEO\nand CFO, has designed ICFR, or caused them to be designed under their supervision, to provide reasonable\nassurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for\nexternal purposes in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards.\nIdentified material weaknesses\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, such that there is a reasonable possibility\nthat a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or\ndetected on a timely basis.\nIn conjunction with the preparation of the Company’s financial statements for the year ended December 31,\n2023 and specifically, in connection with the accounting for private placement warrants that were issued in\nthe fourth quarter of 2023, Management identified an error in its accounting for previously issued warrants\nthat were issued in connection with certain private placement financings in 2021. Management has\ndetermined that the control over accounting for complex financing transactions did not operate effectively in\n2021 as the warrants issued in 2021 should have been classified as a financial liability and accounted for at fair\nvalue through profit and loss, and not as equity instruments. The restatement to correct the classification and\nsubsequent accounting for those warrants impacted the consolidated financial statements of the company for\nthe year ended December 31, 2022 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, which has\nbeen reflected in the restated comparative periods (including an opening balance sheet as of January 1, 2022\nand December 31, 2022, respectively) presented in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.\nRefer to Section 14 for more details about the material errors and related restatements. Management\nconsiders these restatements to constitute a material weakness that requires remediation, and Management\nis in the process of implementing remediation measures to address the material weakness.\n50 Page\nBITFARMS LTD.\nManagement’s Discussion & Analysis\n(In U.S. dollars, except where otherwise indicated)\n15. INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING (Continued)\nB. Management’s quarterly report on internal control over financial reporting (Continued)\nStatus of remediation plan\nRemediation efforts to date comprise expanding the finance team to include more Chartered Professional\nAccountants (CPAs) with technical expertise and experience in evaluating more complex areas of IFRS\nAccounting Standards, involving the Company's legal counsel on evaluating complex agreements involving\nfinancial instruments and engaging third-party consultants to assist with assessing the accounting for complex\nfinancial instruments and review of financial statements. Management’s efforts were in place at the end Q3\n2024, and its remediation plan is expected to be completed during 2024.\nIf these remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weakness described above, or are not\nimplemented timely, or additional deficiencies arise in the future, material misstatements in our interim or\nannual financial statements may occur in the future and could have the effects described in the “Risk Factors”\nsection of the MD&A for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nC. Changes in internal control over financial reporting\nThere have been no changes in the Company’s ICFR that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, the Company’s ICFR during the period beginning on July 1, 2024 and ended September 30,\n2024.\nD. Limitation of DC&P and ICFR\nAll control systems contain inherent limitations, regardless of how well designed. As a result, Management\nacknowledges that its internal control over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all misstatements due\nto error or fraud. In addition, Management’s evaluation of controls can provide only reasonable, not absolute,\nassurance that all control issues that may result in material misstatements, if any, have been detected.\n16. RECENT AND SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nA. Proposed Acquisition\nOn August 21, 2024, the Company and Stronghold Digital Mining, Inc. (“Stronghold”) entered into a definitive\nmerger agreement under which Bitfarms will acquire Stronghold in a stock-for-stock merger transaction (the\n“Transaction”). The Transaction is valued at approximately $125.0 million equity value plus the repayment of\nthe Stronghold debt valued at approximately $50.0 million set to expire at closing.\nB. 2024 ATM Program\nDuring the period from October 1, 2024 to November 12, 2024, the Company issued 19,565,025 common\nshares through the 2024 ATM Program in exchange for gross proceeds of $40.0 million at an average share\nprice of approximately $2.04.

The Company will accelerate the deployment of 10,000 Bitmain S21 Pro Miners at Stronghold’s\nScrubgrass site.\nThe Scrubgrass Hosting Agreement commenced on November 1, 2024, and continues for an initial term\nexpiring on December 31, 2025, after which it will automatically renew for additional one-year periods unless\neither party provides written notice of non-renewal. Pursuant to the Scrubgrass Hosting Agreement, Bitfarms\nwill pay Stronghold a monthly fee equal to fifty percent of the profit generated by the Bitfarms miners, subject\nto certain monthly adjustments between the parties to account for the upfront monthly payment due from\nBitfarms to Stronghold and for taxes and the net cost of power associated with the operation of the Bitfarms\nMiners.\nIn connection with the execution of the Scrubgrass Hosting Agreement, Bitfarms also deposited with\nStronghold $7.8 million, equal to the estimated cost of power for three months of operations of the Bitfarms\nminers, which will be refundable in full to Bitfarms within one business day of the end of the initial term\nexpiring on December 31, 2025.\nD. Bitmain Contract Amendment\nOn November 12, 2024, the Company amended the Purchase Option and the March 2024 Purchase Order and\nupgraded 18,853 Bitmain T21 Miners to 18,853 Bitmain S21 Pro Miners for an additional amount of $33.2\nmillion.

On July 24,\n2024, the Capital Markets Tribunal of the Ontario Securities Commission issued an order to cease trading any\nsecurities issued, or that may be issued, in connection with or pursuant to the June 2024 Rights plan. Also on\nJuly 24, 2024, the Board approved the adoption of a new shareholder rights plan (the “July 2024 Rights Plan”),\npursuant to which one right (a “Right”) will be issued and attached to each common share outstanding as at\nAugust 6, 2024 (the “Record Time”). A Right will also be attached to each common share issued after the\nRecord Time. Subject to the terms of the July 2024 Rights Plan, the Rights become exercisable if a person (the\n“Acquiring Person”), along with certain related persons (including persons “acting jointly or in concert” as\ndefined in the July 2024 Rights Plan), acquires or announces its intention to acquire 20% or more of the\ncommon shares without complying with the “Permitted Bid” provisions of the July 2024 Rights Plan. Following\na transaction that results in a person becoming an Acquiring Person, the Rights entitle the holder thereof to\npurchase common shares at a significant discount to the market price. The July 2024 Rights Plan is subject to\nthe acceptance of the Toronto Stock Exchange (the “TSX”) and shareholder ratification within six months of its\nadoption. The TSX has notified the Company that the TSX will defer its consideration of the acceptance of the\nJuly 2024 Rights Plan until (a) such time as it is satisfied that the appropriate securities commission will not\nintervene pursuant to National Policy 62-202 and (b) the July 2024 Rights Plan is ratified by the shareholders of\nthe Company by no later than January 24, 2025. A deferral of acceptance of the July 2024 Rights Plan by the\nTSX will not affect the adoption or operation of the July 2024 Rights Plan. The Board has recommended that\nshareholders of the Company ratify the July 2024 Rights Plan at the Company’s upcoming special meeting of\nshareholders to be held on November 20, 2024.\n53 Page\nBITFARMS LTD.\nManagement’s Discussion & Analysis\n(In U.S. dollars, except where otherwise indicated)\n18.

The Company is not relying on any registrations,\nexemptions, or “no action” letters to conduct its business in Paraguay.\nIn April 2024, a group of Paraguay’s Senators initially proposed a 180-day blanket ban on cryptocurrency\nmining due to concerns over power theft of and disruptions to the electricity supply. However, the Senate\nissued a statement in support of the legal cryptocurrency mining industry arguing that selling excess energy to\nBitcoin miners unlocks substantial revenue streams, bolster Paraguay's economy and acknowledging that the\nproposed ban would not effectively address illegal Mining activities. The Senate held a public hearing on April\n23, 2024 (the “Public Hearing”) to debate the merits and drawbacks of Bitcoin Mining in the country.\nLawmakers acknowledged the potential issues caused by illegal Mining operations disrupting the power\nsupply, but also recognized the potential economic benefits of embracing licensed Mining.\nFollowing these discussions, several significant developments occurred. On June 26 2024, Congress in\nParaguay sanctioned a bill, which was later promulgated as Law No. 7300. This law increases penalties for\nillegal use of electricity, particularly targeting unauthorized crypto mining. Penalties range from fines to\nimprisonment up to 10 years, with provisions for equipment confiscation.\n54 Page\nBITFARMS LTD.\nManagement’s Discussion & Analysis\n(In U.S. dollars, except where otherwise indicated)\n18. REGULATORY COMPLIANCE (Continued)\nParaguay (Continued)\nSecondly, also on June 26, 2024, ANDE issued a decree implementing an abrupt increase in tariffs for the\ncryptocurrency mining industry. The decree increased the electricity tariffs from 6% to 16%, a 10% point\nincrease, across various voltage categories, effective July 1, 2024.

RISK FACTORS\nThe Company is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and is affected by several factors that could\nhave a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, operating results, and/or future\nprospects. These risks should be considered when evaluating an investment in the Company and may, among\nother things, cause a decline in the price of the Corporation's shares.\nThe risks and uncertainties that Management considers as the most material to the Company's business are\ndescribed in the section entitled Risk Factors of the Company's MD&A for the year ended December 31, 2023,\ndated March 6, 2024 and Section 4.19 - Description of Business - Risk Factor in the 2023 AIF. These risks and\nuncertainties have not materially changed during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, other than the\nrisk described below, and hereby incorporated by reference.\nThere is no assurance when or if the Stronghold Transaction will be completed, and regulatory approvals\nmay not be received, may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are not presently\nanticipated or cannot be met.\nThe completion of the Stronghold Transaction is subject to satisfaction or waiver of certain customary mutual\nclosing conditions, including (i) the approval of the Stronghold Transaction proposal by the holders of\nStronghold common stock, (ii) the absence of any governmental order or law that makes consummation of the\nStronghold Transaction illegal or otherwise prohibited, (iii) receipt of certain approvals and consents from\nspecified governmental entities, including, if applicable, the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting\nperiod under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, (iv) the effectiveness of a registration\nstatement on Form F-4, pursuant to which the Company’s common shares to be issued in connection with the\nStronghold Transaction are registered with the SEC and (v) the authorization for listing of the Company’s\ncommon shares to be issued in connection with the Stronghold Transaction on the TSX and Nasdaq, subject to\ncustomary conditions and official notice of issuance. The obligation of each party to consummate the\nStronghold Transaction is also conditioned upon, among other things, (1) the other party’s representations\nand warranties being true and correct (subject to applicable materiality and de minimis standards), (2) the\nother party having performed in all material respects its obligations required to be performed by it under the\nMerger Agreement at or prior to the effective time, (3) the absence of a material adverse effect on the other\nparty and (4) certain conditions pertaining to Stronghold’s mining facilities. There can be no assurance as to\nwhen these conditions will be satisfied or waived, if at all, or that other events will not intervene to delay or\nresult in the failure to complete the Stronghold Transaction.\n56 Page\nBITFARMS LTD.\nManagement’s Discussion & Analysis\n(In U.S. dollars, except where otherwise indicated)\n19. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nThere is no assurance when or if the Stronghold Transaction will be completed, and regulatory approvals\nmay not be received, may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are not presently\nanticipated or cannot be met. (Continued)\nStronghold and the Company have each agreed to, promptly following the execution of the Merger\nAgreement, prepare and file certain filings, submissions and notices and obtain consents, orders and approvals\nnecessary to complete the Stronghold Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger\nAgreement. No assurance can be given that the required consents, orders and approvals will be obtained or\nthat the required conditions to the completion of the Stronghold Transaction will be satisfied and an adverse\ndevelopment in either party’s regulatory standing or other factors could result in an inability to obtain one or\nmore of the required regulatory approvals or delay receipt of required approvals. Even if all such consents,\norders and approvals are obtained and such conditions are satisfied, no assurance can be given as to the\nterms, conditions and timing of such consents, orders and approvals. For example, these consents, orders and\napprovals may impose conditions on or require divestitures relating to the divisions, operations or assets of\nStronghold and the Company or may impose requirements, limitations or costs or place restrictions on the\nconduct of Stronghold’s or the Company’s business, and if such consents, orders or approvals require an\nextended period of time to be obtained, such extended period of time could increase the chance that a\nmaterial adverse event occurs with respect to Stronghold or the Company. Such extended period of time also\nmay increase the chance that other adverse effects with respect to Stronghold or the Company could occur.\nEach party’s obligation to complete the Stronghold Transaction is also subject to the accuracy of the\nrepresentations and warranties of the other party (subject to certain qualifications and exceptions) and the\nperformance in all material respects of the other party’s covenants under the Merger Agreement. As a result\nof these conditions, the Company cannot provide assurance that the Stronghold Transaction will be completed\non the terms or timeline currently contemplated, or at all.\nThe market value of the Company’s common shares may decline as a result of the Stronghold Transaction\nThe market value of the Company’s common shares may decline as a result of the Stronghold Transaction if,\namong other things, the combined company is unable to achieve the expected growth in earnings or if the\ntransaction costs related to the Stronghold Transaction are greater than expected. The market value also may\ndecline if the combined company does not achieve the perceived benefits of the Stronghold Transaction as\nrapidly or to the extent anticipated by the market or if the effect of the Stronghold Transaction on the\ncombined company’s business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows is not consistent with the\nexpectations of financial or industry analysts.\nThe Company may be the target of securities class action and derivative lawsuits which could result in\nsubstantial costs and may delay or prevent the Stronghold Transaction from being completed\nSecurities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often brought against companies that have entered\ninto merger agreements. Even if the lawsuits are without merit, defending against these claims can result in\nsubstantial costs and divert management time and resources. Additionally, if a plaintiff is successful in\nobtaining an injunction prohibiting consummation of the Stronghold Transaction, then that injunction may\ndelay or prevent the Stronghold Transaction from being completed.\n57 Page\nBITFARMS LTD.\nManagement’s Discussion & Analysis\n(In U.S. dollars, except where otherwise indicated)\n19. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nThe announcement and pendency of the Stronghold Transaction could adversely affect the Company’s\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe announcement and pendency of the Stronghold Transaction could adversely affect the Company’s\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition and could cause disruptions in and create uncertainty\nsurrounding the Company’s business, including affecting the Company’s relationships with its existing and\nfuture business partners, suppliers and employees, which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition, regardless of whether the Stronghold Transaction is\ncompleted.\nIf the Stronghold Transaction is not completed, the trading prices of the Company’s common shares may fall to\nthe extent that the current prices reflect a market assumption that the Stronghold Transaction will be\ncompleted. In addition, the failure to complete the Stronghold Transaction may result in negative publicity or a\nnegative impression of Stronghold and/or the Company in the investment community and may affect the\nCompany’s relationship with employees, suppliers and other partners in the business community.\nThe Company will incur substantial transaction fees and costs in connection with the Stronghold\nTransaction.\nThe Company has incurred and expects to incur additional material non-recurring expenses in connection with\nthe Stronghold Transaction and completion of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,\nincluding costs relating to obtaining required approvals. The Company has incurred significant legal, advisory\nand financial services fees in connection with the process of negotiating and evaluating the terms of the\nStronghold Transaction. Additional significant unanticipated costs may be incurred in the course of\ncoordinating the businesses of Stronghold and the Company after completion of the Stronghold Transaction.\nEven if the Stronghold Transaction is not completed, the Company will be required to pay certain costs relating\nto the Stronghold Transaction incurred prior to the date the Stronghold Transaction was abandoned, such as\nlegal, accounting, financial advisory, filing and printing fees. Such costs may be significant and could have an\nadverse effect on the Company’s future results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nSignificant demands will be placed on the Company as a result of the Stronghold Transaction.\nSignificant demands will be placed on the Company as a result of the Stronghold Transaction and the Company\nhas expended, and continues to expend, significant management resources in an effort to complete the\nStronghold Transaction, which are being diverted from the Company’s day-to-day operations. In addition, as a\nresult of the completion of the Stronghold Transaction, significant demands will be placed on the managerial,\noperational and financial personnel and systems of the Company. The Company cannot assure that their\nsystems, procedures and controls will be adequate to support the expansion of operations following and\nresulting from the Stronghold Transaction. The future operating results of the combined company will be\naffected by the ability of its officers and key employees to manage changing business conditions and to\nimplement and expand its operational and financial controls and reporting systems in response to the\nStronghold Transaction.\n58 Page\nBITFARMS LTD.\nManagement’s Discussion & Analysis\n(In U.S. dollars, except where otherwise indicated)\n19. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nWhile the Merger Agreement is in effect, the Company and its respective subsidiaries’ businesses are\nsubject to restrictions on its business activities.\nUnder the Merger Agreement, the Company is subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of its business\nand generally must operate its business in the ordinary course prior to completing the Stronghold Transaction\n(unless the Company obtains Stronghold’s written consent, which is not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed\nor conditioned), which may restrict the Company’s ability to exercise certain of its business strategies. These\nrestrictions may prevent the Company from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities, making\ncertain investments or acquisitions, selling assets, engaging in capital expenditures in excess of certain agreed\nlimits or incurring indebtedness prior to the completion of the Stronghold Transaction or termination of the\nMerger Agreement, as applicable. These restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Company’s\nbusinesses, financial results, financial condition or share price.\nExcept in specified circumstances, if the Stronghold Transaction is not completed by May 21, 2025, subject\nto extension in specified circumstances, either Stronghold or the Company may choose not to proceed with\nthe Stronghold Transaction.\nExcept in specified circumstances, if the Stronghold Transaction is not completed by May 21, 2025, subject to\nextension in specified circumstances, either Stronghold or the Company may choose not to proceed with the\nStronghold Transaction.\nEither Stronghold or the Company may terminate the Merger Agreement if the Stronghold Transaction has not\nbeen completed by 5:00 p.m. New York, New York time, on May 21, 2025. However, this right to terminate the\nMerger Agreement will not be available to Stronghold or the Company if the failure of such party to perform\nany of its obligations under the Merger Agreement has been the principal cause of or resulted in the failure of\nthe Stronghold Transaction to be complete on or before such time.\nThe termination of the Merger Agreement could negatively impact the Company and, in certain\ncircumstances, could require Stronghold or the Company to pay certain termination fees.\n59 Page\nBITFARMS LTD.\nManagement’s Discussion & Analysis\n(In U.S. dollars, except where otherwise indicated)\n19. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nThe termination of the Merger Agreement could negatively Impact the Company and, in certain\ncircumstances, could require Stronghold or the Company to pay certain termination fees.\nThe Merger Agreement is subject to a number of customary closing conditions that must be fulfilled in order\nto complete the Stronghold Transaction and contains certain termination rights for both Stronghold and the\nCompany, which, if exercised, would result in the Stronghold Transaction not being completed. If the\nStronghold merger is not completed for any reason, including as a result of Stronghold stockholders failing to\napprove the Stronghold Transaction proposal or if the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its\nterms, the ongoing business of the Company may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the\nanticipated benefits of having completed the Stronghold Transaction, the Company would be subject to a\nnumber of risks, including the following:\n• the Company may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including a decline of its\nshare price (which may reflect a market assumption that the Stronghold Transaction will be\ncompleted);\n• the Company may experience negative reactions from or irreparable reputational harm as perceived\nby the Company’s investment community, suppliers, peers regulators, employees, partners in the\nbusiness community and any other third party whether presently known or unknown; and\n• the Company may experience a material adverse effect on the Company’s businesses, operations,\nearnings and financial results.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated under circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement, Stronghold\nmay be required to pay the Company a termination fee of $5,000,000 and the Company may be required to\npay Stronghold a reverse termination fee of $12,500,000 (minus the amount of the deposit, as defined in the\nPanther Creek Hosting Agreement between Stronghold and the Company dated September 12, 2024, held by\nStronghold and not yet returned to the Company under the Panther Creek Hosting Agreement as of the date\nof the termination of the Merger Agreement, such deposit amount being up to a maximum of $5,000,000), in\nthe form of cash and/or Bitcoin (at the election of the Company), depending on the circumstances surrounding\nthe termination. There is no guarantee that Stronghold or the Company will have sufficient funds to make\nthese contractually required payments to the other party, as applicable.\n60 Page\nBITFARMS LTD.\nManagement’s Discussion & Analysis\n(In U.S. dollars, except where otherwise indicated)\n19. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nThe combined company may not realized all of the anticipated benefits of the Stronghold Transaction.\nThe combined company may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the Stronghold Transactions even if\nBitfarms believes that the Stronghold Transaction will provide benefits to the combined company. However,\nthere is a risk that some or all of the expected benefits of the Stronghold Transaction may fail to materialize,\nor may not occur within the time periods anticipated by Bitfarms. The realization of such benefits may be\naffected by a number of factors, including regulatory considerations and decisions, many of which are beyond\nthe control of Bitfarms and Stronghold. The challenge of coordinating previously independent businesses\nmakes evaluating the business and future financial prospects of the combined company following the\nStronghold Transaction difficult. Stronghold and Bitfarms have operated and, until completion of the merger,\nwill continue to operate, independently. The success of the Stronghold Transaction, including anticipated\nbenefits and cost savings, will depend, in part, on the ability to successfully integrate the operations of both\ncompanies. The past financial performance of each of Stronghold and Bitfarms may not be indicative of their\nfuture financial performance. Realization of the anticipated benefits in the Stronghold Transaction will\ndepend, in part, on the combined company’s ability to successfully integrate Stronghold and Bitfarms’\nbusinesses. The combined company will be required to devote significant management attention and\nresources to integrating its business practices and support functions. The diversion of management’s attention\nand any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the Stronghold Transaction and the coordination\nof the two companies’ operations could have an adverse effect on the business, financial results, financial\ncondition or the share price of the combined company following the Stronghold Transaction. The coordination\nprocess may also result in additional and unforeseen expenses.\nFailure to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the Stronghold Transaction may impact the financial\nperformance of the combined company and the price of the combined company’s common shares.\n61 Page\nBITFARMS LTD.\nManagement’s Discussion & Analysis\n(In U.S. dollars, except where otherwise indicated)\n19. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nIn connection with the Stronghold Transaction, the consolidated indebtedness of the Company may increase\nsubstantially, including with respect to the satisfaction or assumption of the outstanding obligations under\nStronghold’s credit agreement, and the increased level of indebtedness following the completion of the\nStronghold Transaction could adversely affect the Company after the Stronghold Transaction, including by\ndecreasing its business flexibility and by impacting its ability to raise additional capital and to meet its\nobligations under its indebtedness.\nWith the Stronghold Transaction, the consolidated indebtedness of the Company may increase substantially,\nincluding with respect to the satisfaction or assumption of the outstanding obligations under Stronghold’s\ncredit agreement, and the increased level of indebtedness following the completion of the Stronghold\nTransaction could adversely affect the Company after the Stronghold Transaction, including by decreasing its\nbusiness flexibility and by impacting its ability to raise additional capital and to meet its obligations under its\nindebtedness.\nThe Merger Agreement provides that, to the extent requested by the Company, Stronghold will, at the\nCompany’s expense, use reasonable best efforts to promptly obtain any consents or amendments as\nnecessary to permit the consummation of the Stronghold Transaction under Stronghold’s credit agreement\n(the “COC Amendment”), but the obtaining of the COC Amendment is not a closing condition to the\nStronghold Transaction. If the COC Amendment is not obtained on or prior to closing, the Company will be\nrequired to satisfy all outstanding obligations under such credit agreement and certain other debt instruments\nof Stronghold prior to or substantially concurrently with the consummation of the Stronghold Transaction,\nwhich could reduce funds available for capital expenditures and other activities of the Company. If the COC\nAmendment is obtained on or prior to closing, the Company may assume an estimated $50 million of\noutstanding net debt of Stronghold, which could have the effect of, among other things, reducing the\nCompany’s flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions.\nIn addition, any incurrence of additional indebtedness, including in connection with the satisfaction or\nassumption of outstanding obligations under Stronghold’s credit agreement or other indebtedness the\nCompany assumes in connection with the Stronghold Transaction, could have important consequences for the\npost-Stronghold Transaction Company’s creditors and its shareholders. For example, it could limit the\nCompany’s ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service\nrequirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; restrict the Company from making\nstrategic acquisitions or cause the Company to make non-strategic divestitures; restrict the Company from\npaying dividends to its shareholders; increase the Company’s vulnerability to general economic and industry\nconditions; and require a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of\nprincipal and interest on the Company’s indebtedness, thereby reducing the Company’s ability to use cash\nflows to fund its operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities. Any increased levels of\nindebtedness following completion of the Stronghold Transaction and corresponding increased demands on\nthe Company’s cash resources may create competitive disadvantages for the Company relative to other\ncompanies with lower debt levels.\n62 Page\nBITFARMS LTD.\nManagement’s Discussion & Analysis\n(In U.S. dollars, except where otherwise indicated)\n19. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nInvestors in the Company’s common shares may suffer dilution as a result of the Stronghold Transaction and\nother issuances of the Company’s securities.\nInvestors in the Company’s common shares may suffer dilution as a result of the Stronghold Transaction and\nother issuances of the Company’s securities. The number of common shares that the Company is authorized to\nissue is unlimited. The Company will, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, issue up to approximately\n66,071,717 common shares, and may, in its sole discretion, as part of future offerings, issue additional\ncommon shares and/or securities convertible into or exercisable for common shares from time to time subject\nto the rules of any applicable stock exchange on which the common shares are then listed and applicable\nsecurities law. The Company cannot predict the size or price of future issuances of common shares or the size\nor terms of future issuances of debt instruments or other securities convertible into common shares, or the\neffect, if any, that such future issuances and sales will have on the market price of the common shares. The\nissuance of any additional common shares and/or securities convertible into or exercisable for common shares\nmay have a dilutive effect on the interests of holders of the Company’s common shares.\nThe Company currently qualifies as an “emerging growth company”; however, the Company will cease to\nqualify as such as of December 31, 2024, and will be required to comply with the auditor attestation\nrequirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nBitfarms currently qualifies as an “emerging growth company”; however, Bitfarms will cease to qualify as such\nas of December 31, 2024, and will be required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section\n404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nBitfarms is an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012, and\nhas been able to take advantage of certain exemptions and relief from various reporting requirements that are\napplicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. In particular, as an emerging\ngrowth company, Bitfarms has not been required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of\nSection 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”). However, Bitfarms will cease to\nqualify as an emerging growth company as of December 31, 2024.\nOnce Bitfarms no longer qualifies as an emerging growth company, the exemption from the auditor\nattestation report requirements under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act will no longer apply. Any\ntesting by Bitfarms conducted in connection with Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or the subsequent\ntesting by Bitfarms’ independent registered public accounting firm conducted in connection with Section\n404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, may reveal deficiencies in Bitfarms’ internal control over financial reporting\nthat are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to\nBitfarms’ financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Any material\nweaknesses in internal controls could cause investors to lose confidence in Bitfarms’ reported financial\ninformation, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of Bitfarms common shares. In addition,\npreparation of the auditor’s attestation report and the cost of compliance with reporting requirements that\nBitfarms has not previously implemented have increased, and will continue to increase, Bitfarms’ expenses\nand require significant management time, and investors may find Bitfarms common shares less attractive\nbecause of the additional compliance costs, which could have a negative impact on the trading price of\nBitfarms common shares.\n63 Page\nBITFARMS LTD.\nManagement’s Discussion & Analysis\n(In U.S. dollars, except where otherwise indicated)\n19. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nThe Company’s business could be negatively impacted by unsolicited investor interest, takeover proposals,\nshareholder activism or proxy contests relating to the election of directors.\nBitfarms’ business could be negatively impacted by unsolicited investor interest, takeover proposals,\nshareholder activism or proxy contests relating to the election of directors.\nOn April 22, 2024, Bitfarms received an unsolicited proposal from Riot to acquire 100% of the issued and\noutstanding common shares of Bitfarms (the “Unsolicited Proposal”). A special committee of the Board,\nconsisting solely of independent directors (the “Bitfarms Special Committee”), considered the Unsolicited\nProposal and determined it significantly undervalued Bitfarms and its growth prospects. On June 24, 2024, the\nUnsolicited Proposal was withdrawn; however, Riot requisitioned a special meeting of Bitfarms shareholders\n(the “Bitfarms Special Meeting”) for the purpose of replacing a majority of the Board with three of its\nnominees and initiated a hearing before the Capital Markets Tribunal of the Ontario Securities Commission.\nOn September 3, 2024, Riot amended its requisition, instead seeking to replace two members of the Board\nwith two of its nominees at the Bitfarms Special Meeting and also threatened litigation.\nOn September 23, 2024, Bitfarms entered into a settlement agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) with\nRiot, pursuant to which, among other things, Riot agreed to withdraw its June 24, 2024 requisition and to\naccept customary standstill provisions through Bitfarms’ 2026 annual meeting, subject to certain exceptions,\nand Bitfarms agreed to make certain changes to its Board, including the resignation of an existing director, the\nappointment of a nominee of the investor to the Board and and the governance and nominating and\ncompensation committees of the Board, and to seek approval from the Bitfarms shareholders at the Bitfarms\nSpecial Meeting to, among other things, expand the Board from five to six members and elect an independent\ndirector nominated by the Board to serve as the sixth member of the Board. Bitfarms also provided Riot with\ncertain rights (subject to certain exceptions) to purchase shares of Bitfarms, provided the investor holds 15%\nor more of the outstanding Bitfarms common shares.\nThe events surrounding the Unsolicited Proposal, Bitfarms Special Meeting, Settlement Agreement and related\ncircumstances and Bitfarms’ responses thereto required significant time and attention by Bitfarms’\nmanagement team and Board and required Bitfarms to incur significant legal and advisory fees and expenses.\nIn the future, similar actions taken by third parties, including unsolicited takeover proposals, the initiation of\nproxy contests and litigation by adverse parties could disrupt Bitfarms’ business, distract Bitfarms from efforts\nto improve its business, cause Bitfarms to incur substantial additional expenses, create perceived uncertainties\nas to Bitfarms’ future direction and result in significant fluctuations in the price of Bitfarms common shares, all\nof which could harm Bitfarms’ business and materially and adversely affect its results of operations.\nNoise Pollution and Community Opposition\nThe Company’s Mining operations involve the use of a large numbers of high-powered Miners and cooling\nsystems that generate significant noise. This noise can pose several risks to the Company’s business including\ncommunity complaints, reputational damage, litigation risk, regulatory risk, operational constraints, increased\ncosts and opposition to expansion. These risks could lead to fines or penalties imposed by local governments,\nrequirements to implement costly noise mitigation measures, restrictions on the Company’s operating hours,\nreduction of scale of the Company’s operations, stricter noise controls regulations on the Company’s\noperations, potential shutdown of data centers that cannot meet local noise regulations, damages resulting\nfrom lawsuits and difficulty obtaining necessary permits and approvals for expanding existing data centers or\nestablishing new site operations. While the Company strives to be a good corporate citizen and mitigate noise\nimpacts where possible, the inherently noisy nature of large-scale cryptocurrency Mining operations presents\nongoing risks to the Company’s business that may negatively affect its financial condition and results of\noperations.\n64 Page\nBITFARMS LTD.\nManagement’s Discussion & Analysis\n(In U.S. dollars, except where otherwise indicated)\n20.

GLOSSARY OF TERMS\nTerms Definition\nArtificial A branch of technology enabling computers and machines to replicate human-like\nIntelligence (AI) abilities, including learning, understanding, problem-solving, decision-making,\ncreativity, and autonomous action.\nASIC ASIC stands for Application Specific Integrated Circuit and refers primarily to specific\ncomputer devices designed to solve the SHA-256 algorithm.\nBitcoin (BTC) BTC is a decentralized digital currency that is not controlled by any centralized\nauthority (e.g., a government, financial institution or regulatory organization) that can\nbe sent from user to user on the Bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries\nto clear transactions. Transactions are verified through the process of Mining and\nrecorded in a public ledger known as the Blockchain. BTC is created when the Bitcoin\nnetwork issues Block Rewards through the Mining process.\nBlock Reward A Bitcoin Block Reward refers to the new BTC that are awarded by the Blockchain\nnetwork to eligible cryptocurrency Miners for each block they successfully mine. The\ncurrent block reward is 3.125 BTC per block.\nBlockchain A Blockchain is a cloud-based public ledger that exists on computers that participate on\nthe network globally. The Blockchain grows as new sets of data, or 'blocks', are added\nto it through Mining. Each block contains a timestamp and a link to the previous block,\nsuch that the series of blocks form a continuous chain. Given that each block has a\nseparate hash and each hash requires information from the previous block, altering\ninformation an established block would require recalculating all the hashes on the\nBlockchain which would require an enormous and impracticable amount of computing\npower. As a result, once a block is added to the Blockchain it is very difficult to edit and\nimpossible to delete.\nExahash or EH/s One quintillion (1,000,000,000,000,000,000) hashes or one million Terahash per\nsecond.\nHash A hash is a function that converts or maps an input of letters and numbers into an\nencrypted output of a fixed length, which outputs are often referred to as hashes.\nA hash is created using an algorithm. The algorithm used in the validation of Bitcoin\ntransactions is the SHA-256 algorithm.\nHashrate Hashrate refers to the number of hash operations performed per second and is a\nmeasure of computing power in Mining cryptocurrency.\nHashrate Under Hashrate from the Miners the Company owns and from Miners hosted and managed\nManagement by the Company.\nHigh Performance Advanced computing capability that allows for rapid data processing and complex\nComputing (HPC) calculations at exceptionally high speeds, essential for handling large datasets and\ncomplex computational tasks.\nHosting A service in which a company provides infrastructure, power, and cooling solutions to\nhouse and operate cryptocurrency mining equipment owned by clients.\nMegawatt or MW A megawatt is 1,000 kilowatts of electricity and, in the industry of cryptocurrency\nMining, is typically a reference to the number of megawatts of electricity per hour that\nis available for use.\nMiners ASICs used by the Company to perform Mining.\n68 Page\nBITFARMS LTD.\nManagement’s Discussion & Analysis\n(In U.S. dollars, except where otherwise indicated)\n25. GLOSSARY OF TERMS (Continued)\nTerms Definition\nMining Mining refers to the process of using specialized computer hardware, and in the case of\nthe Company, ASICs, to perform mathematical calculations to confirm transactions and\nincrease security for the BTC Blockchain. As a reward for their services, Bitcoin Miners\ncollect transaction fees for the transactions they confirm, along with newly created BTC\nas Block Rewards.\nMining Pool A Mining Pool is a group of cryptocurrency Miners who pool their computational\nresources, or Hashrate, in order to increase the probability of finding a block on the\nBTC Blockchain. Mining Pools administer regular payouts to mitigate the risk of Miners\noperating for a prolonged period of time without finding a block.\nNetwork Difficulty Network Difficulty is a unitless measure of how difficult it is to find a hash below a\ngiven target. The Bitcoin network protocol automatically adjusts Network Difficulty by\nchanging the target every 2,016 blocks hashed based on the time it took for the total\ncomputing power used in Bitcoin Mining to solve the previous 2,016 blocks such that\nthe average time to solve each block is ten minutes.\nNetwork Hashrate Network Hashrate refers to the total global hashrate (and related computing power)\nused in Mining for a given cryptocurrency.\nPetahash or PH/s One quadrillion (1,000,000,000,000,000) hashes or one thousand Terahash per second.\nSHA-256 SHA stands for Secure Hash Algorithm. The SHA-256 algorithm was designed by the US\nNational Security Agency and is the cryptographic hash function used within the Bitcoin\nnetwork to validate transactions on the Bitcoin Blockchain.\nSynthetic HODL Synthetic HODL is the Company’s use of financial instruments to generate BTC\nexposure with inherent risk management, capital efficiency and leverage\ncharacteristics.\nTerahash or TH/s One trillion (1,000,000,000,000) hashes or one Terahash per second.\n69 Page"

This involved upgrading nearly\nour entire fleet of miners across, at the time, our 11 data centers. We had always planned for 2024\nto be a transformational year, but we underestimated just how transformational it would be. Year-\nto-date so far in 2024, we’ve:\n• Upgraded 10 data centers and added 3 new data centers to our portfolio,\n• Unracked over 50,000 older gen miners and racked over 46,000 new miners,\n• Increased our hashrate by 83% to 11.9 EH/s today\n• Improved our efficiency by 40% from 35 w/TH to 21 w/TH, reaching our year-end efficiency\ngoal three months ahead of schedule, and, most importantly\n• Significantly grew our MW pipeline from 324 MW today to 950+ MW by year-end 2025 with a\nmulti-year growth potential up to 1.6 GW\nThese numbers speak volumes to our accomplishments and the commitment of our global team to\ngrow the company and drive improved performance. In addition to these tremendous quantitative\nimprovements, we announced our acquisition of Stronghold Digital Mining, which is the largest\nacquisition between two public companies in the BTC mining sector yet, and we significantly\nenhanced our Board of Directors and Leadership team.\n2\n2\nTurning to slide 5:\nOn our Q2 earnings call in August, I outlined several goals and initiatives as Bitfarms new CEO.\nThese included:\n1. First, the continued diversification of our portfolio, beyond Bitcoin mining. The aim here is\nto maximize the utility of our strongest asset, our MWs, in the most efficient and cost-\neffective way possible by expanding into high-growth and high-value geographies and into\nsynergistic business lines, such as hosting, HPC/AI, heat recapture and recycling, and\nenergy generation.\n2. Second. A strong focus on U.S. expansion, particularly in the PJM region, which we\nidentified as the most attractive energy market in the U.S., and\n3. Third, building out an even stronger bench of operators & introducing a new organizational\nstructure in order to evaluate, plan, and execute on the significant opportunity with HPC/AI\n& the upcoming anticipated bitcoin bull run.\nI am pleased to say that over the past 3 months, we’ve made significant progress on each of our\ngoals & laid a strong foundation to execute our growth strategy. I’ll now dive into the Q3 operational\nupdate and talk through several strategic actions we’ve taken this quarter with these goals in mind.\nTurning to slide 6:\n3\n3\nIn line with the first and second initiatives regarding continued diversification of our portfolio and\nexpansion in the U.S:\nIn Q3 we entered into an agreement to acquire Stronghold Digital Mining. This transformative\ncombination ensures a multi-year strategic growth path that we are incredibly excited about. With\nthis acquisition, we are:\n- Integrating vertically by acquiring 2 strategically located power facilities in Pennsylvania,\n- Expanding and rebalancing our portfolio with over 300 MW of U.S. power capacity with the\npotential to increase our energy portfolio to over 950 MW by year-end 2025 & 1.6 GW in the\nnext few years,\n- Creating energy trading and demand response opportunities to minimize energy prices, and\n- Lastly, creating an opportunity to cost-effectively integrate HPC/AI into our portfolio with a\nmerged HPC/AI and BTC mining data center.\nTurning to slide 7:\n4\n4\nUpon closing, the expected 307 MW available at these two locations would drive a 47% increase in\nour 2025 YE megawatts from 648 MW to over 950 MW. Including our Sharon, PA site, the\ncombination of these three sites creates a PJM portfolio of approximately 427 MW in 2025 which is\nlarger than our entire operational energy portfolio today. Importantly, these sites rebalance our\nportfolio back to the US and North America representing 47% and 65% of our year-end 2025\nportfolio, respectively, while LATAM exposure will scale down to 35%, significantly improving the\nsize, quality and distribution of our energy portfolio.\nWe have already begun maximizing the utility of the Stronghold sites with two hosting agreements,\neach for 10,000 miners. These 20,000 miners, initially scheduled for deployment in our Iguazu\nfacility, are being deployed in Pennsylvania at Stronghold’s Panther Creek and Scrubgrass\nfacilities, supporting approximately 4 EH/s. Redirecting these miners reduces our logistics, duties,\nsetup, and energy costs, driving a more optimal deployment and providing a pathway for continued\nprofitable growth. With these two hosting deals, we anticipate that nearly 75% of our hashrate will\ncome from our North American data centers in the first half of next year – re-affirming our\ncommitment to grow in the U.S. In addition, we continue to actively pursue other site acquisitions\nand growth opportunities in the U.S.\nTurning to slide 8:\n5\n5\nIn line with our third initiative to strengthen our leadership team: We made significant progress by\nexpanding our bench and reorganizing our operational structure in order to position ourselves for\ncontinued growth in 2025. Reflecting our commitment to operational excellence, we’ve recruited\nnumerous industry experts with the following leadership appointments:\n- Liam Wilson as our Chief Operating Officer, a newly created role,\n- Alex Brammer, who replaces me in Mining Operations as Senior Vice President,\n- Benoit Gobeil, promoted from EVP of Operations and Infrastructure, as Chief Infrastructure\nOfficer, And\n- Rachel Silverstein as General Counsel, a newly created role as part of our emphasis on\ngrowing in the U.S.\nIn addition, we reorganized our operations into two divisions, mining operations and infrastructure,\nwith Alex and Benoit heading up the divisions, respectively. These new divisions are already\ndelivering greater scalability and accountability in data center construction, maintenance and\noperations and are laying the foundation for the establishment of HPC/AI operations.\nWith these hires, we are laying an even stronger operational foundation, enabling us to execute our\ngrowth plan.\nTurning to slide 9:\n6\n6\nIn addition, we enhanced our corporate governance and strengthened our Board of Directors. With\nthe appointment of two new directors, including myself, and with former Lead Director Brian\nHowlett now serving as our Board Chair, our Board of Directors now consists of 5 members, 4 of\nwhom are independent. With the upcoming Special Shareholder Meeting scheduled to take place\nnext week on the 20th, the board is expected to increase to 6 board members with 5 independents,\nsubject to shareholder approval.\nOn a related note, in Q3 we were able to reach a settlement agreement with RIOT Platforms. which\nwe believe is in the best interest of the Company and our shareholders. Importantly, this mutually\nbeneficial agreement allows us to move forward as an independent company and to execute our\ngrowth strategy avoiding a costly and distracting proxy contest. RIOT remains a shareholder of\nBitfarms with current ownership of just under 20%. Analysts have noted that Bitfarms shares\nprovide good value and significant upside to BTC price relative to peers, and RIOT remaining a top\nshareholder is a positive market signal underscoring the value and potential of our growth.\nTurning to slide 10:\n7\n7\nI will now take a few minutes to discuss our guidance.\nWhile we are now at 11.9 EH/s we are behind schedule on delivering our mid-year 12 EH/s target for\nthe following reasons:\n• First, we had some minor construction delays at several sites that have been overcome but\ndelayed energization by weeks or a few months.\n• second, over the past few months, we’ve experienced shipping delays and extended miner\nwarranty servicing that goes beyond the 2,700 miners replaced a few months ago. Despite\nimprovements in recent miner shipments, continued warranty servicing has impeded the\nachievement of our hash rate target.\nWe’ve been working closely with Bitmain to address these issues and are implementing an efficient\nsolution. We will be upgrading the remaining 18,853 Bitmain T21 miners to be delivered by Bitmain\nas part of our fleet refresh announced last year. Bitmain will now be sending 18,853 more powerful\nand efficient S21 Pro miners, operating at 234 TH and 15 w/TH, representing more than a 20%\nimprovement from the T21 miners in both energy efficiency and hashrate. This capitally efficient\nupgrade allows us to expeditiously upgrade the remaining miners to be delivered for better\nperformance with minimal impact on our cash, while preserving the full upside of the Bitcoin.\nWhile all of the miners are scheduled to ship before the end of the year, this significant upgrade\nand continued RMA servicing will push our YE target of 21 EH/s into H1 2025. It will also improve\nour energy efficiency by an additional 10% from 21 w/TH to 19 w/TH. The majority of the upgraded\nminers will be deployed in Pennsylvania and Quebec. Amidst the backdrop of rapidly improving\n8\n8\nmacro conditions, we believe this is a rare opportunity to upgrade miners for better performance\nbefore miner prices increase.\nTurning to slide 11:\nLooking ahead to 2025: Demand for immediate capacity for both HPC/AI and Bitcoin data centers\nis surging, and turnkey assets are highly sought after. Data center development continues to\naccelerate, driving power scarcity and making access to power very valuable. KKR estimates that\n$250B will be spent annually on the data center boom. The U.S. is the biggest developer of data\ncenters, consuming about 16 to 18 GW of power, compared to about 6 GWs each in Europe & Asia.\nKKR’s global head of digital infrastructure believes over the next 3-4 years that the 18 GWs could\ndouble, if not triple.\nWe have just over 500 MW of secured power and infrastructure for 2025, which represents one of\nthe largest portfolios of flexible MWs amongst any publicly traded miners. This gives us\nunparalleled flexibility to approach this bull market and take advantage of strategic opportunities.\nWith this in mind, we’ve taken important steps to ensure we are getting the best value from our\nassets.\nFirst, we have changed our deployment plans by reallocating the miners from Iguazu to the US with\nthe Stronghold hosting agreements. In doing so we have freed up the 200 MW at the Iguazu site\nentirely and have applied for a delay in energization 60 days to March 1, 2025 in line with the\ncontract. With 200 MW of cost-effective, high uptime, renewable energy and new infrastructure\n9\n9\nIguazu is a marque asset going into a Bitcoin bull market that is capable of producing\napproximately 15 EH/s if filled with the latest S21 XP miners. Management is currently evaluating\nall strategic options to best monetize this site.\nSecond, in Q3 we assumed control of our site in Sharon, Pennsylvania. This is a 120 MW site\nstrategically located in the PJM interconnection market, providing access to low-cost, flexible\npower. The site is very well-suited for both Bitcoin mining and HPC/AI, and we are currently\nevaluating the best way to monetize these MW.\nThird, and as discussed a few minutes ago, we acquired high-value MW in Pennsylvania through\nStronghold. Of the 307 MW available in 2025, these sites are currently contracted to utilize\napproximately 100 MW for hosting, and we are evaluating the best way to monetize the remaining\n200 MW.\nWe now have sufficient MW capacity to go well beyond the previously guided 35EH at year-end\n2025. However, as we continue to refine our 2025 plans and actively rework around Bitcoin mining\nand HPC/AI, we believe it would be premature to maintain the 35 EH/s guidance. We will issue\nupdated guidance once these strategies are finalized.\nTurning to slide 12:\nWe own and operate a portfolio of high-quality energy assets that are monetized through Bitcoin\nmining. At Bitfarms, we are not growing hashrate at any cost – we are focused on getting the best\nutilization and driving the maximum value of our energy assets for our shareholders. When we take\na step back and look at how we do this, we believe that a combination of self-mining, hosting,\n10\n10\nenergy trading, and HPC/AI creates a more powerful and resilient portfolio. We’re conducting a\nthorough evaluation of all of our energy assets, looking at a host of different metrics, both\nqualitative and quantitative, to determine which sites would be best suited for which activities.\nThat said, we’re pleased to announce that we have two different US sites for a 1 to 2 MW HPC/AI\npilot. While still in early stages, we have the land and power secured at both sites and are in active\nconversations with potential partners and suppliers discussing potential accelerated deployment\nin 2025, and are currently in the process of finalizing terms, equipment, plans and budgets.\nWe believe both of these sites are well-suited for development for a number of reasons:\n- First, they are well-located a few hours from major metropolitan centers, on major fiber\ntrunk lines and in or near data center clusters.\n- Second, the power is secured and cost effective, with high uptime and no curtailment\nrequirements, and\n- Third, the land is cleared and ready for accelerated construction.\nWe believe that initiating work at a pilot site will allow us to prudently and cost-effectively evaluate\nthis significant opportunity and to get a firm handle on the space, technology, and infrastructure\nbefore committing a significant amount of capital on a larger HPC/AI site. This pilot reinforces our\ncommitment to diversifying beyond BTC mining and is an important first step into an exciting new\nbusiness line. We expect to provide an update on our progress in 2025.\nTurning to slide 13:\n11\n11\nBefore I turn the call over to Jeff, I want to reiterate the significance of what we’ve accomplished\nover the past 10 months. We’ve refreshed nearly our entire fleet of miners, significantly improved\nour mining economics, built from the ground up a 70 MW state-of-the-art data center, acquired\nthree new sites in the U.S., embarked on an HPC/AI strategy, and completely revamped our\noperational structure and strengthened our leadership team. We are now uniquely positioned with\na strategic pipeline of over 950 MW in 2025 with nearly half a gigawatt of power infrastructure that\nis highly flexible, representing a massive, secured, and cost-effective growth opportunity as we\nenter into the anticipated 2025 Bitcoin bull cycle.\nWe are now a stronger company, with a significantly expanded energy portfolio with up to 1.6GWs\navailable over the coming years, and we are well equipped to take advantage of the significant\nopportunities in front of us. It’s an exciting time in the Bitcoin industry on the heels of the election\nand with BTC hitting new record highs and I have never been more excited or confident in our\ngrowth prospects and our ability to execute.\nTurning to slide 14, I’ll now turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeff Lucas\nThanks Ben, and thanks everyone for joining us today. I will provide an overview of our Q3 financial\nperformance and position. Turning now to slide 15, let’s start with Q3 results.\nDuring the quarter, we earned 703 Bitcoin, 14% more than the 614 Bitcoin mined during the second\nquarter. The increase is driven by the 54% growth in our average hashrate from 6.7 EH/s in 2Q to\n12\n12\n10.3 EH/s in 3Q, which more than offset the impact of the April 2024 Halving and a 3% increase in\nthe average network hashrate quarter over quarter.\nTotal revenue was $45 million in the third quarter, a $3 million, or 8%, increase from the second\nquarter and a 30% increase year-over-year. Revenue from our mining activities was $43 million\ncompared to $40 million in the prior quarter, an increase of over 7%. The balance of the revenue\nwas earned by our electrical subsidiary, Volta, which provides commercial services in addition to\ncost-effectively supporting our data center operating activities.\nGeneral and Administrative, or G&A, expense, excluding non-cash stock-based compensation and\nthe second quarter Canadian sales tax refund, was $22 million in comparison to $11 million in the\nprior quarter. The $11million increase is due largely to one-time nonrecurring costs which totaled\n$12 million in the quarter and accounted for $9 million of the quarter over quarter increase. These\none-time nonrecurring charges included the Riot requisition, expenses associated with the\nsettlement of the employment dispute with the former CEO, and expenses associated with the\nacquisition of Stronghold and the Sharon, Pennsylvania site. The balance of the increase was due\nto higher compensation expense as the Company made several key management hires to build out\nour leadership team as well as higher insurance, duties and other expenses associated with the\nCompany’s growth .\nFor Q3, our operating loss was $44 million, up from $24 million in the second quarter, driven by the\nfactors I just referenced. This operating loss reflects non-cash depreciation expense of $29 million,\nincluding $10 million for accelerated depreciation on older miners, compared to the prior quarter\ndepreciation of $57 million, of which $46 million was accelerated depreciation .\nIn Q3, reported financial income and expense includes a $6-million-dollar non-cash gain on the\nrevaluation of the financial liability for warrants issued in earlier financings, compared to $1 million\nnon-cash loss on the revaluation of this financial liability in Q2. Under IFRS, we are required to\nrecognize a liability for these warrants, even though they cannot be settled for cash.\nNet loss for Q3 was $37 million, or a loss of $0.08 per share, compared to a net loss of $27 million,\nor a loss of $0.07 per share, in Q2.\nNow let’s turn our attention to operating performance and per-bitcoin metrics. Gross mining profit\nwas $17 million dollars, or 38% of mining revenue, down from $21 million, or 51% in the prior\nquarter. Our overall corporate electricity rate for the quarter was 4.7 cents/kWh, an increase from\n4.3 cents/kWh in the second quarter. The increase was driven largely by higher winter electricity\nrates in Argentina and a rate increase in Paraguay instituted at the beginning of the third quarter.\nImportantly, with our improvement in electrical efficiency from an average of 28 w/TH in 2Q to 23\nw/TH in 3Q, our electricity cost per terahash decreased over the quarter by 10% to 2.7 cents from\n3.0 cents per TH per day. I’ll add that in September we achieved our year-end target of 21 w/TH,\nthree months ahead of schedule which equates to about 2.4 cents per TH, an additional 11%\nreduction in electricity cost per terahash.\nOur direct mining cost per Bitcoin in the second quarter was $36,000. Our total cash cost to mine\nBTC was $52,400. And our revenue per Bitcoin was $61,000 , resulting in cash profit per Bitcoin of\nabout $8,500.\n13\n13\nTurning to slide 16:\nFor the third quarter, our Adjusted EBITDA was $6 million, or 14% of revenue, compared to $12\nmillion, or 28% of revenue, in 2Q. The lower Adjusted EBITDA largely reflected the impact of the\nHalving along with higher G&A expense associated with the expansion of our operating activities.\nAs we’ve noted in previous quarterly earnings calls, our Adjusted EBITDA is very straightforward,\nbeing purely a measure of the cash profitability of our mining operations and the profit contribution\nof our Volta subsidiary. e We do not reflect mark-to-market adjustments of our Bitcoin holdings, or\nany other balance sheet valuation adjustments, in our Adjusted EBITDA. Stated simply, our\nAdjusted EBITDA of $6 million in the third quarter equates to cash profit per Bitcoin of $8,500\nmultiplied by 703 BTC mined during the quarter plus approximately $400 thousand profit from our\nVolta electrical subsidiary.\nTurning to slide 17:\n14\n14\nAt September 30th, we had total liquidity of $146 million dollars, consisting of cash of $73 million\nand Bitcoin also valued at $73 million dollars.\nAt October 31st, we held 1,188 BTC, up from 1,147 at the end of September and 905 at the end of\nJune. Our higher BTC Treasury balance reflects our solid cash position and strong cash flow from\noperations. Further, our synthetic HODL continues to grow, increasing from 208 equivalent Bitcoin\nat the end of June to 602 Bitcoin at September 30th and to 802 Bitcoin as of October 31st, As a\nreminder, our Synthetic HODL strategy enables us to utilize excess Bitcoin generated each month\nto fund our growth at a far lower cost of capital than external funding sources while maintaining\nupside potential by applying a portion of the proceeds towards the purchase of long-dated Bitcoin\ncall options.\nIn regard to our ATM facility, which we initiated in March and use solely to fund our growth\ninitiatives and fleet upgrade, we raised net proceeds of $66 million in Q3 and a subsequent $39\nmillion since September 30th.\nLastly, I wish to point out that the growth and diversification initiatives that Ben has spoken about\nare all done with a keen eye on accretive growth and we have and will continue to weigh financing\noptions that provide the greatest shareholder return and minimal dilution.\nBefore I hand the call back to the operator for Q&A, I’d like to echo Ben’s enthusiasm about the\nstrong position Bitfarms is in. We’ve laid a solid foundation in 2024 that sets us up nicely to execute\nour growth strategy into 2025 and beyond. Our entire team, including the recent leadership\nadditions, is aligned and working towards these goals, and we look forward to keeping everyone\nupdated on our progress. With that, I’ll hand it over to the operator for Q&A.\n15\n15\n16\n16"
