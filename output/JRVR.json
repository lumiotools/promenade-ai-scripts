(\"James River\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: JRVR) today reported the following results for the third quarter 2024 as compared to the same period in 20231:\n\n**Three Months Ended****September 30 ,** | **Three Months Ended****September 30 ,**  \n---|---  \n**_($ in thousands, except for share data)_** | **2024** | **per diluted share** | **2023** | **per diluted share**  \nNet (loss) income from continuing operations available to common shareholders | $ | (40,702 | ) | $ | (1.07 | ) | $ | 21,097 | $ | 0.55  \nNet loss from discontinued operations | (1,304 | ) | $ | (0.03 | ) | (4,171 | ) | $ | (0.10 | )  \nNet (loss) income available to common shareholders | (42,006 | ) | $ | (1.10 | ) | 16,926 | $ | 0.45  \nAdjusted net operating (loss) income2 | (28,196 | ) | $ | (0.74 | ) | 18,859 | $ | 0.49  \n  \nNet loss from continuing operations available to common shareholders was $40.7 million ($1.07 per diluted share). Adjusted net operating loss2 of $28.2 million ($0.74 per diluted share) for the third quarter of 2024 was largely attributable to the previously announced $52.2 million of excess consideration paid over reserves ceded in connection with the Excess and Surplus Lines (\"E&S\") combined loss portfolio transfer adverse development reinsurance contract (\"E&S ADC\") that closed on July 2, 2024, as well as $19.2 million of additional adverse development ceded to the E&S ADC and recorded as a deferred reinsurance gain on the Company's balance sheet, and $4.8 million of adverse development retained by the Company. These were partially offset by strong investment income and underwriting profit from our Specialty Admitted segment.\n\nUnless specified otherwise, all underwriting performance ratios presented herein are for our continuing operations and business not subject to retroactive reinsurance accounting for loss portfolio transfers (\"LPTs\").\n\nThird Quarter 2024 Highlights:\n\n  * E&S segment gross written premium growth was 6% and positive renewal rate change of 8.6%. While the segment reported a 136.1% combined ratio, the current accident year combined ratio for the segment was 92.6%.\n  * Specialty Admitted Insurance segment combined ratio of 91.3%, with fronting and program gross written premium growth of 8.7% excluding the non-renewed workers' compensation programs.\n  * Net investment income increased 8.1% compared to the prior year quarter, with all asset classes reporting higher income.\n  * Shareholders' equity per share of $14.02 decreased 2.1% sequentially from June 30, 2024, due to the net loss from continuing operations, while tangible common equity per share3 increased 1.9% sequentially.\n\n\n\nStrategic Actions:\n\n  * The Company is commencing a multi-pronged strategic partnership with Enstar Group Limited (\"Enstar\"), a leader in P&C industry risk and liability management, under which: \n    * Cavello Bay Reinsurance Limited (“Cavello Bay”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Enstar, has agreed to purchase $12.5 million of newly issued common shares at a per share price of $6.40 (subject to certain closing conditions), in addition to 637,640 common shares it already owns through purchases in the open market; and\n    * Subsidiaries of the Company have entered into an adverse development reinsurance agreement with Cavello Bay, directly above the existing E&S ADC, with a limit of $75 million and no co-participation4; and\n    * Enstar will also have an informal consulting relationship and best practices dialogue with the Company’s claims leadership.\n  * The Company amended the convertible preferred shares held by Gallatin Point Capital LLC (\"Gallatin Point\") to convert $37.5 million liquidation preference of the outstanding preferred shares to common shares at a per share price of $6.40. The quarterly preferred dividend of the remaining $112.5 million liquidation preference will remain at 7% for five years subsequent to September 30, 2024 and will be capped at 8% thereafter. In addition, the voluntary and mandatory conversion prices of the remaining $112.5 million of outstanding preferred shares were amended to increase the conversion premiums to 130% and 200% of the new conversion price of $6.40 per share, respectively.\n  * Through these actions, alongside the reduction to the Company's quarterly common dividend, the Company will meaningfully reduce its fixed charges given the opportunity it has to put capital to work at attractive returns, in its E&S segment especially.\n  * The Company intends to pursue a plan to redomicile to the United States during 2025 and expects to reduce its effective tax rate closer to the US statutory rate thereafter.\n  * See the 2024 Strategic Actions Frequently Asked Questions slides being made available on the Investor Relations page of our website simultaneously with this press release for further information on these Strategic Actions. With these announcements, the Board of Directors have concluded the strategic review process announced in November of 2023. While the strategic review process has been completed, in the ordinary course of business the Company expects to consider beneficial opportunities.\n\n\n\n_______________1 The Company closed the sale of JRG Reinsurance Company Ltd. on April 16, 2024. The full financials for our former Casualty Reinsurance segment have been classified to discontinued operations for all periods.2 Adjusted net operating (loss) income, tangible common equity per share and adjusted net operating return on tangible common equity are non-GAAP financial measures. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” at the end of this press release.3 Percent change before $0.05 common dividends paid per share during the third quarter of 2024. 4 The Enstar transactions are subject to closing conditions, including receipt by Cavello Bay of regulatory approval of the adverse development cover.\n\nFrank D'Orazio, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, commented on the third quarter, “With the strategic actions we are announcing - notably the addition of Enstar as both a significant shareholder and strategic partner and the continued commitment of Gallatin Point - our highly regarded E&S franchise is significantly de-risked and well positioned to take advantage of strong market support amid a robust E&S environment. Momentum in our Core E&S franchise has continued to build each quarter during 2024 as we continue to balance attractive market conditions with underwriting discipline.”\n\nDavid Ni, Chief Strategy Officer of Enstar Group, commented, “In conjunction with these transactions, Enstar has had the opportunity to become well-versed with the Company’s business and we are pleased to make a $12.5 million common equity investment, underscoring our support of James River and its E&S franchise.”\n\nMatthew Botein, Co-Founder and Managing Partner of Gallatin Point Capital, commented, “I have seen the team at James River make deep and meaningful improvements to the Company over the last several years. These transactions are the culmination of those efforts and Gallatin Point is very supportive of James River as it enters a new phase, where it is poised to capitalize on the market opportunity for its flagship E&S operation.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Operating Results**\n\n  * Gross written premium of $330.4 million, consisting of the following:\n\n\n\n**Three Months Ended****September 30 ,**  \n---  \n**_($ in thousands)_** | **2024** | **2023** | **_% Change_**  \nExcess and Surplus Lines | $ | 230,215 | $ | 217,151 | _6_ | _%_  \nSpecialty Admitted Insurance | 100,208 | 125,700 | _(20_ | )%  \n$ | 330,423 | $ | 342,851 | _(4_  \n  \n  * Net written premium of $147.3 million, consisting of the following:\n\n\n\n**Three Months Ended****September 30 ,**  \n---  \n**_($ in thousands)_** | **2024** | **2023** | **_% Change_**  \nExcess and Surplus Lines | $ | 129,735 | $ | 123,046 | _5_ | _%_  \nSpecialty Admitted Insurance | 17,603 | 22,936 | _(23_ | )%  \n$ | 147,338 | $ | 145,982 | _1_ | _%_  \n  \n  * Net earned premium of $159.7 million, consisting of the following:\n\n\n\n**Three Months Ended****September 30 ,**  \n---  \n**_($ in thousands)_** | **2024** | **2023** | **_% Change_**  \nExcess and Surplus Lines | $ | 138,892 | $ | 157,600 | _(12_ | )%  \nSpecialty Admitted Insurance | 20,834 | 26,073 | _(20_ | )%  \n$ | 159,726 | $ | 183,673 | _(13_ | )%  \n  \n  * E&S Segment Highlights: \n    * For the third quarter of 2024, the segment grew 6%, and its casualty underwriting divisions grew 6.7% as compared to the prior year quarter.\n    * Renewal rate increases across the segment were 8.6% during the quarter.\n    * The segment experienced its strongest submission growth in over four years, with double digit growth in both new and renewal submissions.\n  * Specialty Admitted Insurance Segment Highlights: \n    * Gross written premium for fronting and program business increased 8.7% compared to the prior year quarter, excluding the impact of our large workers’ compensation program and Individual Risk Workers’ Compensation book.\n    * Gross written premium for the Specialty Admitted Insurance segment declined 20.3% compared to the third quarter of 2023, with the reduction due to the impact of the non-renewed workers' compensation program during the second quarter of 2023 and the sale of the renewal rights of the individual risk workers’ compensation business during the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Pre-tax favorable (unfavorable) reserve development by segment on business not subject to retroactive reinsurance accounting for loss portfolio transfers was as follows:\n\n\n\n**Three Months Ended****September 30 ,**  \n---  \n**_($ in thousands)_** | **2024** | **2023**  \nExcess and Surplus Lines | $ | (57,041 | ) | $ | (7,809 | )  \nSpecialty Admitted Insurance | 165 | —  \n$ | (56,876 | ) | $ | (7,809 | )  \n  \n  * The third quarter of 2024 reflected $57.0 million of net unfavorable reserve development in the E&S segment and $0.2 million of favorable reserve development in the Specialty Admitted Insurance segment. The Company ceded $71.4 million of year-to-date unfavorable reserve development on business subject to the E&S ADC. This consists of a $52.2 million reserve charge upon execution of the E&S ADC equal to the excess consideration paid over reserves ceded and additional adverse development of $19.2 million that was ceded to the E&S ADC. The deferred retroactive reinsurance gain on the balance sheet associated with the E&S ADC is $19.2 million as of September 30, 2024. Additionally, the Company recognized unfavorable gross reserve development of $0.9 million ($0.0 net) on the reserves subject to the Commercial Auto LPT, which provides unlimited coverage.\n  * Retroactive benefits of $2.2 million were recorded in loss and loss adjustment expenses during the third quarter and the total deferred retroactive reinsurance gain on the Balance Sheet is $31.0 million as of September 30, 2024.\n  * Gross fee income was as follows:\n\n\n\n**Three Months Ended****September 30 ,**  \n---  \n**_($ in thousands)_** | **2024** | **2023** | **_% Change_**  \nSpecialty Admitted Insurance | $ | 5,239 | $ | 6,833 | _(23_ | )%  \n  \n  * The consolidated expense ratio was 31.4% for the third quarter of 2024, which was an increase from 26.4% in the prior year quarter. The expense ratio increase was primarily driven by higher compensation and bad debt expense, and lower net earned premium in the E&S segment.\n\n\n\n**Investment Results**\n\nNet investment income for the third quarter of 2024 was $23.6 million, an increase of 8.1% compared to $21.8 million in the prior year quarter. Growth in income was broad-based across the portfolio, as cash flow was deployed at higher yields.\n\nThe Company’s net investment income consisted of the following:\n\n**Three Months Ended****September 30 ,**  \n---  \n**_($ in thousands)_** | **2024** | **2023** | **_% Change_**  \nPrivate Investments | 1,757 | 27 | _NM_  \nAll Other Investments | 21,807 | 21,772 | _0_ | _%_  \nTotal Net Investment Income | $ | 23,564 | $ | 21,799 | _8_ | _%_  \n  \nThe Company’s annualized gross investment yield on average fixed maturity, bank loan and equity securities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 4.8% (versus 4.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2023).\n\nNet realized and unrealized gains on investments of $4.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net realized and unrealized gains on investments of $0.7 million in the prior year quarter. The majority of the realized and unrealized gains during the third quarter of 2024 were related to changes in fair value of our common stock portfolio, partially offset by realized losses on sales in our bank loan and fixed income portfolios.\n\nIn connection with the closing of the E&S ADC on July 2, the Company transferred approximately $310.0 million in cash for the payment of the premium to counterparty, State National Insurance Company, Inc.\n\n**Capital Management**\n\nThe Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.01 per common share. This dividend is payable on Tuesday, December 31, 2024 to all shareholders of record on Monday, December 16, 2024.\n\n**Tangible Equity**\n\nTangible equity5 of $491.9 million at September 30, 2024 increased 1.4% compared to tangible equity of $485.3 million at June 30, 2024, due to strong unrealized investment gains in accumulated other comprehensive income (\"AOCI\") as well as an increase in deferred reinsurance gain, partially offset by a net loss from continuing and discontinued operations. Other comprehensive income benefited by $31.1 million during the third quarter of 2024, reducing AOCI to a loss of $42.8 million due to an increase in the value of the Company's fixed maturity securities caused by a decline in interest rates.\n\n_______________5 Tangible equity and tangible common equity excluding AOCI are non-GAAP financial measures. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” at the end of this press release.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nJames River will hold a conference call to discuss its third quarter results tomorrow, November 12, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.

In some cases, such forward-looking statements may be identified by terms such as believe, expect, seek, may, will, should, intend, project, anticipate, plan, estimate, guidance or similar words. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Although it is not possible to identify all of these risks and uncertainties, they include, among others, the following: the inherent uncertainty of estimating reserves and the possibility that incurred losses may be greater than our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves; inaccurate estimates and judgments in our risk management may expose us to greater risks than intended; downgrades in the financial strength rating or outlook of our regulated insurance subsidiaries impacting our ability to attract and retain insurance business that our subsidiaries write, our competitive position, and our financial condition; the outcome of our exploration of strategic alternatives, and market reaction thereto; the failure to close the common equity and adverse development cover reinsurance transactions with Enstar Group Limited announced on November 11, 2024; the amount of the final post-closing adjustment to the purchase price received in connection with the sale of our casualty reinsurance business and outcome of litigation relating to such transactions; the potential loss of key members of our management team or key employees and our ability to attract and retain personnel; adverse economic factors resulting in the sale of fewer policies than expected or an increase in the frequency or severity of claims, or both; the impact of a higher than expected inflationary environment on our reserves, the values of our investments and investment returns, and our compensation expenses; exposure to credit risk, interest rate risk and other market risk in our investment portfolio; reliance on a select group of brokers and agents for a significant portion of our business and the impact of our potential failure to maintain such relationships; reliance on a select group of customers for a significant portion of our business and the impact of our potential failure to maintain, or decision to terminate, such relationships; our ability to obtain insurance and reinsurance coverage at prices and on terms that allow us to transfer risk, adequately protect our company against financial loss and that supports our growth plans; losses resulting from reinsurance counterparties failing to pay us on reinsurance claims, insurance companies with whom we have a fronting arrangement failing to pay us for claims, or a former customer with whom we have an indemnification arrangement failing to perform its reimbursement obligations, and our potential inability to demand or maintain adequate collateral to mitigate such risks; inadequacy of premiums we charge to compensate us for our losses incurred; changes in laws or government regulation, including tax or insurance law and regulations; changes in U.S. tax laws and the interpretation of certain provisions of Public Law No. 115-97, informally titled the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (including associated regulations), which may be retroactive and could have a significant effect on us including, among other things, by potentially increasing our tax rate, as well as on our shareholders; in the event we do not qualify for the insurance company exception to the passive foreign investment company (“PFIC”) rules and are therefore considered a PFIC, there could be material adverse tax consequences to an investor that is subject to U.S. federal income taxation; the Company or its foreign subsidiary becoming subject to U.S. federal income taxation; a failure of any of the loss limitations or exclusions we utilize to shield us from unanticipated financial losses or legal exposures, or other liabilities; losses from catastrophic events, such as natural disasters and terrorist acts, which substantially exceed our expectations and/or exceed the amount of reinsurance we have purchased to protect us from such events; potential effects on our business of emerging claim and coverage issues; the potential impact of internal or external fraud, operational errors, systems malfunctions or cyber security incidents; our ability to manage our growth effectively; failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended; changes in our financial condition, regulations or other factors that may restrict our subsidiaries’ ability to pay us dividends; and an adverse result in any litigation or legal proceedings we are or may become subject to. Additional information about these risks and uncertainties, as well as others that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, is contained in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"), including our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this release and the Company does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking information to reflect changes in assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events, or otherwise.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nIn presenting James River Group Holdings, Ltd.’s results, management has included financial measures that are not calculated under standards or rules that comprise accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). Such measures, including underwriting (loss) profit, adjusted net operating (loss) income, tangible equity, tangible common equity, adjusted net operating return on tangible equity (which is calculated as annualized adjusted net operating income divided by the average quarterly tangible equity balances in the respective period), and adjusted net operating return on tangible common equity excluding AOCI (which is calculated as annualized adjusted net operating income divided by the average quarterly tangible common equity balances in the respective period, excluding AOCI), are referred to as non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures may be defined or calculated differently by other companies. These measures should not be viewed as a substitute for those measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures are included at the end of this press release.\n\n**About James River Group Holdings, Ltd.**\n\nJames River Group Holdings, Ltd. is a Bermuda-based insurance holding company that owns and operates a group of specialty insurance companies.

Retroactive reinsurance accounting is not indicative of our current and ongoing operations.

We believe that the disclosure of underwriting profit by individual segment and of the Company as a whole is useful to investors, analysts, rating agencies and other users of our financial information in evaluating our performance because our objective is to consistently earn underwriting profits. We evaluate the performance of our segments and allocate resources based primarily on underwriting profit. We define underwriting profit as net earned premiums and gross fee income (in specific instances when the Company is not retaining insurance risk) less losses and loss adjustment expenses on business from continuing operations not subject to retroactive reinsurance accounting for loss portfolio transfers and other operating expenses. Other operating expenses include the underwriting, acquisition, and insurance expenses of the operating segments and, for consolidated underwriting profit, the expenses of the Corporate and Other segment.

We use adjusted net operating income as an internal performance measure in the management of our operations because we believe it gives our management and other users of our financial information useful insight into our results of operations and our underlying business performance.

(\"James River\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: JRVR) today reported the following results for the second quarter 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023:\n\n**Three Months Ended****June 30 ,** | **Three Months Ended****June 30 ,**  \n---|---  \n**_($ in thousands, except for share data)_** | **2024** | **per diluted share** | **2023** | **per diluted share**  \nNet income from continuing operations available to common shareholders | $ | 11,853 | $ | 0.31 | $ | 9,504 | $ | 0.25  \nNet (loss) income from discontinued operations | (6,853 | ) | $ | (0.18 | ) | 3,785 | $ | 0.10  \nNet income available to common shareholders | 5,000 | $ | 0.13 | 13,289 | $ | 0.35  \nAdjusted net operating income1 | 12,664 | $ | 0.33 | 6,647 | $ | 0.18  \n  \nThe Company closed the sale of JRG Reinsurance Company Ltd. (\"JRG Re\") on April 16, 2024. The full financials for our former Casualty Reinsurance segment have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods.\n\nNet income from continuing operations available to common shareholders was $11.9 million ($0.31 per diluted share). Adjusted net operating income1 of $12.7 million ($0.33 per diluted share) for the second quarter of 2024 reflected strong investment income and profitable underwriting results from continuing operations.\n\nUnless specified otherwise, all underwriting performance ratios presented herein are for our continuing operations and business not subject to retroactive reinsurance accounting for loss portfolio transfers (\"LPTs\").\n\nSecond Quarter 2024 Highlights:\n\n  * Group combined ratio of 99.3% and adjusted net operating return on tangible common equity1 of 14.9%.\n  * E&S segment combined ratio of 95.4% and positive renewal rate change of 9.1%, with the majority of the underwriting divisions reporting positive pricing increases.\n  * Specialty Admitted Insurance segment combined ratio of 85.0%, with fronting and program gross written premium growth of 12.3% excluding the non-renewed workers' compensation program.\n  * Net investment income increased 36.7% compared to the prior year quarter, with all asset classes reporting higher income.\n  * Shareholders' equity per share of $14.32 increased 0.8%2 sequentially from March 31, 2024, due to strong net income from continuing operations, while tangible common equity per share1 increased 0.2%2 sequentially.\n\n\n\nFrank D'Orazio, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, commented on the second quarter, “James River has continued to execute on its strategic priorities of de-risking the organization and generating attractive returns on our capital. E&S market conditions remain favorable amid accelerating submission growth and a strong rate environment during the second quarter as we continue to re-profile segments of our portfolio. While we executed an attractive retroactive reinsurance transaction last month, our Board of Directors continues its exploration of strategic alternatives for the Company that was announced in November of 2023.”\n\n_____________________1 Adjusted net operating income, tangible common equity per share and adjusted net operating return on tangible common equity are non-GAAP financial measures.

Reserve development in the E&S segment was primarily related to accident years 2017-2020 for the general liability and excess casualty lines of business. $9.7 million of the unfavorable reserve development in the E&S segment is subject to the previously disclosed combined loss portfolio transfer and adverse development cover reinsurance transaction (\"E&S LPT and ADC\"). The E&S LPT and ADC is effective January 1, 2024, but closed on July 2, 2024. As such, any applicable recoveries will be recognized in the third quarter of 2024.\n  * Additionally, the Company recognized unfavorable reserve development of $1.4 million on the reserves subject to the Commercial Auto LPT, which provides unlimited coverage. Retroactive benefits of $5.1 million were recorded in loss and loss adjustment expenses during the second quarter and the deferred retroactive reinsurance gain on the Balance Sheet is $13.0 million as of June 30, 2024.\n  * Gross fee income was as follows:\n\n\n\n**Three Months Ended****June 30 ,**  \n---  \n**_($ in thousands)_** | **2024** | **2023** | **_% Change_**  \nSpecialty Admitted Insurance | $ | 5,565 | $ | 5,800 | _(4)__%_  \n  \n  * The consolidated expense ratio was 26.3% for the second quarter of 2024, which was an improvement from 28.2% in the prior year quarter. The expense ratio benefited from favorable commission expense adjustments in the Specialty Admitted Insurance segment.\n\n\n\n**Investment Results**\n\nNet investment income for the second quarter of 2024 was $24.9 million, an increase of 36.7% compared to $18.2 million in the prior year quarter. Growth in income was broad-based across the portfolio, as cash flow was deployed at higher yields. On a sequential basis, income from private investments and all other investments increased.\n\nThe Company’s net investment income consisted of the following:\n\n**Three Months Ended****June 30 ,**  \n---  \n**_($ in thousands)_** | **2024** | **2023** | **_% Change_**  \nPrivate Investments | 1,909 | 232 | _723_ | _%_  \nAll Other Investments | 23,022 | 18,002 | _28_ | _%_  \nTotal Net Investment Income | $ | 24,931 | $ | 18,234 | _37_ | _%_  \n  \nThe Company’s annualized gross investment yield on average fixed maturity, bank loan and equity securities for the three months ended June 30, 2024 was 5.0% (versus 4.3% for the three months ended June 30, 2023). The investment yield increased primarily as a result of higher market yields on fixed maturity securities and bank loans.\n\nNet realized and unrealized losses on investments of $2.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to net realized and unrealized gains on investments of $1.6 million in the prior year quarter. The majority of the realized and unrealized losses during the second quarter of 2024 were related to sales in our fixed income portfolio and changes in fair values of our common stock and bank loan portfolios.\n\nIn connection with the closing of the E&S LPT and ADC, the Company transferred approximately $310.0 million in cash for the payment of the premium to counterparty State National Insurance Company, Inc.\n\n**Taxes**\n\nThe Company's effective tax rate fluctuates from period to period based on the relative mix of income reported by country and the respective tax rates imposed by each tax jurisdiction. The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was 28.5%.\n\n**Tangible Equity**\n\nTangible equity3 of $485.3 million at June 30, 2024 decreased 0.3% compared to tangible equity of $486.6 million at March 31, 2024, as strong income from continuing operations was partially offset by a loss from discontinued operations and modest unrealized investment losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (\"AOCI\"). AOCI declined by $2.4 million during the second quarter of 2024 to a loss of $73.9 million, due to a decrease in the value of the Company's fixed maturity securities caused by an increase in interest rates. Excluding AOCI, tangible common equity3 increased 0.2% sequentially.\n\n_____________________3 Tangible equity and tangible common equity excluding AOCI are non-GAAP financial measures. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” at the end of this press release.\n\n**Capital Management**\n\nThe Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.05 per common share. This dividend is payable on Monday, September 30, 2024 to all shareholders of record on Monday, September 16, 2024.\n\n**Other**\n\nAs referenced previously, the E&S LPT and ADC is effective January 1, 2024, but closed on July 2, 2024. As such, any applicable recoveries will be recognized beginning in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nAs a result of the E&S LPT and ADC, the Company expects to recognize a reduction in pre-tax income of approximately $44.0 million in the third quarter of 2024.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nJames River will hold a conference call to discuss its second quarter results tomorrow, August 6, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time. Investors may access the conference call by dialing (800) 715-9871, Conference ID 8370409, or via the internet by visiting [www.jrvrgroup.com](http://www.jrvrgroup.com) and clicking on the “Investor Relations” link. A webcast replay of the call will be available by visiting the company website.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In some cases, such forward-looking statements may be identified by terms such as believe, expect, seek, may, will, should, intend, project, anticipate, plan, estimate, guidance or similar words. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Although it is not possible to identify all of these risks and uncertainties, they include, among others, the following: the inherent uncertainty of estimating reserves and the possibility that incurred losses may be greater than our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves; inaccurate estimates and judgments in our risk management may expose us to greater risks than intended; downgrades in the financial strength rating of our regulated insurance subsidiaries impacting our ability to attract and retain insurance business that our subsidiaries write, our competitive position, and our financial condition; uncertainty regarding the outcome and timing of our exploration of strategic alternatives, and the impacts that it may have on our business; the amount of the final post-closing adjustment to the purchase price received in connection with the sale of our casualty reinsurance business; the potential loss of key members of our management team or key employees and our ability to attract and retain personnel; adverse economic factors resulting in the sale of fewer policies than expected or an increase in the frequency or severity of claims, or both; the impact of a persistently high inflationary environment on our reserves, the values of our investments and investment returns, and our compensation expenses; exposure to credit risk, interest rate risk and other market risk in our investment portfolio; reliance on a select group of brokers and agents for a significant portion of our business and the impact of our potential failure to maintain such relationships; reliance on a select group of customers for a significant portion of our business and the impact of our potential failure to maintain, or decision to terminate, such relationships; our ability to obtain reinsurance coverage at prices and on terms that allow us to transfer risk, adequately protect our company against financial loss and that supports our growth plans; losses resulting from reinsurance counterparties failing to pay us on reinsurance claims, insurance companies with whom we have a fronting arrangement failing to pay us for claims, or a former customer with whom we have an indemnification arrangement failing to perform its reimbursement obligations, and our potential inability to demand or maintain adequate collateral to mitigate such risks; inadequacy of premiums we charge to compensate us for our losses incurred; changes in laws or government regulation, including tax or insurance law and regulations; changes in U.S. tax laws and the interpretation of certain provisions of Public Law No. 115-97, informally titled the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (including associated regulations), which may be retroactive and could have a significant effect on us including, among other things, by potentially increasing our tax rate, as well as on our shareholders; in the event we do not qualify for the insurance company exception to the passive foreign investment company (“PFIC”) rules and are therefore considered a PFIC, there could be material adverse tax consequences to an investor that is subject to U.S. federal income taxation; the Company or its foreign subsidiary becoming subject to U.S. federal income taxation; a failure of any of the loss limitations or exclusions we utilize to shield us from unanticipated financial losses or legal exposures, or other liabilities; losses from catastrophic events, such as natural disasters and terrorist acts, which substantially exceed our expectations and/or exceed the amount of reinsurance we have purchased to protect us from such events; potential effects on our business of emerging claim and coverage issues; the potential impact of internal or external fraud, operational errors, systems malfunctions or cyber security incidents; our ability to manage our growth effectively; failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended; changes in our financial condition, regulations or other factors that may restrict our subsidiaries’ ability to pay us dividends; and an adverse result in any litigation or legal proceedings we are or may become subject to. Additional information about these risks and uncertainties, as well as others that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, is contained in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"), including our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on 10-Q. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this release and the Company does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking information to reflect changes in assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events, or otherwise.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nIn presenting James River Group Holdings, Ltd.’s results, management has included financial measures that are not calculated under standards or rules that comprise accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”).

We believe that the disclosure of underwriting profit by individual segment and of the Company as a whole is useful to investors, analysts, rating agencies and other users of our financial information in evaluating our performance because our objective is to consistently earn underwriting profits. We evaluate the performance of our segments and allocate resources based primarily on underwriting profit. We define underwriting profit as net earned premiums and gross fee income (in specific instances when the Company is not retaining insurance risk) less losses and loss adjustment expenses on business from continuing operations not subject to retroactive reinsurance accounting for loss portfolio transfers and other operating expenses. Other operating expenses include the underwriting, acquisition, and insurance expenses of the operating segments and, for consolidated underwriting profit, the expenses of the Corporate and Other segment.

The following table reconciles shareholders’ equity to tangible equity and tangible common equity for June 30, 2024, March 31, 2024, December 31, 2023, and June 30, 2023.\n\n**June 30 , 2024** | **March 31 , 2024** | **December 31 , 2023** | **June 30 , 2023**  \n---|---|---|---  \n**_($ in thousands, except for share data)_**  \nShareholders' equity | $ | 541,791 | $ | 539,537 | $ | 534,621 | $ | 585,542  \nPlus: Series A redeemable preferred shares | 144,898 | 144,898 | 144,898 | 144,898  \nPlus: Deferred reinsurance gain (a) | 13,047 | 16,731 | 20,733 | 37,572  \nLess: Goodwill and intangible assets | 214,462 | 214,553 | 214,644 | 217,325  \nTangible equity | $ | 485,274 | $ | 486,613 | $ | 485,608 | $ | 550,687  \nLess: Series A redeemable preferred shares | 144,898 | 144,898 | 144,898 | 144,898  \nTangible common equity | $ | 340,376 | $ | 341,715 | $ | 340,710 | $ | 405,789  \nCommon shares outstanding | 37,825,767 | 37,822,340 | 37,641,563 | 37,619,226  \nCommon shares from assumed conversion of Series A preferred shares | 6,848,763 | 6,750,567 | 5,971,184 | 5,640,158  \nCommon shares outstanding after assumed conversion of Series A preferred shares | 44,674,530 | 44,572,907 | 43,612,747 | 43,259,384  \nEquity per share:  \nShareholders' equity | $ | 14.32 | $ | 14.27 | $ | 14.20 | $ | 15.56  \nTangible equity | $ | 10.86 | $ | 10.92 | $ | 11.13 | $ | 12.73  \nTangible common equity | $ | 9.00 | $ | 9.03 | $ | 9.05 | $ | 10.79  \n(a) Deferred reinsurance gain for the periods ending March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 excludes the deferred retroactive reinsurance gain of $34.0 million and $33.2 million, respectively, related to the former Casualty Reinsurance LPT in discontinued operations.  \n  \n![](https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=OTE5OTI4NyM2NDA4NDI5IzIwMTY2NzI=)![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/NmIyMzUyOGEtMzUyMC00MDEzLWI3ZWMtZDJiMzg2NDlkYzI5LTEwMjgyNDU=/tiny/James-River-Group-Holdings-Ltd.png)```\nFor more information contact: Zachary Shytle Analyst, Finance, Investments and Investor Relations Investors@jrvrgroup.com\n```\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/213c93f0-1806-4316-862c-4742b5c45aab/small/jrgh-horiz-logo-2022-medium-jpg.jpg)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/213c93f0-1806-4316-862c-4742b5c45aab)\n\nSource: James River Group Holdings, Ltd.\n"
