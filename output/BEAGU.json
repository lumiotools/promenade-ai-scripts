(the “Company”), the ninth public acquisition vehicle sponsored by Eagle Equity Partners, which is led by Harry Sloan, Jeff Sagansky and Eli Baker, today announced the pricing on October 23, 2024 of its initial public offering of 25,000,000 units at a price of $10.00 per unit. Each unit consists of one Class A ordinary share and one Eagle Share Right to receive one twentieth of one Class A ordinary share upon the consummation of an initial business combination. There are no warrants issued publicly or privately in connection with this offering and, after the closing of the initial public offering, the Company’s sponsor will reduce its founder shares in an amount equal to the Class A ordinary shares underlying the Eagle Share Rights. An amount equal to $10.00 per unit will be deposited into a trust account upon the closing of the offering. The units will be listed on the Nasdaq Global Market (“Nasdaq”) and trade under the ticker symbol “BEAGU” beginning on October 24, 2024. After the securities comprising the units begin separate trading, the Class A ordinary shares and Eagle Share Rights are expected to be listed on Nasdaq under the symbols “BEAG” and “BEAGR,” respectively. The offering is expected to close on October 25, 2024. \n\nBold Eagle Acquisition Corp. is a blank check company whose business purpose is to effect a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses.
