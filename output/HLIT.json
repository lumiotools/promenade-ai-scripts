Our expectations regarding these matters may not materialize, and actual results in future periods are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks include, in no particular order, the following: customer concentration and consolidation; loss of one or more key customers; delays or decreases in capital spending in the cable, satellite, telco, broadcast and media industries; the possibility that our products will not generate sales that are commensurate with our expectations or that our cost of revenue or operating expenses may exceed our expectations; the market and technology trends underlying our Broadband and Video businesses will not continue to develop in their current direction or pace; the impact of general economic conditions on our sales and operations; the mix of products and services sold in various geographies and the effect it has on gross margins; our ability to develop new and enhanced products in a timely manner and market acceptance of our new or existing products; risks associated with our international operations; exchange rate fluctuations of the currencies in which we conduct business; risks associated with our_ cOSTM  _and VOS product solutions; dependence on various broadband and video industry trends; inventory management; the lack of timely availability or the impact of increases in the prices of parts or raw materials necessary to produce our products; the effect of competition, on both revenue and gross margins; difficulties associated with rapid technological changes in our markets; risks associated with unpredictable sales cycles; our dependence on contract manufacturers and sole or limited source suppliers; and the impact on our business of natural disasters. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those more fully described in Harmonic's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, our most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our Current Reports on Form 8-K. The forward-looking statements in this press release are based on information available to the Company as of the date hereof, and Harmonic disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements_.\n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThe Company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\" or referred to herein as \"reported\"). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide management and other users with additional meaningful financial information that should be considered when assessing our ongoing performance. Our management regularly uses our supplemental non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate our business, establish operating budgets, set internal measurement targets and make operating decisions.\n\nThese non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. The Company believes that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with Harmonic's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate Harmonic's results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.\n\nThe Company believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures, when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and its historical and projected results of operations. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative to, the Company's reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nThe non-GAAP measures presented here are: Gross profit, operating expenses, income (loss) from operations, non-operating expenses and net income (loss), Adjusted EBITDA (including those amounts as a percentage of revenue) and net income (loss) per diluted share. The presentation of non-GAAP information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and is not necessarily comparable to non-GAAP results published by other companies. A reconciliation of the historical non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this press release to the most directly comparable historical GAAP financial measures is included with the financial statements provided with this press release. The non-GAAP adjustments described below have historically been excluded from our GAAP financial measures.\n\nOur non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on the following items, as well as the related income tax effects:\n\n_Stock-based compensation -_ Although stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to our employees, we continue to evaluate our business performance excluding stock-based compensation expenses. We believe that management is limited in its ability to project the impact stock-based compensation would have on our operating results. In addition, for comparability purposes, we believe it is useful to provide a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes stock-based compensation in order to better understand the long-term performance of our core business and to facilitate the comparison of our results to the results of our peer companies. \n\n_Restructuring and related charges -_ Harmonic from time to time incurs restructuring charges which primarily consist of employee severance, one-time termination benefits related to the reduction of its workforce, and other costs. These charges are associated with material business shifts. We exclude these items because we do not believe they are reflective of our ongoing long-term business and operating results. \n\n_Non-cash interest expense expenses related to convertible notes and other debt -_ We record the amortization of issuance costs as non-cash interest expense. We believe that excluding these costs provides meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity, along with enhancing investors' ability to view the Company's results from management's perspective. In addition, we believe excluding these costs from the non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to our historical operating results and comparisons to peer company operating results. \n\n_Discrete tax items and tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments -_ The income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments relates to the tax effect of the adjustments that we incorporate into non-GAAP financial measures in order to provide a more meaningful measure of non-GAAP net income.\n\n_Depreciation_ - Depreciation expense, along with interest, tax and stock-based compensation expense, and restructuring charges, is excluded from Adjusted EBITDA because we do not believe depreciation and the other items relate to the ordinary course of our business or are reflective of our underlying business performance.\n\n_Non-recurring advisory fees_ - There were non-recurring costs that we excluded from non-GAAP results relating to professional accounting, tax and legal fees associated with strategic corporate initiatives.\n\n_Asset impairment and related charges_ - We exclude asset impairment and related charges due to the nature of such expenses being unusual and arising outside the ordinary course of continuing operations. These costs primarily consist of impairments of fixed assets, right-of-use assets and related leasehold improvements, and other unrecoverable facility costs due to the intended change in use of certain leased space.\n\n**Harmonic Inc. ** **Preliminary Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets** **(Unaudited, in thousands, except par value)**  \n---  \n**September 27 , 2024** |  **December 31 ,

The American-built Fin 10G R-OLT SFP+ can serve customers at ranges up to 20km, extending the reach of existing network edge devices to address isolated unserved and underserved communities.\n\n[ ![Harmonic logo \\(PRNewsfoto/Harmonic Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/455698/HARMONIC_Inc_logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/455698/HARMONIC_Inc_logo.html)\n\n\"We are fully supportive of the BEAD-BABA program's efforts to bring internet access to all,\" said Dan Gledhill, senior vice president, fiber broadband at Harmonic. \"Enabling efficient delivery of high-speed fiber broadband services from both new and existing network equipment lets operators mitigate mid-mile construction, allowing efforts to focus on last-mile fiber connections to end subscribers. Our solutions help operators cut the cost of deployment projects, reduce time to market and help streamline delivery into rural communities.\"\n\nThe Fin pluggable module can be hosted by Harmonic's portfolio of rack-mounted switches and Jetty remote switches. Jetty fits into Harmonic's Ripple and Oyster nodes and can also be retrofitted into third-party nodes thanks to Harmonic's unique Raft adaptive solution for legacy enclosures. Jetty supports long range 10/25G Ethernet so operators can also daisy chain nodes to more efficiently expand service areas and optimize use of existing fiber assets.\n\nThe company expects to complete the BEAD and Build America, Buy America (BABA) certification process for the Fin R-OLT module by the end of the year and for other key fiber products in 2025.\n\nSCTE TechExpo24 attendees can see Harmonic's fiber broadband innovations on display in booth 803.
