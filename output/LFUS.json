          "content": "Q3 2024\nEARNINGS RELEASE\nOCTOBER 29, 2024\n11\nDISCLAIMERS\nImportant Information About Littelfuse, Inc. This presentation does not constitute or form part of, and should not be construed as, an offer or solicitation to purchase or sell\nsecurities of Littelfuse, Inc. and no investment decision should be made based upon the information provided herein. Littelfuse strongly urges you to review its filings with the Securities\nand Exchange Commission, which can be found at investor.littelfuse.com. This website also provides additional information about Littelfuse.\n“Safe Harbor” Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The statements in this presentation that are not historical facts are intended to constitute\n\"forward-looking statements\" entitled to the safe-harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Such statements are based on Littelfuse, Inc.’s (\"Littelfuse\" or the\n\"Company\") current expectations and are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-\nlooking statements. These risks and uncertainties, include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to general economic conditions; product demand and market\nacceptance; the impact of competitive products and pricing; product quality problems or product recalls; capacity and supply difficulties or constraints; coal mining exposures reserves;\ncybersecurity matters; failure of an indemnification for environmental liability; exchange rate fluctuations; commodity and other raw material price fluctuations; the effect of Littelfuse\naccounting policies; labor disputes; restructuring costs in excess of expectations; pension plan asset returns less than assumed; integration of acquisitions; uncertainties related to\npolitical or regulatory changes; and other risks which may be detailed in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties\nmaterialize or should the underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results and outcomes may differ materially from those indicated or implied in the forward-looking statements.\nThis presentation should be read in conjunction with information provided in the financial statements appearing in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 30, 2023. Further discussion of the risk factors of the company can be found under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year\nended December 30, 2023, and in other filings and submissions with the SEC, each of which are available free of charge on the company’s investor relations website at\ninvestor.littelfuse.com and on the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov. These forward-looking statements are made as of the date hereof. The company does not undertake any\nobligation to update, amend or clarify these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the availability of new information.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures. The information included in this presentation includes the non-GAAP financial measures of organic net sales (decline) growth, adjusted operating\nmargin, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted effective tax rate, free cash flow, and consolidated net leverage ratio (as defined in the credit\nagreement). A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the appendix. The company believes that\nthese non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors regarding its operational performance because they enhance an investor’s overall understanding of our\ncore financial performance and facilitate comparisons to historical results of operations, by excluding items that are not related directly to the underlying performance of our\nfundamental business operations or were not part of our business operations during a comparable period. The company believes that free cash flow is a useful measure of its ability to\ngenerate cash. The company believes that consolidated net leverage ratio is a useful measure of its credit position. Management additionally uses these measures when assessing the\nperformance of the business and for business planning purposes. Note that our definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from those terms as defined or used by\nother companies.\nLittelfuse, Inc. © 2024 22\nBUSINESS UPDATE\nDave Heinzmann, President & CEO\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n Solid Q3 execution drives results above expectations\n Q3 Adjusted EPS exceeded the high end of guidance\n Strong cash generation, continued balance sheet flexibility\n Meaningful new business wins across global customer base\n Delivering on profitability initiatives\n Sequential margin expansion across all three segments\n Experienced teams executing on operational & structural actions\n Well positioned to deliver long-term growth strategy\n Strong track record & commitment to execution\n Unique portfolio & broad exposure to secular growth themes\nResilient & diversified business model\nLittelfuse, Inc. © 2024 44\n2021 – 2025 GROWTH STRATEGY\nEMPOWERING A SUSTAINABLE, CONNECTED, AND SAFER WORLD\nOur capabilities, investments & diversification deliver significant value\nLittelfuse, Inc. © 2024 55\nELECTRONICS END MARKETS\nPRODUCT LEADERSHIP, DIVERSE CUSTOMER REACH\nQ3 2024 Highlights\n Continued solid data center & medical demand; ongoing\nsubdued demand across consumer products, appliance\n& building technology applications\n Healthy design-in activity through cycle\n Momentum supports long term growth trajectory\n Broad & innovative solutions continue to gain traction\nwith our global customer base\n NA & China gaming application wins\n Multi-region wins for various medical applications\n Diversified wins across data center, telecom & appliances\nLittelfuse, Inc. © 2024 66\nTRANSPORTATION END MARKETS\nBALANCED CAPABILITIES, GLOBAL PARTNERSHIPS\nQ3 2024 Highlights\n Benefiting from global scale & strong customer\nrelationships\n Balanced portfolio serving extensive range of transportation\napplications\n Strong execution amid ongoing soft end market dynamics\n Delivering meaningful wins globally with broad customer\nreach\n Multiple wins within electrification systems for key customers\n Global low voltage wins showcase product leadership\n Diverse commercial vehicle wins across construction\nequipment, agriculture & specialty vehicles\nLittelfuse, Inc. © 2024 77\nINDUSTRIAL END MARKETS\nINNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS, BROAD EXPERTISE\nQ3 2024 Highlights\n Continued end demand softness driven by industrial\nequipment, factory automation, motor drives &\nrenewables\n More pronounced impact on power\nsemiconductor business\n Ongoing signs of recovery in HVAC; continued\ntraction in Industrial Safety\n Next generation applications driving broad wins\n Multiple wins for solar customers in Europe\n Commercial HVAC wins in NA\n Global wins across diverse applications highlighted by\ncommercial EV charging infrastructure & mining\nLittelfuse, Inc. © 2024 88\nFINANCIAL UPDATE\nMeenal Sethna, EVP & CFO\nQ3 2024 TOTAL COMPANY\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\n(in millions)\nRevenue Highlights\n Revenue (-7%) vs PY (Reported & Organic)\n ~2% portfolio pruning headwind\n GAAP op margin 15.5%; Adjusted op margin\n$607\n$567 15.9%\n Lower volumes offset by operational\nexecution\n 80bps benefit from FX & commodities\nQ3-23 Q3-24\n Effective tax rate: GAAP 25.3%; Adj. 24.3%\nGAAP EPS $2.30 $2.32\n Q3 Op cash flow $80m; Free cash flow $65m\nAdj.

This presentation does not constitute or form part of, and should not be construed as, an offer or solicitation to purchase or sell\nsecurities of Littelfuse, Inc. and no investment decision should be made based upon the information provided herein. Littelfuse strongly urges you to review its filings with the Securities\nand Exchange Commission, which can be found at investor.littelfuse.com. This website also provides additional information about Littelfuse.\n“Safe Harbor” Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The statements in this presentation that are not historical facts are intended to constitute\n\"forward-looking statements\" entitled to the safe-harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Such statements are based on Littelfuse, Inc.’s (\"Littelfuse\" or the\n\"Company\") current expectations and are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-\nlooking statements. These risks and uncertainties, include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to general economic conditions; product demand and market\nacceptance; the impact of competitive products and pricing; product quality problems or product recalls; capacity and supply difficulties or constraints; coal mining exposures reserves;\ncybersecurity matters; failure of an indemnification for environmental liability; exchange rate fluctuations; commodity and other raw material price fluctuations; the effect of Littelfuse\naccounting policies; labor disputes; restructuring costs in excess of expectations; pension plan asset returns less than assumed; integration of acquisitions; uncertainties related to\npolitical or regulatory changes; and other risks which may be detailed in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties\nmaterialize or should the underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results and outcomes may differ materially from those indicated or implied in the forward-looking statements.\nThis presentation should be read in conjunction with information provided in the financial statements appearing in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 30, 2023. Further discussion of the risk factors of the company can be found under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year\nended December 30, 2023, and in other filings and submissions with the SEC, each of which are available free of charge on the company’s investor relations website at\ninvestor.littelfuse.com and on the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov. These forward-looking statements are made as of the date hereof. The company does not undertake any\nobligation to update, amend or clarify these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the availability of new information.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures. The information included in this presentation includes the non-GAAP financial measures of organic net sales (decline) growth, adjusted operating\nmargin, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted effective tax rate, free cash flow, and consolidated net leverage ratio (as defined in the credit\nagreement). A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the appendix. The company believes that\nthese non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors regarding its operational performance because they enhance an investor’s overall understanding of our\ncore financial performance and facilitate comparisons to historical results of operations, by excluding items that are not related directly to the underlying performance of our\nfundamental business operations or were not part of our business operations during a comparable period. The company believes that free cash flow is a useful measure of its ability to\ngenerate cash. The company believes that consolidated net leverage ratio is a useful measure of its credit position. Management additionally uses these measures when assessing the\nperformance of the business and for business planning purposes. Note that our definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from those terms as defined or used by\nother companies.\nLittelfuse, Inc. © 2024 22\nBUSINESS UPDATE\nDave Heinzmann, President & CEO\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n Solid Q3 execution drives results above expectations\n Q3 Adjusted EPS exceeded the high end of guidance\n Strong cash generation, continued balance sheet flexibility\n Meaningful new business wins across global customer base\n Delivering on profitability initiatives\n Sequential margin expansion across all three segments\n Experienced teams executing on operational & structural actions\n Well positioned to deliver long-term growth strategy\n Strong track record & commitment to execution\n Unique portfolio & broad exposure to secular growth themes\nResilient & diversified business model\nLittelfuse, Inc. © 2024 44\n2021 – 2025 GROWTH STRATEGY\nEMPOWERING A SUSTAINABLE, CONNECTED, AND SAFER WORLD\nOur capabilities, investments & diversification deliver significant value\nLittelfuse, Inc. © 2024 55\nELECTRONICS END MARKETS\nPRODUCT LEADERSHIP, DIVERSE CUSTOMER REACH\nQ3 2024 Highlights\n Continued solid data center & medical demand; ongoing\nsubdued demand across consumer products, appliance\n& building technology applications\n Healthy design-in activity through cycle\n Momentum supports long term growth trajectory\n Broad & innovative solutions continue to gain traction\nwith our global customer base\n NA & China gaming application wins\n Multi-region wins for various medical applications\n Diversified wins across data center, telecom & appliances\nLittelfuse, Inc. © 2024 66\nTRANSPORTATION END MARKETS\nBALANCED CAPABILITIES, GLOBAL PARTNERSHIPS\nQ3 2024 Highlights\n Benefiting from global scale & strong customer\nrelationships\n Balanced portfolio serving extensive range of transportation\napplications\n Strong execution amid ongoing soft end market dynamics\n Delivering meaningful wins globally with broad customer\nreach\n Multiple wins within electrification systems for key customers\n Global low voltage wins showcase product leadership\n Diverse commercial vehicle wins across construction\nequipment, agriculture & specialty vehicles\nLittelfuse, Inc. © 2024 77\nINDUSTRIAL END MARKETS\nINNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS, BROAD EXPERTISE\nQ3 2024 Highlights\n Continued end demand softness driven by industrial\nequipment, factory automation, motor drives &\nrenewables\n More pronounced impact on power\nsemiconductor business\n Ongoing signs of recovery in HVAC; continued\ntraction in Industrial Safety\n Next generation applications driving broad wins\n Multiple wins for solar customers in Europe\n Commercial HVAC wins in NA\n Global wins across diverse applications highlighted by\ncommercial EV charging infrastructure & mining\nLittelfuse, Inc. © 2024 88\nFINANCIAL UPDATE\nMeenal Sethna, EVP & CFO\nQ3 2024 TOTAL COMPANY\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\n(in millions)\nRevenue Highlights\n Revenue (-7%) vs PY (Reported & Organic)\n ~2% portfolio pruning headwind\n GAAP op margin 15.5%; Adjusted op margin\n$607\n$567 15.9%\n Lower volumes offset by operational\nexecution\n 80bps benefit from FX & commodities\nQ3-23 Q3-24\n Effective tax rate: GAAP 25.3%; Adj. 24.3%\nGAAP EPS $2.30 $2.32\n Q3 Op cash flow $80m; Free cash flow $65m\nAdj.
