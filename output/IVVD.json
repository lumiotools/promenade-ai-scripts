(Nasdaq: IVVD), a biopharmaceutical company devoted to delivering protection from serious viral infectious diseases, today announced financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, and recent business highlights.\n\nWith the September 26, 2024 update, the PEMGARDA™ (pemivibart) Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers (Fact Sheet) now includes validated data for pemivibart’s neutralization activity against the latest circulating COVID-19 variants tested, including KP.3, KP.3.1.1 and LB.1. This Fact Sheet update aligns with exploratory clinical efficacy data from the CANOPY Phase 3 clinical trial that demonstrated substantial protection from symptomatic COVID-19 versus placebo in immunocompetent participants across a broad spectrum of viral strains including KP.3 and KP.3.1.1. By ensuring that healthcare providers and other stakeholders have access to accurate information, Invivyd aims to reinforce confidence in the therapeutic potential of PEMGARDA for immunocompromised people needing pre-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19, as authorized. Invivyd reported $9.3 million in PEMGARDA™ (pemivibart) net product revenue in Q3 2024, an increase from $2.3 million in Q2 2024. Though not at previously anticipated rates, PEMGARDA net product revenue grew through the third quarter and continues to grow. \n\n“With the current Fact Sheet that accurately reflects the neutralization activity of PEMGARDA against KP.3.1.1, the exploratory clinical efficacy data reconfirming a substantial level of relative risk reduction of developing symptomatic COVID-19 versus placebo during the KP.3 and KP.3.1.1 wave, and with our predicted continued neutralization activity of pemivibart against the XEC variant, we are confident in the growth potential for PEMGARDA,” said Marc Elia, Chairman of the Invivyd Board of Directors.\n\n“We are excited about the potential of PEMGARDA to address the significant unmet need of COVID-19 pre-exposure prophylaxis for certain immunocompromised people and expect that ongoing commercial execution will drive substantial revenue growth and market expansion,” said Tim Lee, Chief Commercial Officer of Invivyd. “We have expanded our outreach efforts - driving awareness of PEMGARDA in the healthcare providers community, increasing our ability to reach to additional points of care, and adding new programs to support patients.”\n\n**Recent Business Highlights**\n\n  * Submitted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) amendment request to U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) for PEMGARDA for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in certain immunocompromised patients\n  * Announced 180-day exploratory clinical efficacy data from the company’s ongoing CANOPY Phase 3 clinical trial showing PEMGARDA™ (pemivibart) demonstrated 84% relative risk reduction from symptomatic COVID-19 versus placebo through month 6 in Cohort B, a placebo-controlled cohort of all-comer immunocompetent individuals, with safety profile reported as remaining consistent with previously disclosed CANOPY clinical trial data\n  * Reported CANOPY Phase 3 long-term exploratory clinical efficacy data showing PEMGARDA™ (pemivibart) provided 64% relative risk reduction from symptomatic COVID-19 versus placebo in Cohort B over six-month off-drug follow-up period (months 7-12), with no new safety observations occurring during months 7-12\n  * U.S. FDA has updated the PEMGARDA™ EUA Fact Sheet with accurate SARS-CoV-2 variant susceptibility information and PEMGARDA in vitro neutralization activity data\n  * Announced preprint conveying CANOPY Phase 3 clinical trial data including long-term protection versus recent JN.1 sublineages at low residual titers uploaded in MedRxiv; manuscript conveying pivotal safety, immunobridging, and exploratory clinical efficacy results from the CANOPY clinical trial will be submitted to a major scientific journal shortly\n  * Announced preprint describing Invivyd scientists’ novel method for predicting the activity of a monoclonal antibody in the face of variant evolution uploaded in BioRxiv; method predicts continued neutralization activity for pemivibart against SARS-CoV-2 variant XEC, with formal assay assessment pending\n\n\n\n**Recent Pipeline Highlights**\n\n  * Initiated dosing of first participants in Phase 1 clinical trial of VYD2311, a next generation monoclonal antibody candidate for COVID-19, building on the success of PEMGARDA\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * Revenue: Reported $9.3 million of net product revenue of PEMGARDA in Q3 2024 as compared to $2.3 million in Q2 2024.\n  * Cash Position: Cash and cash equivalents were $106.9 million as of September 30, 2024.\n  * Projected 2024 Year-End Cash Position: Based on current operating plans, Invivyd expects to end 2024 with at least $65 million in cash and cash equivalents, based on anticipated growth of net product revenue and various operational efficiency improvements.\n  * Research & Development (R&D) Expenses (including In-Process R&D): R&D expenses were $57.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $30.2 million for the comparable period of 2023. This increase is primarily attributable to an increase in VYD2311 manufacturing as compared to lower manufacturing costs of PEMGARDA during the same period in 2023.\n  * Selling, General & Administrative (SG&A) Expenses: SG&A expenses remained relatively consistent at $13.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and $12.9 million for the comparable period of 2023.\n  * Net Loss and Net Loss per Share: Net loss was $60.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $39.4 million for the comparable period in 2023.

PEMGARDA was engineered from adintrevimab, Invivyd’s investigational mAb that has a robust safety data package and provided evidence of clinical efficacy in a global Phase 2/3 clinical trial for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. PEMGARDA has demonstrated in vitro neutralizing activity against major SARS-CoV-2 variants, including JN.1, KP.3, KP.3.1.1, and LB.1. PEMGARDA targets the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD), thereby inhibiting virus attachment to the human ACE2 receptor on host cells.\n\nPEMGARDA (pemivibart) injection (4500 mg), for intravenous use is an investigational mAb that has not been approved, but has been authorized for emergency use by the U.S. FDA under an EUA for the pre-exposure prophylaxis (prevention) of COVID-19 in adults and adolescents (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg) who have moderate-to-severe immune compromise due to certain medical conditions or receipt of certain immunosuppressive medications or treatments and are unlikely to mount an adequate immune response to COVID-19 vaccination. Recipients should not be currently infected with or have had a known recent exposure to an individual infected with SARS-CoV-2.\n\nPEMGARDA is not authorized for use for treatment of COVID-19 or post-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19. Pre-exposure prophylaxis with PEMGARDA is not a substitute for vaccination in individuals for whom COVID-19 vaccination is recommended. Individuals for whom COVID-19 vaccination is recommended, including individuals with moderate-to-severe immune compromise who may derive benefit from COVID-19 vaccinations, should receive COVID-19 vaccination. In individuals who have recently received a COVID-19 vaccine, PEMGARDA should be administered at least 2 weeks after vaccination.\n\nAnaphylaxis has been observed with PEMGARDA and the PEMGARDA Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers includes a boxed warning for anaphylaxis. The most common adverse events (all grades, incidence ≥2%) observed in participants who have moderate-to-severe immune compromise treated with PEMGARDA included systemic and local infusion-related or hypersensitivity reactions, upper respiratory tract infection, viral infection, influenza-like illness, fatigue, headache, and nausea. For additional information, please see the PEMGARDA full product Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers, including important safety information and boxed warning.\n\nTo support the EUA for PEMGARDA, an immunobridging approach was used to determine if PEMGARDA may be effective for pre-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19. Immunobridging is based on the serum virus neutralizing titer-efficacy relationships identified with other neutralizing human mAbs against SARS-CoV-2. This includes adintrevimab, the parent mAb of pemivibart, and other mAbs that were previously authorized for EUA. There are limitations of the data supporting the benefits of PEMGARDA. Evidence of clinical efficacy for other neutralizing human mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 was based on different populations and SARS-CoV-2 variants that are no longer circulating. Further, the variability associated with cell-based EC50 value determinations, along with limitations related to pharmacokinetic data and efficacy estimates for the mAbs in prior clinical trials, impact the ability to precisely estimate protective titer ranges. Additionally, certain SARS-CoV-2 viral variants may emerge that have substantially reduced susceptibility to PEMGARDA, and PEMGARDA may not be effective at preventing COVID-19 caused by these SARS-CoV-2 viral variants.\n\nThe emergency use of PEMGARDA is only authorized for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use of drugs and biological products during the COVID-19 pandemic under Section 564(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(b)(1), unless the declaration is terminated or authorization revoked sooner. PEMGARDA is authorized for use only when the combined national frequency of variants with substantially reduced susceptibility to PEMGARDA is less than or equal to 90%, based on available information including variant susceptibility to PEMGARDA and national variant frequencies.\n\n**About CANOPY**\n\nThe ongoing CANOPY Phase 3 clinical trial is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of pemivibart and to assess immunobridging from pemivibart to certain historical data from the company’s previous Phase 2/3 clinical trial of adintrevimab (ADG20) for the prevention of symptomatic COVID-19 (EVADE). Additionally, there are pre-specified exploratory endpoints through three, six and twelve months to evaluate clinical efficacy of pemivibart compared to placebo in the prevention of RT-PCR-confirmed symptomatic COVID-19. The latest analysis from the Phase 3 CANOPY clinical trial includes 365-day data. The CANOPY clinical trial enrolled participants in two cohorts: Cohort A is a single-arm, open-label trial in adults who have moderate-to-severe immune compromise including complex underlying medical conditions. Cohort B is a randomized, placebo-controlled cohort that enrolled adults without moderate-to-severe immune compromise who are at risk of acquiring COVID-19 due to regular unmasked face-to-face interactions in indoor settings.\n\n**About VYD2311**\n\nVYD2311 is a novel monoclonal antibody (mAb) candidate being developed for COVID-19 to continue to address the urgent need for new therapeutic options for vulnerable populations, including immunocompromised people. Globally, there are millions of immunocompromised people, with an estimated 8 million in the U.S. alone, who may not adequately respond to COVID-19 vaccination, increasing their risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19.\n\nVYD2311 was engineered from adintrevimab, Invivyd’s investigational mAb that has a robust safety data package and demonstrated clinically meaningful results in global Phase 3 clinical trials for both the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. The pharmacokinetic profile of VYD2311 may offer the ability to deliver clinically meaningful titer levels through more patient-friendly means such as an intramuscular route of administration.\n\n**About Invivyd**\n\nInvivyd, Inc. (Nasdaq: IVVD) is a biopharmaceutical company devoted to delivering protection from serious viral infectious diseases, beginning with SARS-CoV-2. The company’s proprietary INVYMAB™ platform approach combines state-of-the-art viral surveillance and predictive modeling with advanced antibody engineering.

(Nasdaq: IVVD), a biopharmaceutical company devoted to delivering protection from serious viral infectious diseases, today announces that _The New England Journal of Medicine_ (NEJM) has published a peer-reviewed Letter to the Editor describing the PEMGARDA™ (pemivibart) immunobridging emergency use authorization (EUA) pathway, as well as an updated correlate of protection (CoP) curve for prevention of symptomatic COVID-19 via recombinant monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) such as pemivibart.\n\nThe immunobridging approach highlighted in NEJM draws on pharmacokinetic bioequivalence principles and was designed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to allow rapid development and authorization of serial, novel mAbs that can protect vulnerable populations from symptomatic COVID-19 amid a rapidly evolving variant landscape. The immunobridging approach established by the FDA for pemivibart development relied on a comparison between the serum virus neutralizing antibody (sVNA) titers of a novel antibody, pemivibart, and the sVNA titer associated with previous clinical protection at a single point in time from a single prototype mAb, in this case, Invivyd’s prior investigational mAb, adintrevimab.\n\nThe updated CoP data curve for mAbs also published in the NEJM letter as Figure 1B builds on prior published work1 and provides a meta-analytic continuous curve describing the quantitative relationship between sVNA titers and clinical protection from symptomatic COVID-19 across multiple mAbs. Such a continuous curve depicts human immunobiology better than binary point estimate immunobridging analysis and resembles the analyses deployed to understand the clinical protection possible from COVID-19 vaccination. This curve in Figure 1B has not been updated to reflect, but generally comports well with, the positive exploratory clinical efficacy data from Invivyd’s CANOPY Phase 3 registrational clinical trial. Inclusive of the emerging CANOPY exploratory clinical efficacy data, the CoP relationship for mAbs against symptomatic COVID-19 now spans years of virus evolution, dozens of variants of concern, and vast quantities of viral variation, unlocking the potential of such an analysis to rapidly develop mAbs that can protect against symptomatic COVID-19 without requiring excess dose to address the clinical uncertainty of viral variation. Invivyd intends to leverage these data in development of next-generation molecule VYD2311, targeting a low dose, intramuscular or subcutaneous scalable, system- and patient-friendly profile that can confer strong protection with attractive safety.\n\n“We are pleased that the immunobridging pathway leading to PEMGARDA authorization has been published in one of the highest impact medical journals in clinical medicine, the _New England Journal of Medicine_ ,” said Mark Wingertzahn, Ph.D., Senior Vice President of Clinical Development and Medical Affairs. “This approach, borrowed from vaccine development, can provide clinicians and regulators alike with a useful framework for mAbs as we innovate toward rational, scalable, high efficacy medicines that can protect vulnerable populations against COVID-19.”\n\nDr. Wingertzahn continued, “While we are gratified by the publication of Invivyd’s Letter to the Editor, we are disappointed by today’s publication by NEJM of a separate Letter to the Editor from the Columbia University Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Laboratory / Dr. David D. Ho (Ho Lab) that describes neutralization data of “research-grade” “pemivibart” synthesized at Columbia against KP.3.1.1 (Ho Letter). The data contained in the Ho Letter are highly discordant from the information contained in the FDA-authored PEMGARDA Fact Sheet and can cause confusion for healthcare professionals and their patients who may benefit from PEMGARDA.” The Ho Letter rebroadcasted outdated and inaccurate “research grade” “pemivibart” data that first appeared in the public domain in August 2024 via a preprint posted to BioRxiv (Ho Preprint). These data contend that JN.1 sublineages, notably KP.3.1.1, display substantially reduced susceptibility _in vitro_ to an antibody made in the Ho Lab referred to as “pemivibart.”\n\nA series of events that occurred in the summer of 2024 spark questions about data reflected in the Ho Preprint and Letter. On July 30, 2024, Dr. Ho communicated to Invivyd that he had “an optimized mAb that neutralizes all SARS-CoV-2 with great potency,” bringing to light a conflict of interest. Moreover, on August 13, 2024, an author of the Ho Preprint emailed Invivyd requesting authentic pemivibart so they could perform a side-by-side comparison of the neutralization activities of authentic pemivibart against their version of “pemivibart.” To date, Invivyd has declined requests to share authentic pemivibart with the Ho Lab.\n\nUnder protest from Invivyd, reference to the Ho Preprint was added to the PEMGARDA™ Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers (Fact Sheet) in August 2024. Importantly, upon receipt of the validated pemivibart KP.3.1.1 neutralization data from Labcorp-Monogram Biosciences (Monogram) in September 2024, the FDA removed such references from the PEMGARDA Fact Sheet, added the Monogram data supporting the ongoing potential benefit of PEMGARDA (pemivibart) in the authorized population, and stated that PEMGARDA likely retains adequate neutralization activity against circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants in the U.S. including KP.3.1.1, LB.1, KP.3, and KP.2, which comprise more than 75% of currently circulating variants. The PEMGARDA Fact Sheet continues to accurately reflect the neutralization activity of PEMGARDA (pemivibart) against KP.3.1.1.\n\nThe totality of the data, including Invivyd-generated assay data, data generated at a third-party, independent, industrial-grade laboratory, and the previously reported CANOPY trial exploratory clinical efficacy data showing robust reduction of risk of symptomatic COVID-19 compared to placebo observed during a U.S. COVID-19 wave dominated by KP.3 and KP.3.1.1 variants, all favor the validity of the ongoing virology work Invivyd has routinely provided to regulators that underlines the potential clinical benefits of PEMGARDA, as authorized. Importantly, with all this data in hand, the FDA continues to assert in the current PEMGARDA Fact Sheet that based upon the totality of scientific evidence available it is reasonable to believe that PEMGARDA may be effective for pre-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19 caused by susceptible SARS-CoV-2 variants in the authorized population. As a reminder, Invivyd recently disclosed a proprietary method for interrogating the structural biology of pemivibart activity against emerging virus variants that predicts continued activity against XEC, with formal assay testing at Monogram pending.\n\n**About Invivyd** Invivyd, Inc.

PEMGARDA was engineered from adintrevimab, Invivyd’s investigational mAb that has a robust safety data package and provided evidence of clinical efficacy in a global Phase 2/3 clinical trial for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. PEMGARDA has demonstrated in vitro neutralizing activity against major SARS-CoV-2 variants, including JN.1, KP.3, KP.3.1.1 and LB.1. PEMGARDA targets the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD), thereby inhibiting virus attachment to the human ACE2 receptor on host cells.\n\nPEMGARDA (pemivibart) injection (4500 mg), for intravenous use is an investigational mAb that has not been approved, but has been authorized for emergency use by the U.S. FDA under an EUA for the pre-exposure prophylaxis (prevention) of COVID-19 in adults and adolescents (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg) who have moderate-to-severe immune compromise due to certain medical conditions or receipt of certain immunosuppressive medications or treatments and are unlikely to mount an adequate immune response to COVID-19 vaccination. Recipients should not be currently infected with or have had a known recent exposure to an individual infected with SARS-CoV-2.\n\nPEMGARDA is not authorized for use for treatment of COVID-19 or post-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19. Pre-exposure prophylaxis with PEMGARDA is not a substitute for vaccination in individuals for whom COVID-19 vaccination is recommended. Individuals for whom COVID-19 vaccination is recommended, including individuals with moderate-to-severe immune compromise who may derive benefit from COVID-19 vaccinations, should receive COVID-19 vaccination. In individuals who have recently received a COVID-19 vaccine, PEMGARDA should be administered at least 2 weeks after vaccination.\n\nAnaphylaxis has been observed with PEMGARDA and the PEMGARDA Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers includes a boxed warning for anaphylaxis. The most common adverse events (all grades, incidence ≥2%) observed in participants who have moderate-to-severe immune compromise treated with PEMGARDA included systemic and local infusion-related or hypersensitivity reactions, upper respiratory tract infection, viral infection, influenza-like illness, fatigue, headache, and nausea. For additional information, please see the PEMGARDA full product Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers, including important safety information and boxed warning.\n\nTo support the EUA for PEMGARDA, an immunobridging approach was used to determine if PEMGARDA may be effective for pre-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19. Immunobridging is based on the serum virus neutralizing titer-efficacy relationships identified with other neutralizing human mAbs against SARS-CoV-2. This includes adintrevimab, the parent mAb of pemivibart, and other mAbs that were previously authorized for EUA. There are limitations of the data supporting the benefits of PEMGARDA. Evidence of clinical efficacy for other neutralizing human mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 was based on different populations and SARS-CoV-2 variants that are no longer circulating. Further, the variability associated with cell-based EC50 value determinations, along with limitations related to pharmacokinetic data and efficacy estimates for the mAbs in prior clinical trials, impact the ability to precisely estimate protective titer ranges. Additionally, certain SARS-CoV-2 viral variants may emerge that have substantially reduced susceptibility to PEMGARDA, and PEMGARDA may not be effective at preventing COVID-19 caused by these SARS-CoV-2 viral variants.\n\nThe emergency use of PEMGARDA is only authorized for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use of drugs and biological products during the COVID-19 pandemic under Section 564(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(b)(1), unless the declaration is terminated or authorization revoked sooner. PEMGARDA is authorized for use only when the combined national frequency of variants with substantially reduced susceptibility to PEMGARDA is less than or equal to 90%, based on available information including variant susceptibility to PEMGARDA and national variant frequencies.\n\n**About CANOPY** The ongoing CANOPY Phase 3 clinical trial is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of pemivibart and to assess immunobridging from pemivibart to certain historical data from the company’s previous Phase 2/3 clinical trial of adintrevimab (ADG20) for the prevention of symptomatic COVID-19 (EVADE). Additionally, there are pre-specified exploratory endpoints through three, six and twelve months to evaluate clinical efficacy of pemivibart compared to placebo in the prevention of RT-PCR-confirmed symptomatic COVID-19. The latest analysis from the Phase 3 CANOPY clinical trial includes 365-day data. The CANOPY clinical trial enrolled participants in two cohorts: Cohort A is a single-arm, open-label trial in adults who have moderate-to-severe immune compromise including complex underlying medical conditions. Cohort B is a randomized, placebo-controlled cohort that enrolled adults without moderate-to-severe immune compromise who are at risk of acquiring COVID-19 due to regular unmasked face-to-face interactions in indoor settings.\n\n**Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements** This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

(Nasdaq: IVVD), a biopharmaceutical company devoted to delivering protection from serious viral infectious diseases, today announced that a manuscript preprint conveying data from the CANOPY Phase 3 clinical trial of pemivibart, a half-life extended investigational monoclonal antibody (mAb) for the pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) of COVID-19, including long-term protection shown versus recent JN.1 sublineages at low residual titers, was uploaded to MedRxiv, and a preprint describing a novel approach for predicting mAb activity was uploaded to BioRxiv.\n\nCANOPY clinical trial data supported the emergency use authorization (EUA) of PEMGARDA™ (pemivibart) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for PrEP of COVID-19 in certain moderate-to-severe immunocompromised patients via an immunobridging pathway. To date, the CANOPY clinical trial has been conducted over a period of substantial transmission of COVID-19 disease in the U.S., yielding important exploratory clinical efficacy data from Cohort B, a placebo-controlled cohort of immunocompetent individuals at risk of contracting symptomatic COVID-19 disease from regular unmasked face-to-face interactions with others in indoor settings. The safety profile for pemivibart remains consistent with the PEMGARDA Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers. The manuscript preprint conveying pivotal safety, immunobridging, and exploratory clinical efficacy results from the CANOPY clinical trial will be submitted to a major scientific journal shortly.\n\nPrevious disclosures from Invivyd have underlined the strong protection shown in the CANOPY clinical trial from symptomatic disease conferred by PEMGARDA over multiple waves and lineages of SARS-CoV-2, including 6-month data from a JN.1 dominant wave during active dosing (84% relative risk reduction in symptomatic disease versus placebo), and long-term follow-up from months 7-12 after cessation of drug (64% relative risk reduction in symptomatic disease versus placebo) during a KP.3 and KP.3.1.1 wave. [see link [here](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=R2Q9_0TyVTo21PKbW0rdIH2RakIoBZcacJ-2kWRa5tCEvWFlnTFyKib9V_P2rp6nwQVPLSMkDc5lGcKw_B6wthSeEsyqsmSFDKFBivXW14MAWmfuqkXH_a2Rrelo8rxpLEjZqivOPdeQuxLNVDpckuFLQyh_vgLs_os9mseUeSNzYGLlvBv23XPTZish9a4pLoo8jHinLhs43wQk_Vaucg==)].\n\nPublication of the CANOPY clinical trial long-term follow-up, exploratory clinical efficacy data showing continued protection against KP.3 and KP.3.1.1 are particularly critical as they indicate that 1) strong protection was available from pemivibart over a 12-month period, supporting Invivyd’s route toward enhanced and more scalable product forms, and 2) strong protection was conferred during the off-drug interval in the trial with low, residual titer levels.\n\nAdditionally, a preprint describing a novel methodology for assessing and predicting the structure-neutralization relationships between authorized or approved antibodies and novel viral variants to add speed and confidence to overall assessments of antibody activity has been uploaded to BioRxiv. Specifically, a preprint from Invivyd scientists Powers, et al. describes the use of a large panel of close molecular relatives to pemivibart to interrogate neutralization behavior across the panel against emerging variants of interest. This molecular panel approach adds confidence to the gold-standard pseudovirus assessment of authentic pemivibart at Labcorp-Monogram Biosciences by interrogating a large group of similarly structured variants of pemivibart with overlapping assessed binding sites that collectively portray a probabilistic cloud of likely pemivibart neutralization activity against variants of interest. This panel approach previously predicted ongoing neutralization activity for pemivibart against KP.3.1.1. The same method predicts continued neutralization activity for pemivibart against XEC, with formal assay assessment pending.\n\n“Academic labs continue to make claims about ‘pemivibart’ activity that do not reflect the data outputs for PEMGARDA (pemivibart) when Invivyd’s industrial-grade processes with authentic pemivibart are utilized. Given the variability of virology assessments and the critical need to assess outputs through the lens of biological plausibility, at Invivyd we have developed a systematic mechanism to parse the structural basis of individual neutralization results prospectively using a multi-antibody panel approach. Such an approach adds confidence and context to our understanding of the neutralization data we ultimately submit to FDA for their continued evaluation of the risk-benefit profile of PEMGARDA and inclusion in the PEMGARDA Fact Sheet, as reflected in the most recent update,” commented Dr. Robert Allen, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer at Invivyd and an author of the preprint. “Beyond these methods, we are also gratified with the recent CANOPY long-term controlled exploratory clinical data that put to rest any open questions on the activity of PEMGARDA against major variants circulating during the CANOPY trial, including KP.3 and KP.3.1.1.”\n\n**About Invivyd** Invivyd, Inc.

PEMGARDA was engineered from adintrevimab, Invivyd’s investigational mAb that has a robust safety data package and provided evidence of clinical efficacy in a global Phase 2/3 clinical trial for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. PEMGARDA has demonstrated in vitro neutralizing activity against major SARS-CoV-2 variants, including JN.1, KP.3, KP.3.1.1 and LB.1. PEMGARDA targets the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD), thereby inhibiting virus attachment to the human ACE2 receptor on host cells.\n\nPEMGARDA (pemivibart) injection (4500 mg), for intravenous use is an investigational mAb that has not been approved, but has been authorized for emergency use by the U.S. FDA under an EUA for the pre-exposure prophylaxis (prevention) of COVID-19 in adults and adolescents (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg) who have moderate-to-severe immune compromise due to certain medical conditions or receipt of certain immunosuppressive medications or treatments and are unlikely to mount an adequate immune response to COVID-19 vaccination. Recipients should not be currently infected with or have had a known recent exposure to an individual infected with SARS-CoV-2.\n\nPEMGARDA is not authorized for use for treatment of COVID-19 or post-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19. Pre-exposure prophylaxis with PEMGARDA is not a substitute for vaccination in individuals for whom COVID-19 vaccination is recommended. Individuals for whom COVID-19 vaccination is recommended, including individuals with moderate-to-severe immune compromise who may derive benefit from COVID-19 vaccinations, should receive COVID-19 vaccination. In individuals who have recently received a COVID-19 vaccine, PEMGARDA should be administered at least 2 weeks after vaccination.\n\nAnaphylaxis has been observed with PEMGARDA and the PEMGARDA Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers includes a boxed warning for anaphylaxis. The most common adverse events (all grades, incidence ≥2%) observed in participants who have moderate-to-severe immune compromise treated with PEMGARDA included systemic and local infusion-related or hypersensitivity reactions, upper respiratory tract infection, viral infection, influenza-like illness, fatigue, headache, and nausea. For additional information, please see the PEMGARDA full product Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers, including important safety information and boxed warning.\n\nTo support the EUA for PEMGARDA, an immunobridging approach was used to determine if PEMGARDA may be effective for pre-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19. Immunobridging is based on the serum virus neutralizing titer-efficacy relationships identified with other neutralizing human mAbs against SARS-CoV-2. This includes adintrevimab, the parent mAb of pemivibart, and other mAbs that were previously authorized for EUA. There are limitations of the data supporting the benefits of PEMGARDA. Evidence of clinical efficacy for other neutralizing human mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 was based on different populations and SARS-CoV-2 variants that are no longer circulating. Further, the variability associated with cell-based EC50 value determinations, along with limitations related to pharmacokinetic data and efficacy estimates for the mAbs in prior clinical trials, impact the ability to precisely estimate protective titer ranges. Additionally, certain SARS-CoV-2 viral variants may emerge that have substantially reduced susceptibility to PEMGARDA, and PEMGARDA may not be effective at preventing COVID-19 caused by these SARS-CoV-2 viral variants.\n\nThe emergency use of PEMGARDA is only authorized for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use of drugs and biological products during the COVID-19 pandemic under Section 564(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(b)(1), unless the declaration is terminated or authorization revoked sooner. PEMGARDA is authorized for use only when the combined national frequency of variants with substantially reduced susceptibility to PEMGARDA is less than or equal to 90%, based on available information including variant susceptibility to PEMGARDA and national variant frequencies.\n\n**About CANOPY** The ongoing CANOPY Phase 3 clinical trial is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of pemivibart and to assess immunobridging from pemivibart to certain historical data from the company’s previous Phase 2/3 clinical trial of adintrevimab (ADG20) for the prevention of symptomatic COVID-19 (EVADE). Additionally, there are pre-specified exploratory endpoints through three, six and twelve months to evaluate clinical efficacy of pemivibart compared to placebo in the prevention of RT-PCR-confirmed symptomatic COVID-19. The latest analysis from the Phase 3 CANOPY clinical trial includes 365-day data. The CANOPY clinical trial enrolled participants in two cohorts: Cohort A is a single-arm, open-label trial in adults who have moderate-to-severe immune compromise including complex underlying medical conditions. Cohort B is a randomized, placebo-controlled cohort that enrolled adults without moderate-to-severe immune compromise who are at risk of acquiring COVID-19 due to regular unmasked face-to-face interactions in indoor settings.\n\n**Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements** This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
