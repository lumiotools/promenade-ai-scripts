(Nasdaq: RAPT), a clinical-stage, immunology-based therapeutics company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing oral small molecule therapies for patients with significant unmet needs in inflammatory diseases and oncology, today reported financial results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Financial Results for the Third Quarter and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024**\n\n_Third Quarter Ended September 30, 2024_\n\nNet loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $18.4 million, compared to $31.4 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nResearch and development expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $13.3 million, compared to $27.0 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease in research and development expenses was primarily due to lower development costs related to zelnecirnon, tivumecirnon and early stage programs, as well as decreased expenses for personnel, consultants and lab supplies.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $6.4 million, compared to $6.9 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to decreased expenses for personnel, consultants and insurance premiums, partially offset by increases in expenses for non-cash stock-based compensation and facilities.\n\nOn July 16, 2024, the Company’s board of directors approved a reduction of the Company’s workforce to conserve cash resources. The workforce reduction affected 47 people, or approximately 40% of the Company’s headcount. The Company incurred $0.9 million in restructuring charges in connection with the workforce reduction, consisting of cash-based expenses related to employee severance payments, benefits and related costs. The Company completed the workforce reduction plan and all the related cash payments during the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n_Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024_\n\nNet loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $76.6 million, compared to $85.9 million for the same period in 2023.\n\nResearch and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $60.8 million, compared to $74.2 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease in research and development expenses was primarily due to decreases in development costs related to zelnecirnon, tivumecirnon and early-stage programs, as well as lab supplies, partially offset by increased expenses for personnel, consultants, facilities and non-cash stock-based compensation.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $20.9 million, compared to $19.6 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased expenses for personnel, non-cash stock-based compensation and facilities, partially offset by decreases in expenses for consultants and insurance premiums.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $97.9 million.\n\n**About RAPT Therapeutics, Inc.**\n\nRAPT Therapeutics is a clinical-stage, immunology-based therapeutics company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing oral small molecule therapies for patients with significant unmet needs in inflammatory diseases and oncology. Utilizing its proprietary discovery and development engine, the Company is developing highly selective small molecules designed to modulate the critical immune drivers underlying these diseases. RAPT has discovered and advanced two unique drug candidates, zelnecirnon (RPT193) and tivumecirnon (FLX475), each targeting C-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4), for the treatment of inflammation and cancer, respectively.

(Nasdaq: RAPT), a clinical-stage, immunology-based biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing oral small molecule therapies for patients with significant unmet needs in inflammatory diseases and oncology, today announced it is terminating its zelnecirnon (RPT193) program. Zelnecirnon was being evaluated in two randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trials in asthma and atopic dermatitis (AD), and both trials were placed on clinical hold by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in February 2024 due to a serious adverse event (SAE) of liver injury requiring transplant in one patient in the AD trial. No liver toxicity nor other treatment-related SAEs were reported in any other trial participant. The company subsequently closed both studies before completing the planned enrollment. Following feedback recently received from the FDA, the company has stopped its zelnecirnon program.\n\n“In light of the agency’s feedback, we do not see a viable path forward for zelnecirnon, although we continue to believe that CCR4 remains an exciting target with the potential to provide a safe, oral therapeutic option across a number of inflammatory diseases,” commented Brian Wong, M.D., Ph.D., President and CEO of RAPT. “We plan to continue advancing our next generation CCR4 compounds with improved safety margins for inflammatory disease and expect to identify a new candidate in the first half of 2025. Additionally, we continue to actively pursue in-licensing opportunities for clinical-stage assets.”\n\n**About RAPT Therapeutics, Inc.** RAPT Therapeutics is a clinical-stage, immunology-based therapeutics company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing oral small molecule therapies for patients with significant unmet needs in inflammatory diseases and oncology.

These statements relate to future events and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future performances or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Each of these statements is based only on current information, assumptions and expectations that are inherently subject to change and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about the termination of the zelnecirnon program; the company’s business and clinical development plans, including future CCR4 molecules and pursuit of licensing opportunities for clinical-stage assets; and other statements that are not historical fact. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from the plans, intentions and expectations disclosed in these forward-looking statements include uncertainties inherent in the initiation, progress and completion of clinical trials and clinical development of RAPT’s product candidates; the risk that clinical trials may have unsatisfactory outcomes; risks associated with preclinical development of product candidates; risks that efforts to secure licensing and other business development opportunities may not be successful; and other important factors, detailed in RAPT’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and subsequent filings made by RAPT with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
