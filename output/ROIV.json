Mosliciguat Phase 1b data in pulmonary hypertension (PH) patients demonstrated some of the highest pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) reductions (~38%) in PH trials to date. The global Phase 2 PHocus trial for mosliciguat has been initiated in patients with pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease (PH-ILD)\n  * Roivant continued to return capital through share repurchases with $106M purchased for the quarter, resulting in $754M cumulative share repurchases (inclusive of Sumitomo) through September 30, 2024\n  * Dermavant transaction with Organon closed on October 28, 2024. At closing, Roivant received $184M in cash, and Organon took on all of Dermavant’s remaining outstanding long-term debt, which, inclusive of Dermavant’s senior credit facility repaid at closing, had a carrying value of $336M as of September 30, 2024. In addition, Organon will pay Roivant a $75M milestone upon FDA approval for VTAMA in atopic dermatitis, with a target action date in Q1 2025\n  * Roivant reported consolidated cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $5.4B at September 30, 2024\n\n\n\n“I am pleased to finish out another quarter with continued clinical execution, including positive data in Graves’ Disease and FDA’s clearance of INDs in 5 indications at Immunovant,” said Matt Gline, CEO of Roivant. “I am also excited today to present the 52-week data from our Phase 2 study of brepocitinib in NIU. The sustained treatment benefits observed further our belief that brepocitinib is a potentially compelling and durable agent for a disease that is poorly treated today. We have a busy year ahead with major data expected in 2025 from Immunovant and Priovant, along with continued execution across other programs.”\n\n**Recent Developments**\n\n  * **Immunovant:** Endocrinology ProgramIn September 2024, Immunovant reported additional positive results from the Phase 2a trial of batoclimab in Graves’ Disease. Participants in the trial received 12 weeks of high dose batoclimab, 680 mg weekly by subcutaneous injection (SC) followed by 12 weeks of lower dose batoclimab, 340 mg weekly SC. At the end of the first 12 weeks, participants experienced a mean IgG reduction of 77% leading to a 76% Response rate. In addition, by the end of 12 weeks of higher dose batoclimab, 56% achieved an ATD-Free Response. During Weeks 13 to 24, the lower 340mg dose of batoclimab resulted in mean IgG reduction of 65% (vs. 77% on 680mg dose) with a correspondingly lower responder rate of 68%. In addition, a lower ATD-Free Response rate of 36% was also observed in the second 12 weeks. Patients who achieved at least a 70% IgG reduction at the end of the trial had nearly a threefold higher ATD-Free Response rate than those who did not (60% vs. 23%). Batoclimab was well tolerated with no new safety signals identified.In November 2024, additional data on the efficacy and safety of batoclimab in Graves’ thyroidal and extrathyroidal disease were presented in an oral presentation at the American Thyroid Association (ATA) 2024 Annual Meeting. These data showed that a 60% response rate (defined as T3 and T4 falling below the upper limit of normal (ULN) without increasing the ATD dose) was achieved by Week 2, demonstrating the rapidity of response to batoclimab 680mg dosed weekly. Meaningful improvements in proptosis and lid aperture were also observed at both Week 12 and Week 24. Pronounced improvements in multiple Thyroid-Related Patient-Reported Outcomes (ThyPRO-39) measurement scales were also observed, with ATD-Free Responders (defined as T3 and T4 falling below the ULN and ceasing all ATD medications) reporting greater improvements than other participants.Neurology ProgramIn November 2024, Immunovant announced completion of enrollment for patients included in Period 1 of the Phase 2b trial of batoclimab in CIDP, with data expected by March 31, 2025, to inform the trial design for a potentially registrational program with IMVT-1402.Rheumatology ProgramIn November 2024, Immunovant also announced FDA clearance of the IND for IMVT-1402 in D2T RA and expects to initiate a potentially registrational trial by March 31, 2025.\n\n\n  * **Priovant:** In September 2024, Priovant announced receipt of Fast Track designation from FDA for brepocitinib in NIU and enrolled the first patients in the Phase 3 program. New 52-week data from the Phase 2 NEPTUNE study of brepocitinib in NIU showed potential best-in-indication efficacy sustained to one year. Treatment failure rate in the 45 mg dose arm was 35% at week 52 vs. 29% at week 24. Treatment failure rate in the 15 mg dose arm was 56% vs. 44% at week 24. In each treatment arm only one additional patient failed from week 24 to 52. Other important efficacy measurements at week 52 were consistent with the week 24 data, including measurements of retinal vascular leakage and prevention and treatment of macular edema. Safety and tolerability were consistent with prior clinical studies of brepocitinib, with no new safety or tolerability signals identified. Brepocitinib has been dosed in over 1,400 subjects and patients with a safety profile that appears consistent with approved and widely prescribed JAK inhibitors.\n\n\n  * **Pulmovant:** In September 2024, Roivant unveiled mosliciguat, a potential first-in-class and best-in-category inhaled once-daily sGC activator. Mosliciguat is being developed for PH-ILD, which affects ~200,000 patients in the U.S. and Europe with limited or no treatment options. In September 2024, Pulmovant also presented data from the Phase 1b ATMOS study showing a single dose of inhaled mosliciguat in PH patients (N=38) led to sustained, clinically meaningful mean-max reductions in PVR of up to ~38%, one of the highest reductions seen in PH trials to date. Mosliciguat was generally well-tolerated, with low rates of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs).Pulmovant initiated the global Phase 2 PHocus trial of mosliciguat in patients with PH-ILD.\n\n\n  * **Roivant:** In October 2024, Roivant reported the close of Organon’s acquisition of Dermavant. At closing, Roivant received $184M in cash and Organon took on all of Dermavant’s remaining outstanding long-term debt, which, inclusive of Dermavant’s senior credit facility repaid at closing, had a carrying value of $336M as of September 30, 2024. In addition, Organon will pay Roivant a $75M milestone upon FDA approval for VTAMA in atopic dermatitis, with a target action date in the first quarter of calendar year 2025. The transaction also includes payments of up to $950 million for the achievements of certain commercial milestones, in addition to the tiered royalties on net sales that Organon will pay Dermavant shareholders.Roivant continued to return capital through share repurchases with $106M purchased for the quarter ending September 30, 2024, resulting in $754M cumulative share repurchases (inclusive of the repurchase of Sumitomo’s stake in April 2024) through September 30, 2024.Roivant reported consolidated cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $5.4B at September 30, 2024.\n\n\n\n**Major Upcoming Milestones**\n\n  * **Kinevant** plans to report topline data from the ongoing Phase 2 trial of namilumab for the treatment of sarcoidosis in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2024.\n\n\n  * **Immunovant** plans to have initiated 4-5 potentially registrational programs by March 31, 2025, and plans to have initiated studies in a total of 10 indications by March 31, 2026, for IMVT-1402. In pursuit of this goal, Immunovant now has active INDs in Graves’ Disease and difficult-to-treat rheumatoid arthritis and expects to initiate potentially registrational trials in these indications by December 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025 respectively. Topline data from the batoclimab trial in MG is expected by March 31, 2025. Results from this trial are expected to inform a decision regarding next steps for batoclimab in MG and the design of the MG program for IMVT-1402, which is expected to initiate by March 31, 2025. Data from the batoclimab trial in CIDP is expected by March 31, 2025 and will be used to inform the trial design for a potentially registrational program for IMVT-1402. Topline data from the current pivotal program evaluating batoclimab in thyroid eye disease (TED) now expected in the second half of calendar year 2025.\n\n\n  * **Priovant** plans to report topline data from the ongoing Phase 3 trial of brepocitinib in DM in the second half of calendar year 2025.\n  * **Genevant** Markman hearing in Pfizer / BioNTech action scheduled for December 2024. Summary judgment phase of Moderna action scheduled for second and third quarter of calendar year 2025; Moderna trial scheduled for September 2025.\n\n\n\n**Second****Quarter Ended****September 30, 2024****Financial Summary**\n\n**_Cash and Marketable Securities_**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had consolidated cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities of approximately $5.4 billion.\n\n**_Research and Development Expenses_**\n\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses increased by $28.3 million to $143.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $114.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily driven by increases in program-specific costs of $19.2 million, personnel-related expenses of $7.2 million, and share-based compensation of $1.6 million.\n\nWithin program-specific costs, the increase of $19.2 million was primarily driven by an increase in expense of $34.2 million related to the anti-FcRn franchise, partially offset by a decrease in expense of $18.6 million related to RVT-3101, which was sold to Roche in December 2023.\n\nNon-GAAP R&D expenses were $132.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $105.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n**_General and Administrative Expenses_**\n\nGeneral and administrative (G&A) expenses increased by $114.3 million to $202.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $88.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel-related expenses of $87.0 million, of which $79.1 million related to the one-time cash retention awards approved in July 2024 for each of Matthew Gline, Chief Executive Officer; Mayukh Sukhatme, President and Chief Investment Officer; and Eric Venker, President and Chief Operating Officer (the \"2024 Senior Executive Compensation Program\") and $6.6 million related to the special one-time cash retention bonus award granted to employees, following approval in December 2023. The increase was also driven by an increase in share-based compensation expense of $21.7 million, primarily due to the long-term equity incentive awards granted in July 2024 pursuant to the 2024 Senior Executive Compensation Program.\n\nNon-GAAP G&A expenses were $142.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $49.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n**_Loss from continuing operations, net of tax_**\n\nLoss from continuing operations, net of tax was $236.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a loss from continuing operations, net of tax of $244.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. On a basic and diluted per common share basis, loss from continuing operation was $0.25 and $0.28, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. Non-GAAP loss from continuing operations, net of tax was $218.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $154.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n**ROIVANT SCIENCES LTD.**  \n---  \n**Selected Balance Sheet Data**  \n _(unaudited, in thousands)_  \n**September 30, 2024**| **March 31, 2024**  \nCash, cash equivalents and restricted

Dermavant is a company dedicated to developing and commercializing innovative therapeutic solutions in immuno-dermatology. Please see our prior announcement for a summary of the [transaction terms](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=cpSHO0mQMouqRXwxvHOse0Bdy8f5Dggc7XhDqK0w-j_-BcRFu047LdM6prxzEbwhmF8oD2ayE5R0ER3DQoP_m6WUQ2II2GAmXZtundRxW2JVrU27a108hNayla03C31nQhPO1MQ3rsU-qOc2r0mkDRfpY_VgvfRCnxHlHJb2J7itSmyAhp1b0wOyjQ1XutAVj7B9_yqhG5g-ogFWf2uHNexYim42okt0f4vB_hB0Drs=).\n\nVTAMA® (tapinarof) cream, 1%, is a novel nonbiologic, non-steroidal topical therapy approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of mild, moderate, and severe plaque psoriasis in adults with no safety label warnings or precautions and without restrictions on location and duration of use or body surface area. The FDA is reviewing a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for VTAMA cream as a potential treatment for atopic dermatitis (AD) in adults and children two years of age and older, with Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action expected in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2024.\n\nPlaque psoriasis and atopic dermatitis-commonly known as eczema-are common chronic inflammatory skin diseases affecting millions of people in the U.S. and around the globe.1,2 Psoriasis presents a significant impact to quality of life and atopic dermatitis is associated with a higher disease burden for women compared to men.3,4“The future of dermatology depends on innovative treatments like VTAMA, and Organon’s acquisition of Dermavant allows us to further expand our existing portfolio of established brands and biosimilar dermatology treatments,” said Kevin Ali, Chief Executive Officer of Organon. “Integrating the expertise of Dermavant into Organon’s U.S. organization marks the beginning of a new chapter in dermatology. We are excited to bring this nonbiologic non-steroidal topical option to the millions of patients suffering from a chronic skin condition like plaque psoriasis and, potentially in the future, atopic dermatitis.”\n\n“I would like to thank Kevin and the entire Organon team for their partnership in the acquisition of Dermavant,” said Mayukh Sukhatme, MD, President and Chief Investment Officer of Roivant. “This deal represents a true win-win outcome for Organon and Roivant in our mutual goal to address patient needs and is emblematic of Roivant’s ability to form non-traditional, value-enhancing collaborations on important medicines. We believe that Organon’s strong global commercial footprint will maximize the impact of VTAMA for patients globally, and we are excited to continue to share meaningfully in the success of VTAMA along the way.”\n\n**About VTAMA****®****(tapinarof) cream, 1%** VTAMA cream is a non-steroidal once-daily topical treatment. The safety and effectiveness of VTAMA cream was evaluated in randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trials, PSOARING-1 and 2 for plaque psoriasis. The safety and efficacy of VTAMA for the treatment of atopic dermatitis was also evaluated in ADORING-1 and ADORING-2 Phase III clinical studies and is currently under review with the FDA.\n\n**Important Safety Information**\n\n**Indication:** VTAMA® (tapinarof) cream, 1% is an aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonist indicated for the topical treatment of plaque psoriasis in adults. VTAMA cream is for use on the skin (topical) only. Do not use VTAMA cream in your eyes, mouth, or vagina. **Adverse Events:** The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 1%) in subjects treated with VTAMA cream were folliculitis (red raised bumps around the hair pores), nasopharyngitis (pain or swelling in the nose and throat), contact dermatitis (skin rash or irritation, including itching and redness, peeling, burning, or stinging), headache, pruritus (itching), and influenza (flu). \n\nYou are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA.

The FDA is reviewing a Supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for VTAMA cream as a potential treatment for atopic dermatitis (AD) in adults and children two years of age and older, with Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) action expected in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2024.\n\nPsoriasis is a common chronic inflammatory skin disease affecting over 8 million Americans 20 years of age or older1 and 125 million people worldwide2. Atopic dermatitis is one of the most common inflammatory skin conditions impacting approximately 16.5 million adults and more than 9.6 million children in the U.S.3 In adults, women are impacted disproportionately4. Psoriasis presents a significant impact to quality of life5 and atopic dermatitis is associated with a higher disease burden6 for women compared to men.\n\n“We look forward to combining Dermavant’s strong dermatology commercial and field medical organization in the U.S., with Organon’s market access capabilities, regulatory expertise and worldwide commercial reach. This will allow us to bring VTAMA cream, a patient-focused innovation in dermatology, providing an effective, well-tolerated, non-steroidal treatment option to the millions of people living with plaque psoriasis and potentially atopic dermatitis,” said Kevin Ali, Organon Chief Executive Officer. “The acquisition will deliver on Organon’s objective of improving the health of women throughout their life stages by investing in treatments for conditions that affect women differently.”\n\n“This is another example of Roivant’s ability to offer creative win-win collaborations. We are able to meet Organon’s structural objectives and to create a transaction that is very attractive to both Roivant and Dermavant stakeholders, while still preserving meaningful economics tied to the potential future success of VTAMA,” said Matt Gline, Chief Executive Officer of Roivant. “Additionally, we are excited for VTAMA cream to benefit from Organon’s commercial scale. We believe they have the capabilities and reach to ensure patients globally can access this important medicine.”\n\n“This is an unparalleled opportunity for continued growth and innovation for Dermavant, preserving our values and vision and allowing them to thrive in the new structure at Organon. We set out to revolutionize the standard of care in dermatology, and we delivered—becoming the #1 branded topical for plaque psoriasis within just two months after launching VTAMA cream, and providing over 275,000 patients with the relief they desperately needed,” said Todd Zavodnick, Chief Executive Officer of Dermavant. “I am certain that this merger will provide us the scope and global scale to unleash the potential of VTAMA cream.”\n\n“We structured the deal economics to be heavily weighted towards success-based milestones and royalties, similar to other transactions we have executed to date. This is consistent with our commitment to disciplined capital allocation as we look to continue to reduce our leverage, but also strategically add growth assets,” said Matthew Walsh, Organon Chief Financial Officer.\n\n**Terms of the Transaction** Organon has agreed to acquire Dermavant for aggregate consideration of up to approximately $1.2 billion, with an upfront payment of $175 million and a $75 million milestone payment upon regulatory approval in AD, as well as payments of up to $950 million for the achievements of certain commercial milestones. In addition, Organon will pay Dermavant shareholders tiered royalties on net sales. Dermavant owns the rights to VTAMA cream globally excluding China and has out licensed Japan rights.\n\nCompletion of the transaction is subject to review under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and other customary conditions. Closing of the transaction is currently expected to take place in the fourth quarter of 2024. Upon closing of the transaction, as part of the purchase price consideration, Organon would assume Dermavant liabilities with an approximate value of $286 million reported by Roivant as of June 30, 2024, which would be subject to fair value accounting by Organon. Given the transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter 2024, revenue contribution from VTAMA as well as expenses associated with onboarding the product are not expected to impact the full year 2024 non-GAAP guidance ranges provided on August 6th, 2024. The transaction is expected to be modestly dilutive to Adjusted EBITDA in 2025, turning accretive in 2026. Organon expects net leverage to be elevated above 4.0x as a result of the transaction. The transaction is not expected to result in a revision to Organon’s capital allocation priorities.\n\nRoivant was represented by Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP as legal advisor and Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC as financial advisor. Organon was represented by Covington & Burling LLP as legal advisor.\n\n**About VTAMA® (tapinarof) cream, 1%** VTAMA cream is a non-steroidal once-daily topical treatment that works by activating aryl hydrocarbon receptors in the skin to reduce inflammation and normalize the skin barrier. The safety and effectiveness of VTAMA cream was evaluated via randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trials, PSOARING-1 and 2 for psoriasis. The safety and efficacy of VTAMA for the treatment of atopic dermatitis was also evaluated as part of the ADORING-1 and 2 Phase III clinical studies, and is currently under review with the FDA.\n\n**Important Safety Information****Indication:** VTAMA® (tapinarof) cream, 1% is an aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonist indicated for the topical treatment of plaque psoriasis in adults. VTAMA cream is for use on the skin (topical) only. Do not use VTAMA cream in your eyes, mouth, or vagina. **Adverse Events:** The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 1%) in subjects treated with VTAMA cream were folliculitis (red raised bumps around the hair pores), nasopharyngitis (pain or swelling in the nose and throat), contact dermatitis (skin rash or irritation, including itching and redness, peeling, burning, or stinging), headache, pruritus (itching), and influenza (flu). \n\nYou are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA.

Pulmovant presented data from the proof-of-concept Phase 1b ATMOS study during the ERS Congress in Vienna, Austria.\n\n“We believe mosliciguat can transform the lives of patients living with pulmonary hypertension, and I am excited to announce this potential first-in-class and best-in-category therapy. Mosliciguat has the incredibly rare advantage of potential differentiation across three separate key areas - efficacy, safety, and convenience in administration. We are impressed with the data generated so far, particularly the PVR results, and we believe its differentiated mechanism as an sGC activator can have maximal impact on PH-ILD patients, a large population with severe disease, high morbidity and mortality, and few treatment options,” said Matt Gline, Roivant’s Chief Executive Officer. “Along with the positive Graves’ data announcement at Immunovant yesterday, we feel incredibly fortunate to announce another exciting clinical update this week. As promised, we are continuing to expand our existing pipeline and remain laser-focused on clinical execution, with a number of important study readouts and milestones expected in the coming months.”\n\nMosliciguat has been extensively characterized across a robust Phase 1 program with 170 participants dosed to date, including in the ATMOS study, and based on data from these studies has the potential to show differentiation in efficacy, safety and convenience. Mosliciguat’s target, sGC, is a key enzyme in the nitric oxide (NO) / cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) signaling pathway that catalyzes cGMP production leading to increased vasodilation, reduced inflammation and apoptosis, reverse vascular remodeling and anti-fibrotic effects. Unlike sGC stimulators which require reduced heme and NO to exert their effect on sGC, mosliciguat is an sGC activator that works independently of heme and NO. This also allows mosliciguat to potentially retain efficacy in highly oxidative environments typical of PH, where stimulators are expected to lose efficacy given heme is oxidized or removed and NO levels are depleted.\n\nATMOS was a non-randomized, open-label, dose escalation, proof-of-concept Phase 1b trial that assessed the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of mosliciguat following single dose inhaled administration in participants aged between 18 and 80 years with World Health Organization (WHO) Group 1 PH (pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)) or Group 4 PH (chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH)). Overall, 38 patients received mosliciguat in this study. In the per-protocol set of patients (N=20), mosliciguat 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 mg doses led to mean-max peak reductions in PVR from baseline of -25.9%, -38.1% and -36.3%, respectively, consistently exceeding the predefined ≥ -20% threshold for the primary outcome. Notably, a similar effect on PVR was observed in the pharmacodynamic analysis set (N=37), which included participants both responsive and non-responsive to inhaled NO, suggesting that mosliciguat’s novel mechanism of action may allow for broad activity across the spectrum of PH. Data from ATMOS, a proof-of-concept trial of inhaled mosliciguat in untreated PAH or CTEPH was presented during poster session (PS) 31, poster number PA5238, at the ERS Congress today.\n\nOverall, in its Phase 1 development program in 170 healthy volunteers and PH patients, mosliciguat has shown a favorable safety profile, dose-dependent increases in cGMP and a 40-hour half-life supporting convenient dosing. Mosliciguat is unique among inhaled PH therapies, requiring just one puff once per day to deliver its potential best-in-category PVR reductions – all currently approved therapies require multiple puffs, multiple times per day. Mosliciguat is formulated for delivery via DPI, providing greater convenience to patients compared to nebulizers required for many existing inhaled PH therapies. Direct delivery to the lungs also minimizes risk of serious adverse effects seen with systemic vasodilators, such as worsening of oxygenation status. In addition to greater efficacy as evidenced by PVR in ATMOS, a generally favorable safety profile and ease of administration support the potential differentiation for mosliciguat.\n\nPulmovant will advance the clinical program to assess mosliciguat in its global Phase 2 PHocus study in patients with PH-ILD, a subgroup of Group 3 PH. Approximately 120 patients will be enrolled in the study, which will start imminently. An estimated 200,000 patients across the U.S. and Europe are living with PH-ILD and have limited or no approved treatment options. The PH-ILD prevalence is meaningfully greater than that of PAH, representing an attractive commercial opportunity with limited competition and high unmet patient need.\n\nRoivant created Pulmovant, a wholly-owned Roivant subsidiary, to in-license from Bayer exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize mosliciguat. Bayer received an upfront cash payment of ~$14.0 million, with up to an additional $280 million agreed upon for future development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments, as well as tiered high-single digit sales-based royalties.\n\n**Investor Call**\n\nA conference call and webcast will be held at 8:00 AM EDT on Tuesday, September 10, 2024, to discuss these updates.

Immunovant also disclosed data from several proprietary market research studies that showed a consistent unmet need among ATD treated patients who are intolerant to, uncontrolled on or relapsed after ATDs. Finally, Immunovant also announced alignment with the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) and Investigational New Drug Application (IND) clearance with initiation of a pivotal trial of IMVT-1402 in GD expected by December 31, 2024.\n\nAs previously disclosed, the batoclimab phase 2a trial in uncontrolled GD enrolled patients who were hyperthyroid despite ATD therapy. Participants in the trial received 12 weeks of high dose batoclimab, 680 mg weekly by subcutaneous injection (SC) followed by 12 weeks of lower dose batoclimab, 340 mg weekly SC. At the end of the first 12 weeks, participants experienced a mean IgG reduction of 77% leading to a 76% Response rate (defined as T3 and T4 falling below the upper limit of normal (ULN) without increasing the ATD dose). In addition, by the end of 12 weeks of higher dose batoclimab, 56% achieved an ATD-Free Response (defined as T3 and T4 falling below the ULN and the patient simultaneously tapering completely off their ATD). Despite benefiting from a lower starting IgG level after 12 weeks of 680mg therapy, during Weeks 13 to 24, the lower 340mg dose of batoclimab resulted in mean IgG reduction of 65% (vs. 77% on 680mg dose) with a correspondingly lower responder rate of 68%. In addition, a lower ATD-Free Response rate of 36% was also observed in the second 12 weeks. Finally, patients who achieved at least a 70% IgG reduction at the end of the trial had nearly a threefold higher ATD-Free Response rate than those who did not (60% vs. 23%).\n\n“We are thrilled to share these updates today which we believe validate a large and important degree of unmet medical need in patients uncontrolled on ATDs and which we believe demonstrate strong response rates in this same population,” said Pete Salzmann, M.D., chief executive officer of Immunovant. “We find the correlation between clinical response and IgG lowering impressive and believe this creates not only a potential first-in-class but also a potential best-in-class opportunity for IMVT-1402. We are very pleased to have aligned with the FDA on a pivotal trial design that we expect to initiate by the end of the year.”\n\n**Webcast Details**\n\nImmunovant will host a webcast at 8:00 a.m. ET today to discuss these updates. **Please click**[**here**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=7e3rgfCOpBMxfEmiEHv4aOdO72GM7GIZdJBa72H5HyDidv16LHEoV9x8MGeNmjGB91ScIB_5wYMvKB2eAZvy4O1wBpkwahpt6hcP6C6Gm6M=)**to register for the event.** The live webcast will also be available under the [News & Events](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=9_8E4Nve1hanSn-eV250-F_bpPHDmGXs14L5OBrNsNn3Ko0CcAWCdFTE8aFTyFlmjq4kfC3XVFFeuTVe5WaRxo1woiaVYgbCHITsebUe2Rg4s98QflWbiex7gBxvfIT3) section of Immunovant’s website.

Today, Roivant’s pipeline includes VTAMA, a novel topical approved for the treatment of psoriasis and in development for the treatment of atopic dermatitis; IMVT-1402 and batoclimab, fully human monoclonal antibodies targeting the neonatal Fc receptor (“FcRn”) in development across several IgG-mediated autoimmune indications; and brepocitinib, a potent small molecule inhibitor of TYK2 and JAK1 for the treatment of dermatomyositis and non-infectious uveitis, in addition to other clinical stage molecules. We advance our pipeline by creating nimble subsidiaries or “Vants” to develop and commercialize our medicines and technologies. Beyond therapeutics, Roivant also incubates discovery-stage companies and health technology startups complementary to its biopharmaceutical business.
