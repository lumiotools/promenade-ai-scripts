A reconciliation of such non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measure is included on page 44 of\nthis presentation. You are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment to non-GAAP financial measures and the reasons management considers it appropriate for supplemental analysis. Cartesian and the Companies believe that the use\nof these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends. Our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future\nresults will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.
