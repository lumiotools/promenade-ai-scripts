Announces Revenue Generation in Home Care Market with AI-Driven Solutions that Meet Urgent Needs\")\n\n### 33,000 Home Care Target Market Represents Significant Revenue Potential\n\nDETROIT, Nov. 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Amesite Inc. (NASDAQ: AMST), a leading technology company specializing in AI-driven solutions for B2C and B2B markets, announced today that it is generating revenue in the home care market.\n\nThe need for enhanced technology in the home care sector is critical. With staff turnover, documentation requirements and operational costs presenting significant challenges to home care agencies, the application of AI-driven solutions becomes essential to meet the demand for accessible care. In the United States alone, approximately 77% of home care clients are turned away due to workforce and resource limitations1, and putting more stress on family members trying to provide necessary care for their loved ones.\n\nBoth independently-owned and franchisee home care businesses represent major opportunities for revenue growth. The National Association for Home Care and Hospice reports 33,000 home care and hospice organizations across the U.S2. Additionally, the home care industry employed roughly 1.4 million workers in 20233. The population of Americans aged 65 and older expanded significantly throughout the 20th century, rising from 3.1 million in 1900 to 35 million by 20004. By 2030, all members of the Baby Boomer generation will be 65 or older. As the number of Americans living with Alzheimer’s disease rises, projected to increase from 6 million today to over 13 million by 2050, the demand for home-based elder care is set to surge significantly. [Urgently needed growth in this sector is limited by workforce shortages and high operational costs, making AI-driven efficiency tools both necessary and timely.](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=tDmWYsNKwOYpzzJdY1y7EP4FtVr6R53OP9qe5akSZEIf6edoFnZD39_S9krf-zJ_w6t9sgzWQa0sWaF5D7ZnWV902DHcl38myer-WI4m0TDtuepnN-oLjAQbpFCRk5vmX0lEyEvXdhj7vbDmtvN7kOQKYpNKem5po-YUsnvIGu7wFRzXho-w6JKNV6vDcwzPVptkVOsiyhF2b7LCZV4T_GfiYOSCFSzjqtMnT4YifobSBVaZLMW0US3-2ai8PKdBlOP3D2xyJ9DUuDrL1uiHRVW4ih1liU5ynZeQgxvqVrtOksvRZ0xq4yR9lCEe7E0XiDQ7v0f5ObxKdwlcBUVwwo_HnXKnxTWFyV8y82YQhxir2pLpUMG8nZcB6Cz2yuFnE1oMtZCswjggBvySVEih8w== \"Opens in a new window\")\n\nBrandon Owens, Amesite’s VP of Sales, said, “Independently-owned agencies have seen the value of our solution.

These professions collectively represent 13M individuals in the United States.\n\n[Amesite is presently piloting the enterprise tool with long-term care companies.](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=aHSUE0UUy8cZn__00DXQD7IzyTZDqoBKJZJdgsBLDyeyMtawFpvAu2T4RYneMJuxpYepFMSR8JIswB9gXTlpvv-4UjL_FuLZ2tOaUAgSYJqxvgFGThQkBfmjnEASbulOuMxfeZFVM7I751jAkFMcdrflDQKV9WbqDzsxyEK4rfJWPmvJSebpllTKNQAjKXEw5osntLI8e16SdQ5zMyrpMigPQAv3RhWnRLhz2Ez_tXq9LlTZqgoNVNXBamdRB3FbO5UVdbzeboMu_0UCnNN1W-nbA7a0XNh6cECNVIPxw18= \"Opens in a new window\") Long term care markets are enormous, spanning skilled nursing, home health care, assisted living, hospice & palliative care and others, comprising over $490 billion in value.

Turnover, for example, is both rampant and expensive, with 80% of employees leaving within their first 100 days on staff, costing an agency with 100 workers over $420,000 per year in replacement costs alone. Over 700,000 job openings for home health and personal care aides are anticipated each year over the next decade.\n\nNurseMagic™ enables organizations to deploy one app for their entire workforce while providing the specific functionalities employees need. This capability reduces complexity and eliminates the need for extensive menus and training typically required with many enterprise software platforms. Most electronic health record (EHR) and electronic medical record (EMR) systems are difficult to navigate, with complex menus and permissions that require training to use. NurseMagic™ simplifies this process by delivering only what users need and eliminating the need for complex navigation.\n\nBrandon Owens, Amesite’s Vice President of Sales, said, “With NurseMagic, enterprises can license a single app and be confident that it will meet the diverse needs of employees in different professions. Instead of overwhelming users with unnecessary menus and requiring extensive training, NurseMagic can dynamically serve the functionality each person requires – saving both time and costs, and enabling any user in the organization to improve their performance using the app.”\n\nSai Nittala, Amesite’s Senior AI Manager, commented, “We decided to completely rethink how users in healthcare experience software. Our solution enables each and every user to have a personalized experience – prioritizing radical ease-of-use. Instead of training users to adapt to the app, NurseMagic™ dynamically follows the user, offering personalized experiences that are customized to their enterprise, profession and tasks.”\n\nAmesite CEO Dr. Ann Marie Sastry said, “This significant update provides development and deployment cost savings for organizations, as one platform can be customized and delivered to employees across all sectors. By offering a single, streamlined solution, Amesite helps enterprises operate more efficiently, allowing them to focus on delivering patient care.”\n\nView a short video explainer on this release by Amesite CEO Dr. Ann Marie Sastry here: [https://youtu.be/aWpjhtA33c](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=oePNLIkXYPr16FaJDPWg3pe44GgglVYReR7RKx9pcIFxmvayLtYkWqw715BV4YxenwiTGiOJCwZ6Nmnf420wNv9dEqbHsdyVay346a-yEWw= \"Opens in a new window\")\n\nPricing is available by contacting Amesite at [https://www.nursemagic.ai/pricing](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=oePNLIkXYPr16FaJDPWg3txBwLIAfKPaJ_xpVPxIK4nesl_iMeAxNYrP-cC1i5q-1C6kBsc1WVk1MXZN7wzaQejRVTtqyQhc4ZlQg4_CZoFYAGbaJVjjJEoZRnbBfO4A \"Opens in a new window\").\n\n**About Amesite Inc.**\n\nAmesite Inc.

(NASDAQ: AMST), a pioneering technology company specializing in the development and marketing of B2C and B2B AI-driven solutions, announced today the release of its 2025 Home Health Care Outlook report. The report provides an analysis of the current state of home health care and insights for organizations seeking to navigate the challenges and opportunities in 2025.\n\nBrandon Owens, VP of Sales at Amesite, said, “As home health care organizations enter budget season, they can use this report to help them understand the impacts of errors, burnout, and turnover – and adopt new solutions. Supporting workers directly without changing IT or other infrastructure can simultaneously improve patient care, reduce costs and drive revenue. Companies in our sector already turn away 25% of their potential contracts and clients – this report details why they experience these ‘employee bleeds’, and enables them to understand how our NurseMagicTM solution meets their needs.”\n\n[Amesite recently announced the launch of pilot programs for five home health and skilled nursing facilities](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ONrgAufcWIVJK4EKa--vLf1uUsrY70I8VXLZYJUVMVqMVX_8KfVRM4UEm90H5cQFQx_ujwHRWiYkQHN8IED_shpsnEwxwNwjr9uokGRsTE0O9Kjaum_cS3oK3I5sb1edfnQWnvEVnv4EgcR4P9YSqHmfd-Lo88Ra-dBPNhKwo_fNlYUh-7E2n_o5uDgi3-zgJZMDl9YyCuL1GLJaEUmkzc7RVQMk6dtTqf-e6ZNML1Jj2qurjUW02L9QjZH_bAZYQsCequHZETtuSUoMZzbeOufGLy29mQaKB7bwXGH-yRLP02sLnIjf4EjL_oRoGNhpwz8HKAvhOdnC4s3f-kCWQw== \"Opens in a new window\"), collectively employing over 30,000 healthcare professionals in the US. Early results are promising, with users reporting faster reimbursements, improved patient care, and significantly reduced workforce costs.\n\nLou Andriotti, CEO of Vista Springs, said, “NurseMagic is nothing short of revolutionary. It effortlessly transforms the way we deliver care—from drafting complex nursing and care notes in seconds, where it used to take hours, to empowering staff with seamless, positive communication techniques. My team is leveraging NurseMagic across a multitude of functions, and the impact has been extraordinary. We are beyond thrilled to have access to such an innovative tool and deeply appreciative of Amesite for creating this groundbreaking product. It aligns flawlessly with our unwavering commitment to delivering world-class, compassionate care.”\n\nAs the home health care industry continues its rapid growth—projected to expand from $100 billion in 2024 to $176 billion by 2032—the industry report highlights the sector's ongoing staffing shortages and high turnover rates. The report estimates that the average home health agency with only 100 employees pays annual turnover costs of over $423,000 per year.\n\nAmesite Founder & CEO, Dr. Ann Marie Sastry said, “Our team aggregated this data to support the industry – and we’re finding that it aligns perfectly with our experience in our pilot programs with enterprises around the nation. Every home care business needs to adopt solutions for employees, and also to leverage AI – NurseMagicTM enables them to do both in a single app.”\n\nFor more information on NurseMagic™ and to download the full 2025 Home Health Care Outlook report, visit [www.nursemagic.ai/home-health-care-report](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=bFLfa3BGcY1Ln92sDhvVFKYJo9t7uQsleZLzkwsct6OPgeftWMkYvdYvJBOvrWuaN3dQhs4lMkKPXkqdpYdwUn6-A-2s0wsEGVkXsrkN7LZx1pUCKQqImdP55It98rkvK4O82Ish6ixW-qa7PSRQ5iBsOjPI1j7j-mz80_epLEA= \"Opens in a new window\")\n\n**About Amesite Inc.**\n\nAmesite Inc.

Words such as “may,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “predicts,” “potential,” “continue,”\n“expects,” “anticipates,” “future,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates,” and similar expressions, as well as statements in future tense, identify forward-looking\nstatements. Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results and may not be accurate indications of when such performance or\nresults will be achieved. Forward-looking statements are based on information we have when those statements are made or management’s good faith belief as of that time with\nrespect to future events, and are subject to a number of risks, and uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those\nexpressed in or suggested by the forward-looking statements. These risks are more fully described in the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The\nfollowing is a summary of such risks:\n● our planned online machine learning platform’s ability to enable universities and other clients to offer timely, improved popular courses and certification\nprograms, without becoming software tech companies;\n● our planned online machine learning platform’s ability to result in opportunistic incremental revenue for colleges, universities and other clients, and improved\nability to garner state funds due to increased retention and graduation rates through use of machine learning and natural language processing;\n● our ability to continue as a going concern;\n● our ability to obtain additional funds for our operations;\n● our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our technologies and our ability to operate our business without infringing the intellectual\nproperty rights of others;\n● our reliance on third parties to conduct our business and studies;\n● our reliance on third party designers, suppliers, and partners to provide and maintain our learning platform;\n● our ability to attract and retain qualified key management and technical personnel;\n● our expectations regarding the time during which we will be an emerging growth company under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS Act;\n● our financial performance;\n● the impact of government regulation and developments relating to our competitors or our industry; and\n● other risks and uncertainties, including those listed under the caption “Risk Factors.”\nThese statements relate to future events or our future operational or financial performance, and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that\nmay cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these\nforward-looking statements. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, among other things, those listed under the section titled\n“Item 1A. Risk Factors” and elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nAny forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q reflect our current view with respect to future events and are subject to these and other risks,\nuncertainties and assumptions relating to our business, results of operations, industry and future growth. Given these uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on these\nforward-looking statements. No forward-looking statement is a guarantee of future performance. You should read this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and the documents that\nwe reference herein and have filed as exhibits hereto completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from any future results\nexpressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements for any\nreason, even if new information becomes available in the future.\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q also contains, or may contain, estimates, projections and other information concerning our industry, our business and the markets\nfor our products, including data regarding the estimated size of those markets and their projected growth rates. Information that is based on estimates, forecasts, projections or\nsimilar methodologies is inherently subject to uncertainties and actual events or circumstances may differ materially from events and circumstances reflected in this\ninformation.

(the “Company”) was incorporated in November 2017. Amesite is a pioneering technology company specializing in the development and marketing of B2C and\nB2B AI-driven solutions, including its higher ed platform that offers professional learning. Leveraging its proprietary AI infrastructure, Amesite offers cutting-edge applications\nthat cater to both individual and professional needs. NurseMagic™, the company’s mobile healthcare app, streamlines creation of nursing notes and documentation tasks,\nenhances patient communication, and offers personalized guidance to nurses on patient care, medications, and handling challenging workplace situations.\nNote 2 - Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe condensed financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America\n(“GAAP”) and considering the requirements of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The Company has a fiscal year with a June 30 year end.\nIn the opinion of management, the condensed financial statements of the Company as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023 include all adjustments and accruals, consisting only of normal, recurring accrual adjustments, which are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim\nperiods. These interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year.\nCertain information and footnote disclosures normally included in condensed financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed in or omitted from\nthis report pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. These condensed financial statements should be read together with the financial statements and notes thereto\nincluded in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern, which\ncontemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.\nThe Company is developing its customer base and has not completed its efforts to establish a stabilized source of revenue sufficient to cover its expenses. The Company has\nhad a history of net losses and negative cash flows from operating activities since inception and expects to continue to incur net losses and use cash in its operations in the\nforeseeable future.\nThe assessment of the Company’s ability to meet its future obligations is inherently judgmental, subjective and susceptible to change. Based on their current forecast,\nmanagement believes that it may not have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to maintain the Company’s planned operations for the next twelve months following the issuance\nof these condensed financial statements.\n-7-\nThe Company has considered both quantitative and qualitative factors that are known or reasonably known as of the date of these condensed financial statements are issued and\nconcluded that there are conditions present in the aggregate that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. In response to the\nconditions, management plans include generating cash by completing financing transactions, which may include offerings of common stock. However, these plans are subject\nto market conditions, and are not within the Company’s control, and therefore, cannot be deemed probable. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in\nimplementing their plans. As a result, the Company has concluded that management’s plans do not alleviate substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a\ngoing concern. The condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and\nclassification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of condensed financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting\nperiod. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The total amount of bank deposits (checking\nand savings accounts) insured by the FDIC at the period ended September 30, 2024 was $250,000.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost. The straight-line method is used for computing depreciation and amortization. Assets are depreciated over their estimated useful\nlives. The cost of leasehold improvements is depreciated (amortized) over the lesser of the length of the related leases or the estimated useful lives of the assets. Costs of\nmaintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred.\nDepreciable Life - Years\nLeasehold improvements Shorter of estimated lease term or 10 years\nFurniture and fixtures 7 years\nComputer equipment and software 5 years\nCapitalized Software Costs\nThe Company capitalizes costs incurred in the development of software for its customers, including the costs of the software, materials, consultants, and payroll and payroll\nrelated costs for employees incurred in developing computer software. Software development projects generally include three stages: the preliminary project stage (all costs are\nexpensed as incurred), the application development stage (certain costs are capitalized and certain costs are expensed as incurred) and the post-implementation/operation stage\n(all costs are expensed as incurred). Capitalization of costs requires judgment in determining when a project has reached the application development stage, the proportion of\ntime spent in the application development stage, and the period over which we expect to benefit from the use of that software. Once the software is placed in service, these costs\nare amortized on the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which is generally three years.\n-8-\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30\n2024 2023\nBeginning capitalized software $ 3,993,691 $ 3,618,990\nAdditions 148,000 65,200\nEnding capitalized software $ 4,141,691 $ 3,684,190\nBeginning accumulated amortization $ 3,348,863 $ 2,840,545\nAmortization expense 111,939 146,020\nEnding accumulated amortization $ 3,460,802 $ 2,986,565\nCapitalized software - net $ 680,889 $ 697,625\nAmortization expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $111,939 and $146,020, respectively and included as part of “Technology and content\ndevelopment” in the Statements of Operations.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate our revenue from contractual arrangements with businesses, colleges and universities to provide a comprehensive platform of integrated technology and\ntechnology enabled services related to product offerings. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized revenue from contracts with customers\nof $11,250 and $63,333, respectively, related to services provided over time.\nPerformance Obligations and Timing of Recognition\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance\nobligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied.\nThis performance obligation is satisfied as the partners receive and consume benefits, which occur ratably over the contract term.\nOccasionally, we provide professional services, such as custom development, non-complex implementation activities, training, and other various professional services. We\nevaluate these services to determine if they are distinct and separately identifiable in the context of the contract. In our contracts with customers that contain multiple\nperformance obligations as a result of this assessment, we allocate the transaction price to each separate performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis.\nStandalone selling prices of our solutions and services are typically estimated based on observable transactions when the solutions or services are sold on a standalone basis.\nWhen standalone selling prices are not observable, we utilize a cost-plus margin approach to allocate the transaction price.\nWe also receive fees that are fixed in nature, such as annual license and maintenance charges, in place of or in conjunction with variable consideration. The fees are recognized\nratably over the service period of the contract that the Company’s platform is made available to the customer (i.e., the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the\nbenefit of the software over the contract service period).\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, all revenue recognized has been recognized over the related contract periods. For the three months ended September\n30, 2024, one customer represents 100% of total revenue.\nAccounts Receivable, Contract Assets, and Deferred Liabilities\nBalance sheet items related to contracts consist of accounts receivable (net), contract assets, and deferred liabilities on our condensed balance sheets. Accounts receivable is\nstated at net realizable value, and we utilize the allowance method to provide for doubtful accounts based on management’s evaluation of the collectability of the amounts due.\nOur estimates are reviewed and revised periodically based on historical collection experience and a review of the current status of accounts receivable. Historically, actual\nwrite-offs for uncollectible accounts have not significantly differed from prior estimates. There was no allowance for doubtful accounts on accounts receivable balances as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 or June 30, 2024.\n-9-\nWe may recognize revenue prior to billing a customer when we have satisfied or partially satisfied our performance obligations as billings to our customers may not be made\nuntil after the service period has commenced. As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 we do not have any such contract assets.\nDeferred liabilities as of each balance sheet date represent the excess of amounts billed or received as compared to amounts recognized in revenue on our condensed statements\nof operations as of the end of the reporting period, and such amounts are reflected as a current liability on our condensed balance sheets as deferred revenue. We generally\nreceive payments prior to completion of the service period and our performance obligations. These payments are recorded as deferred liability until the services are delivered or\nuntil our obligations are otherwise met, at which time revenue is recognized.\nSome contracts also involve annual license fees, for which upfront amounts are received from customers. In these contracts, the license fees received in advance of the\nplatform’s launch are recorded as deferred liabilities.\nThe following table provides information on the changes in the balance of deferred liabilities:\nThree Months Ended\nDeferred Revenue September 30\n2024 2023\nOpening balance $ 0 $ 53,948\nPlus billings 35,625 33,750\nLess revenue recognized (11,250) (63,323)\nClosing balance $ 24,375 $ 24,375\nRevenue recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 that was included in the deferred revenue balance that existed in the opening balance of each\nyear was approximately $0 and $26,250, respectively.\nThe deferred revenue balance as of September 30, 2024 is expected to be recognized over the next 7 months.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe have issued four types of stock-based awards under our stock plans: stock options, restricted stock units, deferred stock units, and stock warrants. All stock-based awards\ngranted to employees, directors and independent contractors are measured at fair value at each grant date. We rely on the Black-Scholes option pricing model for estimating the\nfair value of stock-based awards granted, and expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company’s stock prices. Stock options generally vest over two years\nfrom the grant date and generally have ten-year contractual terms. Restricted stock units generally have a term of 12 months from the closing date of the agreement. Stock\nwarrants issued have a term of five years. Information about the assumptions used in the calculation of stock-based compensation expense is set forth in Note 3 in the Notes to\nCondensed Financial Statements.\nTechnology and Content Development\nTechnology and content development expenditures consist primarily of personnel and personnel-related expense and contracted services associated with the maintenance of our\nplatform as well as hosting and licensing costs and are charged to expense as incurred. It also includes amortization of capitalized software costs and research and development\ncosts related to improving our platform and creating content that are charged to expense as incurred.\n-10-\nFair Value Measurements\nAccounting standards require certain assets and liabilities be reported at fair value in the condensed financial statements and provide a framework for establishing that fair\nvalue. The framework for determining fair value is based on a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value.\nFair values determined by Level 1 inputs use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access.\nFair values determined by Level 2 inputs use other inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly. These Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and\nliabilities in active markets and other inputs such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals.\nLevel 3 inputs are unobservable inputs, including inputs that are available in situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the related asset. These Level 3 fair value\nmeasurements are based primarily on management’s own estimates using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques.\nIn instances wherein inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels in the above fair value hierarchy, fair value measurements in their entirety are categorized based\non the lowest level input that is significant to the valuation. The Company’s assessment of the significance of particular inputs to these fair value measurements requires\njudgment and considers factors specific to each asset or liability.\nIncome Taxes\nA current tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the year. Deferred tax liabilities or assets are recognized for the\nestimated future tax effects of temporary differences between financial reporting and tax accounting.\nDeferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets\nand liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or\nsettled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the statement of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.\nNet Loss per Share\nAt September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the Company had 636,577 and 633,000 potentially dilutive shares of common stock related to common stock options and warrants,\nrespectively, as determined using the if-converted method. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the dilutive effect of common stock options and common\nstock warrants has not been included in the average shares outstanding for the calculation of net loss per share as the effect would be anti-dilutive as a result of our net losses in\nthese periods.\nSubsequent Events\nThe Company evaluated subsequent events through the date of this Form 10-Q and has determined that no events have occurred that would require recognition or disclosure in\nthe condensed financial statements.\nRisks and Uncertainties\nThe Company operates in an industry subject to rapid change. The Company’s operations will be subject to significant risk and uncertainties including financial, operational,\ntechnological, and other risks associated with an early-stage company, including the potential risk of business failure.\nNote 3 - Stock-Based Compensation\nThe Company’s Equity Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) permits the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and deferred stock units\nto officers, employees, directors, consultants, agents, and independent contractors of the Company. The Company believes that such awards align the interests of its employees,\ndirectors, and consultants with those of its stockholders.\n-11-\nOption awards are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of the Company’s stock at the date of grant; those option awards generally vest over four\nyears from the grant date and generally have ten-year contractual terms. Certain option awards provide for accelerated vesting (as defined in the Plan).\nThe Company estimates the fair value of each option award using a Black Scholes Model (“BSM”). Expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of comparable\ncompanies. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise within the valuation model or estimates the expected option exercise when historical data is\nunavailable. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The Company has not\npaid any dividends on common stock since its inception and does not anticipate paying dividends on its common stock in the foreseeable future. When calculating the amount\nof annual compensation expense, the Company has elected not to estimate forfeitures and instead accounts for forfeitures as they occur.\nNo options were granted for the three months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. As of September 30, 2024, there were approximately $50,052 of total unrecognized\ncompensation costs for employees and non-employees related to nonvested options. These costs are expected to be recognized through December 2026.\nA summary of options that vested in the three months ended September 30, 2024 is presented below:\nWeighted\nAverage\nWeighted Remaining\nAverage Contractual\nNumber of Exercise Term\nOptions Shares Price (in years)\nOutstanding at July 1, 2024 235,219 22.05 5.46\nAdditional vesting 3,577 9.50 8.23\nOutstanding and expected to vest at September 30, 2024 238,796 20.96 5.29\nOn September 29, 2021, the board of directors approved changes to our director compensation program for fiscal year 2022 and beyond. The board instituted an annual cash\nretainer for directors in the amount of $48,000 per director with an additional retainer for the chair of our Compensation Committee and Audit Committee of $7,500 and\n$10,000, respectively. Directors can choose to receive deferred stock units in lieu of cash payments. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, $62,500 in deferred stock\nunits were awarded and $13,875 in cash compensation was accrued.\nOn May 3, 2024, the board of directors of the Company approved an amendment to the Company’s 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2018 Plan”) to increase the number of\nshares available for issuance under the 2018 Plan by 508,488 shares and increase the number of shares that may be issued pursuant to the exercise of incentive stock options\nby 508,488 shares. The amendment to the 2018 Plan is intended to ensure that the Company can continue to provide an incentive to employees, directors and consultants by\nenabling them to share in the Company’s future growth. If approved by the stockholders, all of the additional shares would be available for grant as incentive stock options\nwithin the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), or as nonqualified stock options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation\nrights, or other kinds of equity-based compensation available under the 2018 Plan. The amendment to the 2018 Plan was approved by the Company’s stockholders at the\nCompany’s special meeting on June 18, 2024.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company has 822,524 shares of common stock available for granting under the Plan.\nOn August 1, 2024, the Company issued 250,000 shares of common stock to a consultant under an agreement for activities related to potential future financing. The $720,000\nmarket value of those shares is reflected in the Company’s common stock and additional paid in capital accounts and has been capitalized as deferred issuance costs and shown\nas a current asset as of September 30, 2024. These costs will be recognized as an expense against the proceeds of a potential future equity issuance, or amortized over the life of\nthe debt of a potential future debt issuance, or if an equity or debt transaction is not executed, then expensed at the conclusion of the contract with the consultant in July 2025.\nNote 4 - Warrants\nAs of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, there were 397,781 warrants outstanding.\nThe Company measures the fair value of warrants using the Black-Scholes Model. No warrants have been issued during the three months ended September 30, 2024 or the year\nended June 30, 2024.\nNote 5 - Income Taxes\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and prior periods since inception, the Company’s activities have not generated taxable income or tax liabilities. Accordingly,\nthe Company has not recognized an income tax benefit on the Condensed Statements of Operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nThe Company has approximately $28.4 million of net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future income taxes, of which approximately $17,000 of net operating\nloss carryforwards expire in 2037. Due to uncertainty as to the realization of the net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets as a result of the Company’s\nlimited operating history and operating losses since inception, a full valuation allowance has been recorded against the Company’s deferred tax assets.\n-12-\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our unaudited condensed financial statements and\nrelated notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited financial statements and related notes for the year ended June 30, 2024 included in\nour Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, on September 30, 2024. In addition to historical information, this discussion and\nanalysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these\nforward-looking statements as a result of certain factors. We discuss factors that we believe could cause or contribute to these differences below and elsewhere in this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q, including those factors set forth in the section entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and in the section entitled “Risk\nFactors” in Part II, Item 1A.\nOverview\nThe following discussion highlights our results of operations and the principal factors that have affected our financial condition as well as our liquidity and capital resources for\nthe three months ended September 30, 2024 and provides information that management believes is relevant for an assessment and understanding of the statements of financial\ncondition and results of operations presented herein. The following discussion and analysis are based on our unaudited condensed financial statements contained in this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which we have prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and the requirements of the\nSEC. You should read the discussion and analysis together with such financial statements and the related notes thereto.\nThe Company is developing its customer base and has not completed its efforts to establish a stabilized source of revenue sufficient to cover its expenses. The Company has\nhad a history of net losses and negative cash flows from operating activities since inception and expects to continue to incur net losses and use cash in its operations in the\nforeseeable future.\nWe are not currently profitable, and we cannot provide any assurance that we will ever be profitable. We incurred a net loss of $908,045 for the three months ended September\n30, 2024, and we incurred a net loss of $38.7 million for the period from November 14, 2017 (date of incorporation) to September 30, 2024.\nThe assessment of the Company’s ability to meet its future obligations is inherently judgmental, subjective and susceptible to change. Based on their current forecast,\nmanagement believes that it will have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to maintain the Company’s planned operations for the next twelve months following the issuance of\nthese condensed financial statements; however, there is uncertainty in the forecast and therefore the Company cannot assert that it is probable. The Company has considered\nboth quantitative and qualitative factors that are known or reasonably knowable as of the date of these condensed financial statements are issued and concluded that there are\nconditions present in the aggregate that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.\nIn response to the conditions, management plans include generating cash by completing financing transactions, which may include offerings of common stock. However, these\nplans are subject to market conditions, and are not within the Company’s control, and therefore, cannot be deemed probable. There is no assurance that the Company will be\nsuccessful in implementing their plans. As a result, the Company has concluded that management’s plans do not alleviate substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to\ncontinue as a going concern.\nFinancial Position, Liquidity, and Capital Resources\nWe are not currently profitable, and we cannot provide any assurance that we will ever be profitable. We incurred a net loss of $908,045 for the three months ended September\n30, 2024, and we incurred a net loss of $37.8 million for the period from November 14, 2017 (date of incorporation) to September 30, 2024.\nDuring the period from November 14, 2017 (date of incorporation) to September 30, 2020, we raised net proceeds of approximately $11,760,000 from private placement\nfinancing transactions (stock and debt). On September 25, 2020, we completed the Offering of 250,000 shares of our common stock, $0.0001 par value per share, at an offering\nprice of $60.00 per share (total net proceeds of approximately $12.8 million after underwriting discounts, commissions, and other offering costs).\n-13-\nOn August 2, 2021, we entered into a purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC (“Lincoln Park”), under which, subject to\nspecified terms and conditions, we may sell up to $16.5 million shares of common stock. Our net proceeds under the Purchase Agreement will depend on the frequency of sales\nand the number of shares sold to Lincoln Park and the prices at which we sell shares to Lincoln Park. On August 2, 2021, we sold 63,260 shares of our common stock to\nLincoln Park in an initial purchase under the Purchase Agreement for a total purchase price of $1,500,000. We also issued 12,727 shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park\nas consideration for its irrevocable commitment to purchase our common stock under the Purchase Agreement.\nOn February 16, 2022, we closed on a public offering of common stock and received approximately $2.51 million of cash proceeds, net of underwriting discounts,\ncommissions, and other offering costs.\nOn September 1, 2022, we closed on a public offering of common stock and concurrent private placement of warrants and received approximately $1.85 million of cash\nproceeds, net of underwriting discounts, commissions, and other offering costs.\nAs of September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalent balance totaled $1,434,753.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern, which\ncontemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.\nThe Company is developing its customer base and has not completed its efforts to establish a stabilized source of revenue sufficient to cover its expenses. The Company has\nhad a history of net losses and negative cash flows from operating activities since inception and expects to continue to incur net losses and use cash in its operations in the\nforeseeable future.\nThe assessment of the Company’s ability to meet its future obligations is inherently judgmental, subjective and susceptible to change. Based on their current forecast,\nmanagement believes that it may not have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to maintain the Company’s planned operations for the next twelve months following the issuance\nof these condensed financial statements.\nThe Company has considered both quantitative and qualitative factors that are known or reasonably known as of the date of these condensed financial statements are issued and\nconcluded that there are conditions present in the aggregate that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. In response to the\nconditions, management plans include generating cash by completing financing transactions, which may include offerings of common stock. However, these plans are subject\nto market conditions, and are not within the Company’s control, and therefore, cannot be deemed probable. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in\nimplementing their plans. As a result, the Company has concluded that management’s plans do not alleviate substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a\ngoing concern. The condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and\nclassification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nThis management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our condensed financial statements, which have been prepared in\naccordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these condensed financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets\nand liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the\nreported period. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the\ncircumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates if conditions differ from our assumptions. While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in\nNote 2 in the “Notes to Condensed Financial Statements,” we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates\nin preparation of our condensed financial statements.\n-14-\nCash, Cash Equivalents, including US Treasury Market Fund\nAs of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 our cash and cash equivalents totaled $1,434,753 and $2.071,016, respectively with the majority invested in a short-term US\nTreasury Fund returning approximately 4.2. The Fund is invested in US Treasuries with a 7-day liquidity. The decision to allocate funds to the short-term US Treasury Fund is\nbased on our investment strategy, which prioritizes liquidity and stability while receiving current rate returns. The returns from the fund for the three months ended September\n30, 2024 were 4.2% and in line with our expectations and the broader market trends for similar investment vehicles. We continuously monitor our investment portfolio,\nconsidering market conditions and our liquidity needs, ensuring alignment with our broader financial strategy and risk tolerance.\nInternally Developed Capitalized Software\nWe capitalize certain costs related to the development of software for our customers, primarily consisting of direct labor and third-party vendor costs associated with creating\nthe software. Software development projects generally include three stages: the preliminary project stage (all costs are expensed as incurred), the application development stage\n(certain costs are capitalized and certain costs are expensed as incurred) and the post-implementation/operation stage (all costs are expensed as incurred). Costs capitalized in\nthe application development stage include costs related to the design and implementation of the selected software components, software build and configuration infrastructure,\nand software interfaces. Capitalization of costs requires judgment in determining when a project has reached the application development stage, the proportion of time spent in\nthe application development stage, and the period over which we expect to benefit from the use of that software. Once the software is placed in service, these costs are\namortized on the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which is generally three years.\nThe Company capitalized software of $148,000 and $374,700 and recognized amortization expense of $111,939 and $508,318 for the three months ended September 30, 2024\nand year ended June 30, 2024, respectively.\nResults of Operations\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate substantially all our revenue from contractual arrangements with businesses, colleges and universities and K-12 schools to provide a comprehensive platform of\ntightly integrated technology and technology enabled services related to product offerings. Revenue related to our licensing arrangements is generally recognized ratably over\nthe contract term commencing upon platform delivery. Revenue related to licensing arrangements recognized in a given time period will consist of contracts that went live in\nthe current period or that went live in previous periods and are currently ongoing.\nWe have recorded accounts receivable of $0 and $30,600 as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. We have set up deferred revenue liabilities at the end of\neach period to reflect performance obligations to be performed in future periods for our services delivered over time. Future obligations related to deferred revenue totaled\n$24,375 and $0 as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 respectively.\nThe majority of our customers are private and public learning institutions across various domestic regions. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, one customer\ncomprised 100% of total revenue.\nRevenue\nWe generated revenues of $11,250 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to $63,333 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n-15-\nWe have strongly pivoted to grow our customer base while reducing risk and losses, resulting in a larger client base, a short-term reduction in overall revenue and a dramatic\nreduction in cash burn. Larger, cash-upfront deals were struggling to produce sustainable revenue, as administrative barriers within nonprofits, high price points set by\ncustomers, and inability or unwillingness of customers to partner with schools, businesses and other entities to purchase products hampered growth.\nWe continue to believe that AI-powered learning programs, priced affordably, will supplant other academic products in the mid to long term, but have defocused on securing\n“change agent” customers, and are now offering our academic platform for use by any community college on a fee-per-course basis. The incremental cost to Amesite in\ndelivering the system is de minimis, as the system is turnkey, and the technology stack is robust. We have focused all new development work on delivering AI tools to markets\nhungry for increased capability that immediately impacts both their performance and their bottom line. The NurseMagicTM app is the first of these and has already gained\ntraction with larger entities.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe issue four types of stock-based awards under our stock plans: stock options, restricted stock units, deferred stock units, and stock warrants. All stock-based awards granted\nto employees, directors and independent contractors are measured at fair value at each grant date. We rely on the Black-Scholes option pricing model for estimating the fair\nvalue of stock-based awards granted, and expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company’s stock prices. Stock options generally vest over two years\nfrom the grant date and generally have ten-year contractual terms. Restricted stock units generally have a term of 12 months from the closing date of the agreement. Stock\nwarrants issued have a term of five years. Information about the assumptions used in the calculation of stock-based compensation expense is set forth in Note 3 in the Notes to\nCondensed Financial Statements.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and personnel-related expenses, including executive management, legal, finance, human resources and other\ndepartments that do not provide direct operational services. General and administrative expenses also include professional fees and other corporate expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were $633,122 as compared to $438,262 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe increase between the three-month periods is due to the recording of Board Compensation in the current quarter, offset by savings due to deliberate cost reductions,\nincluding reductions in headcount and associated administrative costs. These reductions were made possible by completion of certain features and platform capabilities that\nrequire less staffing to maintain than to build.\nTechnology and Content Development\nTechnology and content development expenses consist primarily of personnel and personnel-related expenses and contracted services associated with the ongoing improvement\nand maintenance of our platform as well as hosting and licensing costs. Technology and content expenses also include the amortization of capitalized software costs.\nTechnology and content development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were $139,658 as compared to $333,434 for the three months ended September\n30, 2023. The decreases between the three-month periods in technology reflect the increase in capital asset additions and reductions in headcount and associated administrative\ncosts, since these costs scale with staff.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expense consist primarily of activities to attract customers to our offerings. This includes personnel and personnel-related expenses, various search engine\nand social media costs as well as the cost of advertising.\nSales and marketing expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were $165,814 as compared to $241,627 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The\ndecrease between the three-month periods in sales and marketing are principally related to moving certain marketing functions from outside providers to inside staff.\nInterest Income\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, interest income totaled $19,299 as compared to interest income of $59,297 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nNet Loss\nOur net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $908,045 as compared to a net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2023 of $890,693.\nCapital Expenditures\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had capital asset additions of $148,000 and $65,200, respectively. We will continue to capitalize significant\nsoftware development costs, comprised primarily of internal payroll, payroll related and contractor costs, as we build out and complete our technology platforms.\n-16-\nReverse Split of Stock\nOn February 15, 2023, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders (the “Special Meeting”). At the Special Meeting, the stockholders also approved a proposal to\namend the Company’s certificate of incorporation to effect a reverse split of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 at a specific ratio within a\nrange of one-for five (1-for-5) to a maximum of one-for-fifty (1-for-50) to be determined by the Company’s board of directors in its sole discretion.\nFollowing the Special Meeting, the board of directors approved a one-for-twelve (1-for-12) reverse split of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock (the\n“Reverse Stock Split”). On February 21, 2023, the Company filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of amendment to its certificate of\nincorporation (the “Certificate of Amendment”) to affect the Reverse Stock Split. The Reverse Stock Split became effective as of 4:01 p.m. Eastern Time on February 21, 2023,\nand the Company’s common stock began trading on a split-adjusted basis when the Nasdaq Stock Market opens on February 22, 2023.\nOn March 8, 2023, the Company received a letter from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) stating that because the Company’s common stock had a closing bid price at\nor above $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive trading days, the Company had regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement of $1.00 per share for\ncontinued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2).\nChanges in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nThe Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item as it is a “smaller reporting company.”\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision, and with the participation of, our management,\nincluding our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (principal financial and accounting officer), of the effectiveness of our\ndisclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”). Based on that evaluation,\nour management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\nChanges in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are\nreasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n-17-\nPART II – OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings.\nNone.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows may be impacted by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including those set\nforth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, the occurrence of any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our actual results. There have been no material changes in\nour risk factors from those previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.\nNone.\nItem 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities.\nNone.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\nNot applicable.\nItem 5. Other Information.\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2024, none of our directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Exchange Act) adopted or terminated a “Rule 10b5-1 trading\narrangement” or “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement,” as each term is defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K.\n-18-\nItem 6.
