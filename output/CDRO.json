In\nMexico, net gaming revenue reached €26.7 million, 27% above the prior year period, despite the significant\ndevaluation of the Mexican peso following the presidential election in June. In constant currency terms, our net\ngaming revenue in the country would have grown by 43%. Meanwhile, performance in Spain remained strong,\nwith net gaming revenue of €20.9 million in the quarter, 11% above last year.”\nOscar Iglesias, CFO of Codere Online, stated, \"Beyond the significant top line growth, we also generated €1.5\nmillion of Adjusted EBITDA and €3.5 million of cash in the quarter. This is now the third consecutive quarter of\npositive Adjusted EBITDA and brings the year-to-date total to €4.5 million.\"\nMr. Iglesias further added, \"With regards to our existing outlook for 2024, we expect to finish the year in the upper\npart of the range with respect to both our net gaming revenue and Adjusted EBITDA guidance.\"\nRecent Events\nDelisting Notice from Nasdaq\n• On November 12, 2024, the Company received a letter from Nasdaq notifying the Company of Nasdaq’s\nintention to delist its securities from the Nasdaq Stock Market given the Company had not yet filed its\nForm 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2023;\n• On November 18, 2024, the Company formally requested to Nasdaq a hearing to appeal the delisting\ndetermination6;\n• On November 25, 2024, Nasdaq informed the Company that its request for a hearing was accepted and\nthat the hearing has been scheduled for January 16, 2025;\n• The Company continues to work diligently to complete and file its Form 20-F for 2023 as soon as possible.\n6 A request for a hearing automatically stays the delisting of the Company’s securities from Nasdaq through the duration of the hearing\nprocess.\n2\nConference Call Information\nCodere Online’s management will host a conference call to discuss the results and provide a business update at\n8:30 am US Eastern Time today, November 27, 2024.

Due to decimal rounding, numbers presented throughout this report may not add up precisely to the totals\nand subtotals provided, and percentages may not precisely reflect the absolute figures.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements in this document may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor”\nprovisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include, but are\nnot limited to, statements regarding Codere Online Luxembourg, S.A. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Codere Online”) or\nCodere Online’s or its management team’s expectations, hopes, beliefs, intentions or strategies regarding the future. In\naddition, any statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other characterizations of future events or circumstances,\nincluding any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. The words “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,”\n“estimate,” “expect,” “intends,” “may,” “might,” “plan,” “possible,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “would” and similar\nexpressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not\nforward-looking. Forward-looking statements in this document may include, for example, statements about Codere Online’s\nfinancial performance and, in particular, the potential evolution and distribution of its net gaming revenue; any prospective and\nillustrative financial information; and changes in Codere Online’s strategy, future operations and target addressable market,\nfinancial position, estimated revenues and losses, projected costs, prospects and plans as well as timing relating to the\nupcoming Nasdaq Hearing and the potential delisting of Codere Online’s securities.\nThese forward-looking statements are based on information available as of the date of this document and current expectations,\nforecasts and assumptions, and involve a number of judgments, risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, forward-looking\nstatements should not be relied upon as representing Codere Online’s or its management team’s views as of any subsequent\ndate, and Codere Online does not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or\ncircumstances after the date they were made, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as\nmay be required under applicable securities laws.\nAs a result of a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties, Codere Online’s actual results or performance may be\nmaterially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. There may be additional risks that\nCodere Online does not presently know or that Codere Online currently believes are immaterial that could also cause actual\nresults to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ\ninclude (i) changes in applicable laws or regulations, including online gaming, privacy, data use and data protection rules and\nregulations as well as consumers’ heightened expectations regarding proper safeguarding of their personal information, (ii) the\nimpacts and ongoing uncertainties created by regulatory restrictions, changes in perceptions of the gaming industry, changes\nin policies and increased competition, and geopolitical events such as war, (iii) the ability to implement business plans,\nforecasts, and other expectations and identify and realize additional opportunities, (iv) the risk of downturns and the possibility\nof rapid change in the highly competitive industry in which Codere Online operates, (v) the risk that Codere Online and its\ncurrent and future collaborators are unable to successfully develop and commercialize Codere Online’s services, or experience\nsignificant delays in doing so, (vi) the risk that Codere Online may never achieve or sustain profitability, (vii) the risk that Codere\nOnline will need to raise additional capital to execute its business plan, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at\nall, (viii) the risk that Codere Online experiences difficulties in managing its growth and expanding operations, (ix) the risk that\nthird-party providers, including the Codere Group, are not able to fully and timely meet their obligations, (x) the risk that the\nonline gaming operations will not provide the expected benefits due to, among other things, the inability to obtain or maintain\nonline gaming licenses in the anticipated time frame or at all, (xi) the risk that Codere Online is unable to secure or protect its\nintellectual property, (xii) the risk that Codere Online’s securities may be delisted from Nasdaq and (xiii) the possibility that\nCodere Online may be adversely affected by other political, economic, business, and/or competitive factors. Additional\ninformation concerning certain of these and other risk factors is contained in Codere Online’s filings with the U.S. Securities\nand Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements concerning Codere Online\n5\nor other matters and attributable to Codere Online or any person acting on their behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety\nby the cautionary statements above.\nFinancial Information and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nCodere Online’s financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued\nby the International Accounting Standards Board (“IFRS”), which can differ in certain significant respects from generally\naccepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).\nThis document includes certain financial measures not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP or IFRS (“non-GAAP”), such\nas, without limitation, net gaming revenue and Adjusted EBITDA. These non-GAAP financial measures are not measures of\nfinancial performance in accordance with U.S. GAAP or IFRS and may exclude items that are significant in understanding and\nassessing Codere Online’s financial results. Therefore, these measures should not be considered in isolation or as an\nalternative to revenue, net income, cash flows from operations or other measures of profitability, liquidity or performance under\nU.S. GAAP or IFRS. You should be aware that Codere Online’s presentation of these measures may not be comparable to\nsimilarly-titled measures used by other companies. In addition, the audit of Codere Online’s financial statements in accordance\nwith PCAOB standards, may impact how Codere Online currently calculates its non-GAAP financial measures, and we cannot\nassure you that there would not be differences, and such differences could be material.\nCodere Online believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in\nevaluating ongoing operating results and trends in comparing Codere Online’s financial measures with other similar companies,\nmany of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. These non-GAAP financial measures are subject to\ninherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which expense and income are excluded\nor included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to their most\ndirectly comparable measure under IFRS are included herein.\nThis document may include certain projections of non-GAAP financial measures. Codere Online is unable to quantify certain\namounts that would be required to be included in the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP or IFRS financial measures without\nunreasonable effort, due to the inherent difficulty and variability of accurately forecasting the occurrence and financial impact\nof the various adjusting items necessary for such comparable measures or such reconciliation that have not yet occurred, are\nout of our control, or cannot be reasonably predicted, ascertained or assessed, which could have a material impact on its future\nIFRS financial results. Consequently, no disclosure of estimated comparable U.S. GAAP or IFRS measures is included and no\nreconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures is included.\nUse of Projections\nThis document contains financial forecasts with respect to Codere Online’s business and projected financial results, including\nnet gaming revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Codere Online’s independent auditors have not audited, reviewed, compiled or\nperformed any procedures with respect to the projections for the purpose of their inclusion in this document, and accordingly,\nthey did not express an opinion or provide any other form of assurance with respect thereto for the purpose of this document.\nThese projections should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of future results. The assumptions and estimates\nunderlying the prospective financial information are inherently uncertain and are subject to a wide variety of significant business,\neconomic and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in\nthe prospective financial information. See “Forward-Looking Statements” above. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that\nthe prospective results are indicative of the future performance of Codere Online or that actual results will not differ materially\nfrom those presented in the prospective financial information. Inclusion of the prospective financial information in this document\nshould not be regarded as a representation by any person that the results contained in the prospective financial information\nwill be achieved.\nFor further information on the limitations and assumptions underlying these projections, please refer to Codere Online’s filings\nwith the SEC.\nPreliminary Information\nThis document contains figures, financial metrics, statistics and other information that is preliminary and subject to change (the\n“Preliminary Information”). The Preliminary Information has not been audited, reviewed, or compiled by any independent\nregistered public accounting firm. This Preliminary Information is subject to ongoing review including, where applicable, by\nCodere Online’s independent auditors. Accordingly, no independent registered public accounting firm has expressed an opinion\nor any other form of assurance with respect to the Preliminary Information. During the course of finalizing such Preliminary\nInformation, adjustments to such Preliminary Information presented herein may be identified, which may be material. Codere\nOnline undertakes no obligation to update or revise the Preliminary Information set forth in this document as a result of new\n6\ninformation, future events or otherwise, except as otherwise required by law. The Preliminary Information may differ from actual\nresults. Therefore, you should not place undue reliance upon this Preliminary Information. The Preliminary Information is not a\ncomprehensive statement of financial results, and should not be viewed as a substitute for full financial statements prepared\nin accordance with IFRS. In addition, the Preliminary Information is not necessarily indicative of the results to be achieved in\nany future period.\nNo Offer or Solicitation\nThis document does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor will there be any sale\nof securities in any states or jurisdictions in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or\nqualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.

In\nthe quarter we saw improved customer engagement and customer acquisitions in part due to targeted additional\nmarketing investments made around certain major sports betting events (i.e. Eurocup and Copa America). As a\nresult, performance in our core Mexican and Spanish businesses was strong (notwithstanding all the Spanish\nvictories in the Eurocup), with net gaming revenue growing by 57% in the second quarter in Mexico to over €28\nmillion and 25% in Spain to nearly €22 million.”\nOscar Iglesias, CFO of Codere Online, stated, \"We are pleased to have delivered positive Adjusted EBITDA for\nthe second consecutive quarter despite the increased marketing spend around the Eurocup and Copa America.\nThe €1.3 million in Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter is nearly €6 million better than the prior year period\nand for the year-to-date period we have generated €3.0 million.\"\nMr. Iglesias further added, \"Thanks to this solid performance in the first half of the year, we are well on track to\nmeet the profitability and cash generation expectations we set out to achieve in the beginning of the year, while\nstill delivering significant top line growth. As such, we are raising our outlook for the full year 2024 and now expect\nto generate between €205 - 215 million of net gaming revenue, which represents a growth of 22% year-on-year\nat the midpoint, and between €2.5 - 7.5 million of positive Adjusted EBITDA.\"\nRecent Events\nBoard Changes\n• In the AGM held on June 24, 2024, Mr. Gabriel Saenz de Buruaga, Mr. Taavi Davies and Mr. Claude\nNoesen were appointed as directors, succeeding Mr. Patrick Ramsey, Ms. Michal Elimelech, and Mr.\nLaurent Teitgen.\n• Mr. Gonzaga Higuero, CEO of Codere Group, was re-appointed as director and named Chairman of the\nBoard.\nResearch Coverage\n• On July 11, 2024, Craig-Hallum Capital Group initiated coverage of Codere Online6.\n• For more information about research firms currently covering Codere Online please access the Analyst\nCoverage section of our website.\n6 Codere Online does not endorse, recommend, or have any affiliation with Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC or their research.

Forward-looking statements include, but are\nnot limited to, statements regarding Codere Online Luxembourg, S.A. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Codere Online”) or\nCodere Online’s or its management team’s expectations, hopes, beliefs, intentions or strategies regarding the future. In\naddition, any statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other characterizations of future events or circumstances,\nincluding any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. The words “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,”\n“estimate,” “expect,” “intends,” “may,” “might,” “plan,” “possible,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “would” and similar\nexpressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not\nforward-looking. Forward-looking statements in this document may include, for example, statements about Codere Online’s\nfinancial performance and, in particular, the potential evolution and distribution of its net gaming revenue; any prospective and\nillustrative financial information; and changes in Codere Online’s strategy, future operations and target addressable market,\nfinancial position, estimated revenues and losses, projected costs, prospects and plans.\nThese forward-looking statements are based on information available as of the date of this document and current expectations,\nforecasts and assumptions, and involve a number of judgments, risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, forward-looking\nstatements should not be relied upon as representing Codere Online’s or its management team’s views as of any subsequent\ndate, and Codere Online does not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or\ncircumstances after the date they were made, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as\nmay be required under applicable securities laws.\nAs a result of a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties, Codere Online’s actual results or performance may be\nmaterially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. There may be additional risks that\nCodere Online does not presently know or that Codere Online currently believes are immaterial that could also cause actual\nresults to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ\ninclude (i) changes in applicable laws or regulations, including online gaming, privacy, data use and data protection rules and\nregulations as well as consumers’ heightened expectations regarding proper safeguarding of their personal information, (ii) the\nimpacts and ongoing uncertainties created by regulatory restrictions, changes in perceptions of the gaming industry, changes\nin policies and increased competition, and geopolitical events such as war, (iii) the ability to implement business plans,\nforecasts, and other expectations and identify and realize additional opportunities, (iv) the risk of downturns and the possibility\nof rapid change in the highly competitive industry in which Codere Online operates, (v) the risk that Codere Online and its\ncurrent and future collaborators are unable to successfully develop and commercialize Codere Online’s services, or experience\nsignificant delays in doing so, (vi) the risk that Codere Online may never achieve or sustain profitability, (vii) the risk that Codere\nOnline will need to raise additional capital to execute its business plan, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at\nall, (viii) the risk that Codere Online experiences difficulties in managing its growth and expanding operations, (ix) the risk that\nthird-party providers, including the Codere Group, are not able to fully and timely meet their obligations, (x) the risk that the\nonline gaming operations will not provide the expected benefits due to, among other things, the inability to obtain or maintain\nonline gaming licenses in the anticipated time frame or at all, (xi) the risk that Codere Online is unable to secure or protect its\nintellectual property, and (xii) the possibility that Codere Online may be adversely affected by other political, economic,\nbusiness, and/or competitive factors. Additional information concerning certain of these and other risk factors is contained in\nCodere Online’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). All subsequent written and oral forward-\nlooking statements concerning Codere Online or other matters and attributable to Codere Online or any person acting on their\nbehalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements above.\n5\nFinancial Information and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nCodere Online’s financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued\nby the International Accounting Standards Board (“IFRS”), which can differ in certain significant respects from generally\naccepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).\nThis document includes certain financial measures not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP or IFRS (“non-GAAP”), such\nas, without limitation, net gaming revenue and Adjusted EBITDA. These non-GAAP financial measures are not measures of\nfinancial performance in accordance with U.S. GAAP or IFRS and may exclude items that are significant in understanding and\nassessing Codere Online’s financial results. Therefore, these measures should not be considered in isolation or as an\nalternative to revenue, net income, cash flows from operations or other measures of profitability, liquidity or performance under\nU.S. GAAP or IFRS. You should be aware that Codere Online’s presentation of these measures may not be comparable to\nsimilarly-titled measures used by other companies. In addition, the audit of Codere Online’s financial statements in accordance\nwith PCAOB standards, may impact how Codere Online currently calculates its non-GAAP financial measures, and we cannot\nassure you that there would not be differences, and such differences could be material.\nCodere Online believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in\nevaluating ongoing operating results and trends in comparing Codere Online’s financial measures with other similar companies,\nmany of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. These non-GAAP financial measures are subject to\ninherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which expense and income are excluded\nor included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to their most\ndirectly comparable measure under IFRS are included herein.\nThis document may include certain projections of non-GAAP financial measures. Codere Online is unable to quantify certain\namounts that would be required to be included in the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP or IFRS financial measures without\nunreasonable effort, due to the inherent difficulty and variability of accurately forecasting the occurrence and financial impact\nof the various adjusting items necessary for such comparable measures or such reconciliation that have not yet occurred, are\nout of our control, or cannot be reasonably predicted, ascertained or assessed, which could have a material impact on its future\nIFRS financial results. Consequently, no disclosure of estimated comparable U.S. GAAP or IFRS measures is included and no\nreconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures is included.\nUse of Projections\nThis document contains financial forecasts with respect to Codere Online’s business and projected financial results, including\nnet gaming revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Codere Online’s independent auditors have not audited, reviewed, compiled or\nperformed any procedures with respect to the projections for the purpose of their inclusion in this document, and accordingly,\nthey did not express an opinion or provide any other form of assurance with respect thereto for the purpose of this document.\nThese projections should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of future results. The assumptions and estimates\nunderlying the prospective financial information are inherently uncertain and are subject to a wide variety of significant business,\neconomic and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in\nthe prospective financial information. See “Forward-Looking Statements” above. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that\nthe prospective results are indicative of the future performance of Codere Online or that actual results will not differ materially\nfrom those presented in the prospective financial information. Inclusion of the prospective financial information in this document\nshould not be regarded as a representation by any person that the results contained in the prospective financial information\nwill be achieved.\nFor further information on the limitations and assumptions underlying these projections, please refer to Codere Online’s filings\nwith the SEC.\nPreliminary Information\nThis document contains figures, financial metrics, statistics and other information that is preliminary and subject to change (the\n“Preliminary Information”). The Preliminary Information has not been audited, reviewed, or compiled by any independent\nregistered public accounting firm. This Preliminary Information is subject to ongoing review including, where applicable, by\nCodere Online’s independent auditors. Accordingly, no independent registered public accounting firm has expressed an opinion\nor any other form of assurance with respect to the Preliminary Information. During the course of finalizing such Preliminary\nInformation, adjustments to such Preliminary Information presented herein may be identified, which may be material. Codere\nOnline undertakes no obligation to update or revise the Preliminary Information set forth in this document as a result of new\ninformation, future events or otherwise, except as otherwise required by law.

Our focus on Mexico and Spain continues to yield impressive results, with net gaming revenue\nin Mexico growing by 51% in the first quarter to nearly €27 million. In Spain, meanwhile, net gaming revenue\ngrew by 21% to over €22 million. In both markets, our targeted marketing efforts allowed us to grow our active\ncustomer base by c. 25% as a result of the acquisition of higher quality customers (i.e. lower churn) but also with\nan increased spend per active.”\nOscar Iglesias, CFO of Codere Online, stated, “Once again, top line growth exceeded our expectations in the\nfirst quarter, with Mexico continuing to put distance on Spain as our largest market by revenue. We are particularly\nexcited, however, to see Mexico now also contributing positive Adjusted EBITDA for the first time. This, together\nwith a strong performance by Spain, allowed us to generate €1.7 million in total Adjusted EBITDA in the first\nquarter, which represents a significant step towards achieving our full year profitability targets.”\nMr. Iglesias further added, “On the back of this strong performance in the first quarter and based on recent trading\nactivity, we now expect to generate between €195-210 million of net gaming revenue in 2024, and reaffirm that\nwe expect to generate positive Adjusted EBITDA and cash flow for the full year in 2024.”\nRecent Events\nLaunch in Mendoza\n We have recently obtained final regulatory authorization and expect to launch operations soon in the\nProvince of Mendoza.\n Mendoza is the 5th most populated province in Argentina with over 2 million people.\n This launch will further increase our presence in the country, where we started operations in the City of\nBuenos Aires in December 2021, and continue pursuing a license in the Province of Buenos Aires.\nRayados Renewal\n On March 15, 2024, Codere Online agreed to extend its relationship with the Monterrey Rayados Football\nClub as its Official Betting Partner for the next four seasons.\n With this renewal, Codere Online also became the Main Sponsor of the women's team, Rayadas.\n Codere Online expects to continue to deliver on its growth plan in Latin America, relying on this and other\nsponsorships and local activations.\nBoard Appointment\n On April 9, 2024, the Board of Directors of Codere Online appointed Daniel Valdez as a member of the\nBoard and the Audit Committee.\n Mr. Valdez previously served as a member of the Board between the consummation of the business\ncombination in November 2021 and August 2023.\n2\nConference Call Information\nCodere Online’s management will host a conference call to discuss the results and provide a business update at\n8:30 am US Eastern Time today, May 15, 2024.

Forward-looking statements include, but are\nnot limited to, statements regarding Codere Online Luxembourg, S.A. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Codere Online”) or\nCodere Online’s or its management team’s expectations, hopes, beliefs, intentions or strategies regarding the future. In\naddition, any statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other characterizations of future events or circumstances,\nincluding any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. The words “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,”\n“estimate,” “expect,” “intends,” “may,” “might,” “plan,” “possible,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “would” and similar\nexpressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not\nforward-looking. Forward-looking statements in this document may include, for example, statements about Codere Online’s\nfinancial performance and, in particular, the potential evolution and distribution of its net gaming revenue; any prospective and\nillustrative financial information; and changes in Codere Online’s strategy, future operations and target addressable market,\nfinancial position, estimated revenues and losses, projected costs, prospects and plans.\nThese forward-looking statements are based on information available as of the date of this document and current expectations,\nforecasts and assumptions, and involve a number of judgments, risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, forward-looking\nstatements should not be relied upon as representing Codere Online’s or its management team’s views as of any subsequent\ndate, and Codere Online does not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or\ncircumstances after the date they were made, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as\nmay be required under applicable securities laws.\nAs a result of a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties, Codere Online’s actual results or performance may be\nmaterially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. There may be additional risks that\nCodere Online does not presently know or that Codere Online currently believes are immaterial that could also cause actual\nresults to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ\ninclude (i) changes in applicable laws or regulations, including online gaming, privacy, data use and data protection rules and\nregulations as well as consumers’ heightened expectations regarding proper safeguarding of their personal information, (ii) the\nimpacts and ongoing uncertainties created by regulatory restrictions, changes in perceptions of the gaming industry, changes\nin policies and increased competition, and geopolitical events such as war, (iii) the ability to implement business plans,\nforecasts, and other expectations and identify and realize additional opportunities, (iv) the risk of downturns and the possibility\nof rapid change in the highly competitive industry in which Codere Online operates, (v) the risk that Codere Online and its\ncurrent and future collaborators are unable to successfully develop and commercialize Codere Online’s services, or experience\nsignificant delays in doing so, (vi) the risk that Codere Online may never achieve or sustain profitability, (vii) the risk that Codere\nOnline will need to raise additional capital to execute its business plan, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at\nall, (viii) the risk that Codere Online experiences difficulties in managing its growth and expanding operations, (ix) the risk that\nthird-party providers, including the Codere Group, are not able to fully and timely meet their obligations, (x) the risk that the\nonline gaming operations will not provide the expected benefits due to, among other things, the inability to obtain or maintain\nonline gaming licenses in the anticipated time frame or at all, (xi) the risk that Codere Online is unable to secure or protect its\nintellectual property, and (xii) the possibility that Codere Online may be adversely affected by other political, economic,\nbusiness, and/or competitive factors. Additional information concerning certain of these and other risk factors is contained in\nCodere Online’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). All subsequent written and oral forward-\nlooking statements concerning Codere Online or other matters and attributable to Codere Online or any person acting on their\n4\nbehalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements above.\nFinancial Information and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nCodere Online’s financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued\nby the International Accounting Standards Board (“IFRS”), which can differ in certain significant respects from generally\naccepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).\nThis document includes certain financial measures not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP or IFRS (“non-GAAP”), such\nas, without limitation, net gaming revenue and Adjusted EBITDA. These non-GAAP financial measures are not measures of\nfinancial performance in accordance with U.S. GAAP or IFRS and may exclude items that are significant in understanding and\nassessing Codere Online’s financial results. Therefore, these measures should not be considered in isolation or as an\nalternative to revenue, net income, cash flows from operations or other measures of profitability, liquidity or performance under\nU.S. GAAP or IFRS. You should be aware that Codere Online’s presentation of these measures may not be comparable to\nsimilarly-titled measures used by other companies. In addition, the audit of Codere Online’s financial statements in accordance\nwith PCAOB standards, may impact how Codere Online currently calculates its non-GAAP financial measures, and we cannot\nassure you that there would not be differences, and such differences could be material.\nCodere Online believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in\nevaluating ongoing operating results and trends in comparing Codere Online’s financial measures with other similar companies,\nmany of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. These non-GAAP financial measures are subject to\ninherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which expense and income are excluded\nor included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to their most\ndirectly comparable measure under IFRS are included herein.\nThis document may include certain projections of non-GAAP financial measures. Codere Online is unable to quantify certain\namounts that would be required to be included in the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP or IFRS financial measures without\nunreasonable effort, due to the inherent difficulty and variability of accurately forecasting the occurrence and financial impact\nof the various adjusting items necessary for such comparable measures or such reconciliation that have not yet occurred, are\nout of our control, or cannot be reasonably predicted, ascertained or assessed, which could have a material impact on its future\nIFRS financial results. Consequently, no disclosure of estimated comparable U.S. GAAP or IFRS measures is included and no\nreconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures is included.\nUse of Projections\nThis document contains financial forecasts with respect to Codere Online’s business and projected financial results, including\nnet gaming revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Codere Online’s independent auditors have not audited, reviewed, compiled or\nperformed any procedures with respect to the projections for the purpose of their inclusion in this document, and accordingly,\nthey did not express an opinion or provide any other form of assurance with respect thereto for the purpose of this document.\nThese projections should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of future results. The assumptions and estimates\nunderlying the prospective financial information are inherently uncertain and are subject to a wide variety of significant business,\neconomic and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in\nthe prospective financial information. See “Forward-Looking Statements” above. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that\nthe prospective results are indicative of the future performance of Codere Online or that actual results will not differ materially\nfrom those presented in the prospective financial information. Inclusion of the prospective financial information in this document\nshould not be regarded as a representation by any person that the results contained in the prospective financial information\nwill be achieved.\nFor further information on the limitations and assumptions underlying these projections, please refer to Codere Online’s filings\nwith the SEC.\nPreliminary Information\nThis document contains figures, financial metrics, statistics and other information that is preliminary and subject to change (the\n“Preliminary Information”). The Preliminary Information has not been audited, reviewed, or compiled by any independent\nregistered public accounting firm. This Preliminary Information is subject to ongoing review including, where applicable, by\nCodere Online’s independent auditors. Accordingly, no independent registered public accounting firm has expressed an opinion\nor any other form of assurance with respect to the Preliminary Information.

EBITDA Reconciliation\n1. 2021 figure differs from that included in our Q4 2021 earnings presentation where we excluded Greenplay’sAccounting Revenue (see footnote 2).\n2. Reflects Accounting Revenue from our former .com business, which we sold on December 31, 2021 and have excluded for comparability purposes. 2020 and 2021 figures differ from those included in our Q4 2021 earnings presentation as\nthose reflected Greenplay’sNet Gaming Revenue.\n3. Figures primarily reflect differences in recognition of revenue related to certain partner and affiliate agreements in place in Colombia and VAT impact from entry fees in Mexico.\n4. FY-22 figure will vary from prior presentations which were proformafor a reclassification of non-deductible VAT in Colombia from CIT to EBITDA, resulting in a €0.8 mm lower Provision for CIT and corresponding decreases in EBITDA. To\nproperly align the Provision for CIT with that reported in our Annual Reports on form 20-F, that impact is now being reflected in “Other Accounting Adjustments”.\n5. Figures include losses / (gains) from exchange rate variations and impact from the application of IAS 29 (Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies) in Argentina.\n6. In our Annual Reports on form 20-F, variations in fair value of public warrants are included in EBITDA while in our management reporting they are included as interest income (i.e. no impact on EBITDA).\n7. Figures primarily reflect costs related to a legacy affiliate program in Mexico, post-closing adjustments to financial accounts to reflect commercially agreed platform and technology services fees, and actual costs of doing business (i.e.\ninvoicing between Codere Group companies and Codere Online companies) and, in 2022, a Provision for CIT (see footnote 4 above). Since Q1-23, figure reflects the impact of inflation accounting (IAS 29) in Argentina.\n8. Reflects fees and related expenses in connection with the merger with DD3 Acquisition Corp. II. 2021 figure differs from our Q4-21 earnings presentation as a portion of the business combination transaction costs that were supported by\nCodere Online’smajority owner (Codere NewCo, S.A.) was ultimately accounted for as a capital increase thereby increasing the expense related to transaction costs (i.e. impact to income statement) in the applicable accounting period.\n25\n9. Reflects non-cash impact from the application of IFRS 2 (the difference in the fair value of shares and warrants issued to holders of DD3Acquisition Corp. II Common Stock in excess of its net assets).\n10. 2022 figures reflect the €0.7 mm cash impact from the cyber-related fraud incident and the €0.8 mm non-cash provision related to the 2021 regulatory fee (i.e. canon) paid to the Spanish regulator (DGOJ) in January 2022 that was\nincorrectly accounted for in 2022 instead of 2021; 2023 figures reflect the €0.5 mm impact of a retail withdrawal fraud in Spain.\nA\n(\n(\nN\nN\n(\n(\n(\n(\nE\n(\n(\nA\n(\n(\n(\nA\nG A A P\n(1 )c c o u n t in g R e v e n u e\n(2 )- ) G r e e n p la y\n(3 )+ ) A c c o u n tin g A d ju s tm e n ts\ne t G a m in g R e v e n u e\ne t In c o m e ( L o s s )\n(4 )+ /- ) P r o v is io n fo r C o r p o r a te In c o m e T a x\n(5 )+ /- ) In te r e s t E x p e n s e / ( In c o m e )\n(6+ /- ) V a r .

Accordingly, forward-looking\nstatements should not be relied upon as representing Codere Online’s or its management team’s views as of any subsequent\ndate, and Codere Online does not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or\ncircumstances after the date they were made, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as\nmay be required under applicable securities laws.\nAs a result of a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties, Codere Online’s actual results or performance may be\nmaterially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. There may be additional risks that\nCodere Online does not presently know or that Codere Online currently believes are immaterial that could also cause actual\nresults to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ\ninclude (i) changes in applicable laws or regulations, including online gaming, privacy, data use and data protection rules and\nregulations as well as consumers’ heightened expectations regarding proper safeguarding of their personal information, (ii) the\nimpacts and ongoing uncertainties created by regulatory restrictions, changes in perceptions of the gaming industry, changes\nin policies and increased competition, and geopolitical events such as war, (iii) the ability to implement business plans,\nforecasts, and other expectations and identify and realize additional opportunities, (iv) the risk of downturns and the possibility\nof rapid change in the highly competitive industry in which Codere Online operates, (v) the risk that Codere Online and its\ncurrent and future collaborators are unable to successfully develop and commercialize Codere Online’s services, or experience\nsignificant delays in doing so, (vi) the risk that Codere Online may never achieve or sustain profitability, (vii) the risk that Codere\nOnline will need to raise additional capital to execute its business plan, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at\nall, (viii) the risk that Codere Online experiences difficulties in managing its growth and expanding operations, (ix) the risk that\nthird-party providers, including the Codere Group, are not able to fully and timely meet their obligations, (x) the risk that the\nonline gaming operations will not provide the expected benefits due to, among other things, the inability to obtain or maintain\nonline gaming licenses in the anticipated time frame or at all, (xi) the risk that Codere Online is unable to secure or protect its\nintellectual property, and (xii) the possibility that Codere Online may be adversely affected by other political, economic,\nbusiness, and/or competitive factors. Additional information concerning certain of these and other risk factors is contained in\nCodere Online’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). All subsequent written and oral forward-\nlooking statements concerning Codere Online or other matters and attributable to Codere Online or any person acting on their\nbehalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements above.\nFinancial Information and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nCodere Online’s financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued\nby the International Accounting Standards Board (“IFRS”), which can differ in certain significant respects from generally\naccepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).\nThis document includes certain financial measures not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP or IFRS (“non-GAAP”), such\nas, without limitation, net gaming revenue and Adjusted EBITDA. These non-GAAP financial measures are not measures of\nfinancial performance in accordance with U.S. GAAP or IFRS and may exclude items that are significant in understanding and\nassessing Codere Online’s financial results. Therefore, these measures should not be considered in isolation or as an\nalternative to revenue, net income, cash flows from operations or other measures of profitability, liquidity or performance under\nU.S. GAAP or IFRS. You should be aware that Codere Online’s presentation of these measures may not be comparable to\nsimilarly-titled measures used by other companies. In addition, the audit of Codere Online’s financial statements in accordance\nwith PCAOB standards, may impact how Codere Online currently calculates its non-GAAP financial measures, and we cannot\nassure you that there would not be differences, and such differences could be material.\nCodere Online believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in\nevaluating ongoing operating results and trends in comparing Codere Online’s financial measures with other similar companies,\nmany of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. These non-GAAP financial measures are subject to\ninherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which expense and income are excluded\nor included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to their most\ndirectly comparable measure under IFRS are included herein.\nThis document may include certain projections of non-GAAP financial measures. Codere Online is unable to quantify certain\namounts that would be required to be included in the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP or IFRS financial measures without\nunreasonable effort, due to the inherent difficulty and variability of accurately forecasting the occurrence and financial impact\nof the various adjusting items necessary for such comparable measures or such reconciliation that have not yet occurred, are\nout of our control, or cannot be reasonably predicted, ascertained or assessed, which could have a material impact on its future\nIFRS financial results. Consequently, no disclosure of estimated comparable U.S. GAAP or IFRS measures is included and no\nreconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures is included.\nUse of Projections\nThis document contains financial forecasts with respect to Codere Online’s business and projected financial results, including\nnet gaming revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Codere Online’s independent auditors have not audited, reviewed, compiled or\nperformed any procedures with respect to the projections for the purpose of their inclusion in this document, and accordingly,\nthey did not express an opinion or provide any other form of assurance with respect thereto for the purpose of this document.\nThese projections should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of future results. The assumptions and estimates\nunderlying the prospective financial information are inherently uncertain and are subject to a wide variety of significant business,\neconomic and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in\nthe prospective financial information. See “Forward-Looking Statements” above. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that\nthe prospective results are indicative of the future performance of Codere Online or that actual results will not differ materially\nfrom those presented in the prospective financial information. Inclusion of the prospective financial information in this document\nshould not be regarded as a representation by any person that the results contained in the prospective financial information\nwill be achieved.\nFor further information on the limitations and assumptions underlying these projections, please refer to Codere Online’s filings\nwith the SEC.\nPreliminary Information\nThis document contains figures, financial metrics, statistics and other information that is preliminary and subject to change (the\n“Preliminary Information”). The Preliminary Information has not been audited, reviewed, or compiled by any independent\nregistered public accounting firm. This Preliminary Information is subject to ongoing review including, where applicable, by\nCodere Online’s independent auditors.

Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to their most\ndirectly comparable measure under IFRS are included herein.\nThis document may include certain projections of non-GAAP financial measures. Due to the high variability and difficulty in\nmaking accurate forecasts and projections of some of the information excluded from these projected measures, together with\nsome of the excluded information not being ascertainable or accessible, Codere Online is unable to quantify certain amounts\nthat would be required to be included in the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP or IFRS financial measures without\nunreasonable effort.

For the full year, we continue to expect to generate between €140-150 mm of net gaming revenue\nand Adjusted EBITDA of negative €20-30 mm, although given our strong performance in Q1, we now expect to\nbe at the higher end of the range and are well on track to deliver positive EBITDA and cash flow for the full year\nin 2024.”\nRecent Events\nCOO Appointment:\n Deborah Guivisdalsky has recently been appointed as COO, replacing Aviv Sher after his appointment\nas CEO in March;\n Mrs. Guivisdalsky previously served as the Head of CRM/VIP of Codere Online, overseeing all the day-\nto-day operations across the different teams in Malta such as Fraud, Payments, VIP and CRM.

Our strategic focus on Mexico and Spain, where we are seeing a strong return on marketing\ninvestment, has proven successful, with significant increases in both our active customer base and spend per\ncustomer. Casino continued to exceed our expectations with a second consecutive quarter contributing 58% of\ntotal net gaming revenue in the period.”\nMr. Sher further added, “Our net gaming revenue in Mexico grew by 54% in the fourth quarter, reaching more\nthan €25 million, whereas net gaming revenue in Spain, grew by 17%, to nearly €21 million. We were able to\ngrow our active customer base by more than 15% in both markets in the quarter which we believe is impressive\nconsidering the similar level of marketing investment in these countries in 2023 versus the prior year.”\nOscar Iglesias, CFO of Codere Online, stated, “Our fourth quarter results have allowed us to reach nearly €172\nmillion of net gaming revenue for the full year, 19% above the midpoint of the initial €140-150 mm outlook we\nprovided early last year. This outperformance, combined with the overall lower level of marketing investment,\nalso allowed us to deliver a better than expected negative €12mm in Adjusted EBITDA versus the initial outlook\nof negative €20-30mm.”\nMr. Iglesias further added, “We are very encouraged by our performance in 2023 which further supports our\nexpectation that we will generate positive Adjusted EBITDA and cash flow for the full year in 2024, a year in which\nwe expect net gaming revenue of €185-200 mm. In short, we expect to deliver upon our original commitment to\ninvestors to be a profitable company in the third year after de-SPAC and are more committed than ever to creating\nmeaningful value for our shareholders.”\nConference Call Information\nCodere Online’s management will host a conference call to discuss the results and provide a business update at\n8:30 am US Eastern Time today, February 29, 2024.

In\naddition, any statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other characterizations of future events or circumstances,\nincluding any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. The words “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,”\n“estimate,” “expect,” “intends,” “may,” “might,” “plan,” “possible,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “would” and similar\nexpressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not\nforward-looking.

Accordingly, forward-looking\nstatements should not be relied upon as representing Codere Online’s or its management team’s views as of any subsequent\ndate, and Codere Online does not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or\ncircumstances after the date they were made, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as\nmay be required under applicable securities laws.\nAs a result of a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties, Codere Online’s actual results or performance may be\nmaterially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. There may be additional risks that\nCodere Online does not presently know or that Codere Online currently believes are immaterial that could also cause actual\nresults to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ\ninclude (i) changes in applicable laws or regulations, including online gaming, privacy, data use and data protection rules and\nregulations as well as consumers’ heightened expectations regarding proper safeguarding of their personal information, (ii) the\nimpacts and ongoing uncertainties created by regulatory restrictions, changes in perceptions of the gaming industry, changes\nin policies and increased competition, and geopolitical events such as war, (iii) the ability to implement business plans,\nforecasts, and other expectations and identify and realize additional opportunities, (iv) the risk of downturns and the possibility\nof rapid change in the highly competitive industry in which Codere Online operates, (v) the risk that Codere Online and its\ncurrent and future collaborators are unable to successfully develop and commercialize Codere Online’s services, or experience\nsignificant delays in doing so, (vi) the risk that Codere Online may never achieve or sustain profitability, (vii) the risk that Codere\nOnline will need to raise additional capital to execute its business plan, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at\nall, (viii) the risk that Codere Online experiences difficulties in managing its growth and expanding operations, (ix) the risk that\nthird-party providers, including the Codere Group, are not able to fully and timely meet their obligations, (x) the risk that the\nonline gaming operations will not provide the expected benefits due to, among other things, the inability to obtain or maintain\nonline gaming licenses in the anticipated time frame or at all, (xi) the risk that Codere Online is unable to secure or protect its\nintellectual property, and (xii) the possibility that Codere Online may be adversely affected by other political, economic,\nbusiness, and/or competitive factors. Additional information concerning certain of these and other risk factors is contained in\nCodere Online’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). All subsequent written and oral forward-\nlooking statements concerning Codere Online or other matters and attributable to Codere Online or any person acting on their\nbehalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements above.\nFinancial Information and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nCodere Online’s financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued\nby the International Accounting Standards Board (“IFRS”), which can differ in certain significant respects from generally\naccepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).\nThis document includes certain financial measures not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP or IFRS (“non-GAAP”), such\nas, without limitation, net gaming revenue and Adjusted EBITDA. These non-GAAP financial measures are not measures of\nfinancial performance in accordance with U.S. GAAP or IFRS and may exclude items that are significant in understanding and\nassessing Codere Online’s financial results. Therefore, these measures should not be considered in isolation or as an\nalternative to revenue, net income, cash flows from operations or other measures of profitability, liquidity or performance under\nU.S. GAAP or IFRS. You should be aware that Codere Online’s presentation of these measures may not be comparable to\nsimilarly-titled measures used by other companies. In addition, the audit of Codere Online’s financial statements in accordance\nwith PCAOB standards, may impact how Codere Online currently calculates its non-GAAP financial measures, and we cannot\nassure you that there would not be differences, and such differences could be material.\nCodere Online believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in\nevaluating ongoing operating results and trends in comparing Codere Online’s financial measures with other similar companies,\nmany of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. These non-GAAP financial measures are subject to\ninherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which expense and income are excluded\nor included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to their most\ndirectly comparable measure under IFRS are included herein.\nThis document may include certain projections of non-GAAP financial measures. Codere Online is unable to quantify certain\namounts that would be required to be included in the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP or IFRS financial measures without\nunreasonable effort, due to the inherent difficulty and variability of accurately forecasting the occurrence and financial impact\nof the various adjusting items necessary for such comparable measures or such reconciliation that have not yet occurred, are\nout of our control, or cannot be reasonably predicted, ascertained or assessed, which could have a material impact on its future\nIFRS financial results. Consequently, no disclosure of estimated comparable U.S. GAAP or IFRS measures is included and no\nreconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures is included.\nUse of Projections\nThis document contains financial forecasts with respect to Codere Online’s business and projected financial results, including\nnet gaming revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Codere Online’s independent auditors have not audited, reviewed, compiled or\nperformed any procedures with respect to the projections for the purpose of their inclusion in this document, and accordingly,\nthey did not express an opinion or provide any other form of assurance with respect thereto for the purpose of this document.\nThese projections should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of future results. The assumptions and estimates\nunderlying the prospective financial information are inherently uncertain and are subject to a wide variety of significant business,\neconomic and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in\nthe prospective financial information. See “Forward-Looking Statements” above. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that\nthe prospective results are indicative of the future performance of Codere Online or that actual results will not differ materially\nfrom those presented in the prospective financial information. Inclusion of the prospective financial information in this document\nshould not be regarded as a representation by any person that the results contained in the prospective financial information\nwill be achieved.\nFor further information on the limitations and assumptions underlying these projections, please refer to Codere Online’s filings\nwith the SEC.\nPreliminary Information\nThis document contains figures, financial metrics, statistics and other information that is preliminary and subject to change (the\n“Preliminary Information”). The Preliminary Information has not been audited, reviewed, or compiled by any independent\nregistered public accounting firm. This Preliminary Information is subject to ongoing review including, where applicable, by\nCodere Online’s independent auditors. Accordingly, no independent registered public accounting firm has expressed an opinion\nor any other form of assurance with respect to the Preliminary Information.
