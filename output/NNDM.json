(Nasdaq: NNDM)** (“Nano” or the “Company”), a leading supplier of **A** dditively **M** anufactured **E** lectronics (“AME”) and multi-dimensional polymer, metal & ceramic **A** dditive **M** anufacturing (“AM”) 3D printing solutions, today reiterated its calls for its shareholders to protect their investment and vote “FOR” all of the Company’s proposals ahead of the 2024 Annual General Meeting (the “AGM”).\n\nNano also issued the following statement in response to a report published by Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. (\"ISS\"), a leading independent proxy advisory firm:\n\n“We are pleased that ISS recognizes the progress we have made in our successful execution of Nano’s focused value creation strategy and its recommendation that our shareholders vote for the re-election of General Garrett in the AGM. Over the past year, Nano’s recently refreshed Board of Directions (“Board”) and leadership team have delivered on promises made to our shareholders, including transformational M&A agreements, improvements in financial and operational performance, and significant governance enhancements – all with the ultimate goal of driving significant, long-term value for our shareholders.”\n\n“In compliance with last week’s Israeli court ruling, Nano Dimension has welcomed Murchinson Ltd.’s (“Murchinson”) prior nominees, Kenneth Traub and Dr. Joshua Rosensweig, as full members to Nano’s Board. We disagree with any recommendation supporting the addition of more of Murchinson’s nominees to Nano’s Board, as well as the recommendations to vote against Nano’s compensation proposals and for the elimination of the staggered Board structure. The addition of Traub and Rosensweig provides Murchinson with reasonable and appropriate representation on the Board. If our shareholders do not vote for Nano’s proposals, including the election of CEO Yoav Stern and General Garrett to the Board, they risk facilitating Murchinson’s path to gain control of the Board, which would prevent the Company from maximizing long-term value for all our shareholders.”\n\nISS’ report acknowledges key aspects of **Nano’s progress to date under the leadership of its Board and management team**(emphasis added): \n\n**M &A Strategy**\n\n  * “The leadership team deserves credit for capitalizing on market conditions in 2020 and 2021 by raising approximately $1.5 billion, which provided a clear mandate for growth through M&A. NNDM **has since successfully grown the top line and built NNDM into a larger, more diversified industry participant**.”\n\n\n  * “It is **important to give leadership credit for the initial fundraising** , and to recognize that NNMD operates in a challenged industry, in which the concept of consolidation is in no way illogical.”\n\n\n\n**Financial and Operational Improvements** :\n\n  * “The board also highlights **organic revenue growth** , and **NNDM has consistently expanded gross margin**. In other words, integration efforts have met with a degree of success.”\n\n\n\n**Governance Enhancements**\n\n  * “[T]he board has **undergone positive leadership change and meaningful refreshment since the September 2023 AGM** […] NNDM progressed from having six independent directors on a nine-member board, to having seven independent directors on an eight-member board.”\n\n\n\nAfter years of attacking Nano and attempting to gain control of the Company, Murchinson STILL has **NO** plan for value creation and **NO** executable ideas. With two Murchinson representatives on the Board already, shareholders must vote FOR Nano’s highly qualified nominees to prevent Murchinson from gaining control of nearly half the Nano Board and executing its plans to liquidate the Company.\n\nNano’s Board urges shareholders to protect their investment and the Company's future by voting today “**FOR** ” **ALL of Nano’s proposals** and **“AGAINST” Murchinson’s proposals**. Votes must be received by 11:59 p.m. ET on Sunday, December 1st, 2024.\n\nSome brokers may have earlier deadlines, so shareholders are encouraged to vote **as soon as possible** to ensure their votes will be counted. **Since time is short, shareholders are encouraged to vote by e-mail or electronically according to the instructions on their proxy card.** Voting by e-mail or electronically is the best way for shareholders to ensure that their votes will be counted.\n\nShareholders of record as of the close of business on October 22, 2024, are entitled to vote at the AGM. The AGM will be held on Friday, December 6th, 2024, at 7:00 a.m. ET.\n\nThe Company’s proxy statement and other important information and resources related to the Annual Meeting can be found at [www.ProtectingNanoValue.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=I78dARIW9Nhni7gmZv_eSQkvrg-YIYSdEAny8cprdU4yZoemPtSKlainkbwF2KnW9k-AZJem46qFclemDSXk936TeoWLO7dCzhwrrbWaco6YC9j8GjZmVT5XKDy5hIpD) or the investor relations page of the Company’s website. \n\nIf you have questions about how to vote your shares, please contact:\n\n![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/015e6038-5c92-4f7a-9a5c-f51730fea27d/image-001.jpg)\n\n**About Nano Dimension**\n\nNano Dimension’s (Nasdaq: NNDM) vision is to transform existing electronics and mechanical manufacturing into Industry 4.0 environmentally friendly & economically efficient precision additive electronics and manufacturing – by delivering solutions that convert digital designs to electronic or mechanical devices – on demand, anytime, anywhere.Nano Dimension’s strategy is driven by the application of deep learning-based AI to drive improvements in manufacturing capabilities by using self-learning & self-improving systems, along with the management of a distributed manufacturing network via the cloud.Nano Dimension has served over 2,000 customers across vertical target markets such as aerospace and defense, advanced automotive, high-tech industrial, specialty medical technology, R&D, and academia.

(Nasdaq: NNDM)** (“Nano” or the “Company”), a leading supplier of **A** dditively **M** anufactured **E** lectronics and multi-dimensional polymer, metal & ceramic **A** dditive **M** anufacturing 3D printing solutions, today commented on the Israeli court ruling regarding Nano’s Extraordinary General Meeting (the “EGM”) that was held on March 20th, 2023.\n\nHighlights of the ruling include:\n\n  * The EGM on March 20th, 2023, was determined to have been duly convened and the results of the meeting are valid, including the proposed changes to the Company’s Articles of Association.\n  * Decisions made by Nano’s Board since the March 2023 EGM are also valid, including agreements to acquire Desktop Metal, Inc. (“Desktop Metal”) and Markforged Holding Corporation (“Markforged”).\n  * Kenneth Traub and Dr. Joshua Rosensweig, two nominees put forth by Murchinson Ltd. (“Murchinson”) ahead of the March 2023 meeting who have been serving as Board observers, have been appointed as full Board members, effective immediately.\n  * CEO Yoav Stern is no longer a Board member. He continues to stand for election as planned at the 2024 Annual General Meeting (the “Annual Meeting”) to be held on December 6, 2024.\n\n\n\nThe Company clarifies in response to Murchinson’s announcement issued earlier today, that, although Dr. Yoav Nissan-Cohen and Oded Gera have been removed from the Company’s Board in the March 2023 EGM pursuant to the court ruling, both, however, have been elected at the Company’s Annual Meeting held in September 2023 and are serving as Board members. \n\nDr. Yoav Nissan-Cohen, Chairman of the Board of Nano Dimension, commented: “We are pleased to welcome Kenneth Traub and Dr. Joshua Rosensweig as full members to Nano’s Board. Both have been actively engaged as observers to date and we look forward to their continued insights in guiding the Company’s strategy. We are also pleased that the Israeli Court affirmed to our shareholders and other stakeholders that our Board was fully authorized to oversee Nano’s strategy, including our transformational M&A strategy and acquisitions of Desktop Metal and Markforged. We remain committed to advancing our plans to become the market leader in digital manufacturing and delivering long-term value creation for our shareholders.” \n\nDr. Nissan-Cohen added, “Yoav Stern continues as CEO and stands for election as planned along with General Garrett at our upcoming Annual Meeting. It is critically important that shareholders benefit from Yoav’s expertise as a director and that General Garrett remains a Board member. With their deep expertise and institutional knowledge, we have the right Board in place to bolster our long-term strategy.”\n\nUnder the court’s ruling, Murchinson’s previous nominees now hold two seats on Nano’s Board. Accordingly, Nano’s Board urges the Company’s shareholders to protect their investment and the Company's future by voting today **“FOR” ALL of Nano’s proposals, including the reelection of Yoav Stern and General Garrett, and AGAINST Murchinson’s proposals** at its upcoming Annual Meeting. For most shareholders, the expected deadline to vote electronically will be 11:59 pm ET on December 1, 2024. Some brokers may have earlier deadlines, so **shareholders are encouraged to call their brokers TODAY** to ensure their vote is counted. **Since time is short, shareholders are encouraged to vote by e-mail or electronically according to the instructions on their proxy card.** Voting by e-mail or electronically is the best way for shareholders to ensure that their votes will be counted.\n\nShareholders of record as of the close of business on October 22nd, 2024, are entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting, which will be held on Friday, December 6th, 2024, at 7:00 AM ET.\n\nNano’s proxy statement and other important information and resources related to the Annual Meeting can be found at [www.ProtectingNanoValue.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=lQ4yvPjN_DBePxFverCi3APw8ugRm6GtQF-wZnHv6gTWUkyBS_AjdbF3Rc04JoT2_F8Bl9Ug5idMolp9lqmlVdbKQv5a_WIbQiHIMMAAjXO3ffPTxfIUWaJT_0pJNVPt) or the investor relations page of the Company’s website. \n\nNano is still reviewing and assessing the court ruling and evaluating any actions it may require to take. \n\nIf you have questions about how to vote your shares, please contact:\n\n**INNISFREE M &A INCORPORATED****Shareholders, Call Toll-Free: (877) 717-3923****Banks and Brokers, Call Collect: (212) 750-5833**  \n---  \n  \n**About Nano Dimension**\n\nNano Dimension’s (Nasdaq: NNDM) vision is to transform existing electronics and mechanical manufacturing into Industry 4.0 environmentally friendly & economically efficient precision additive electronics and manufacturing – by delivering solutions that convert digital designs to electronic or mechanical devices - on demand, anytime, anywhere.\n\nNano Dimension’s strategy is driven by the application of deep learning based AI to drive improvements in manufacturing capabilities by using self-learning & self-improving systems, along with the management of a distributed manufacturing network via the cloud.\n\nNano Dimension has served over 2,000 customers across vertical target markets such as aerospace and defense, advanced automotive, high-tech industrial, specialty medical technology, R&D and academia.
