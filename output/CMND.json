          "content": "CLEARMIND MEDICINE INC.\nCODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT AND\nETHICS\nI. Purpose and Scope\nThe Board of Directors of Clearmind Medicine Inc., a company existing under the Business Corporations Act\n(British Columbia) (together with its subsidiaries, the “Company”), has adopted this Code of Business Conduct and\nEthics (this “Code”) to aid the Company’s directors, officers and employees in making ethical and legal decisions when\nconducting the Company’s business and performing their day-to-day duties.\nThe Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) or a committee of the Board is responsible for administering\nthe Code. The Board has delegated day-to-day responsibility for administering and interpreting the Code to the\nCompany’s Chief Financial Officer, or his designee (such officer or designee, the “Compliance Officer”). If the last-\ndesignated Compliance Officer has ceased to be employed by the Company, please contact the Company’s Chief\nExecutive Officer with any questions you may have.\nThe Company expects its directors, officers and employees to exercise reasonable judgment when conducting\nthe Company’s business. The Company encourages its directors, officers and employees to refer to this Code frequently\nto ensure that they are acting within both the letter and spirit of this Code. The Company also understands that this Code\nwill not provide an answer to every problem you may encounter or address every concern you may have about\nconducting the Company’s business ethically and legally. In these situations, or if you otherwise have questions or\nconcerns about this Code, the Company encourages you to speak with your supervisor (if applicable) or, if you are\nuncomfortable doing that, with the Compliance Officer.\nThe Company’s directors, officers and employees generally have other legal and contractual obligations to the\nCompany. This Code is not intended to reduce or limit the other obligations you may have to the Company. Instead, this\nCode should be viewed as imposing the minimum standards the Company expects from its directors, officers and\nemployees in the conduct of the Company’s business. Additional resources, including applicable policies, procedures,\nmanuals and toolkits, are available through internal employee communication channels.\nII. Standards of Conduct\nA. Compliance with Laws, Rules and Regulations\nThe Company requires that all employees, officers and directors comply with all laws, rules and regulations\napplicable to the Company wherever it does business. Directors, officers and employees of the Company are expected to\nuse good judgment and common sense in seeking to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations and to ask\nfor advice when they are uncertain about them.\nIf you become aware of the violation of any law, rule or regulation by the Company, whether by its officers,\nemployees, directors, or any third party doing business on behalf of the Company, it is your responsibility to promptly\nreport the matter to your supervisor or to the Compliance Officer. Raising valid concerns helps the Company correct\nproblems before they get bigger. It is our responsibility to speak up when something does not seem right, and our duty\nto act and report violations of law, rule, regulation or policy, as it helps us achieve the high standards that we set for\nourselves. The Company is committed to a culture where each directors, officer and employee of the Company feels\ncomfortable raising compliance concerns, and can expect every reported concern to be treated with care, and\ninvestigated thoroughly and discretely. While it is the Company’s desire to address matters internally, nothing in this\nCode should discourage you from reporting any illegal activity, including any violation of the securities laws, antitrust\nlaws, environmental laws or any other federal, state or foreign law, rule or regulation, to the appropriate regulatory\nauthority. This Code should not be construed to prohibit you from testifying, participating or otherwise assisting in any\nstate or federal administrative, judicial or legislative proceeding or investigation.\n1\nB. Conflicts of Interest\nThe Company recognizes and respects the right of its directors, officers and employees to engage in outside\nactivities that they may deem proper and desirable, provided that these activities do not impair or interfere with the\nperformance of their duties to the Company or their ability to act in the Company’s best interests. In most, if not all,\ncases this will mean that our directors, officers and employees must avoid situations that present a potential or actual\nconflict between their personal interests and the Company’s interests.\nA “conflict of interest” occurs when a director’s, officer’s or employee’s personal interest interferes with the\nCompany’s interests. Conflicts of interest can arise in many situations. For example, conflicts of interest can arise when\na director, officer or employee takes an action or has an outside interest, responsibility or obligation that can make it\ndifficult for him or her to perform the responsibilities of his or her position objectively or effectively in the Company’s\nbest interests. Conflicts of interest can also occur when a director, officer or employee or his or her immediate family\nmember receives some personal benefit (whether improper or not) as a result of the director’s, officer’s or employee’s\nposition with the Company. Each individual’s situation is different and in evaluating his or her own situation, a director,\nofficer or employee will have to consider many factors.\nAny material transaction, responsibility, obligation, or relationship that reasonably could be expected to give\nrise to a conflict of interest should be reported promptly to the Compliance Officer, who may notify the Board or a\ncommittee of the Board as he or she deems appropriate. Actual or potential conflicts of interest involving a director or\nexecutive officer other than the Compliance Officer should be disclosed directly to the Compliance Officer. Actual or\npotential conflicts of interest involving the Compliance Officer should be disclosed directly to the Chief Executive\nOfficer.\nC. Insider Trading\nEmployees, officers and directors who have material non-public information about the Company or other\ncompanies, including our suppliers and customers, as a result of their relationship with the Company are prohibited by\nlaw and Company policy from trading in securities of the Company or such other companies, as well as from\ncommunicating such information to others who might trade on the basis of that information.\nIf you are uncertain about the constraints on your purchase or sale of any Company securities or the securities\nof any other company that you are familiar with by virtue of your relationship with the Company, consult with the\nCompliance Officer before making any such purchase or sale.\nD. Confidentiality\nDirectors, officers and employees of the Company must maintain the confidentiality of confidential\ninformation entrusted to them by the Company or other companies, including our suppliers and customers, except when\ndisclosure is authorized by a supervisor or legally mandated. Unauthorized disclosure of any confidential information is\nprohibited. Additionally, employees should take appropriate precautions to ensure that confidential or sensitive business\ninformation, whether it is proprietary to the Company or another company, is not communicated within the Company\nexcept to employees who have a need to know such information to perform their responsibilities for the Company.\nThird parties may ask you for information concerning the Company. Subject to the exceptions noted in the\npreceding paragraph, employees, officers and directors (other than the Company’s authorized spokespersons) must not\ndiscuss internal Company matters with, or disseminate internal Company information to, anyone outside the Company,\nexcept as required in the performance of their Company duties and, if appropriate, after a confidentiality agreement is in\nplace. This prohibition applies particularly to inquiries concerning the Company from the media, market professionals\n(such as securities analysts, institutional investors, investment advisers, brokers and dealers) and security holders. All\nresponses to inquiries on behalf of the Company must be made only by the Company’s authorized spokespersons. If you\nreceive any inquiries of this nature, you must decline to comment and refer the inquirer to your supervisor or one of the\nCompany’s authorized spokespersons.\n2\nYou also must abide by any lawful obligations that you have to any former employer(s). These obligations may\ninclude restrictions on the use and disclosure of confidential information, restrictions on the solicitation of former\ncolleagues to work at the Company and non-competition obligations.\nE. Honest and Ethical Conduct and Fair Dealing\nYou should endeavor to deal honestly, ethically and fairly with the Company’s suppliers, customers,\ncompetitors and employees. Statements regarding the Company’s products and services must not be untrue, misleading,\ndeceptive or fraudulent. You must not take unfair advantage of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of\nprivileged information, misrepresentation of material facts or any other unfair-dealing practice.\nF. Protection and Proper Use of Corporate Assets\nEmployees, officers and directors should seek to protect the Company’s assets. Theft, carelessness and waste\nhave a direct impact on the Company’s financial performance. We work hard and play hard.

Future directors, officers\nand employees will be supplied a copy of the Code when beginning service at the Company. All directors, officers and\nemployees will be expected to review and sign an acknowledgment regarding the Code on a periodic basis.\nB. Monitoring Compliance and Disciplinary Action\nThe Company’s management, under the supervision of its Board or a committee of the Board shall take\nreasonable steps to (i) monitor compliance with the Code, and (ii) when appropriate, impose and enforce appropriate\ndisciplinary measures for violations of the Code.\nDisciplinary measures for violations of the Code will be determined in the Company’s sole discretion and may\ninclude, but are not limited to, counseling, oral or written reprimands, warnings, probation or suspension with or without\npay, demotions, reductions in salary, termination of employment or service, and restitution.\nThe Company’s management shall periodically report to the Board or a committee of the Board on these\ncompliance efforts including, without limitation, alleged violations of the Code and the actions taken with respect to\nviolations.\nC. Communication Channels\nBe Proactive. Every employee is encouraged to act proactively by asking questions, seeking guidance and\nreporting suspected violations of the Code and other policies and procedures of the Company, as well as any violation or\nsuspected violation of law, rule or regulation resulting from the conduct of the Company’s business or occurring on the\nCompany’s property. If an employee believes that actions have taken place, may be taking place, or may be about to\ntake place that violate or would violate the Code or any law, rule or regulation applicable to the Company, you are\nobligated to bring the matter to the attention of the Company.\nSeeking Guidance. The best starting point for officers or employees seeking advice on ethics-related issues or\nwishing to report potential violations of the Code will usually be their supervisor. However, if the conduct in question\ninvolves an officer’s or employee’s supervisor, if the officer or employee has reported the conduct in question to the\nsupervisor and does not believe that the supervisor has dealt with it properly, or if the officer or employee does not feel\ncomfortable discussing the matter with the supervisor, the officer or employee may raise the matter with the Compliance\nOfficer.\nCommunication Alternatives. Any officer or employee may communicate with the Compliance Officer, or\nreport potential violations of the Code, by any of the following methods:\n• By e-mail to Oded Gilboa <oded@clearmindmedicine.com> (anonymity cannot be maintained);\n4\n• In writing (which can be done anonymously as set forth below under “Anonymity”), addressed to the\nCompliance Officer, by mail to Clearmind Medicine Inc., _______________________, Attn: Oded Gilboa;\nReporting Accounting and Similar Concerns. Concerns or questions regarding potential violations of the Code,\na Company policy or procedure or laws, rules or regulations relating to accounting, internal accounting controls, or\nauditing or securities law matters will be directed to the Audit Committee of the Board (the “Audit Committee”) or a\ndesignee of the Audit Committee in accordance with the procedures established by the Audit Committee for receiving,\nretaining and treating complaints regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters. Officers and\nemployees can also communicate directly with the Audit Committee or its designee regarding such matters by the\nfollowing methods (which can be done anonymously as set forth below under “Anonymity”):\n• By e-mail to Oded Gilboa <oded@clearmindmedicine.com> (anonymity cannot be maintained);\n• In writing (which can be done anonymously as set forth below under “Anonymity”), addressed to the\nCompliance Officer, by mail to Clearmind Medicine Inc., _______________________, Attn: Oded Gilboa;\nCooperation. Employees are expected to cooperate with the Company in any investigation of a potential\nviolation of the Code, any other Company policy or procedure, or any law, rule or regulation.\nMisuse of Reporting Channels. Employees should not use these reporting channels in bad faith or in a false or\nfrivolous manner or to report grievances that do not involve the Code or other ethics-related issues.\nDirector Communications. In addition to the foregoing methods, a director also can communicate concerns or\nseek advice with respect to this Code by contacting the Board through its Chairperson or the Audit Committee.\nD. Anonymity\nThe Company prefers that officers and employees, when reporting suspected violations of the Code, identify\nthemselves to facilitate the Company’s ability to take steps to address the suspected violation, including conducting an\ninvestigation. However, the Company also recognizes that some people may feel more comfortable reporting a\nsuspected violation anonymously.\nAn officer or employee who wishes to remain anonymous may do so, and the Company will use reasonable\nefforts to protect confidentiality. If a report is made anonymously, however, the Company may not have sufficient\ninformation to investigate or evaluate the allegations. Accordingly, persons who report suspected violations\nanonymously should provide as much detail as they can to permit the Company to evaluate the allegation and, if it\ndeems appropriate, conduct an investigation.\nE. No Retaliation\nThe Company forbids any retaliation against an officer or employee who, acting in good faith on the basis of a\nreasonable belief, reports suspected misconduct. Specifically, the Company will not discharge, demote, suspend,\nthreaten, harass or in any other manner discriminate against, such an officer or employee. Anyone who participates in\nany such conduct is subject to disciplinary action, including termination.\n5\nIV. Waivers and Amendments\nNo waiver of any provisions of the Code for the benefit of a director or an executive officer (which\nincludes, without limitation, the Company’s principal executive, financial and accounting officers) shall be effective\nunless (i) approved by the Board or, if permitted, the Audit Committee, and (ii) if required, the waiver is promptly\ndisclosed to the Company’s securityholders in accordance with applicable Canadian and U.S. securities laws and the\nrules and regulations of the exchange or system on which the Company’s shares are traded or quoted, as the case\nmay be.\nAny waivers of the Code for other employees may be made by the Compliance Officer, the Board or, if\npermitted, the Audit Committee.\nAll amendments to the Code must be approved by the Board and, if required, must be promptly disclosed to\nthe Company’s securityholders in accordance with United States securities laws and Nasdat rules and regulations.\nAdopted on:\n6\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nI hereby acknowledge that I have read, that I understand and that I agree to comply with, the Code of\nBusiness Conduct and Ethics of Clearmind Medicine Inc. (the “Company”). I also understand and agree that I\nwill be subject to sanctions, including termination of employment, that may be imposed by the Company, in its\nsole discretion, for violation of such Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.\nDate: Signature:\nName: (Please Print)\nTitle:\n7"

Purpose\nThis Executive Officer Clawback Policy describes the circumstances under which Covered Persons of\nClearmind Medicine, Inc. and any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries (the “Company”) will be required to\nrepay or return Erroneously-Awarded Compensation to the Company.\nThis Policy and any terms used in this Policy shall be construed in accordance with any SEC regulations\npromulgated to comply with Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection\nAct of 2010, including without limitation Rule 10D-1 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934, as amended, and the rules adopted by Nasdaq.\nEach Covered Person of the Company shall sign an Acknowledgement and Agreement to the Clawback\nPolicy in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A as a condition to his or her participation in any of the\nCompany’s incentive-based compensation programs; provided that this Policy shall apply to each Covered\nPerson irrespective of whether such Covered Person shall have failed, for any reason, to have executed such\nAcknowledgement and Agreement.\nII. Definitions\nFor purposes of this Policy, the following capitalized terms shall have the respective meanings set forth\nbelow:\n(a) “Accounting Restatement” shall mean an accounting restatement (i) due to the material\nnoncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws,\nincluding any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial\nrestatements that is material to the previously issued financial statements (a “Big R” restatement), or\n(ii) that corrects an error that is not material to previously issued financial statements, but would result\nin a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the\ncurrent period (a “little r” restatement). Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the following changes\nto the Company’s financial statements represent error corrections and shall not be deemed an\nAccounting Restatement: (a) retrospective application of a change in accounting principle; (b)\nretrospective revision to reportable segment information due to a change in the structure of the\nCompany’s internal organization; (c) retrospective reclassification due to a discontinued operation; (d)\nretrospective application of a change in reporting entity, such as from a reorganization of entities under\ncommon control; and (e) retrospective revision for share splits, reverse share splits, share dividends or\nother changes in capital structure.\n(b) “Board” shall mean the Board of Directors of the Company.\n(c) “Clawback-Eligible Incentive Compensation” shall mean, in connection with an Accounting\nRestatement, any Incentive-Based Compensation Received by a Covered Person (regardless of whether\nsuch Covered Person was serving at the time that Erroneously-Awarded Compensation is required to\nbe repaid) (i) on or after the Nasdaq Effective Date, (ii) after beginning service as a Covered Person,\n1\n(iii) while the Company has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or national\nsecurities association and (iv) during the Clawback Period.\n(d) “Clawback Period” shall mean, with respect to any Accounting Restatement, the three completed\nfiscal years immediately preceding the Restatement Date and any transition period (that results from a\nchange in the Company’s fiscal year) of less than nine months within or immediately following those\nthree completed fiscal years.\n(e) “Committee” shall mean the Compensation Committee of the Board.\n(f) “Covered Person” shall mean any person who is, or was at any time, during the Clawback Period, an\nExecutive Officer of the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, Covered Person may include a former\nExecutive Officer that left the Company, retired or transitioned to an employee non-Executive Officer\nrole (including after serving as an Executive Officer in an interim capacity) during the Clawback Period,\nand this Policy applies regardless of whether the Covered Person was at fault for an accounting error\nor other action that resulted in, or contributed to, the Accounting Restatement.\n(g) “Erroneously-Awarded Compensation” shall mean the amount of Clawback-Eligible Incentive\nCompensation that exceeds the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation that otherwise would have\nbeen Received had it been determined based on the restated amounts.

For purposes of this Policy, Financial Reporting Measures shall include stock price and total\nshareholder return (and any measures that are derived wholly or in part from stock price or total\nshareholder return).

Determination and Calculation of Erroneously-Awarded Compensation\n3\nIn the event of an Accounting Restatement, the Committee shall promptly determine the amount of any\nErroneously-Awarded Compensation for each Executive Officer in connection with such Accounting\nRestatement and shall promptly thereafter provide each Executive Officer with a written notice containing\nthe amount of Erroneously-Awarded Compensation and a demand for repayment, forfeiture or return\nthereof, as applicable.\n(a) Cash Awards. With respect to cash awards, the Erroneously-Awarded Compensation is the difference\nbetween the amount of the cash award (whether payable as a lump sum or over time) that was Received\nand the amount that should have been Received applying the restated Financial Reporting Measure.\n(b) Cash Awards Paid From Bonus Pools. With respect to cash awards paid from bonus pools, the\nErroneously-Awarded Compensation is the pro rata portion of any deficiency that results from the\naggregate bonus pool that is reduced based on applying the restated Financial Reporting Measure.\n(c) Equity Awards. With respect to equity awards, if the shares, options, SARs or other equity awards are\nstill held at the time of recovery, the Erroneously-Awarded Compensation is the number of such\nsecurities Received in excess of the number that should have been received applying the restated\nFinancial Reporting Measure (or the value in excess of that number). If the options, SARs or other\nequity awards have been exercised, vested, settled or otherwise converted into underlying shares, but\nthe underlying shares have not been sold, the Erroneously-Awarded Compensation is the number of\nshares underlying the excess options or SARs (or the value thereof). If the underlying shares have\nalready been sold, the Erroneously-Awarded Compensation is the higher of the value of the stock upon\nvesting, exercise or sale.\n(d) Compensation Based on Stock Price or Total Shareholder Return. For Incentive-Based\nCompensation based on (or derived from) stock price or total shareholder return, where the amount of\nErroneously-Awarded Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the\ninformation in the applicable Accounting Restatement, the amount shall be determined by the\nCommittee based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on the stock\nprice or total shareholder return upon which the Incentive-Based Compensation was Received (in which\ncase, the Committee shall maintain documentation of such determination of that reasonable estimate\nand provide such documentation to Nasdaq in accordance with applicable listing standards).\nV. Recovery of Erroneously-Awarded Compensation\nOnce the Committee has determined the amount of Erroneously-Awarded Compensation recoverable from\nthe applicable Covered Person, the Committee shall take all necessary actions to recover the Erroneously-\nAwarded Compensation. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, the Committee shall pursue the\nrecovery of Erroneously-Awarded Compensation in accordance with the below:\n(a) Cash Awards. With respect to cash awards, the Committee shall either (i) require the Covered Person\nto repay the Erroneously-Awarded Compensation in a lump sum in cash (or such property as the\nCommittee agrees to accept with a value equal to such Erroneously-Awarded Compensation)\nreasonably promptly following the Restatement Date or (ii) if approved by the Committee, offer to\nenter into a Repayment Agreement. If the Covered Person accepts such offer and signs the Repayment\nAgreement within a reasonable time as determined by the Committee, the Company shall countersign\nsuch Repayment Agreement.\n(b) Unvested Equity Awards. With respect to those equity awards that have not yet vested, the Committee\nshall take all necessary action to cancel, or otherwise cause to be forfeited, the awards in the amount of\nthe Erroneously-Awarded Compensation.\n4\n(c) Vested Equity Awards. With respect to those equity awards that have vested and the underlying shares\nhave not been sold, the Committee shall take all necessary action to cause the Covered Person to deliver\nand surrender the underlying shares in the amount of the Erroneously-Awarded Compensation.\nIn the event that the Covered Person has sold the underlying shares, the Committee shall either (i)\nrequire the Covered Person to repay the Erroneously-Awarded Compensation in a lump sum in cash\n(or such property as the Committee agrees to accept with a value equal to such Erroneously-Awarded\nCompensation) reasonably promptly following the Restatement Date or (ii) if approved by the\nCommittee, offer to enter into a Repayment Agreement. If the Covered Person accepts such offer and\nsigns the Repayment Agreement within a reasonable time as determined by the Committee, the\nCompany shall countersign such Repayment Agreement.\n(d) Repayment Agreement. “Repayment Agreement” shall mean an agreement (in a form reasonably\nacceptable to the Committee) with the Covered Person for the repayment of the Erroneously-Awarded\nCompensation as promptly as possible without unreasonable economic hardship to the Covered Person.\n(e) Effect of Non-Repayment. To the extent that a Covered Person fails to repay all Erroneously-Awarded\nCompensation to the Company when due (as determined in accordance with this Policy), the Company\nshall, or shall cause one or more other members of the Company to, take all actions reasonable and\nappropriate to recover such Erroneously-Awarded Compensation from the applicable Covered Person.\nUnless otherwise determined by the Committee in its discretion, the applicable Covered Person shall\nbe required to reimburse the Company for any and all expenses reasonably incurred (including legal\nfees) by the Company in recovering such Erroneously-Awarded Compensation in accordance with the\nimmediately preceding sentence.\nThe Committee shall have broad discretion to determine the appropriate means of recovery of\nErroneously-Awarded Compensation based on all applicable facts and circumstances and taking into\naccount the time value of money and the cost to shareholders of delaying recovery. However, in no\nevent may the Company accept an amount that is less than the amount of Erroneously-Awarded\nCompensation in satisfaction of a Covered Person’s obligations hereunder.\nVI. Discretionary Recovery\nNotwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to take action to recover\nErroneously-Awarded Compensation if any one of the following conditions are met and the Committee\ndetermines that recovery would be impracticable:\n(i) The direct expenses paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy against a Covered\nPerson would exceed the amount to be recovered, after the Company has made a reasonable\nattempt to recover the applicable Erroneously-Awarded Compensation, documented such\nattempts and provided such documentation to Nasdaq;\n(ii) Recovery would violate home country law where that law was adopted prior to November 28,\n2022, provided that, before determining that it would be impracticable to recover any amount\nof Erroneously-Awarded Compensation based on violation of home country law, the Company\nhas obtained an opinion of home country counsel, acceptable to Nasdaq, that recovery would\nresult in such a violation and a copy of the opinion is provided to Nasdaq; or\n5\n(iii) Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits\nare broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet the requirements of 26\nU.S.C. 401(a)(13) or 26 U.S.C. 411(a) and regulations thereunder.\nVII. Reporting and Disclosure Requirements\nThe Company shall file all disclosures with respect to this Policy in accordance with the requirements of\nthe federal securities laws, including the disclosure required by the applicable filings required to be made\nwith the SEC.\nVIII. Effective Date\nThis Policy shall apply to any Incentive-Based Compensation Received on or after the Nasdaq Effective\nDate.\nIX. No Indemnification\nThe Company shall not indemnify any Covered Person against the loss of Erroneously-Awarded\nCompensation and shall not pay, or reimburse any Covered Persons for premiums, for any insurance policy\nto fund such Covered Person’s potential recovery obligations.\nX. Administration\nThe Committee has the sole discretion to administer this Policy and ensure compliance with Nasdaq\nRules and any other applicable law, regulation, rule or interpretation of the SEC or Nasdaq promulgated\nor issued in connection therewith. Actions of the Committee pursuant to this Policy shall be taken by the\nvote of a majority of its members. The Committee shall, subject to the provisions of this Policy, make\nsuch determinations and interpretations and take such actions as it deems necessary, appropriate or\nadvisable. All determinations and interpretations made by the Committee shall be final, binding and\nconclusive.\nXI. Amendment; Termination\nThe Committee may amend this Policy from time to time in its discretion and shall amend this Policy as it\ndeems necessary, including as and when it determines that it is legally required by any federal securities\nlaws, SEC rule or the rules of any national securities exchange or national securities association on which\nthe Company’s securities are then listed. The Committee may terminate this Policy at any time.\nNotwithstanding anything in this Section XI to the contrary, no amendment or termination of this Policy\nshall be effective if such amendment or termination would (after taking into account any actions taken by\nthe Company contemporaneously with such amendment or termination) cause the Company to violate any\nfederal securities laws, SEC rule or the rules of any national securities exchange or national securities\nassociation on which the Company’s securities are then listed.\nXII. Other Recoupment Rights; No Additional Payments\nThe Committee intends that this Policy will be applied to the fullest extent of the law. The Committee may\nrequire that any employment agreement, equity award agreement or any other agreement entered into on or\nafter the Adoption Date shall, as a condition to the grant of any benefit thereunder, require a Covered Person\nto agree to abide by the terms of this Policy. Any right of recoupment under this Policy is in addition to,\nand not in lieu of, any other rights under applicable law, regulation or rule or pursuant to any similar policy\nin any employment agreement, equity plan, compensation policy, equity award agreement or similar\n6\narrangement and any other legal remedies available to the Company. However, this Policy shall not provide\nfor recovery of Incentive-Based Compensation that the Company has already recovered pursuant to Section\n304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or other recovery obligations.\nXIII. Successors\nThis Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Covered Persons and their beneficiaries, heirs,\nexecutors, administrators or other legal representatives.\n7\nExhibit A\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND AGREEMENT\nTO THE\nEXECUTIVE OFFICER CLAWBACK POLICY\nOF\nCLEARMIND MEDICINE, INC.\nBy signing below, the undersigned acknowledges and confirms that the undersigned has received and\nreviewed a copy of Clearmind Medicine, Inc.

(THE \"COMPANY\")\nINSIDER TRADING AND BLACKOUT PERIOD POLICY\nPURPOSE\nThe Company is a Canadian reporting issuer whose common shares trade on the Nasdaq (the\n\"Exchange\"). As such, trades in the Company's securities1 are subject to Canadian rules and\nregulations, as well as the rules and regulations of the Exchanges (collectively, \"securities laws\").\nSecurities laws generally prohibit trading or dealing in the securities of a company on the basis of\nmaterial non-public information. Anyone violating these laws is subject to personal liability and\ncould face criminal and civil penalties, fines, or imprisonment as well as causing significant\ndamage to the Company's reputation.\nThe purpose of this Policy is to assist Company Personnel (as defined below) in complying with\ntheir obligations. This Policy does not replace your responsibility to understand and comply with\nthe securities laws, including the legal prohibitions on insider trading and, if applicable, your\nobligation for insider reporting.\nTrading in securities of the Company, including without limitation the purchase and sale of\ncommon shares and the exercise of stock options, by Company Personnel, must also avoid the\nappearance of impropriety, as well as remain in full compliance with securities laws. Accordingly,\nyou must exercise good judgment when engaging in securities transactions and when relaying to\nothers information obtained as a result of your employment with or other relationship to the\nCompany. If you have any doubt whether a particular situation requires refraining from effecting\na transaction in the Company's securities or sharing information with others, such doubt should be\nresolved against taking such action.\nCOMPANY PERSONNEL\nThe following persons are required to observe and comply with this Policy:\n(a) all directors, officers and employees of the Company or its subsidiaries;\n(b) any other person retained by or engaged by or on behalf of the Company or any of\nits subsidiaries (such as a consultant, independent contractor, adviser, or other\nservice provider);\n(c) any family member, spouse or other person living in the household or a dependent\nchild of any of the individuals referred to in Sections (a) and (b) above;\n(d) partnerships, trusts, corporations, RRSP's and other entities over which any of the\nabove-mentioned individuals exercise control or direction; and\n1 \"Securities\" includes common shares and any other security that the Company may issue from time to time, including preferred shares, options,\ndebentures, warrants, restricted share units, puts, calls and other derivative instruments with respect to such securities and any other securities that\nare convertible or exchangeable into such securities.\nDoc ID: 151c0c530af38e386791d3714e0c52f60a69bd88\n- 2 -\n(e) any other persons to which any of the individuals referred to in Sections (a), (b) and\n(c) above exercise control or direction.\nFor the purposes of this Policy, the persons listed above are collectively referred to as \"Company\nPersonnel\". Sections (c) and (d) should be carefully reviewed by Company Personnel; those\nsections have the effect of making various family members or holding companies or trusts of the\npersons referred to in Sections (a) and (b) subject to this Policy.\nMATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION\n\"Material undisclosed information\" is information that:\n(i) could reasonably be expected to have a significant effect on the market price or\nvalue of the Company's securities; or\n(ii) a reasonable investor would consider to be important in making an investment\ndecision regarding the purchase or sale of the securities of the Company;\nand that has not been previously disclosed or published by means of a broadly disseminated news\nrelease or securities filing with a reasonable amount of time having been given for investors to\nanalyze the information.\nExamples of material undisclosed information include but are not limited to: financial performance\nand significant changes in financial performance; projections and strategic plans; major R&D and\nclinical milestones, major corporate acquisitions and dispositions; significant changes to major\nassets and operations; changes in ownership of the Company's securities that may affect the control\nof the Company; significant changes in senior management or to the Board of Directors; significant\nlitigation; changes in corporate structure, such as reorganizations; changes in capital structure;\nsignificant new debt or material events of default; public or private sale of additional securities;\nentering into or loss of significant contracts; major labour disputes or disputes with major\ncontractors, customers or suppliers; takeover bids and issuer bids; and any decision to implement\nsuch a change by the Company's Disclosure Committee who believe that confirmation of the\ndecision by the Company's Board of Directors is probable.\nIf you have any doubt whether certain information is \"material,\" you should not trade or\ncommunicate such information. Information is \"non-public\" until it has been made available to\ninvestors generally, such as in publicly available reports filed with the applicable stock exchange\nor securities commission or in press releases issued by a company. In general, information may be\npresumed to have been available to investors two business days after the formal release of such\ninformation.\nPROHIBITED AND RESTRICTED ACTIVITIES\nInsider Trading\nYou must not engage in transactions in any securities, whether of the Company or of any other\ncompanies, while in possession of material, non-public information regarding such company or\nsecurities, including engaging in transactions in any securities of companies with which the\nDoc ID: 151c0c530af38e386791d3714e0c52f60a69bd88\n- 3 -\nCompany does business, or may do business, when you are in possession of material, non-public\ninformation regarding such company or securities (\"insider trading\").\nUnder this Policy, \"trading\" includes any sale or purchase of securities of the Company, including\nbut not limited to: (a) buying or selling puts or calls or other derivative securities on the Company's\nsecurities; (b) the exercise of stock options granted under the Company's stock option plan; and\n(c) the acquisition of shares or any other securities pursuant to any Company benefit plan or\narrangement. Notwithstanding (b) above, you may exercise stock options granted under the\nCompany's stock option plan for cash, but the sale of any shares issued on the exercise of\nCompany-granted stock options apply to the foregoing prohibition. Notwithstanding item (c)\nabove, regular, purchases in accordance with a previously approved structured trading plan are\nexempt from the foregoing prohibition; however, starting, stopping, or making changes to your\nPre-Approved Trading Plan (defined below), is prohibited during any period of time you are in\npossession of material, non-public information about the Company.\nTipping\nYou must not disclose material, non-public or other confidential information relating to the\nCompany or other companies, when obtained in the course of service to the Company, to anyone,\ninside or outside of the Company (including family members) (\"tipping\"), except on a strict need-\nto-know basis as is necessary in the course of the Company's business and under circumstances\nthat make it reasonable to believe that the information will not be misused or improperly disclosed\nby the recipient. You must treat all information concerning the Company as confidential and\nproprietary to the Company. Any uncertainty concerning the disclosure of any such information to\nother persons in the course of the Company's business should be immediately brought to the\nattention of a member of the Disclosure Committee for resolution. You must also refrain from\nrecommending or suggesting that any person engage in transactions in securities, whether of the\nCompany or any other company, while in possession of material, non-public information about\nthose securities or that company. Both the person who provides the information and the person\nwho receives the information are liable under securities laws if the person who receives the\ninformation trades in securities based on the provided non-public information.\nTrading During Blackouts\nYou must not, directly or indirectly, trade in securities of the Company during any Blackout Period\n(as described below).\nHedging Transactions\nYou must not engage in hedging transactions. Certain forms of hedging or monetization\ntransactions, such as zero-cost collars and forward sale contracts, allow an employee to lock in\nmuch of the value of his or her share holdings, often in exchange for all or part of the potential for\nupside appreciation in the shares. These transactions allow you to continue to own the covered\nsecurities, but without the full risks and rewards of ownership. When that occurs, you may no\nlonger have the same objectives as the Company's other shareholders. Therefore, you are\nprohibited by this Policy from engaging in any such hedging transactions.\nDoc ID: 151c0c530af38e386791d3714e0c52f60a69bd88\n- 4 -\nMargin Accounts and Pledges\nYou must not hold securities of the Company in a margin account or pledge Company securities\nas collateral. Securities held in a margin account may be sold by the broker without the customer's\nconsent if the customer fails to meet a margin call. Similarly, securities pledged (or hypothecated)\nas collateral for a loan may be sold in foreclosure if the borrower defaults on the loan. Because a\nmargin sale or foreclosure sale may occur at a time when the pledgor is aware of material non-\npublic information or otherwise is not permitted to trade in Company securities, you are prohibited\nfrom holding Company securities in a margin account or pledging Company securities as collateral\nfor a loan.\nBLACKOUT PERIODS\nThe Company reserves the right to restrict trading by directors, officers, employees and agents in\nsecurities of the Company. Such restriction is generally referred to as a \"Blackout Period\" and is\nin place when there is, or is potential for, a significant event pending or there is information\navailable but not yet disclosed.\nThe \"Blackout Period\" is:\n(a) for quarterly financial results, the period beginning at the end of the trading day that\nis two (2) weeks prior to the end of the quarter and ending at the end of the first full\ntrading day after the financial results are publicly disclosed. This Blackout Period\napplies to all directors, officers, finance and accounting staff and corporate\ncommunications staff directly involved in the dissemination of the financial results,\nand other Company's employees as determined by senior management;\n(b) for annual financial results, the period beginning at the end of the trading day that\nis two (2) weeks prior to the end of the fiscal year and ending at the end of the first\nfull trading day after the annual financial results are publicly disclosed. This\nBlackout Period applies to all directors, officers, finance and accounting staff,\ncorporate communications staff directly involved in the dissemination of the\nfinancial results, and other Company's employees as determined by senior\nmanagement;\n(c) for news releases containing material information, other than financial results, the\nperiod beginning at the end of the trading day that is one (1) week prior to the end\nof one full trading day immediately following the time of the announcement. This\nBlackout Period applies to all directors and officers and other employees as\ndetermined by senior management; or\n(d) any other time and for any length of time as deemed necessary by the Company's\nDisclosure Committee.\nAll efforts will be made to advise of Blackout Periods as soon as possible; however, it is your\nresponsibility to ensure that you are not in violation of the prohibition against trading during a\nBlackout Period by pre-clearing transactions with a member of the Disclosure Committee in\naccordance with this Policy.\nDoc ID: 151c0c530af38e386791d3714e0c52f60a69bd88\n- 5 -\nPRE-APPROVED TRADING PLANS\nNotwithstanding any of the prohibitions contained in this Policy, Company Personnel may trade\nin Company securities at any time pursuant to a trading plan (e.g. an automatic securities purchase\nplan) that has been properly adopted and is properly administered in accordance with National\nInstrument 55-104 – Insider Reporting Requirements and Exemptions (a \"Pre-Approved Trading\nPlans\"). All adopted Pre-Approved Trading Plans must comply with all applicable policies\nestablished by the Company, in addition to complying with securities laws.\nThe rules applicable to Pre-Approved Trading Plans are complex and technical in nature, so you\nshould not employ a Pre-Approved Trading Plan without obtaining advice from legal counsel.

Together with the IMCA approval, this becomes our second approved site, bringing us closer to offering hope to those suffering from the devastating effects of alcohol addiction. Alcohol abuse is a major global health issue and one of the leading preventable causes of death, particularly in the U.S., where AUD is the most common substance use disorder among people aged 12 and older1.”\n\nThe primary endpoint of the trial, titled A Phase I/II Single and Multiple Dose Tolerability, Safety and Pharmacokinetic Study of CMND-100 in Healthy Volunteers and Subjects with Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD), is to determine the tolerable dose and evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of CMND-100.

Words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates” and similar expressions or variations of such words are intended to identify forward-looking statements. For example, the Company is using forward-looking statements when it discusses the potential to bring hope to those suffering from the devastating addiction to alcohol. The Company cannot assure that any patent will issue as a result of a pending patent application or, if issued, whether it will issue in a form that will be advantageous to the Company. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based upon management’s current expectations, beliefs and projections, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain. Such expectations, beliefs and projections are expressed in good faith. However, there can be no assurance that management’s expectations, beliefs and projections will be achieved, and actual results may differ materially from what is expressed in or indicated by the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. For a more detailed description of the risks and uncertainties affecting the Company, reference is made to the Company’s reports filed from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including, but not limited to, the risks detailed in the Company’s annual report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2023 filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements are made. The Company assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, subsequent events or circumstances, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting forward-looking information except to the extent required by applicable securities laws. If the Company does update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be drawn that the Company will make additional updates with respect thereto or with respect to other forward-looking statements.

(Nasdaq: **CMND**), (FSE: **CWY0**) (“Clearmind” or the \"Company\"), a clinical-stage biotech company focused on discovery and development of novel psychedelic-derived therapeutics to solve major under-treated health problems, today announced the publication of an international patent application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) for its pioneering combination therapy of Ibogaine and N-Acylethanolamines.\n\n‍\n\nIbogaine, a key compound derived from the root of Tabernanthe iboga, a shrub native to West and Central Africa, has shown promise in human [clinical trials](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=CFIw0AMOGfTC8D87KI5D9PLbC6yrADMQYLin7OeMdaIgd1ZN7X3ps5UgcQ8q1iiIBH8Y-vgJrx46cB5Gxu9O7wBN-CNGH5hCBunzmmMmTLFu_j_symH8teQZH7uhPQzhkMLhxqTtAIJ_HJLu715Raw==) for treating opioid use disorder (OUD), cocaine use disorder (CUD), and other substance use disorders (SUD). As a result, Ibogaine is considered a potentially effective anti-addiction agent.\n\n‍\n\nThe patent application follows innovative developments from Clearmind’s successful collaboration with SciSparc Ltd. (Nasdaq: SPRC) (“SciSparc”), a clinical-stage specialty pharmaceutical company focused on treatments for central nervous system disorders. Together, the two companies are researching innovative combination therapies that integrate psychedelic compounds with the N-Acylethanolamines family, including Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA).\n\n‍\n\nDr. Adi Zuloff-Shani, CEO of Clearmind Medicine, commented: “The publication of this patent highlights Clearmind’s commitment to leadership in the psychedelics space through building a diverse patent portfolio, featuring technologies with varying timelines to market. Most importantly, we aim to provide safe and effective solutions for mental health conditions that currently have unmet needs. While treatments with Ibogaine are generally considered safe under proper medical supervision, there have been reports of fatalities or adverse events associated with the ingestion of iboga plant material or Ibogaine. We believe that combining Ibogaine with Palmitoylethanolamide will further enhance the efficacy and safety of this promising therapy.”\n\n‍\n\n**About Clearmind Medicine Inc.**\n\nClearmind is a clinical-stage psychedelic pharmaceutical biotech company focused on the discovery and development of novel psychedelic-derived therapeutics to solve widespread and underserved health problems, including alcohol use disorder.

(Nasdaq: **CMND**), (FSE: **CWY0**) (“Clearmind” or the \"Company\"), a clinical-stage biotech company focused on discovery and development of novel psychedelic-derived therapeutics to solve major under-treated health problems, today announced the submission of a patent application under the International Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”). This submission is part of the Company’s ongoing collaboration with Yissum Research Development Company of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (“Yissum”), pursuant to the exclusive licensing agreement Clearmind holds with Yissum.\n\n‍\n\nThe patent application covers innovative compounds invented by Professors Rami Yaka, Ahmed Masaewa, and Avi Priel of the Hebrew University. These novel compounds are designed to treat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other mental health conditions.\n\n‍\n\nThe global market for PTSD treatment, valued at $16.8 billion in 2023, is expected to reach $27.37 billion by 2033, according to [Future Market Insights](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=bvcQ2lRQH79GprZz02WEqfo-p4pArWLcxOvkpEtRRrlN2mF1WXsY2R6txgC_IhDxpuSds2TsMWDttlUIp_X2lSkjsRWa0IqGvwJRPUc6oTr9vd9b85IRRVAnlfeeR0a8EV_nLRe1mLShkbrRwXJAcFjQloz-VsHdZ99kiUck-Bv15qdDlNkZQgnGhmDiCgYf). PTSD is a psychiatric disorder with significant unmet medical needs and very limited existing treatment options. Current approaches for PTSD management include patient education, social support, psychotherapy, and psychopharmacological interventions, all of which provide limited efficacy.\n\n‍\n\nDr. Adi Zuloff-Shani, CEO of Clearmind Medicine, commented: “Our collaboration with Yissum continues to yield remarkable results. We are proud of the groundbreaking innovations we are developing together to meet the growing demand for advanced treatments for various mental health conditions, including PTSD. This is particularly critical for moderate to severe cases of PTSD, where pharmacological options are limited, with only two FDA-approved agents available and other treatments used off-label. However, these drugs are often associated with side effects, such as nausea, weight gain, sexual dysfunction, insomnia, and increased anxiety. Our goal is to deliver effective and safe treatments for PTSD, such as our next-generation psychedelic compounds, which aim to significantly improve the quality of life for patients.”\n\n‍\n\n**About Clearmind Medicine Inc.**\n\nClearmind is a clinical-stage psychedelic pharmaceutical biotech company focused on the discovery and development of novel psychedelic-derived therapeutics to solve widespread and underserved health problems, including alcohol use disorder.
