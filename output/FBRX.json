Announces Third Quarter 2024 Results and Provides Business Update\n\n11/14/2024\n\nDownload PDF Format (opens in new window)\n\nDALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--  Forte Biosciences, Inc. ([www.fortebiorx.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fortebiorx.com%2F&esheet=54153227&newsitemid=20241114366438&lan=en-US&anchor=www.fortebiorx.com&index=1&md5=17739f96976569e2e66da26979669988)) (NASDAQ: FBRX), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on autoimmune and autoimmune-related diseases, today announced third quarter 2024 results and provided a business update. \n\nThird Quarter 2024 Business Highlights\n\n“We continue to make excellent progress with FB102 and have begun dosing patients in a celiac disease clinical trial. In addition to safety and tolerability, we will be assessing the histological impact as well as a variety of other activity parameters. The topline data is expected to readout in the second quarter of 2025,” said Paul Wagner, Ph.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Forte Biosciences. “Based on the biology of celiac disease and the mechanism of action of FB102, we are excited about the potential in celiac disease, an indication with a significant unmet need. We believe the data to date supports the significant potential for FB102 across a variety of autoimmune and autoimmune-related diseases with large addressable markets and we look forward to pursuing these opportunities as we continue to advance the FB102 program.” \n\nR&D and Clinical Development Summary\n\nIn FB102 mechanistic in-vitro studies, human donor T and NK cells were stimulated with either IL2 or IL15 in the presence or absence of FB102. FB102 significantly inhibited proliferation and activation at levels comparable to unstimulated cells. Human donor regulatory T cell (Treg) studies stimulated with IL2 demonstrated comparable proliferation both in the presence and absence of FB102. \n\nIn the 4- and 13-week nonhuman primate (NHP) studies, after a single dose, FB102 demonstrated significant reductions in the NK cell pharmacodynamic marker. Additionally, after multiple doses at exposures comparable to human therapeutic doses, Treg levels in the FB102 dosing arm were comparable to vehicle. These observations suggest that FB102 is demonstrating selectivity with respect to inhibiting the intermediate versus high affinity IL2 receptor. \n\nThe phase 1 healthy volunteer SAD/MAD cohorts have completed successfully. The FB102 phase 1 healthy volunteer trial demonstrated a good safety profile. Of note, this trial reported a significant reduction in the NK cell pharmacodynamic marker of the FB102 mechanism. Based on these results, Forte has advanced clinical development of FB102 into a celiac disease patient trial. Top-line results of the study are expected in the second quarter of 2025. \n\nThird Quarter 2024 Operating Results\n\nResearch and development expenses were $5.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $6.4 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of $3.0 million in manufacturing costs partially offset by an increase of $2.5 million in clinical and other expenses. \n\nResearch and development expenses were $16.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $18.3 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of $7.5 million in manufacturing costs partially offset by an increase of $4.0 million in clinical and other expenses as we advanced our FB102 program through clinical trials, and a net increase of $1.2 million in payroll and related expenses due to an increase in our average headcount and related costs. \n\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $3.8 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in legal and professional expenses. \n\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $13.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $7.8 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases in legal and professional expenses. \n\nNet losses per share were $(4.54) and $(6.57) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and $(15.35) and $(23.97) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \n\nForte ended the third quarter 2024 with $16.4 million in cash and cash equivalents. In August 2024, Forte effected a 1:25 reverse split and has 1.46 million shares of common stock outstanding on a post-split basis as of September 30, 2024. \n\n**FORTE BIOSCIENCES, INC.**  \n---  \n**CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS**  \n**(in thousands, except share and par value data)**  \n**September 30, 2024** |  **December 31, 2023**  \n**(unaudited)**  \n**Assets**  \nCurrent assets:  \nCash and cash equivalents |  $  |  16,363  |  $  |  37,125   \nPrepaid expenses and other current assets |  1,305  |  1,202   \nTotal current assets |  17,668  |  38,327   \nProperty and equipment, net |  86  |  109   \nOther assets |  192  |  544   \n**Total assets** |  $  |  17,946  |  $  |  38,980   \n**Liabilities and stockholders' equity**  \nCurrent liabilities:  \nAccounts payable |  $  |  5,159  |  $  |  1,424   \nAccrued liabilities |  3,421  |  2,242   \nTotal current liabilities |  8,580  |  3,666   \n**Commitments and contingencies (Note 6)**  \n**Stockholders’ equity**  \nCommon stock, $0.001 par value: 200,000,000 shares authorized as of September 30, 2024 (unaudited) and December 31, 2023; 1,460,007 and 1,453,402 shares issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2024 (unaudited) and December 31, 2023, respectively |  1  |  1   \nAdditional paid-in capital |  156,207  |  153,829   \nAccumulated other comprehensive income |  1  |  4   \nAccumulated deficit |  (146,843  |  )  |  (118,520  |  )   \nTotal stockholders’ equity |  9,366  |  35,314   \n**Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity** |  $  |  17,946  |  $  |  38,980   \n  \n**FORTE BIOSCIENCES, INC.**  \n---  \n**CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AND COMPREHENSIVE LOSS**  \n**(unaudited)**  \n**(in thousands, except share and per share amounts)**  \n**For the Three Months Ended September 30,** |  **For the Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nOperating expenses:  \nResearch and development |  $  |  5,720  |  $  |  6,369  |  $  |  15,634  |  $  |  18,295   \nResearch and development - related party |  150  |  -  |  329  |  -   \nGeneral and administrative |  2,759  |  3,847  |  13,288  |  7,810   \nTotal operating expenses |  8,629  |  10,216  |  29,251  |  26,105   \nLoss from operations |  (8,629  |  )  |  (10,216  |  )  |  (29,251  |  )  |  (26,105  |  )   \nOther income, net |  237  |  261  |  928  |  501   \nNet loss |  $  |  (8,392  |  )  |  $  |  (9,955  |  )  |  $  |  (28,323  |  )  |  $  |  (25,604  |  )   \nPer share information:  \nNet loss per share - basic and diluted |  $  |  (4.54  |  )  |  $  |  (6.57  |  )  |  $  |  (15.35  |  )  |  $  |  (23.97  |  )   \nWeighted average shares and pre-funded warrants outstanding, basic and diluted |  1,847,644  |  1,514,509  |  1,845,407  |  1,068,019   \nComprehensive Loss:  \nNet loss |  $  |  (8,392  |  )  |  $  |  (9,955  |  )  |  $  |  (28,323  |  )  |  $  |  (25,604  |  )   \nUnrealized gain (loss) on available-for-sale securities, net |  8  |  (6  |  )  |  (3  |  )  |  (5  |  )   \nComprehensive loss |  $  |  (8,384  |  )  |  $  |  (9,961  |  )  |  $  |  (28,326  |  )  |  $  |  (25,609  |  )   \n  \nAdditional details on Forte’s third quarter 2024 financial results can be found in Forte’s Form 10-Q as filed with the SEC on November 14, 2024.

Announces Second Quarter 2024 Results and Provides Business Update\n\n08/14/2024\n\nDownload PDF Format (opens in new window)\n\nDALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--  Forte Biosciences, Inc. ( [www.fortebiorx.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fortebiorx.com%2F&esheet=54108996&newsitemid=20240814514202&lan=en-US&anchor=www.fortebiorx.com&index=1&md5=0e817e8bc9fde3e13076fe240ea846f0) ) (NASDAQ: FBRX), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on autoimmune and autoimmune-related diseases, today announced second quarter 2024 results and provided a business update. \n\nSecond Quarter 2024 Business Highlights\n\n“Forte continues to make excellent progress with FB102, our anti-CD122 monoclonal antibody therapeutic candidate. The SAD/MAD phase 1 healthy volunteer study has successfully completed and FB102 has demonstrated a good safety profile,” said Paul Wagner, Ph.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Forte Biosciences. “Based on the successful completion of the phase 1 healthy volunteer cohorts, Forte is initiating a patient study in celiac disease with data expected by the second quarter of 2025. Based on the biology of celiac disease and the mechanism of action of FB102 we are excited about the potential in celiac disease, an indication with a significant unmet need. We believe the data to date supports the significant potential for FB102 across a variety of autoimmune and autoimmune-related diseases with large addressable markets and we look forward to pursuing these opportunities as we continue to advance the FB102 program.” \n\nR&D and Clinical Development Updates\n\nIn FB102 mechanistic in-vitro studies, human donor T and NK cells were stimulated with either IL2 or IL15 in the presence or absence of FB102. FB102 significantly inhibited proliferation and activation at levels comparable to unstimulated cells. Human donor regulatory T cell (Treg) studies stimulated with IL2 demonstrated comparable proliferation both in the presence and absence of FB102. \n\nIn the 4 and 13 week nonhuman primate (NHP) studies, after a single dose, FB102 demonstrated significant reductions in the NK cell pharmacodynamic marker. Additionally, after multiple doses at exposures comparable to human therapeutic doses, Treg levels in the FB102 dosing arm was comparable to vehicle. These observations suggest that FB102 is demonstrating selectivity with respect to inhibiting the intermediate vs high affinity IL2 receptor. \n\nThe phase 1 healthy volunteer SAD/MAD cohorts have successfully completed. The FB102 phase 1 healthy volunteer study demonstrated a good safety profile. Of note, in this study FB102 reported a significant reduction in the NK cell pharmacodynamic marker of the FB102 mechanism. Based on these results, Forte is advancing clinical development of FB102 into a celiac disease patient study with first patient dosing expected in the third quarter of 2024. Top-line results of the study are expected by the second quarter of 2025. \n\nSecond Quarter 2024 Operating Results\n\nResearch and development expenses were $5.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $7.1 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of approximately $1.5 million in manufacturing costs partially offset by an increase of approximately $0.1 million in payroll and related expenses due to an increase in Forte’s average headcount. \n\nResearch and development expenses were $10.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $11.9 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of approximately $4.1 million in manufacturing costs partially offset by an increase of approximately $1.3 million in clinical expenses as Forte advanced its FB102 program through clinical trials, and a net increase of approximately $1.0 million in payroll and related expenses due to an increase in Forte’s average headcount and related payments. \n\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $7.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to $1.9 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases in legal and professional expenses. \n\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $10.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $4.0 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases in legal and professional expenses. \n\nNet losses per share were $(0.27) and $(0.42) for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, and $(0.43) and $(0.74) for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \n\nForte ended the second quarter 2024 with approximately $24.5 million in cash and cash equivalents. Forte had approximately 36.4 million shares of common stock outstanding as of June 30, 2024. \n\n**CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS** **(in thousands except share and par value data)**  \n---  \n**June 30, 2024** |  **December 31, 2023**  \n**(unaudited)**  \n**Assets**  \nCurrent assets:  \nCash and cash equivalents |  $  |  24,498  |  $  |  37,125   \nPrepaid expenses and other current assets |  1,213  |  1,202   \nTotal current assets |  25,711  |  38,327   \nProperty and equipment, net |  96  |  109   \nOther assets |  271  |  544   \n**Total assets** |  **$** |  **26,078** |  **$** |  **38,980**  \n**Liabilities and stockholders' equity**  \nCurrent liabilities:  \nAccounts payable |  $  |  5,275  |  $  |  1,424   \nAccrued liabilities (including $50 and $0 related party payable as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively) |  3,842  |  2,242   \nTotal current liabilities |  9,117  |  3,666   \n**Commitments and contingencies (Note 6)**  \n**Stockholders’ equity**  \nCommon stock, $0.001 par value: 200,000,000 shares authorized as of June 30, 2024 (unaudited) and December 31, 2023; 36,442,380 and 36,335,105 shares issued and outstanding as of June 30, 2024 (unaudited) and December 31, 2023, respectively |  36  |  36   \nAdditional paid-in capital |  155,383  |  153,794   \nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) |  (7  |  )  |  4   \nAccumulated deficit |  (138,451  |  )  |  (118,520  |  )   \nTotal stockholders’ equity |  16,961  |  35,314   \n**Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity** |  **$** |  **26,078** |  **$** |  **38,980**  \n  \n**CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AND COMPREHENSIVE LOSS** **(Unaudited)** **(in thousands, except share and per share amounts)**  \n---  \n**For the Three Months Ended June 30,** |  **For the Six Months Ended June 30,**  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nOperating expenses:  \nResearch and development |  $  |  5,590  |  $  |  7,139  |  $  |  9,914  |  $  |  11,926   \nResearch and development - related party |  150  |  $  |  -  |  179  |  $  |  -   \nGeneral and administrative |  7,078  |  1,895  |  10,529  |  3,963   \nTotal operating expenses |  12,818  |  9,034  |  20,622  |  15,889   \nLoss from operations |  (12,818  |  )  |  (9,034  |  )  |  (20,622  |  )  |  (15,889  |  )   \nOther income, net |  307  |  138  |  691  |  240   \nNet loss |  $  |  (12,511  |  )  |  $  |  (8,896  |  )  |  $  |  (19,931  |  )  |  $  |  (15,649  |  )   \nPer share information:  \nNet loss per share - basic and diluted |  $  |  (0.27  |  )  |  $  |  (0.42  |  )  |  $  |  (0.43  |  )  |  $  |  (0.74  |  )   \nWeighted average shares and pre-funded warrants outstanding, basic and diluted |  46,131,151  |  21,046,831  |  46,107,006  |  21,026,866   \n**Comprehensive Loss:**  \nNet loss |  $  |  (12,511  |  )  |  $  |  (8,896  |  )  |  $  |  (19,931  |  )  |  $  |  (15,649  |  )   \nUnrealized (loss) gain on available-for-sale securities |  (5  |  )  |  1  |  (11  |  )  |  1   \nComprehensive loss |  $  |  (12,516  |  )  |  $  |  (8,895  |  )  |  $  |  (19,942  |  )  |  $  |  (15,648  |  )   \n  \nAdditional details on Forte’s second quarter 2024 financial results can be found in Forte’s Form 10-Q as filed with the SEC on August 14, 2024.

Wagner, et al., 2023-0817-MTZ (the “Action”), pending before the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware\n(the “Court”), and of a hearing to be held before the Court, in the Leonard L. Williams Justice Center, 500 North King Street,\nWilmington, Delaware 19801 on Tuesday, July 30, 2024 at 11 a.m. (or remotely by such means as the Court may order) (the\n“Settlement Hearing”). The purpose of the Settlement Hearing is to determine: (a) whether the Court should approve the\nSettlement; (b) whether the Court should enter an Order and Final Judgment dismissing the claims asserted in the Action on the\nmerits and with prejudice as to Plaintiff Camac Fund, LP (“Plaintiff” or “Camac”), the Company, the Class (defined below),\nand the Company’s stockholders, and effectuating the releases described below; (c) whether the Court should grant the\napplication of Plaintiff for an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses actually incurred by it in connection with investigating and\npursuing the claims asserted in the Action (and to reimburse Plaintiff for the attorneys’ fees and expenses already paid to its\ncounsel); and (d) such other matters as may properly come before the Court.\nThis Notice will inform you of how, if you so choose, you may enter your appearance in the Action or object to the\nSettlement and may have your objection heard at the Settlement Hearing.\nTHE FOLLOWING RECITATION DOES NOT CONSTITUTE FINDINGS OF THE COURT AND SHOULD NOT BE\nUNDERSTOOD AS AN EXPRESSION OF ANY OPINION OF THE COURT AS TO THE MERITS OF ANY CLAIMS OR\nDEFENSES BY ANY OF THE PARTIES. IT IS BASED ON STATEMENTS OF THE PARTIES AND IS SENT FOR THE\nSOLE PURPOSE OF INFORMING YOU OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE ACTION AND OF A HEARING ON A\nPROPOSED SETTLEMENT SO THAT YOU MAY MAKE APPROPRIATE DECISIONS AS TO STEPS YOU MAY, OR\nMAY NOT, WISH TO TAKE IN RELATION TO THE ACTION.\nBACKGROUND AND DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION\nOn August 1, 2023, Forte announced that: (i) it had entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement dated July 28, 2023,\nfor a private placement with certain qualified buyers, institutional accredited investors and certain executive officers, senior\nmanagement, and members of the Forte Board of the Directors (the “Board”) pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell\n15,166,957 shares of common stock of the Company at a purchase price of $1.006 per share, and 9,689,293 pre-funded\nwarrants to purchase common stock at a price of $1.005 per pre-funded warrant (the “Private Placement”); (ii) the Private\nPlacement had closed on July 31, 2023; and (iii) the gross proceeds of the Private Placement were approximately $25 million.\nOn August 10, 2023, Camac filed a Verified Complaint (the “Original Complaint”) in this Action against the Individual\nDefendants and certain of the institutional investors in the Private Placement (the “Institutional Investors”). In the Original\nComplaint, Camac alleged that the Individual Defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the Private\nPlacement because the sole purpose of the Private Placement was to entrench the Board and prevent Camac’s two nominees\n(Michael G. Hacke and Chris McIntyre) from winning election to Forte’s eight-member Board at the 2023 annual meeting of\nstockholders scheduled for September 19, 2023. Camac further alleged that prior decisions of the Board, including with respect\nto adopting a stockholder rights agreement, expanding the size of the Board and adding new directors, adopting severance\nagreements for Forte’s officers in the event of a change-in-control, and initiating an at-the-market offering of Forte stock,\nsupported Camac’s claims.\nCamac also alleged that the Institutional Investors aided and abetted the alleged breaches of fiduciary duty by the\nIndividual Defendants in connection with the Private Placement. Along with the Original Complaint, Camac filed a Motion to\nExpedite and Motion for Preliminary Injunction\n2\nin which it asked the Court to expedite proceedings and schedule a preliminary injunction hearing in advance of the 2023\nannual meeting to consider its request to enjoin the counting of votes cast by the Institutional Investors at the 2023 annual\nmeeting.\nOn August 16, 2023, certain of the defendants filed motions to dismiss the Original Complaint.\nOn August 17, 2023, following briefing and oral argument, the Court issued an oral ruling granting, in part, the Motion\nto Expedite. The Court held that Camac was permitted to take expedited discovery but declined to schedule a preliminary\ninjunction hearing in advance of the 2023 annual meeting. Instead, the Court ordered the Parties to confer and submit a\nproposed schedule for a hearing on the motions to dismiss and the motion for preliminary injunction promptly following the\n2023 annual meeting.\nOn September 1, 2023, Camac voluntarily dismissed without prejudice the Institutional Investors, specifically\ndefendants Fred Alger Management, LLC, BVF Partners L.P., Farallon Capital Management, L.L.C., Perceptive Advisors\nLLC, and Tybourne Capital (US) LLC.\nOn September 8, 2023, the Court granted the remaining parties’ Stipulation and [Proposed] Scheduling Order Governing\nDefendants’ Motion to Dismiss, pursuant to which Camac withdrew its request for a preliminary injunction and the parties\nagreed to stay all discovery pending the outcome of Defendants’ motion to dismiss the Original Complaint.\nOn September 19, 2023, Forte held its 2023 annual meeting. Forte’s two nominees (Lawrence Eichenfield, M.D., and\nPaul A. Wagner, Ph.D.) won reelection to the Board.\nOn October 23, 2023, Camac filed its Verified Amended Class Action and Derivative Complaint (the “Amended\nComplaint”). Count I is styled as a direct claim on behalf of a class of Forte stockholders for breach of fiduciary duty against\nthe Individual Defendants for approving the Private Placement and the “sequencing of the Annual Meeting and record date.”\nCount II is styled as a derivative claim on behalf of nominal defendant Forte and its stockholders against the Individual\nDefendants for “wrongful dilution.” The Amended Complaint further alleges facts regarding the Board’s adoption of the rights\nagreement, addition of directors to the Board, adoption of severance agreements for executives, and initiation of the\nat-the-market offering as support for Camac’s claims.\nOn November 3, 2023, Defendants moved to dismiss the Amended Complaint.\nOn April 15, 2024, following briefing and oral argument, the Court denied Defendants’ motion to dismiss the Amended\nComplaint.\nOn April 30, 2024, the Court entered an order granting the Parties’ Stipulation and [Proposed] Order Governing Case\nSchedule, which provided for expedited proceedings in advance of trial to be held on July 29-31, 2024.\nExpedited discovery ensued, including extensive written discovery and multiple document productions from the Parties\nand certain non-parties to the Action totaling over 28,000 pages.\nThe Parties also briefed Defendants’ motion to quash third-party subpoenas that Camac had issued, which the Court\ndenied on May 17, 2024. Camac also filed a motion to strike one of Defendants’ affirmative defenses and filed an opening\nbrief in support thereof. Defendants filed an answering brief in response to the motion to strike on May 28, 2024.\n3\nOn June 4, 2024, the Parties reached an agreement-in-principle to settle the claims asserted in the Action, subject to\nexecution of the Stipulation (defined below) and related papers and Court approval, and agreed to stay proceedings while the\nParties negotiated the terms of the Stipulation and finalized the Settlement. The Parties informed the Court of their\nagreement-in-principle the same day.\nREASONS FOR THE SETTLEMENT\nFollowing an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the claims asserted in the Action, including review and\nanalysis of the written and document discovery Camac received in the Action, Camac has determined that the terms of the\nSettlement are fair, reasonable, adequate, and in the best interests of the Company, the Class (defined below), and the\nCompany’s stockholders, and that it is reasonable to pursue a settlement of the Action based upon those terms and the\nprocedures outlined in the Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement, Compromise, and Release (the “Stipulation”).\nFor purposes of the Settlement, “Class” means the class of all record holders and beneficial owners of Forte common\nstock who held such stock from the period of July 28, 2023, through and including September 19, 2023 (except as limited by\nthe following sentence), and their heirs, assigns, transferees, and successors-in-interest, in each case solely in their capacity as\nholders or owners of Company common stock. Excluded from the Class are (i) the Individual Defendants; and (ii) any\nIndividual Defendant’s immediate family members (meaning any children, stepchildren, grandchildren, parents, stepparents,\nspouses, and siblings) (collectively, the “Excluded Parties” and each an “Excluded Party”).\nAt all times, Defendants have denied, and continue to deny, all allegations of wrongdoing in the Action, including\nwithout limitation that they have committed any breaches of fiduciary duty, that they have violated Delaware law, or that\nPlaintiff or the Company and its stockholders have suffered any damages. Defendants expressly maintain that they have at all\ntimes complied with their fiduciary and legal duties.\nAlthough Defendants believe that they have strong defenses to the claims asserted in the action, Defendants entered into\nthe Stipulation because the Settlement will eliminate the burden, expense, distraction, and uncertainties inherent in further\nlitigation.\nSETTLEMENT CONSIDERATION\nClass-Wide Settlement Consideration. Subject to approval of the Settlement by the Court, the Parties agree that:\n(a) The Board shall be expanded to nine seats, one incumbent director shall resign from the Board, and two\n(2) directors to be selected by Camac from a list of five (5) candidates to be identified by the Company shall\nbe appointed to the Forte Board (the “Camac Nominees”).\n(b) The Board shall establish a committee of directors, which shall be less than the full Board and shall include\nthe Camac Nominees, to evaluate strategic alternatives for the Company.\n(c) The Company shall not renew the Rights Agreement dated July 11, 2022, as amended on June 26, 2023, when\nit expires by its terms on July 12, 2024, and further agrees not to adopt a new rights plan for a period of three\n(3) years following the expiration of the Rights Agreement on July 12, 2024.\n4\nCamac Standstill and Reimbursement of Out-of-Pocket Expenses.\n(a) In addition, as part of the Settlement, Camac has agreed to enter into a standstill and voting agreement and\nForte has agreed to pay Camac’s out-of-pocket expenses in related to the 2023 annual meeting and proxy\ncontest. Specifically, within three (3) days of entering into the Stipulation, Camac shall enter into a standstill\nand voting agreement with the Company with standard terms to be negotiated in good faith between the\nparties and a duration of three (3) years from the date of execution. Until such time as Camac executes the\nstandstill and voting agreement pursuant to this Paragraph, Camac shall not nominate directors for the 2024\nannual meeting or vote against management’s slate or proposals at the 2024 annual meeting.\n(b) Within three (3) days of executing the standstill and voting agreement contemplated in paragraph (a) above,\nthe Company shall pay or cause to be paid to Camac a total of $364,000.00 (U.S. Dollars) in cash via wire\ntransfer to compensate Camac for its documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the\n2023 annual meeting and its proxy contest to nominate Messrs. Hacke and McIntyre to the Board.\nRELEASE OF CLAIMS\nEffective upon the Effective Date (as defined below):\n(a) Plaintiff’s and the Settlement Class’s Releases.

The contemplated releases given by Plaintiff and Settlement Class Releasors and Defendant Releasors\ncollectively (the “Releasing Parties”) extend to claims that the Releasing Parties did not know or suspect to exist at the time of\nthe releases, which, if known, might have affected his, her, or its decision to settle with and release the Released Parties, or\nmight have affected his, her, or its decision not to object to this Settlement (“Unknown Claims”).

Accordingly, in determining to enter into the Settlement,\nPlaintiff believes it was sufficiently informed of the circumstances and terms of its proxy contest, the Private Placement, and\nthe 2023 annual meeting, and all other challenged conduct, actions, and events that are the subject to the Action, to determine\nwhether the Settlement was in the best interests of the Company, the members of the Class, and the Company’s stockholders.\nThe Settlement shall be terminated, and shall be void and of no force and effect, unless otherwise agreed to by the\nParties pursuant to the terms hereof, if (i) any Party exercises a right to terminate the Settlement pursuant to the terms of the\nStipulation; or (ii) the Settlement does not\n7\nobtain Final Court Approval (defined below). If the Stipulation is terminated, the Stipulation and the Settlement shall be void\nand of no effect, and the Stipulation shall not be deemed to prejudice in any way the positions of any Party in the Action. In\nsuch event, and consistent with the applicable evidentiary rules, neither the Stipulation nor any of its contents, nor the\nexistence of the Stipulation, shall be admissible in evidence or shall be referred to for any purpose in the Action or in any other\nproceeding, except in connection with any claim for breach of the Stipulation or as otherwise specifically provided herein.\nThe Settlement (other than the obligations in Paragraph 2 of the Stipulation pertaining to (a) the standstill and voting\nagreement and (b) payment to compensate Camac for its expenses related to the 2023 annual meeting and proxy contest, as\ndescribed above) shall be void and of no force and effect if the terms of the Settlement, except for the Fee and Expense\nApplication (defined below), do not receive Final Court Approval (defined below), in which case the Parties shall revert to\ntheir litigation positions prior to entering into the Stipulation. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that approval of the\nFee and Expense Application (defined below) by the Court is not a condition precedent to the Settlement or Final Court\nApproval thereof.\nINTERIM INJUNCTION\nSubject to an order of the Court, pending final determination of whether the Settlement should be approved, the Parties\nshall be barred and enjoined, to the maximum extent permitted under law, from commencing, prosecuting, instigating, or in\nany way participating in the commencement or prosecution of any action asserting any of the Released Claims as defined\nherein, either directly, representatively, derivatively, or in any other capacity, and all pending deadlines in any and all such\nactions shall be suspended.\nTHE SETTLEMENT HEARING\nThe Settlement Hearing shall be held on Tuesday, July 30, 2024, at 11 a.m. (or remotely by such means as the Court may\norder), in the Delaware Court of Chancery in the Leonard L.

However,\nexcept for good cause\n8\nshown, no person shall be heard and no papers, briefs, pleadings, or other documents submitted by any person shall be\nconsidered by the Court unless, not later than ten (10) calendar days prior to the Settlement Hearing, such person files with the\nCourt and serves upon counsel listed below: (a) a written notice of intention to appear; (b) a statement of such person’s\nobjections to any matters before the Court; (c) the grounds for such objections and the reasons that such person desires to\nappear and be heard; and (d) documentation evidencing ownership of Company stock and any other documents or writings\nsuch person desires the Court to consider.

Any person who fails to object in the manner described above shall be deemed to\nhave waived the right to object (including any right of appeal) and shall be forever barred from raising such objection in these\nor any other actions or proceedings. Any Forte stockholder who does not object to the Settlement or the Fee and Expense\nApplication or to any other matter set forth in this Notice need not take any action.\nTHE ORDER AND FINAL JUDGMENT\nIf the Court determines that the Settlement, as provided in the Stipulation, is fair, reasonable, adequate, and in the best\ninterests of the Company, the Class, and the Company’s stockholders (other than the Excluded Parties), the Parties to the\nAction will ask the Court to enter the Order and Final Judgment (the “Judgment”), which will, among other things:\n(a) approve the Settlement as fair, reasonable, adequate, and in the best interests of the Company, the Class, and the\nCompany’s stockholders (other than the Excluded Parties) and direct consummation of the Settlement in accordance with its\nterms and conditions;\n9\n(b) certify, for the purposes of the Settlement only, the Action as a non-opt out class action on behalf of the Class;\n(c) determine that the requirements of the rules of the Court and due process have been satisfied in connection with\nthis Notice;\n(d) dismiss the Action with prejudice as to Plaintiff, the Company, the Class, each member of the Class, and the\nCompany’s stockholders and grant the releases in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Stipulation;\n(e) permanently bar and enjoin Plaintiff, the Company, the Class, each member of the Class, and the Company’s\nstockholders from instituting, commencing, or prosecuting any of the claims released by the Settlement; and\n(f) award attorneys’ fees and expenses to Plaintiff’s counsel.\nEFFECTIVE DATE / FINAL COURT APPROVAL\nThe “Effective Date” of the Settlement shall be the first date by which the Court has entered the Judgment and such\nJudgment has received Final Court Approval.\n“Final Court Approval” of any Court Order means (i) if no appeal is filed, the expiration date of the time for filing or\nnoticing of any appeal of the Judgment; or (ii) if there is an appeal from the Judgment, the date of (a) final dismissal of all such\nappeals, or the final dismissal of any proceeding on certiorari or otherwise to review the Judgment, or (b) the date the\nJudgment is finally affirmed on appeal, the expiration of the time to file a petition for a writ of certiorari or other form of\nreview, or the denial of a writ of certiorari or other form of review of the Judgment, and, if certiorari or other form of review is\ngranted, the date of final affirmance of the Judgment after such review. However, any appeal or proceeding seeking subsequent\njudicial review pertaining solely to an order issued with respect to attorneys’ fees or expenses payable to Plaintiff or Plaintiff’s\ncounsel shall not in any way delay the Effective Date of the Settlement.\nATTORNEYS’ FEES AND EXPENSES\nCamac intends to petition the Court for an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses in connection with investigating and\nprosecuting the claims asserted in the Action (the Fee and Expense Application defined above). Any attorneys’ fees and\nexpenses awarded by the Court shall be paid by or on behalf of Defendants and/or their insurers in an aggregate amount not to\nexceed $1,700,000 (U.S. Dollars) (the “Fee and Expense Reimbursement”).

C.A. No. 2023-0817-MTZ\nPAUL A. WAGNER, LAWRENCE\nEICHENFIELD, BARBARA K. FINCK,\nDONALD A. WILLIAMS, STEPHEN K.\nDOBERSTEIN, STEVEN KORNFELD,\nSCOTT BRUN, and DAVID GRYSKA,\nDefendants,\nand\nFORTE BIOSCIENCES, INC.,\nNominal Defendant.\nSTIPULATION AND AGREEMENT OF\nSETTLEMENT, COMPROMISE, AND RELEASE\nThis Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement, Compromise, and Release (the “Stipulation,” the terms\nof which are the “Settlement”), dated June 11, 2024, is entered into between (i) Plaintiff Camac Fund, LP\n(“Camac” or “Plaintiff”); (ii) defendants Paul A. Wagner, Lawrence Eichenfield, Barbara K. Finck, Donald\nA. Williams, Stephen K. Doberstein, Steven Kornfeld, Scott Brun, and David Gryska (the “Individual\nDefendants”); and (iii) nominal defendant Forte Biosciences, Inc. (“Forte,” the “Company,” or “Nominal\nDefendant” and, together with the Individual\nDefendants, “Defendants”). Plaintiff and each Defendant is referred to individually as a “Party” and\ncollectively as the “Parties.” The Parties intend for this Stipulation to fully, finally, and forever resolve,\ndischarge, and settle the above-captioned action (the “Action”) and the Released Claims (as defined below),\nsubject to the approval of the terms and conditions of the Stipulation by the Court of Chancery of the State of\nDelaware (the “Court”).\nBACKGROUND\nA. On August 1, 2023, Forte announced that: (i) it had entered into a Securities Purchase\nAgreement dated July 28, 2023, for a private placement with certain qualified buyers, institutional accredited\ninvestors and certain executive officers, senior management, and members of the Forte Board of the\nDirectors (the “Board”) pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell 15,166,957 shares of common stock\nof the Company at a purchase price of $1.006 per share, and 9,689,293 pre-funded warrants to purchase\ncommon stock at a price of $1.005 per pre-funded warrant (the “Private Placement”); (ii) the Private\nPlacement had closed on July 31, 2023; and (iii) the gross proceeds of the Private Placement were\napproximately $25 million.\nB. On August 10, 2023, Camac filed a Verified Complaint (the “Original Complaint”) in this\nAction against the Individual Defendants and certain of the institutional investors in the Private Placement\n(the “Institutional Investors”). In the\n2\nOriginal Complaint, Camac alleged that the Individual Defendants breached their fiduciary duties in\nconnection with the Private Placement because the sole purpose of the Private Placement was to entrench the\nBoard and prevent Camac’s two nominees (Michael G. Hacke and Chris McIntyre) from winning election to\nForte’s eight-member Board at the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders scheduled for September 19, 2023.\nCamac further alleged that prior decisions of the Board, including with respect to adopting a stockholder\nrights agreement, expanding the size of the Board and adding new directors, adopting severance agreements\nfor Forte’s officers in the event of a change-in-control, and initiating an at-the-market offering of Forte stock,\nsupported Camac’s claims.\nC. Camac also alleged that the Institutional Investors aided and abetted the alleged breaches of\nfiduciary duty by the Individual Defendants in connection with the Private Placement. Along with the\nOriginal Complaint, Camac filed a Motion to Expedite and Motion for Preliminary Injunction in which it\nasked the Court to expedite proceedings and schedule a preliminary injunction hearing in advance of the\n2023 annual meeting to consider its request to enjoin the counting of votes cast by the Institutional Investors\nat the 2023 annual meeting.\nD. On August 16, 2023, certain of the defendants filed motions to dismiss the Original Complaint.\n3\nE. On August 17, 2023, following briefing and oral argument, the Court issued an oral ruling\ngranting, in part, the Motion to Expedite. The Court held that Camac was permitted to take expedited\ndiscovery but declined to schedule a preliminary injunction hearing in advance of the 2023 annual meeting.\nInstead, the Court ordered the Parties to confer and submit a proposed schedule for a hearing on the motions\nto dismiss and the motion for preliminary injunction promptly following the 2023 annual meeting.\nF. On September 1, 2023, Camac voluntarily dismissed without prejudice the Institutional\nInvestors, specifically defendants Fred Alger Management, LLC, BVF Partners L.P., Farallon Capital\nManagement, L.L.C., Perceptive Advisors LLC, and Tybourne Capital (US) LLC.\nG. On September 8, 2023, the Court granted the remaining parties’ Stipulation and [Proposed]\nScheduling Order Governing Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, pursuant to which Camac withdrew its request\nfor a preliminary injunction and the parties agreed to stay all discovery pending the outcome of Defendants’\nmotion to dismiss the Original Complaint.\nH. On September 19, 2023, Forte held its 2023 annual meeting. Forte’s two nominees (Lawrence\nEichenfield, M.D., and Paul A. Wagner, Ph.D.) won reelection to the Board.\n4\nI. On October 23, 2023, Camac filed its Verified Amended Class Action and Derivative Complaint\n(the “Amended Complaint”). Count I is styled as a direct claim on behalf of a class of Forte stockholders for\nbreach of fiduciary duty against the Individual Defendants for approving the Private Placement and the\n“sequencing of the Annual Meeting and record date.” Count II is styled as a derivative claim on behalf of\nnominal defendant Forte and its stockholders against the Individual Defendants for “wrongful dilution.” The\nAmended Complaint further alleges facts regarding the Board’s adoption of the rights agreement, addition of\ndirectors to the Board, adoption of severance agreements for executives, and initiation of the at-the-market\noffering as support for Camac’s claims.\nJ. On November 3, 2023, Defendants moved to dismiss the Amended Complaint.\nK. On April 15, 2024, following briefing and oral argument, the Court denied Defendants’ motion\nto dismiss the Amended Complaint.\nL. On April 30, 2024, the Court entered an order granting the Parties’ Stipulation and [Proposed]\nOrder Governing Case Schedule, which provided for expedited proceedings in advance of trial to be held on\nJuly 29-31, 2024.\nM. Expedited discovery ensued, including extensive written discovery and multiple document\nproductions from the Parties and certain non-parties to the Action totaling over 28,000 pages.\n5\nN. The Parties also briefed Defendants’ motion to quash third-party subpoenas that Camac had\nissued, which the Court denied on May 17, 2024. Camac also filed a motion to strike one of Defendants’\naffirmative defenses and filed an opening brief in support thereof. Defendants filed an answering brief in\nresponse to the motion to strike on May 28, 2024.\nO. On June 4, 2024, the Parties reached an agreement-in-principle to settle the claims asserted in\nthe Action, subject to execution of the Stipulation and related papers and Court approval, and agreed to stay\nproceedings while the Parties negotiated the terms of the Stipulation and finalized the Settlement. The\nParties informed the Court of their agreement-in-principle the same day.\nP. Following an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the claims asserted in the Action,\nincluding review and analysis of the written and document discovery Camac received in the Action, Camac\nhas determined that the terms of the Settlement are fair, reasonable, adequate, and in the best interests of the\nCompany, the Class (defined below), and the Company’s stockholders, and that it is reasonable to pursue a\nsettlement of the Action based upon those terms and the procedures outlined herein.\nQ. At all times, Defendants have denied, and continue to deny, all allegations of wrongdoing in the\nAction, including without limitation that they have committed any breaches of fiduciary duty, that they have\nviolated Delaware law, or\n6\nthat Plaintiff or the Company and its stockholders have suffered any damages. Defendants expressly\nmaintain that they have at all times complied with their fiduciary and legal duties. Although Defendants\nbelieve that they have strong defenses to the claims asserted in the Action, Defendants are entering into this\nStipulation because the Settlement will eliminate the burden, expense, distraction, and uncertainties inherent\nin further litigation.\nR. This Stipulation (together with the Exhibits hereto), which has been duly executed by the\nundersigned signatories on behalf of their respective clients, reflects the final and binding agreement among\nthe Parties concerning the Settlement, subject to Court approval.\nNOW, THEREFORE, IT IS STIPULATED AND AGREED, in consideration of the benefits set forth\nbelow, and subject to the approval of the Court pursuant to Court of Chancery Rules 23 and 23.1, as\namended on May 31, 2024 and effective June 14, 2024, that the Action and the Released Claims (as defined\nbelow) shall be compromised, settled, released, and dismissed with prejudice on the merits and without costs\n(except as provided below), subject to the following terms and conditions:\nSETTLEMENT CONSIDERATION AND OTHER AGREEMENTS\n1.

Camac Standstill and Reimbursement of Out-of-Pocket Expenses.\n(a) Within three (3) days of entering into this Stipulation, Camac shall enter into a standstill\nand voting agreement with the Company with standard terms to be negotiated in good faith between the\nparties and a duration of three (3) years from the date of execution. Until such time as Camac executes the\nstandstill and voting agreement pursuant to this Paragraph, Camac shall not nominate directors for the 2024\nannual meeting or vote against management’s slate or proposals at the 2024 annual meeting.\n8\n(b) Within three (3) days of executing the standstill and voting agreement contemplated by\nParagraph 2(b) above, the Company shall pay or cause to be paid to Camac a total of $364,000.00 (U.S.\nDollars) in cash via wire transfer to compensate Camac for its documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred\nin connection with the 2023 annual meeting and its proxy contest to nominate Messrs.

The foregoing releases extend to any Unknown Claims, meaning any claims the Releasing\nParties do not know or suspect to exist at the time of the\n13\nreleases, which, if known, might have affected his, her, or its decision to settle with and release the Released\nParties, or might have affected his, her, or its decision not to object to this Settlement. Unknown Claims\ninclude those claims in which some or all of the facts comprising the claim may be unsuspected, or even\nundisclosed or hidden. With respect to any and all Released Claims, the Parties agree that upon the Effective\nDate, the Parties expressly waive the provisions, rights, and benefits conferred by or under California Civil\nCode Section 1542, or any other law of the United States or any state or territory of the United States, or\nprinciple of common law, which is similar, comparable, or equivalent to Section 1542, which provides:\nA GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS THAT THE CREDITOR OR\nRELEASING PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER\nFAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE AND THAT, IF KNOWN BY HIM\nOR HER, WOULD HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH\nTHE DEBTOR OR RELEASED PARTY.\nThe Parties acknowledge that they may hereafter discover facts in addition to or different from those\nnow known or believed to be true by them, with respect to the subject matter of the Released Claims, but it is\nthe intention of the Parties to completely, fully, finally, and forever compromise, settle, release, discharge,\nand extinguish any and all Released Claims, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, contingent or\nabsolute, accrued or unaccrued, apparent or unapparent, which do now exist, or heretofore existed, or may\nhereafter exist, and without regard to the subsequent discovery of additional or different facts. The Parties\nacknowledge\n14\nthat the foregoing waiver was separately bargained for and is a key element of this Stipulation of which this\nrelease is a part.\n6. The foregoing releases are not intended to release and shall not be deemed to release any rights\nor obligations of the Parties created by this Stipulation.\nCONDITIONS OF THE SETTLEMENT\n7. The Settlement was preceded by extensive litigation between the Parties in the Action, including\nbriefing on dispositive and discovery motions, written discovery, and document productions. Accordingly, in\ndetermining to enter into this Settlement, Plaintiff believes it was sufficiently informed of the circumstances\nand terms of its proxy contest, the Private Placement, and the 2023 annual meeting, and all other challenged\nconduct, actions, and events that are the subject to the Action, to determine whether the Settlement was in\nthe best interests of the Company, the members of the Class, and the Company’s stockholders.\n8. This Stipulation shall be terminated, and shall be void and of no force and effect, unless\notherwise agreed to by the Parties pursuant to the terms hereof, if (i) any Party exercises a right to terminate\nthe Settlement pursuant to the terms of this Stipulation; or (ii) the Settlement does not obtain Final Court\nApproval (defined below). If this Stipulation is terminated, this Stipulation and the Settlement shall be void\nand of no effect, and this Stipulation shall not be deemed to prejudice in any way the positions of any Party\nin the Action. In such event, and\n15\nconsistent with the applicable evidentiary rules, neither this Stipulation nor any of its contents, nor the\nexistence of this Stipulation, shall be admissible in evidence or shall be referred to for any purpose in the\nAction or in any other proceeding, except in connection with any claim for breach of this Stipulation or as\notherwise specifically provided herein.\n9. The Settlement (other than the obligations in Paragraphs 2(a) and (b) of this Stipulation) shall\nbe void and of no force and effect if the terms of the Settlement, except for the Fee and Expense Application\n(defined below), do not receive Final Court Approval (defined below), in which case the Parties shall revert\nto their litigation positions prior to entering into this Stipulation. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties\nagree that approval of the Fee and Expense Application (defined below) by the Court is not a condition\nprecedent to the Settlement or Final Court Approval thereof.\n10. In the event that any final injunction, decision, order, judgment, determination, or decree is\nentered or issued by any court or governmental entity prior to Final Court Approval (defined below) of this\nStipulation and the Settlement embodied herein that would make consummation of the Settlement in\naccordance with the terms of this Stipulation unlawful or that would restrain, prevent, enjoin, or otherwise\nprohibit consummation of the Settlement, the Parties each reserve the right to withdraw from and to\nterminate the Settlement. In addition, in the event that any\n16\npreliminary or temporary injunction, decision, order, determination, or decree (an “Interim Order”) is entered\nor issued by any court or governmental entity prior to Final Court Approval (defined below) of this\nStipulation and the Settlement that would restrain, prevent, enjoin, or otherwise prohibit consummation of\nthe Settlement, then, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Parties shall have no obligation to\nconsummate the Settlement unless and until such Interim Order expires or is terminated or modified in a\nmanner such that consummation of the Settlement in accordance with the terms of this Stipulation would no\nlonger be restrained, prevented, enjoined, or otherwise prohibited.\n11. The Settlement shall be conditioned upon (i) entry of the Order and Final Judgment by the Court\nin the form attached as Exhibit C, or as substantially modified by written consent of the Parties or the Court,\nwhich shall release any and all Released Claims (the “Judgment”); and (ii) the Judgment becoming final\nfollowing Final Court Approval (defined below).\n12. “Final Court Approval” of the Settlement means that the Court has approved the Settlement in\naccordance with the Stipulation and entered the Judgment, and such Judgment is finally affirmed on appeal\nor is no longer subject to appeal, and the time for any petition for re-argument, appeal, or review has expired.\nFor purposes of this paragraph, an “appeal” shall not include any appeal that concerns only the issue of\nattorneys’ fees and expenses.\n17\n13. The “Effective Date” of the Settlement shall be the first date by which the Court has entered the\nJudgment and such Judgment has received Final Court Approval.\n14. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Stipulation, any appeal or proceeding seeking\nsubsequent judicial review pertaining solely to an order issued with respect to attorneys’ fees or expenses\nand/or an incentive award payable to Plaintiff shall not in any way delay the Judgment from becoming final\nor the Effective Date of the Settlement.\nSUBMISSION AND APPLICATION TO THE COURT\n15. Within one (1) day of the execution of this Stipulation on behalf of all Parties, the Parties shall\nsubmit this Stipulation together with its exhibits to the Court, and the Parties shall apply jointly for entry of\nan order (the “Scheduling Order”), substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A, providing for,\namong other things: (i) approval of the form and content of the proposed Notice of the Settlement (defined\nbelow); and (ii) a date for the final settlement hearing (the “Settlement Hearing”). At the Settlement Hearing,\nthe Parties shall jointly request that the Judgment be entered substantially in the form attached as Exhibit C.\nNOTICE\n16. The Company shall be responsible for providing Notice of the Settlement to Company\nstockholders and all members of the Class in the form and\n18\nmanner directed by the Court (when approved by the Court, the “Notice”), substantially in the form attached\nhereto as Exhibit B. The Company shall cause to be paid all costs and expenses incurred in providing the\nNotice, including any costs and expenses associated with any additional copies of the Notice requested by\nrecord holders of the Company’s common stock (whether for the purpose of providing the Notice to\nbeneficial owners or otherwise).\nINTERIM INJUNCTION\n17. Subject to an order of the Court, pending final determination of whether the Settlement should\nbe approved, the Parties shall be barred and enjoined, to the maximum extent permitted under law, from\ncommencing, prosecuting, instigating, or in any way participating in the commencement or prosecution of\nany action asserting any of the Released Claims as defined herein, either directly, representatively,\nderivatively, or in any other capacity, and all pending deadlines in any and all such actions shall be\nsuspended.\nATTORNEYS’ FEES AND EXPENSES\n18. Camac intends to petition the Court for an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses in connection\nwith investigating and prosecuting the claims asserted in the Action (the “Fee and Expense Application”).\nAny attorneys’ fees and expenses awarded by the Court shall be paid by or on behalf of Defendants and/or\ntheir\n19\ninsurers in an aggregate amount not to exceed $1,700,000.00 (U.S. Dollars) (the “Fee and Expense\nReimbursement”).\n19. Plaintiff’s counsel’s Fee and Expense Application is not the subject of any agreement among\nPlaintiff and Defendants other than what is set forth in this Stipulation. Defendants agree that they will not\nobject to or otherwise take any position on the Fee and Expense Application so long as the Fee and Expense\nApplication seeks an award or reimbursement in an amount no greater than as set forth in the preceding\nParagraph.\n20. An award of attorneys’ fees or expenses to Plaintiff or Plaintiff’s counsel is not a necessary term\nof the Settlement and shall not be a condition of the Settlement. Neither Plaintiff nor Plaintiff’s counsel may\ncancel or terminate the Settlement based on the Court’s or any appellate court’s ruling on attorneys’ fees or\nexpenses.\n21. Except as provided in this Stipulation, the Defendant Releasors and the Company shall bear no\nother expenses, costs, damages, or fees alleged or incurred by any of Plaintiff’s counsel, or by any attorneys,\nexperts, advisors, agents, or representatives of Plaintiff, any Forte stockholder, or any Class member in\nconnection with the Action, the Released Claims, or the Settlement. The Plaintiff and Settlement\nClass Releasors shall bear no expenses, costs, damages, or fees alleged or incurred by any Defendant, or by\nany of any of Defendants’ attorneys, experts, advisors,\n20\nagents, or representatives in connection with the Action, the Released Claims, or the Settlement.\nTERMINATION\n22. Prior to the Effective Date, each Party shall have the right to terminate the Settlement and this\nStipulation by providing written notice of their election to do so, through counsel, to all other Parties hereto\nwithin thirty (30) calendar days of: (a) the Court’s final refusal to enter the Scheduling Order; (b) the Court’s\nrefusal to approve (including at the Settlement Hearing) the Settlement or any material part thereof; (c) the\nCourt’s refusal to enter the Judgment in any material respect or to dismiss the Action with prejudice; or\n(d) the date upon which an order vacating, modifying, revising, or reversing the Judgment becomes final.\n23.
