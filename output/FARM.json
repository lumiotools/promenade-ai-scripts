You should carefully consider the risk factors incorporated by reference herein from our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 and the other information contained in this\nprospectus, as updated, amended, or superseded by our subsequent filings under the Exchange Act and the risk\nfactors and other information contained in the applicable prospectus supplement before acquiring any of such\nsecurities. The occurrence of any of these risks might cause you to lose all or part of your investment in the\noffered securities. Although we have tried to discuss key risk factors, please be aware that these are not the only\nrisks we face and there may be additional risks that we do not presently know of or that we currently consider not\nlikely to have a significant impact. New risks may emerge at any time and we cannot predict such risks or estimate\nthe extent to which they may affect our business or our financial performance. Please also refer to the section\nentitled \"Forward-Looking Statements” above.\nUSE OF PROCEEDS\nUnless we specify otherwise in an accompanying prospectus supplement, we intend to use the net proceeds\nfrom the issuance or sale of our securities to provide additional funds for general corporate purposes, which may\ninclude, without limitation, the repayment of outstanding indebtedness, capital expenditures and/or improvements,\ndistributions to stockholders and working capital. Any specific allocation of the net proceeds of an offering of\nsecurities to a specific purpose will be determined at the time of such offering and will be described in the\naccompanying prospectus supplement to this prospectus.\nDESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK\nThe following description of our capital stock is not complete and may not contain all the information you\nshould consider before investing in our capital stock. This description is summarized from, and qualified in its\nentirety by reference to, our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and our Amended and\nRestated Bylaws, each as amended from time to time, which have been publicly filed with the SEC. See \"Where\nYou Can Find More Information; Incorporation by Reference.” You should read the prospectus supplement\napplicable to a particular issuance of securities, which will contain additional information and which may update or\nchange some of the information below.\nOur authorized capital stock currently consists of:\n• 50,000,000 shares of common stock, $1.00 par value (\"Common Stock”); and\n• 500,000 shares of preferred stock, $1.00 par value (\"Preferred Stock”).\n4\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCommon Stock\nSubject to the preferential rights of any outstanding series of Preferred Stock, holders of Common Stock are\nentitled to one vote per share on the election of directors and on all other matters submitted to a vote of the\nstockholders generally. Except with respect to the election of directors, the affirmative vote of the holders of a\nmajority in voting power of the shares represented at any meeting of stockholders and entitled to vote thereat\nshall be the act of the stockholders, unless otherwise provided by the General Corporation Law of the State of\nDelaware (the \"DGCL”), any other applicable law, our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation\n(including any certificate of designations of preferences as to any Preferred Stock), or our Amended and Restated\nBylaws. At each annual meeting of stockholders, directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast. Subject to\npreferences that may be applicable to any outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, the holders of Common Stock are\nentitled to receive ratably such dividends as may be declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally\navailable therefor. In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, holders of Common\nStock are entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining after payment of liabilities and the liquidation preferences\nof any outstanding shares of Preferred Stock. Holders of Common Stock have no preemptive or subscription\nrights, and no right to convert their Common Stock into any other securities. There are no redemption or sinking\nfund provisions applicable to the Common Stock. The Common Stock is not liable for further call or assessment.\nDelaware law provides that the holders of the outstanding shares of Common Stock will have the right to\nvote separately as a class on any amendment to our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation\nthat: (i) increases or decreases the authorized number of shares of Common Stock, (ii) changes the par value of the\nCommon Stock or (iii) alters or changes the powers, preferences, or special rights of the shares of Common Stock\nso as to affect them adversely.\nThe outstanding shares of Common Stock are fully paid and nonassessable. Additional shares of authorized\nCommon Stock may be issued, as authorized by the Board of Directors from time to time, without stockholder\napproval, except as may be required by applicable stock exchange requirements.\nStockholder Action By Written Consent; Special Meetings of Stockholders\nOur Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation prohibits stockholders from acting by\nconsent in lieu of a meeting and, as such, any action taken by the stockholders of the Company must be taken at a\nduly called annual or special meeting of stockholders. In addition, our Second Amended and Restated Certificate\nof Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws only authorize (i) the Chairman of the Board of Directors, if\nthere be one, (ii) the President or (iii) the Board of Directors to call a special meeting of stockholders, and do not\nauthorize our stockholders to call or request the holding of a special meeting of stockholders. These provisions\nmay limit the ability of stockholders to act in between annual meeting of stockholders.\nExclusive Forum\nThe Amended and Restated Bylaws provide that, unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of\nan alternative forum, the Court of Chancery (the \"Chancery Court”) of the State of Delaware (or, in the event that\nthe Chancery Court does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware or other state\ncourts of the State of Delaware) shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for\n(i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on the Company’s behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of\nbreach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or stockholder of the Company to the Company or to the\nCompany’s stockholders, (iii) any action arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or the Second Amended\nand Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Amended and Restated Bylaws (as either may be amended from\ntime to time), (iv) any action asserting a claim against the Company governed by the internal affairs doctrine, or\n(v) any action asserting an \"internal corporate claim” as the term is defined in Section 115 of the DGCL. The\nAmended and Restated Bylaws further provide that, if any action the subject matter of which is within the scope\nof the preceding sentence is filed in a court other than a court located within the State of Delaware (a \"Foreign\nAction”) in the name of any stockholder, such stockholder shall be deemed to have consented to (a) the personal\njurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within the State of Delaware in connection with any action\nbrought in any\n5\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nsuch court to enforce the preceding sentence and (b) having service of process made upon such stockholder in\nany such action by service upon such stockholder’s counsel in the Foreign Action as agent for such stockholder.\nTransfer Agent\nThe transfer agent and registrar for our Common Stock is EQ Shareowner Services.\nPreferred Stock\nThe Company’s Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation empowers the Board of Directors\nto issue up to 500,000 shares of Preferred Stock from time to time in one or more classes or series. The Board also\nmay fix for each such class or series such voting powers, full or limited, or no voting powers, and such\ndesignations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights and such qualifications,\nlimitations or restrictions thereof, including redemption rights, dividend rights, liquidation rights, conversion\nrights, voting powers, and the number of shares constituting any class or series or the designation of the class or\nseries.\nThe terms of any outstanding series of Preferred Stock could decrease the amount of earnings and assets\navailable for distribution to holders of Common Stock or negatively impact the ability of the holders of our\nCommon Stock to exercise their rights and power, including by diluting the voting power of the Common Stock or\nsubordinating the rights of the Common Stock, without any further vote or action by the stockholders. The rights\nof holders of Common Stock will be subject to the rights, powers or preferences of the holders of any series of\nPreferred Stock that may be issued by the Company in the future. The issuance of Preferred Stock could have the\neffect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company or make removal of management more\ndifficult. Additionally, the issuance of Preferred Stock may have the effect of decreasing the market price of the\nCommon Stock, and may negatively impact the ability of the holders of our Common Stock to exercise their voting\nand other powers and rights.\nDelaware law provides that the holders of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock will have the right to\nvote separately as a class on any amendment to our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation\nthat: (i) increases or decreases the authorized number of shares of Preferred Stock, (ii) changes the par value of the\nPreferred Stock or (iii) alters or changes the powers, preferences, or special rights of the shares of Preferred Stock\nso as to affect them adversely (provided that, if any such amendment within the scope of this clause (iii) alters or\nchanges the powers, preferences or special rights of one or more series of Preferred Stock to affect them\nadversely, but shall not so affect the entire class of Preferred Stock, the only the shares of the series so affected\nby the amendment shall vote as a separate class). This right is in addition to any voting powers and rights that\nmay be provided for in the applicable certificate of designations.\nAnti-Takeover Effects of Delaware Law\nThe Company is governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL. In general, Section 203 prohibits a\nDelaware corporation from engaging in a \"business combination” with an \"interested stockholder” for a period of\nthree years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless: before\nthe time that the person became an \"interested stockholder,” the board of directors approved either the \"business\ncombination” or the transaction which resulted in the person becoming an \"interested stockholder”; upon\ncompletion of the transaction that results in the \"interested stockholder” becoming an \"interested stockholder,”\nthe \"interested stockholder” owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the\ntransaction commenced (excluding for purposes of determining the number of shares outstanding, but not for\npurposes of determining the number of shares owned by the interested stockholder, (1) shares owned by persons\nwho are directors and also officers and (2) shares owned by employee stock plans in which employee participants\ndo not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares held subject to the plan will be tendered in a\ntender or exchange offer); or on or subsequent to the date that the person became an \"interested stockholder,” the\nbusiness combination is approved by the board of directors and authorized at an annual or special meeting of\nstockholders, and not by written consent, by the affirmative vote of at least 662⁄3% of the outstanding voting\nstock that is not owned by the \"interested stockholder.”\n6\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nGenerally, a \"business combination” includes a merger, asset sale, stock sale or other transaction resulting in\na financial benefit to the interested stockholder (other than on other than a pro rata basis with other stockholders).\nSubject to certain exceptions, an \"interested stockholder” is a person who, together with that person’s affiliates\nand associates, either owns 15% or more of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock or, if such person is an\naffiliate or associate of the corporation, within the three prior years did own 15% or more of the corporation’s\noutstanding voting stock. The statute could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in the\nCompany’s control with respect to transactions not approved by the Board of Directors in advance.\n7\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nDESCRIPTION OF DEPOSITARY SHARES\nWe may, at our option, elect to offer depositary shares rather than full shares of Preferred Stock. Each\ndepositary share will represent ownership of and entitlement to all rights and preferences of a fraction of a share of\nPreferred Stock of a specified class or series (including dividend, voting, redemption and liquidation rights). The\napplicable fraction will be specified in a prospectus supplement. The shares of Preferred Stock represented by the\ndepositary shares will be deposited with a depositary named in the applicable prospectus supplement, under a\ndeposit agreement, among us, the depositary and the holders of the certificates evidencing depositary shares, or\ndepositary receipts. Depositary receipts will be delivered to those persons purchasing depositary shares in the\noffering. The depositary will be the transfer agent, registrar and dividend disbursing agent for the depositary\nshares. Holders of depositary receipts agree to be bound by the deposit agreement, which requires holders to take\ncertain actions such as filing proof of residence and paying certain charges.\nThe following description of the depositary shares, and any description of the depositary shares in an\naccompanying prospectus supplement, may not be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by\nreference to, the underlying deposit agreement and the depositary receipt, which we will file with the SEC at or\nprior to the time of the sale of the depositary shares. You should refer to, and read this summary together with, the\ndeposit agreement and related depositary receipt. You can obtain copies of any form of deposit agreement or other\nagreement pursuant to which the depositary shares are issued by following the directions described under the\ncaption \"Where You Can Find More Information; Incorporation by Reference” in the accompanying prospectus\nsupplement.\nDividends\nThe depositary will distribute all cash dividends or other cash distributions received in respect of the class or\nseries of Preferred Stock represented by the depositary shares to the record holders of depositary receipts in\nproportion to the number of depositary shares owned by such holders on the relevant record date, which will be\nthe same date as the record date fixed by us for the applicable series of Preferred Stock. The depositary, however,\nwill distribute only such amount as can be distributed without attributing to any depositary share a fraction of one\ncent, and any balance not so distributed will be added to and treated as part of the next sum received by the\ndepositary for distribution to record holders of depositary receipts then outstanding.\nIn the event of a distribution other than in cash, the depositary will distribute property received by it to the\nrecord holders of depositary receipts entitled thereto, in proportion, as nearly as may be practicable, to the number\nof depositary shares owned by such holders on the relevant record date, unless the depositary determines (after\nconsultation with us) that it is not feasible to make such distribution, in which case the depositary may (with our\napproval) adopt any other method for such distribution as it deems equitable and appropriate, including the sale\nof such property (at such place or places and upon such terms as it may deem equitable and appropriate) and\ndistribution of the net proceeds from such sale to such holders.\nLiquidation Preference\nIn the event of the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company, whether voluntary or\ninvoluntary, the holders of each depositary share will be entitled to the fraction of the liquidation preference\naccorded each share of the applicable class or series of Preferred Stock as set forth in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement.\nRedemption\nIf the class or series of Preferred Stock represented by the applicable series of depositary shares is\nredeemable, such depositary shares will be redeemed from the proceeds received by the depositary resulting from\nthe redemption, in whole or in part, of the Preferred Stock held by the depositary. Whenever we redeem any\nPreferred Stock held by the depositary, the depositary will redeem as of the same redemption date the number of\ndepositary shares representing the shares of Preferred Stock so redeemed. The depositary will mail the notice of\nredemption promptly upon receipt of such notice from us and not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the\ndate fixed for redemption of the Preferred Stock and the depositary shares to the record holders of the depositary\nreceipts.\n8\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nVoting\nPromptly upon receipt of notice of any meeting at which the holders of the class or series of Preferred Stock\nrepresented by the applicable series of depositary shares are entitled to vote, the depositary will mail the\ninformation contained in such notice of meeting to the record holders of the depositary receipts as of the record\ndate for notice of such meeting. Each such record holder of depositary receipts will be entitled to instruct the\ndepositary as to the exercise of the voting rights pertaining to the number of shares of Preferred Stock represented\nby such record holder’s depositary shares. The depositary will endeavor, insofar as practicable, to vote such\nPreferred Stock represented by such depositary shares in accordance with such instructions, and we will agree to\ntake all action which may be deemed necessary by the depositary in order to enable the depositary to do so. The\ndepositary will abstain from voting any of the Preferred Stock to the extent that it does not receive specific\ninstructions from the holders of depositary receipts.\nWithdrawal of Preferred Stock\nUpon surrender of depositary receipts at the principal office of the depositary and payment of any unpaid\namount due to the depositary, and subject to the terms of the deposit agreement, the owner of the depositary\nshares evidenced thereby is entitled to delivery of the number of whole shares of Preferred Stock and all money\nand other property, if any, represented by such depositary shares. Partial shares of Preferred Stock will not be\nissued. If the depositary receipts delivered by the holder evidence a number of depositary shares in excess of the\nnumber of depositary shares representing the number of whole shares of Preferred Stock to be withdrawn, the\ndepositary will deliver to such holder at the same time a new depositary receipt evidencing such excess number of\ndepositary shares. Holders of Preferred Stock thus withdrawn will not thereafter be entitled to deposit such shares\nunder the deposit agreement or to receive depositary receipts evidencing depositary shares therefor.\nAmendment and Termination of Deposit Agreement\nThe form of depositary receipt evidencing the depositary shares and any provision of the deposit agreement\nmay at any time and from time to time be amended by agreement between us and the depositary. However, any\namendment which materially and adversely alters the rights of the holders (other than any change in fees) of\ndepositary shares will not be effective unless such amendment has been approved by at least a majority of the\ndepositary shares then outstanding. No such amendment may impair the right, subject to the terms of the deposit\nagreement, of any owner of any depositary shares to surrender the depositary receipt evidencing such depositary\nshares with instructions to the depositary to deliver to the holder of the Preferred Stock and all money and other\nproperty, if any, represented thereby, except in order to comply with mandatory provisions of applicable law.\nThe deposit agreement will be permitted to be terminated by us upon not less than 30 days prior written\nnotice to the applicable depositary if a majority of each series of Preferred Stock affected by such termination\nconsents to such termination, whereupon such depositary will be required to deliver or make available to each\nholder of depositary receipts, upon surrender of the depositary receipts held by such holder, such number of\nwhole or fractional shares of Preferred Stock as are represented by the depositary shares evidenced by such\ndepositary receipts together with any other property held by such depositary with respect to such depositary\nreceipts. In addition, the deposit agreement will automatically terminate if (a) all outstanding depositary shares\nthereunder shall have been redeemed, (b) there shall have been a final distribution in respect of the related\nPreferred Stock in connection with any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company and such\ndistribution shall have been distributed to the holders of depositary receipts evidencing the depositary shares\nrepresenting such Preferred Stock or (c) each share of the related Preferred Stock shall have been converted into\nstock of the Company not so represented by depositary shares.\nCharges of Depositary\nWe will pay all transfer and other taxes and governmental charges arising solely from the existence of the\ndepositary arrangements. We will pay charges of the depositary in connection with the initial deposit of the\nPreferred Stock and initial issuance of the depositary shares, and redemption of the Preferred Stock and all\nwithdrawals of Preferred Stock by owners of depositary shares. Holders of depositary receipts will\n9\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\npay transfer, income and other taxes and governmental charges and certain other charges as are provided in the\ndeposit agreement to be for their accounts. In certain circumstances, the depositary may refuse to transfer\ndepositary shares, may withhold dividends and distributions and sell the depositary shares evidenced by such\ndepositary receipt if such charges are not paid. The applicable prospectus supplement will include information\nwith respect to fees and charges, if any, in connection with the deposit or substitution of the underlying\nsecurities, the receipt and distribution of dividends, the sale or exercise of rights, the withdrawal of the underlying\nsecurity, and the transferring, splitting or grouping of receipts. The applicable prospectus supplement will also\ninclude information with respect to the right to collect the fees and charges, if any, against dividends received and\ndeposited securities.\nMiscellaneous\nThe depositary will forward to the holders of depositary receipts all notices, reports and proxy soliciting\nmaterial from us which are delivered to the depositary and which we are required to furnish to the holders of the\nclass or series of Preferred Stock represented by the depositary receipts. In addition, the depositary will make\navailable for inspection by holders of depositary receipts at the principal office of the depositary, and at such\nother places as it may from time to time deem advisable, any notices, reports and proxy soliciting material received\nfrom us which are received by the depositary as the holder of the class or series of Preferred Stock represented by\nthe depositary receipts. The applicable prospectus supplement will include information about the rights, if any, of\nholders of depositary receipts to inspect the transfer books of the depositary and the list of holders of depositary\nreceipts.\nNeither the depositary nor the Company assumes any obligation or will be subject to any liability under the\ndeposit agreement to holders of depositary receipts other than for its negligence or willful misconduct. Neither the\ndepositary nor the Company will be liable if it is prevented or delayed by law or any circumstance beyond its\ncontrol in performing its obligations under the deposit agreement. The obligations of the Company and the\ndepositary under the deposit agreement will be limited to performance in good faith of its and our respective\nduties thereunder, and neither we nor the depositary will be obligated to prosecute or defend any legal proceeding\nin respect of any depositary shares or Preferred Stock unless satisfactory indemnity is furnished. The Company\nand the depositary may rely on written advice of counsel or accountants, on information provided by holders of\nthe depositary receipts or other persons believed in good faith to be competent to give such information and on\ndocuments believed to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties.\nIn the event the depositary shall receive conflicting claims, requests or instructions from any holders of\ndepositary receipts, on the one hand, and us, on the other hand, the depositary shall be entitled to act on such\nclaims, requests or instructions received from us.\nResignation and Removal of Depositary\nThe depositary may resign at any time by delivering to us notice of its election to do so, and we may at any\ntime remove the depositary, any such resignation or removal to take effect upon the appointment of a successor\ndepositary and its acceptance of such appointment. Such successor depositary must be appointed within 60 days\nafter delivery of the notice for resignation or removal and must be a bank or trust company having its principal\noffice in the United States and having a combined capital and surplus of at least $150,000,000.\nDESCRIPTION OF WARRANTS\nWe may issue warrants for the purchase of shares of our Common Stock or Preferred Stock. We may issue\nwarrants independently or together with other securities, and the warrants may be attached to or separate from\nany offered securities. Each series of warrants will be issued under a separate warrant agreement to be entered into\nbetween us and the investors or a warrant agent. The following summary of material provisions of the warrants\nand warrant agreements are subject to, and qualified in their entirety by reference to, all the provisions of the\nwarrant agreement and warrant certificate applicable to a particular series of warrants. The terms of any warrants\noffered under a prospectus supplement may differ from the\n10\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nterms described below. We urge you to read the applicable prospectus supplement and any related free writing\nprospectus, as well as the complete warrant agreements and warrant certificates that contain the terms of the\nwarrants.\nThe particular terms of any issue of warrants will be described in the prospectus supplement relating to the\nissue. Those terms may include:\n• the number of shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock purchasable upon the exercise of warrants to\npurchase such shares and the price at which such number of shares may be purchased upon such\nexercise;\n• the designation, stated value and rights, powers, preferences and other terms (including, without\nlimitation, liquidation, dividend and conversion rights and voting powers) of the series of Preferred Stock\npurchasable upon exercise of warrants to purchase Preferred Stock;\n• the date, if any, on and after which the warrants and the related Common Stock or Preferred Stock will be\nseparately transferable;\n• the terms of any rights to redeem or call the warrants;\n• the date on which the right to exercise the warrants will commence and the date on which the right will\nexpire;\n• United States Federal income tax consequences applicable to the warrants; and\n• any additional terms of the warrants, including terms, procedures, and limitations relating to the exchange,\nexercise and settlement of the warrants.\nHolders of equity warrants will not be entitled:\n• to vote or consent as a stockholder of the Company or receive dividends;\n• to receive notice as stockholders with respect to any meeting of stockholders for the election of our\ndirectors or any other matter; or\n• to exercise any rights as stockholders of the Company.\nEach warrant will entitle its holder to purchase the number of shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock at\nthe exercise price set forth in, or calculable as set forth in, the applicable prospectus supplement. Unless we\notherwise specify in the applicable prospectus supplement, holders of the warrants may exercise the warrants at\nany time up to the specified time on the expiration date that we set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement.\nAfter the close of business on the expiration date, unexercised warrants will become void.\nA holder of warrant certificates may exchange them for new warrant certificates of different denominations,\npresent them for registration of transfer and exercise them at the corporate trust office of the warrant agent or any\nother office indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement. Until any warrants to purchase Common Stock or\nPreferred Stock are exercised, the holders of the warrants will not have any rights of holders of the underlying\nCommon Stock or Preferred Stock, including any rights to receive dividends or payments upon any liquidation,\ndissolution or winding up on the Common Stock or Preferred Stock, if any.\nDESCRIPTION OF PURCHASE CONTRACTS\nWe may issue purchase contracts for the purchase or sale of:\n• equity securities issued by us, a basket of such securities, an index or indices of such securities or any\ncombination of the above as specified in the applicable prospectus supplement;\n• currencies; or\n• commodities.\nEach purchase contract will entitle the holder thereof to purchase or sell, and obligate us to sell or purchase,\non specified dates, such securities, currencies or commodities at a specified purchase price, which\n11\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nmay be based on a formula, all as set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement.

All securities that we offer, other than our\ncommon stock, will be new issues of securities with no established trading market, and may or may not be listed\non a national securities exchange, quotation system or over-the-counter market. Any underwriters may make a\nmarket in these securities but will not be obligated to do so and may discontinue any market making at any time\nwithout notice. No assurance can be given as to the liquidity of the trading market for any securities sold by us.\nAny underwriter may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, short covering transactions and\npenalty bids in accordance with Regulation M under the Exchange Act.

Stabilizing transactions permit bids to purchase the underlying\nsecurity so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum price in accordance with Rule 104 of\nRegulation M under the Exchange Act. Short covering transactions involve purchases of the securities in the\nopen market after the distribution is completed to cover short positions. Short covering transactions also may be\neffected through a partial or full over-allotment exercise granted to them by us. Penalty bids permit the\nunderwriters to reclaim a selling concession from a dealer when the securities originally sold by the dealer are\npurchased in a covering transaction to cover short positions. Those activities may cause the price of the\nsecurities to be higher than it would otherwise be. If commenced, the underwriters may discontinue any of the\nactivities at any time.\nAny underwriters who are qualified market makers on Nasdaq may engage in passive market making\ntransactions in the securities on Nasdaq in accordance with Rule 103 of Regulation M under the Exchange Act\nduring the business day prior to the pricing of the offering and before the commencement of offers or sales of the\nsecurities. Passive market makers must comply with applicable volume and price limitations and must be identified\nas passive market makers. In general, a passive market maker must display its bid at a price not in excess of the\nhighest independent bid for such security; if all independent bids are lowered below the passive market maker’s\nbid, however, the passive market maker’s bid must then be lowered when certain purchase limits are exceeded.\nWe may engage in at-the-market offerings into an existing trading market in accordance with Rule 415(a)(4)\nunder the Securities Act. In addition, we may enter into derivative transactions with third parties, or sell securities\nnot covered by this prospectus to third parties in privately negotiated transactions. If the applicable prospectus\nsupplement so indicates, in connection with those derivatives, the third parties may sell securities covered by this\nprospectus and the applicable prospectus supplement, including in short sale transactions. If so, the third party\nmay use securities pledged by us or borrowed from us or others to settle those sales or to close out any related\nopen borrowings of stock, and may use securities received from us in settlement of those derivatives to close out\nany related open borrowings of stock. The third party in such sale transactions will be an underwriter and, if not\nidentified in this prospectus, will be named in the applicable prospectus supplement (or a post-effective\namendment). In addition, we may otherwise loan or pledge securities to a financial institution or other third party\nthat in turn may sell the securities short using this prospectus and an applicable prospectus supplement. Such\nfinancial institution or other third party may transfer its economic short position to investors in our securities or in\nconnection with a concurrent offering of other securities.\nWe may sell the securities in exchange in whole or part for consideration other than cash.

          "content": "Third quarter fiscal 2024 letter to shareholders\nMay 9, 2024\n2\nDear shareholders,\nIn our fiscal third quarter, we were pleased to maintain the positive year-over-year gains we have made\nin several of our key metrics, including gross margins and adjusted EBITDA1.\nOur results reflect continued progress related to the transformation of our direct store delivery (DSD)\nbusiness. During the third quarter, we continued consolidation of our roasting and production\noperations to our Portland, Oregon facility and made significant strides related to our brand pyramid\nand SKU rationalization projects. We are also beginning to see positive trend changes in customer\nretention as a result of our new sales structure, which we implemented earlier in the fiscal year. We\nbelieve a return to customer growth will follow continued improvements to in-stock positions and\nequipment service.\nWe are building a foundation to support long-term profitable growth and value creation and we remain\nconfident in becoming free cash flow2 positive in early fiscal 2025. There is still much work to be done so\nwe do not expect our results to be linear quarter to quarter.\nThird quarter fiscal 2024 financial results\nPlease note, results for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 are reported on a continuing operations basis,\nreflecting the performance of our DSD business in the current and prior year periods. You should refer\nto our Form 10-Q, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) today, May 9,\n2024, for further information regarding the respective performance of our discontinued and continuing\noperations.\nThird quarter fiscal 2024 sales were $85.4 million compared to $85.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal\n2023. Overall, net sales decreased slightly on a year-over-year basis due to a reduction in unit sales,\nwhich was largely offset by higher pricing.\nTotal quarterly net sales (millions) and gross margin % from continuing operations\n1Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. Please refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for an explanation and reconciliation of\nAdjusted EBITDA and other related non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures Free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, is cash\nflow from operations less capital expenditures.\n2Free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, is cash flow from operations less capital expenditures.\n3\nGross margins increased 660 basis points on a year-over-year basis to 40.1% compared to 33.5% for the\nthird quarter of the prior year. Gross profit during the quarter increased $5.5 million to $34.2 million, or\n19% on a year-over-year basis, compared to $28.8 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The\nincrease in gross margin was primarily due to improved pricing and a decrease in underlying commodity\ncost compared to the prior year period.\nOperating expenses decreased slightly from $35.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to $34.7\nmillion in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. This decrease was due to a $2.3 million increase in net gains\nassociated with the sale of branch properties and other assets, partially offset by a $1.3 million increase\nin selling expenses and a $0.2 million increase in general and administrative (G&A) expenses during the\nthird quarter. The selling expense increase was primarily due to additional costs related to healthcare\nbenefits, vehicle rent expense and other benefit-related expenses, which were partially offset by a\ndecrease in advertising-related expense.\nNet income from continuing operations moved to a loss of $0.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024\ncompared to a loss of $6.9 million during the prior year period, an improvement of approximately $6.2\nmillion.\nOur capital expenditures for the quarter were flat compared to the prior year at $3.4 million. In fiscal\n2024, we anticipate between $12 and $15 million in total capital expenditures. We expect to finance\nthese expenditures through cash flow from operations and borrowings under our credit facility.\nAdjusted EBITDA1 for the third quarter remained positive for the second consecutive quarter at $0.3\nmillion compared to a loss of $0.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023.\nAs of March 31, 2024, we had $5.5 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and $0.2 million in\nrestricted cash. Additionally, we had outstanding borrowings of $23.3 million, utilized $4.6 million of the\nletters of credit sub-limit and had $30.5 million of availability under our revolver credit facility. We\nbelieve we are adequately capitalized and expect to achieve our goal to be free cash flow2 positive in\nearly fiscal 2025.\nStrategic and operational update\nWith one of the largest DSD networks in the country, Farmer Brothers remains focused on delivering the\nhigh-quality coffee, tea and culinary products and equipment service which has set us apart for more\nthan 110 years. From local restaurants and convenience store chains to entertainment venues and five-\nstar hotels, Farmer Brothers is committed to providing the right product at the right price at the right\ntime for our wide-ranging customer base.\nWe made significant strides during the third quarter in redefining our tiered coffee offerings and\nsimplifying our SKU list. This change to our brand pyramid is designed to create clearly defined\ntraditional, premium and specialty coffee lines within our product catalog and simplify our offerings and\nthe overall customer experience. It will also remove SKU redundancies across our previous product lines,\ncreating additional operational and cost efficiencies for the organization and streamline our inventory\nand sales approach.\nAs we continue this work, we are encouraged to see our planning and production teams have been able\nto improve scheduling, resulting in better in-stock and delivery capabilities. As of the third quarter we\nnow have more inventory in SKUs related to our new tiered coffee offerings than those of our previous\ncatalog. We expect to complete this transition by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2025.\n1Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. Please refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for an explanation and reconciliation of\nAdjusted EBITDA and other related non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures Free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, is cash\nflow from operations less capital expenditures.\n2Free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, is cash flow from operations less capital expenditures.\n4\nWe are also continuing to invest in technology upgrades to drive efficiency and better serve our\ncustomers. During the third quarter, we completed an upgrade of handheld devices for our route sales\nrepresentatives, which is expected to drive better inventory management, invoicing and customer\nservice.\nOur customer retention rate has vastly improved compared to the prior year. Our focus on improving\nkey elements of our value proposition to acquire and retain profitable customers is beginning to bear\nfruit.\nLastly, as we continue to focus on right sizing our operations, we signed a long-term lease in late March\nfor our new headquarters in Fort Worth, Texas. This space better aligns with our current business needs.\nWe expect to complete the move to our new location by the end of fiscal 2024.\nOutlook and closing\nWe are proud of the strides we have made and the early wins we have achieved related to our DSD\ntransformation, but we are not done yet. We firmly believe in the sustainable, long-term potential of\nFarmer Brothers to generate significant shareholder value. Change of this magnitude, however, takes\ntime and patience as we continue to implement deliberate and foundational changes to generate\nefficiencies which will drive long-term success.\nAs a result, we do not expect progress in our financial results to be linear quarter to quarter as we\nexecute and focus on measured, strategic long-term growth. However, we remain confident we are well\npositioned to achieve free cash flow2 positivity in early fiscal 2025.\nThis year has been one of tremendous change for our organization and we fully believe there is still\nopportunity for further optimization and growth as we remain focused on:\n• Driving customer retention and growth.\n• Improving our cost structure and delivering incremental margin improvement.\n• Increasing market penetration for new, on-trend products.\n• Completing the transitional services associated with our direct ship sale.\nWe want to thank our team members for their tireless work and dedication, as well as the continued\nsupport of our partners, customers and shareholders.\nSincerely,\nJohn Moore Brad Bollner\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer Interim Chief Financial Officer\n1Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure.

Further, management utilizes these measures, in addition to GAAP\nmeasures, when evaluating and comparing the Company’s operating performance against internal financial forecasts\nand budgets.\nWe believe that EBITDA facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period by isolating the\neffects of certain items that vary from period to period without any correlation to core operating performance or that\nvary widely among similar companies. These potential differences may be caused by variations in capital structures\n(affecting interest expense), tax positions (such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates\nor net operating losses) and the age and book depreciation of facilities and equipment (affecting relative depreciation\nexpense). We also present EBITDA and EBITDA Margin because (i) we believe that these measures are frequently\nused by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry, (ii) we believe\nthat investors will find these measures useful in assessing our ability to service or incur indebtedness, and (iii) we\nuse these measures internally as benchmarks to compare our performance to that of our competitors.\nEBITDA, EBITDA Margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, as defined by us, may not be\ncomparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We do not intend for non-GAAP financial\nmeasures to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n1Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure.

          "content": "Second quarter fiscal 2024 letter to shareholders\nFeb. 8, 2024\nDear shareholders,\nAs we continue to transition our operation to focus solely on direct store delivery (DSD), we are pleased\nto see early momentum in several of our operational and financial metrics.\nOverall, during the second quarter of fiscal 2024 we saw meaningful improvements in gross margin and\nadjusted EBITDA. Our gross margin during the quarter rose above 40% for the first time in more than a\nyear. While we do anticipate some one-time items and pressures in the near future which could impact\ngross margin, we expect to be able to capture additional upside as we have now sold through the\nmajority of our older, higher cost inventory. We believe the company is now positioned to generate\nsustainable gross margin in excess of 40%.\nIn addition, we are continuing to make progress on centralizing our roasting and production operations\nto our Portland, Oregon facility. We remain confident we are well on our way to being free cash flow1\npositive by early fiscal 2025.\nSecond quarter fiscal 2024 financial results\nPlease note, results for the fiscal 2024 second quarter are reported on a continuing operations basis,\nreflecting the performance of our DSD business in the current and prior year periods. You should refer\nto our Form 10-Q, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) today, Feb. 8,\n2024, for further information regarding the respective performance of our discontinued and continuing\noperations.\nSecond quarter fiscal 2024 sales increased $600,000 to $89.5 million compared to $88.9 million in the\nsecond quarter of fiscal 2023. Overall, net sales were positively impacted by higher pricing compared to\nprior periods, but were offset by a decrease in year-over-year coffee and allied product volume.\nGross margin increased 550 basis points on a year-over-year basis to 40.4% compared to 34.9% for the\nsecond quarter of the prior year. Gross profit during the quarter increased $5.1 million to $36.1 million,\nor 16% on a year-over-year basis, compared to $31 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The\nincrease in gross margin was primarily due to improved pricing and a decrease in underlying\ncommodities cost compared to the prior year period.\nTotal quarterly net sales (millions) and gross margin % from continuing operations\n1 Free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, is cash flow from operations less capital expenditures.\n2 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. Please refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for an explanation and reconciliation of\nAdjusted EBITDA and other related non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures.\nOperating expenses decreased $2.6 million from $34.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 to\n$31.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. We saw a $1.1 million increase in general and\nadministrative (G&A) expense and a $2.5 million increase in selling expense, which was offset by a $6.2\nmillion increase in net gains from the sale of branch properties and other assets during the quarter. The\nselling expense increase was primarily due to additional costs related to healthcare benefits, rent and a\nyear-over-year increase in incentive compensation expense, partially offset by a decrease in advertising-\nrelated expense. The increase in G&A expense was also driven by an increase in incentive compensation\nexpense and severance-related costs, partially offset by a decrease in IT and consulting related costs\ncompared to the prior year.\nNet income from continuing operations moved from a loss of $8.7 million during the prior year period to\na gain of $2.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, an improvement of $11.4 million.\nOur capital expenditures for the quarter were $3.3 million compared to $4.7 million in the prior year\nperiod. In fiscal 2024, we anticipate between $12 and $15 million in capital expenditures. We expect to\nfinance these expenditures through cash flow from operations and borrowings under our credit facility.\nAdjusted EBITDA2 for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 was $2.3 million, an increase of $4.5 million\ncompared to a loss of $2.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023.\nAs of Dec. 31, 2023, we had $6.9 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents. Additionally, we had\noutstanding borrowings of $23.3 million, utilized $4.6 million of the letters of credit sub-limit and had\n$24.5 million of availability under our credit facility. We believe we are adequately capitalized to finance\nour operations in fiscal 2024 and expect to achieve our goal to be free cash flow positive by early fiscal\n2025.\nStrategic and operational update\nFrom providing traditional and on-trend product options to world-class equipment service and support,\nFarmer Brothers’ nationwide network is backed by the local expertise necessary to meet the unique\nneeds of our extensive DSD customer base.\nWe are seeing improvements in customer retention and believe we are in a solid position to grow our\ncustomer base in the future. Leveraging insights from our AI-backed technology, we are focusing on\nimproving key portions of our value proposition that best retain and gain customers.\nAs we highlighted last quarter, we continue to reduce brand and SKU redundancies across our coffee\nline in an effort to simplify our offerings and streamline our procurement, production and sales\noperations. By removing redundancies across our catalog, our planning and production teams will be\nable to improve scheduling and focus on producing our most popular and profitable items. This will\nultimately improve our in-stock and delivery capabilities and allow us to realize additional efficiencies\nand cost savings.\nWe are continuing to invest in technology as part of what we are internally calling “Project Symphony”\nto improve our customer experience. Currently, we are enhancing our field inventory management tools\nand have recently launched a new customer relationship management (CRM) system. These tools will\nhelp our teams better track, communicate and meet the needs of our DSD customer base.\n1 Free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, is cash flow from operations less capital expenditures.\n2 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. Please refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for an explanation and reconciliation of\nAdjusted EBITDA and other related non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures.\nOur national equipment and field service continues to be a critical driver of our customer retention\nefforts. Our highly trained and certified technicians provide 24/7 preventive and emergency\nmaintenance services, as well as access to new and refurbished beverage equipment.\nOutlook and closing\nOverall, we continue to see positive momentum, highlighted by our gross margin and adjusted EBITDA\nperformance. We know there is still work to be done as we complete our transition to a DSD-focused\nbusiness. During the second half of fiscal 2024, we are focused on further improvement as we:\n• Improve our cost structure and deliver incremental margin improvement\n• Drive customer growth and retention\n• Increase market penetration for new, on-trend products\n• Complete the transitional services associated with our direct ship sale\nWhile we do not expect results to be linear on a quarter-over-quarter basis, we believe we are in a\nbetter position to generate sustainable top-line growth. We firmly believe we will achieve our goal of\nbeing free cash flow positive by early fiscal 2025 and want to thank our team members, partners,\ncustomers and shareholders for their continued dedication and support. Together, we will continue to\ndrive success and create long-term value for our shareholders.\nSincerely,\nJohn Moore Brad Bollner\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer Interim Chief Financial Officer\nInvestor contract\nEllipsis IR\ninvestor.relations@farmerbros.com\nMedia contact\nBrandi Wessel\nDirector of Communications\n405-885-5176\nbwessel@farmerbros.com\nInvestor conference call\nFarmer Brothers (NASDAQ: FARM) will publish its fiscal second quarter 2024 financial results for the\nperiod ended Dec. 31, 2023 with the filing of its 10-Q and the issuing of its quarterly shareholder letter,\nboth of which will be posted on the Investor Relations section of its website after the close of market\nThursday, Feb. 8.\n1 Free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, is cash flow from operations less capital expenditures.\n2 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure.

Further, management utilizes these measures, in addition to GAAP\nmeasures, when evaluating and comparing the Company’s operating performance against internal financial\nforecasts and budgets.\nWe believe that EBITDA facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period by isolating the\neffects of certain items that vary from period to period without any correlation to core operating performance or\nthat vary widely among similar companies. These potential differences may be caused by variations in capital\nstructures (affecting interest expense), tax positions (such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in\neffective tax rates or net operating losses) and the age and book depreciation of facilities and equipment (affecting\nrelative depreciation expense). We also present EBITDA and EBITDA Margin because (i) we believe that these\nmeasures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies\nin our industry, (ii) we believe that investors will find these measures useful in assessing our ability to service or incur\nindebtedness, and (iii) we use these measures internally as benchmarks to compare our performance to that of our\ncompetitors.\nEBITDA, EBITDA Margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, as defined by us, may not be\ncomparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We do not intend for non-GAAP financial\nmeasures to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n1 Free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, is cash flow from operations less capital expenditures.\n2 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure.

          "content": "First quarter fiscal 2024 letter to shareholders\nNov. 9, 2023\nDear shareholders,\nWe find ourselves at a pivotal moment, characterized by the strategic divestiture of our\ndirect ship business and a model refocused on what we have always done best – direct\nstore delivery (DSD). While there is still work to be done, we are confident we are well\npositioned to deliver improving operational and financial results in the coming quarters\nas we focus on generating long-term shareholder value.\nThe first quarter of fiscal 2024 was a step in the right direction, as revenue was up slightly\nyear over year, gross margins improved and adjusted EBITDA approached breakeven.\nResults were, as expected, impacted by costs associated with our direct ship sale and\ninternal reorganization efforts, as well as slightly sluggish coffee volumes. We, however,\nremain optimistic we will continue to see improvement in our revenue, gross margins and\noperating costs.\nIn terms of costs, we recently completed a targeted reduction of our operating expenses,\nwhich appropriately sizes our organization. We are also making progress on centralizing\nour roasting and production activities to our Portland, Oregon facility, which once\ncompleted will provide significant efficiency and cost savings benefits.\nIn addition, our average cost per pound of coffee in the quarter decreased approximately\n12% compared to the first quarter of 2023 and 1.6% versus the prior quarter. We are\ncontinuing to bring in new supply at a meaningfully lower price. We are also working to\nevaluate and reduce brand and SKU redundancies across our coffee lines to simplify our\ncustomer-facing lineup and further streamline production and sales operations. We\nbelieve these efforts will help drive down our cost of goods sold (COGs) throughout the\ncoming quarters.\nFirst quarter fiscal 2024 financial results\nAs a reminder, results for the fiscal 2024 first quarter are reported on a continuing\noperations basis, reflecting the performance of our DSD business in the respective\nperiods. Please refer to our Form 10-Q, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (SEC) today, Nov. 9, 2023, for further information regarding the respective\nperformance of our discontinued and continuing operations.\nFirst quarter fiscal 2024 net sales were $81.9 million, which increased slightly on a year-\nover-year basis compared to $79.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Overall, net\n2\nsales were positively impacted by higher pricing compared to prior periods, but were\noffset by transitional costs and a slight decrease in coffee volume.\nGross profit during the quarter increased to $30.8 million compared to $27.0 million for\nthe first quarter of fiscal 2023. Gross margin increased 380 basis points on a year-over-\nyear basis to 37.6%. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to improved pricing\nand a decrease in underlying costs.\nTotal quarterly net sales and gross margin % from continuing operations\n100 50%\n90\n45%\n80\n40%\n70\n35%\n60\n30%\n50\n25%\n40\n30 20%\nSep '21 Dec '21 Mar '22 Jun '22 Sep '22 Dec '22 Mar '23 Jun '23 Sep '23\nTotal net sales (in millions) Gross margin %\nOperating expenses were $32.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, up from $27.8\nmillion in the prior year period. This increase was due to a $3.6 million increase in general\nand administrative (G&A) expenses, a $400,000 decrease in net gains from the sale of\nbranch properties and other assets and a $1.1 million increase in selling expenses. The\nincrease in selling expenses during the first quarter was primarily due to additional spend\non vehicles, fleet and freight. The increase in G&A expenses was primarily due to\nseverance costs of $2.3 million related to executive management transitions and the non-\nrecurrence of a $1.9 million gain related to the Boyd settlement in the prior year.\nNet loss from continuing operations was $1.3 million compared to a loss of $1.6 million in\nthe first quarter of 2023.\nFor the three months ended Sept. 30, 2023, our capital expenditures were $3.5 million\ncompared to $2.8 million in the prior year period. In fiscal 2024, we anticipate paying\n3\nbetween $16 and $18 million in capital expenditures. We expect to finance these\nexpenditures through cash flow from operations and borrowings under our credit facility.\nAdjusted EBITDA approached breakeven for the fiscal first quarter at a loss of $452,000\ncompared to a loss of $3.9 million on a year-over-year basis.\nTurning to the balance sheet, as of Sept. 30, 2023, we had $4 million of unrestricted cash\nand cash equivalents. As of Sept. 30, 2023, we had outstanding borrowings of $23.3\nmillion, utilized $4.6 million of the letters of credit sub-limit and had $25.4 million of\navailability under our credit facility. We believe we are adequately capitalized to finance\nour operations in fiscal 2024.\nStrategic and operational updates\nWith a local branch network covering 49 states and equipment servicing capabilities\nacross the country, Farmer Brothers remains an industry leader in size, service and\nproduct offerings. We are uniquely positioned to meet the ever-changing needs of our\nnationwide DSD customer base. Our renewed and complete focus on this base not only\nbetter aligns our sales strategy, but also allows for enhanced logistical planning\nthroughout the organization.\nAlready during the first quarter, we are seeing a positive turnaround as customer\nretention is flattening. We believe it will begin to turn positive as we continue to improve\nour performance. Meanwhile, our operational and transitional cost impacts are expected\nto continue to decline on a quarter-over-quarter basis throughout the year as we\nappropriately size our cost structure.\nIn addition, our new AI-backed pricing approach is helping optimize our pricing strategy\nby establishing companywide pricing models and informing necessary and timely\nchanges in pricing. We will be rolling out additional modules throughout fiscal 2024 using\nAI insights targeted at increasing customer retention, driving market-based sales gains\nand further simplifying our DSD pricing tiers to drive better margin performance.\nWe are also making headway with several growth initiatives. Our new, on-trend product\nadditions, including our SHOTT natural flavored syrups and Boyd’s ambient liquid coffee,\nare performing well in their early stages. Our Revive equipment and service business also\ncontinues to be a differentiator for our DSD business.\n4\nOutlook and closing\nOverall, we are pleased with the early transition results and believe Farmer Brothers’\nfocus on DSD will better enable us to generate sustainable top line growth with a goal of\ngenerating free cash flow early in our fiscal 2025 year. We are continuing to see\nimprovements in our cost structure and overall operational efficiency, but we know\nprogress will not be 100% linear across all areas.\nMoving into the second quarter and beyond, we will continue to explore avenues to:\n• Leverage our nationwide DSD customer network\n• Appropriately size our cost structure\n• Continue to optimize pricing\n• Drive customer growth and retention\n• Increase market penetration for on-trend products\n• Complete the transitional services associated with our direct ship sale\nIn closing, we would like to thank our dedicated team members, partners, customers and\nshareholders for their support. Your continued dedication and confidence in our business\nis instrumental. Together, we are confident we will achieve our goals and create long-\nterm value for our stakeholders.\nSincerely,\nJohn Moore Brad Bollner\nInterim Chief Executive Officer Interim Chief Financial Officer\nInvestor contact: M edia contact:\nEllipsis IR Brandi Wessel\nInvestor.relations@farmerbros.com Director of Communications\n405-885-5176\nbwessel@farmerbros.com\n5\nInvestor conference call\nThe company will host an audio-only investor conference call today, Thursday, Nov. 9,\n2023, at 5 p.m. Eastern to review the company’s financial results for the fiscal first quarter\nended Sept. 30, 2023.\nInterested parties may access the webcast via the Investor Relations section of the Farmer\nBrothers’ website.

Further, management\nutilizes these measures, in addition to GAAP measures, when evaluating and comparing the\nCompany’s operating performance against internal financial forecasts and budgets.\nWe believe that EBITDA facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period\nby isolating the effects of certain items that vary from period to period without any correlation to\ncore operating performance or that vary widely among similar companies. These potential\ndifferences may be caused by variations in capital structures (affecting interest expense), tax\npositions (such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or net\noperating losses) and the age and book depreciation of facilities and equipment (affecting relative\ndepreciation expense). We also present EBITDA and EBITDA Margin because (i) we believe that these\nmeasures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to\nevaluate companies in our industry, (ii) we believe that investors will find these measures useful in\n12\nassessing our ability to service or incur indebtedness, and (iii) we use these measures internally as\nbenchmarks to compare our performance to that of our competitors.\nEBITDA, EBITDA Margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, as defined by us, may\nnot be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We do not intend for\nnon-GAAP financial measures to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other measures\nprepared in accordance with GAAP.\nSet forth below is a reconciliation of reported net loss to EBITDA (unaudited):\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n(In thousands) 2023 2022\nNet loss from continuing operations, as reported $ (1,307) $ (1,580)\nIncome tax (benefit) expense (132) 43\nInterest expense (1) 1,007 904\nDepreciation and amortization expense 2,948 3,381\nEBITDA $ 2,516 $ 2,748\nEBITDA Margin 3.1 % 3.4 %\n____________\n(1) Excludes interest expense related to pension plans and postretirement benefit plan.\nSet forth below is a reconciliation of reported net loss to Adjusted EBITDA (unaudited):\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n(In thousands) 2023 2022\nNet loss from continuing operations, as reported $ (1,307) $ (1,580)\nIncome tax (benefit) expense (132) 43\nInterest expense (1) 1,007 904\nDepreciation and amortization expense 2,948 3,381\n401(k), ESOP and share-based compensation expense 1,552 2,197\nGain on settlement with Boyd's sellers (2) — (1,917)\nNet gains from sale of assets (6,785) (7,182)\nSeverance costs 2,265 234\nAdjusted EBITDA $ (452) $ (3,920)\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin (0.6) % (4.9) %\n________\n(1) Excludes interest expense related to pension plans and postretirement benefit plans.\n(2) Result of the settlement related to the acquisition of Boyd Coffee Company which included the cancellation of shares of\nSeries A Preferred Stock and settlement of liabilities.\n13"

          "content": "FARMER BROS. CO.\nAMENDED AND RESTATED\nAUDIT COMMITTEE CHARTER\n(as adopted by the Board of Directors on September 8, 2016 and amended on October 28, 2019 and\nMay 1, 2024)\nPurpose\nThe Audit Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Farmer Bros.\nCo. (the “Company”) is established for the principal purposes of overseeing on behalf of the Board the\naccounting and financial reporting processes of the Company and the audit of its financial statements. The\nCommittee is established to assist the Board in overseeing: (i) the integrity of the Company’s financial\nstatements; (ii) the independent auditor’s qualifications and independence; (iii) the performance of the\nCompany’s independent auditor and internal audit function; (iv) the Company’s compliance with legal and\nregulatory requirements relating to accounting and financial reporting matters; (v) the Company’s system of\ndisclosure controls and procedures, internal control over financial reporting that management has established\nand compliance with ethical standards adopted by the Company; and (vi) the Company’s framework and\nguidelines with respect to financial risk assessment and financial risk management. The Committee shall\nalso provide an open avenue of communication among the independent auditors, internal audit staff, financial\nand other senior management of the Company and the Board.\nOrganization, Membership and Meetings\n1. The Committee shall be composed of at least three (3) directors, all of whom shall meet the\nindependence, expertise and other qualification standards required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,\nas amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (the “Exchange Act”), the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (“SEC”) and Nasdaq. At least one member of the Committee shall qualify as an “audit\ncommittee financial expert” under Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Exchange Act.\nThe identity of such member(s) shall be disclosed in periodic filings as required by the SEC.\n2. Members of the Committee shall be appointed by the Board. Members of the Committee\nshall continue to be Committee members until their successors are appointed and qualified or until their\nearlier retirement, resignation or removal. Any member may be removed, with or without cause, by the\napproval of a majority of the independent directors then serving on the full Board. The Board may fill any\nvacancies on the Committee by a majority vote of the directors then in office.\n3. The Committee shall meet at least quarterly, with the authority to convene additional\nmeetings, as circumstances require. The Committee may invite members of management, the internal audit\nstaff, independent auditors, legal counsel or others to attend meetings and to provide relevant information.\nThe Committee shall meet periodically with management, the internal audit staff and the independent auditor\nin separate executive sessions to discuss matters which the Committee members or these groups believe\nshould be discussed privately.\n4. The Committee may form and delegate authority to subcommittees when appropriate, or to\none or more members of the Committee.\n5. The Board shall designate a Committee member as the Chairman of the Committee, or if\nthe Board does not do so, the Committee members shall appoint a Committee member as Chairman by a\nmajority vote of the authorized number of Committee members. The Chairman of the Committee shall\npreside at all Committee meetings and set the agenda for any meeting in consultation with other members of\nthe Committee, as appropriate. Briefing materials will be provided to the Committee as far in advance of\nmeetings as practicable. At all meetings of the Committee, a majority of the members of the Committee\nshall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, and the act of a majority of the members of the\nCommittee present at a meeting at which a quorum is in attendance shall be the act of the Committee.\nMembers of the Committee may participate in any meeting by means of a conference telephone or similar\ncommunications equipment by means of which persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and\nsuch participation shall constitute presence in person at such meeting. The Committee shall maintain\nwritten minutes of its meetings. Minutes of each meeting of the Committee shall be distributed to each\nmember of the Committee and the Board. The Secretary of the Company shall retain the original signed\nminutes for filing with the corporate records of the Company. Any person present at a meeting may be\nappointed by the Committee as Secretary to record the minutes. The Committee may adopt additional\nrules of procedure, but when a matter of procedure is not addressed by Committee rules, the procedure\nspecified by the Company’s Bylaws shall be followed. The Committee may also act by unanimous\nwritten consent as the Committee may decide.\n6. The Committee shall make itself available to meet with management of the Company and\nthe internal audit staff to discuss any matters that any of them deems appropriate, and shall be available to\nthe independent auditors during the year for consultation purposes. In carrying out its duties and\nresponsibilities, the Committee also has the authority to meet with and seek any information it requires\nfrom employees, officers, directors, or external parties.\nCommittee Authority, Responsibilities and Duties\n1. The Committee’s role is one of oversight. The Company’s management is responsible for\nthe preparation, presentation and integrity of the Company’s financial statements as well as the\nCompany’s financial reporting process, accounting policies, internal audit function, internal accounting\ncontrols and disclosure controls and procedures. The Company’s independent auditors are responsible for\nauditing the Company’s annual financial statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing\nstandards (“GAAS”), expressing an opinion as to the conformity of such annual financial statements with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and reviewing the Company’s quarterly financial\nstatements. While the Committee has certain authority and oversight responsibilities under this Charter, it\nis not the responsibility of the Committee to plan or conduct audits or to determine that the Company’s\nfinancial statements and disclosures are complete and accurate and are in accordance with GAAP and\napplicable rules and regulations, or to assure the operating effectiveness of internal controls or accounting\nsystems. In the absence of their having reason to believe that such reliance is unwarranted, the Committee\nmembers may rely without independent verification on the information provided to them and on the\nrepresentations made by the Company’s management, independent auditors and other professionals and\nexperts, including the Company’s internal audit staff or others responsible for the internal audit function.\n2. Additionally, the Committee recognizes that the Company’s management, internal audit\nstaff and independent auditors, have more time, knowledge and more detailed information concerning the\nCompany than do Committee members. Consequently, in carrying out its oversight responsibilities, the\nCommittee is not providing any expert or special assurance as to the Company’s financial statements or\nany professional certification as to the work or independence of the internal audit staff or the Company’s\nindependent auditors. In addition, auditing literature, particularly Statement of Auditing Standards No.\n100, defines the term “review” to include a particular set of required procedures to be undertaken by\nindependent auditors. The Committee members are not independent auditors, and the term “review” as\napplied to the Committee in this Charter is not intended to have that meaning and should not be interpreted\nto suggest that the Committee members can or should follow the procedures required of auditors\nperforming reviews of financial statements. Furthermore, the Committee’s authority and oversight\nresponsibility do not assure that the audits of the Company’s financial statements have been carried out\nin accordance with GAAS.\n3. The following functions and responsibilities are set forth as a guide, with the\nunderstanding that the Committee has the authority to diverge from this guide as appropriate given the\ncircumstances. The Committee, in carrying out its responsibilities, believes its policies and procedures\nshould remain flexible to best react to changing conditions and circumstances, and that the Committee\nshould take appropriate actions to set the overall corporate “tone” for quality financial reporting, sound\nbusiness risk practices and ethical behavior.\nIndependent Auditor Oversight\n1. Be directly and solely responsible for the appointment, dismissal, compensation,\nretention and oversight of the work of any independent auditor engaged by the Company (including\nresolution of disagreements between management and the auditor regarding financial reporting) for the\npurpose of preparing or issuing an audit report or performing other audit, review or attest services for the\nCompany. Discuss with the independent auditor any significant issues that the independent auditor\ndiscussed with management in connection with such appointment or retention. The independent auditor\nshall report directly to the Committee.\n2. Meet with the independent auditor prior to commencement of the audit and discuss the\nobjectives of the audit and overall audit strategy, including the timing of the audit, significant risks\nidentified by the outside auditor during its risk assessment procedures, use of the internal audit function,\nand the roles, responsibilities and location of firms participating in the audit.\n3. Approve in advance the engagement of the independent auditor for all audit services\nand non-audit services (other than the de minimis exceptions permitted by the Exchange Act) and approve\nthe fees and other terms of any such engagement. The term “non-audit services” means any\nprofessional services provided to the Company by the independent auditor, other than those provided to\nthe Company in connection with an audit or a review of the financial statements of the Company. The\nCommittee may establish pre-approval policies and procedures for particular services of which it is\ninformed, and may delegate pre-approval authority for non-audit services to the Chairman, subject to\nsuch limitations and conditions as the Committee may require. All actions taken by the Chairman\npursuant to a grant of pre- approval authority shall be reported to the full Committee at its next\nmeeting. Approval of non-audit services shall be disclosed to investors in periodic reports required by\nSection 13(a) of the Exchange Act.\n4. Obtain and review annually a formal written statement from the independent auditor\ndelineating all relationships between the auditor and the Company, actively engage in a dialogue with the\nindependent auditor with respect to any disclosed relationships or services that may impact the objectivity\nand independence of the auditor, and take, or recommend that the full Board take, appropriate action to\noversee the independence of the auditor. The Committee shall also approve the level of compensation of\nthe auditor and determine, annually, whether such level of services and compensation affects the auditor’s\nindependence.\n5. Evaluate annually the qualifications, performance and independence of the independent\nauditor, including a review and evaluation of the lead (or coordinating) audit partner (or other audit\npartner having primary responsibility for the audit), taking into account the opinions of management and\nthe Company’s internal audit staff. On an annual basis, obtain and review a report from the independent\nauditors describing (i) the independent auditor’s internal quality-control procedures, and (ii) any material\nissues raised by the most recent internal quality-control review, or peer review, of the firm, or by any\ninquiry or investigation by governmental or professional authorities, within the preceding five years,\nrespecting one or more independent audits carried out by such firm, and any steps taken to deal with any\nsuch issues. The Committee shall present its conclusions with respect to the independent auditor to the\nfull Board.\n6. Take any actions necessary to ensure the rotation, not less frequently than every five\nyears, of the audit partner.\n7. Establish policies for the hiring of employees or former employees of the independent\nauditor.\n8. Review with the independent auditor and the Company’s internal audit staff:\na.

Review and discuss with management and the independent auditors any material off-\nbalance sheet transactions, arrangements, obligations (including contingent obligations) and other\nrelationships of the Company with entities of which the Committee is made aware whose accounts are not\nconsolidated in the financial statements of the Company and that may have a material current or future\neffect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, capital\nresources or significant components of revenues or expenses.\n10. The independent auditor shall report promptly to the Committee all material written\ncommunications between the independent audit firm and Company management. The Committee shall\nalso review any problems with management and any other matters required to be communicated to the\nCommittee under GAAS or applicable rules of the SEC, Nasdaq, or other regulatory authorities. The\nindependent auditors shall also report on recently issued and adopted accounting standards, the\nCompany’s compliance therewith, and the effect of unusual or extraordinary transactions. The\nindependent auditors must discuss their judgments about the quality and content of the Company’s\naccounting principles with the Committee.\nInternal Audit\n1. Review the performance and effectiveness of the Company’s internal audit function\nincluding the objectives, responsibilities, compliance with International Standards for the Professional\nPractice of Internal Auditing, and qualifications of the Company’s internal audit staff.

If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors,\nthe record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of the stockholders\nshall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is\nwaived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held.

The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment,\norder, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create\na presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably\nbelieved to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal\naction or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that such person’s conduct was unlawful.\n8.2.

Authorization of Indemnification. Any indemnification under this Article 8 (unless ordered\nby a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination\nthat indemnification of the present or former director or officer is proper in the circumstances because such\nperson has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 8.1 or Section 8.2 of this Article 8,\nas the case may be. Such determination shall be made, with respect to a person who is a director or officer\nat the time of such determination, (i) by a majority vote of the directors who are not parties to such action,\nsuit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum, or (ii) by a committee of such directors designated by\na majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum, or (iii) if there are no such directors, or\nif such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion or (iv) by the stockholders.\nSuch determination shall be made, with respect to former directors and officers, by any person or persons\nhaving the authority to act on the matter on behalf of the Corporation.

The provisions of this Section 8.4 shall not\nbe deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the circumstances in which a person may be deemed to\nhave met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 8.1 or Section 8.2 of this Article 8, as the\ncase may be.\n8.5. Indemnification by a Court. Notwithstanding any contrary determination in the specific\ncase under Section 8.3 of this Article 8, and notwithstanding the absence of any determination thereunder,\nany director or officer may apply to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or any other court of\ncompetent jurisdiction in the State of Delaware for indemnification to the extent otherwise permissible\nunder Section 8.1 or Section 8.2 of this Article 8.

Neither a contrary determination in the specific case under Section 8.3\nof this Article 8 nor the absence of any determination thereunder shall be a defense to such application or\ncreate a presumption that the director or officer seeking indemnification has not met any applicable standard\nof conduct. Notice of any application for indemnification pursuant to this Section 8.5 shall be given to the\nCorporation promptly upon the filing of such application. If successful, in whole or in part, the director or\nofficer seeking indemnification shall also be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such application.\n8.6. Expenses Payable in Advance.

Such expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by former\ndirectors and officers or other employees and agents may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any,\nas the Corporation deems appropriate.\n8.7.

          "content": "FARMER BROS. CO.\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE GUIDELINES\nThe Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Farmer Bros. Co., a Delaware corporation (the\n“Company”), has adopted these Corporate Governance Guidelines (these “Guidelines”) to promote the\nfunctioning of the Board and its committees and to set forth a common set of expectations as to how the\nBoard should perform its functions. These Guidelines are intended to serve as a flexible framework within\nwhich the Board may conduct its business and not as a set of legally binding obligations. These Guidelines\nshould be interpreted in the context of all applicable laws, and in accordance with the Company’s Amended\nand Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (“Certificate of Incorporation”), Amended and\nRestated Bylaws, as amended (“Bylaws”), and other corporate governance documents.\n1. Basic Responsibilities of Directors and the Board\nManagement is responsible for the day-to-day business operations of the Company. The Board is\nelected by the stockholders to provide oversight and strategic guidance to senior management. The basic\nresponsibility of the directors is to exercise their business judgment and to act in good faith in a manner\nthat they believe to be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders and with such care, including\nreasonable inquiry, as an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances.\nDirectors must fulfill their responsibilities consistent with their fiduciary duties to stockholders and in\ncompliance with all applicable laws and regulations. In discharging these obligations, directors should be\nentitled to rely on the honesty and integrity of the Company’s officers, employees, advisors and independent\nauditors. The directors shall be entitled to have the Company purchase reasonable directors’ and officers’\nliability insurance on their behalf, and shall receive the benefits of indemnification and exculpation to the\nfullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation, the Company’s\nBylaws, and any indemnification agreements, as applicable, adopted and amended from time to time by the\nBoard.\nDirectors are expected to prepare for, attend and participate actively in all regularly scheduled\nBoard meetings and meetings of Board committees on which they serve and to meet as frequently as needed\nto discharge their responsibilities properly.\nIn addition to its general oversight of management, the Board also performs a number of specific\nfunctions, including:\n• Reviewing, approving and monitoring fundamental financial and business strategies and major\ncorporate actions;\n• Assessing major risks facing the Company and reviewing options for their mitigation; and\n• Ensuring processes are in place for maintaining the integrity of the Company, its financial\nstatements, its compliance with law and ethics, its relationships with employees, its\nrelationships with customers and suppliers, and its relationships with investors and\nstockholders.\n2. Board Composition\na. Board Size. The Board believes five to nine members is an appropriate size based on the\nCompany’s present circumstances. The Board periodically evaluates whether a different\nnumber or range would better serve the Company’s goals and needs, including the goals\nreflected in these Guidelines. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is\nresponsible for evaluating and recommending to the Board any changes regarding the\ncomposition, size, structure and practices of the Board and its committees.\nb. Board Leadership. The Board may, in its discretion, choose a Chairman of the Board of\nDirectors, who must also be a director. At each meeting of the Board of Directors, the\nChairman of the Board of Directors or, in his or her absence, a director chosen by the\nmajority of the directors present, shall act as chairman.\nc. Duration of Board Term. Under the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws,\nthe directors of the Corporation shall be elected annually at the annual meeting of\nstockholders (each annual meeting of stockholders, an “Annual Meeting”) and shall hold\noffice until the next Annual Meeting and until his or her successor shall be elected and\nqualified, or his or her death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal from\noffice. In no event shall a decrease in the number of directors remove or shorten the term\nof any incumbent director.\nd. Selection of Board Members. Board members are elected by the Company’s stockholders\nannually, except for Board action to fill vacancies in existing or new director positions.\nThe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for recommending\nto the Board criteria for membership on the Board (including criteria for consideration of\ncandidates recommended by the Company’s stockholders); identifying qualified\nindividuals for Board membership; recommending to the Board nominees to stand for\nelection at the annual meeting of stockholders, including consideration of\nrecommendations from stockholders pursuant to these Guidelines; and recommending to\nthe Board director nominees to fill vacancies on the Board as they arise. In making its\nrecommendations to the Board, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee\nconsiders, among other things, the qualifications of individual director candidates in light\nof the criteria described below. For purposes of identifying nominees for the Board, the\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee may rely on professional and personal\ncontacts of the Board and senior management. If necessary, the Nominating and Corporate\nGovernance Committee may explore alternative sources for identifying nominees,\nincluding engaging, as appropriate, a third-party search firm to assist in identifying\nqualified candidates. The process may also include interviews and additional background\nand reference checks for non-incumbent nominees, at the discretion of the Nominating and\nCorporate Governance Committee.\nThe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider recommendations\nfor director nominees from Company stockholders. Biographical information and contact\ninformation for proposed nominees should be sent to Farmer Bros. Co., 1912 Farmer\nBrothers Drive, Northlake, Texas 76262, Attention: Secretary. The Nominating and\nCorporate Governance Committee will evaluate candidates proposed by stockholders in\nlight of the criteria described below.\ne. Qualifications. The Board seeks to be composed of individuals who have the highest\npersonal and professional integrity, who have demonstrated exceptional ability and\njudgment and who are effective, in connection with the other members of the Board, in\nproviding the diversity of skills, expertise and perspectives appropriate for the business and\noperations of the Company and serving the long-term interests of the Company’s\nstockholders. All nominees should contribute substantially to the Board’s oversight\nresponsibilities and reflect the needs of the Company’s business.\nIn evaluating director candidates, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee\nand the Board may also consider the following criteria as well as any other factor that they\ndeem to be relevant:\n• The candidate’s experience in corporate management, such as serving as an officer or\nformer officer of a publicly held company;\n• The candidate’s experience as a board member of another publicly held company;\n• The candidate’s professional and academic experience relevant to the Company’s\nindustry;\n• The strength of the candidate’s leadership skills;\n• The candidate’s senior level experience in food manufacturing and distribution, with\nan emphasis on direct-store-delivery experience and expertise;\n• The candidate’s experience in finance and accounting and/or executive compensation\npractices; and\n• Whether the candidate has the time required for preparation, participation and\nattendance at Board meetings and committee meetings, if applicable.\nIn addition, the Board will consider whether there are potential conflicts of interest with\nthe candidate’s other personal and professional pursuits and relationships.\nThe Board should monitor the mix of specific experience, qualifications and skills of its\ndirectors in order to ensure that the Board, as a whole, has the necessary tools to perform\nits oversight function effectively in light of the Company’s business and structure.\nf. Independence. The Board will be comprised of a majority of independent directors, and all\nmembers of each Board committee shall be independent directors. For a director to qualify\nas “independent,” the Board must affirmatively determine that the director has no\nrelationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out\nthe responsibilities of a director, and the director otherwise satisfies the standards of\n“independence” established by applicable rules and regulations, including Nasdaq listing\nrequirements and federal securities laws. The Board will review each director’s\nindependence annually, and the Company will disclose the Board’s determinations in the\nCompany’s annual proxy statement.\nTo qualify as independent for purposes of serving on Board committees:\n• three or more directors must meet the standards of independence required for service\non the Audit Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee\nunder applicable law, regulations and the Nasdaq listing requirements; and\n• three or more directors must (i) meet the standards of independence for service on the\nCompensation Committee under applicable law, regulations and the Nasdaq listing\nrequirements, and (ii) be “non-employee directors” for purposes of Rule 16b-3 under\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\nIf a director becomes aware of a change in circumstances which the director believes may\naffect his or her independent status with respect to general Board service or service on a\nparticular committee, he or she should promptly advise the Nominating and Corporate\nGovernance Committee which is responsible for monitoring the independence of Board\nmembers.\ng. Term Limits. The Board does not believe it should limit the number of terms for which an\nindividual may serve as a director. Directors who have served on the Board for an extended\nperiod of time are able to provide valuable insight into the operations and future of the\nCompany based on their experience with and understanding of the Company’s history,\npolicies and objectives.\nh. Other Boards and Committees. Directors must be willing to devote sufficient time to\ncarrying out their duties and responsibilities effectively. Directors are expected to advise\nthe Chairman of the Board and the Chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance\nCommittee prior to accepting any other public or private company directorship or any\nassignment to the audit committee or compensation committee of the board of directors of\nany such company of which such director is a member. Directors are also expected to report\nmaterial changes in their business or professional affiliations or responsibilities, including\nany promotion or retirement, to the Chairman of the Board and the Chair of the Nominating\nand Corporate Governance Committee. Non-employee directors should not serve on more\nthan four other public company boards, and any director who is employed as an executive\nofficer of a public company shall not serve as a director of more than two public companies\n(including serving as a director of the Company) without prior approval of the Board. The\nBoard expects individual directors to use their judgment in accepting directorships of other\ncorporations or charitable organizations and to allow sufficient time and attention to\nCompany matters. Service on boards and/or committees of other organizations should be\nconsistent with the Company’s conflict of interest policies.\ni. Leadership Structure. Due principally to the limited size of the Board, the Board has not\nformally designated a lead independent director. Although the roles of Chairman and Chief\nExecutive Officer are currently separate, the Company has no bylaw or policy in place that\nmandates this leadership structure. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee\nwill evaluate and recommend to the Board any changes in the Board’s leadership structure.\n3. Board Compensation\nThe Compensation Committee is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations to the\nBoard with respect to the compensation of directors. The compensation should fairly pay directors for work\nrequired in a company of the Company’s size and scope; compensation should align directors’ interests\nwith the long-term interests of stockholders; and the structure of the compensation should be clearly\ndisclosed to stockholders. In view of their significant added responsibilities, members of Board committees\nand committee chairs may receive reasonable compensation for their added responsibilities, which may be\ngreater in amount than that paid to other directors. Changes in Board compensation, if any, should come at\nthe recommendation of the Compensation Committee and be approved by the Board. Board members who\nare also employees of the Company shall not be separately compensated for their service on the Board.\n4. Board Meetings: Attendance at Annual Meeting\na. Frequency. The Board will generally hold four regularly scheduled meetings per year and\nwill hold additional special meetings as necessary. In appropriate circumstances, the Board\nmay also act by written consent, as permitted by the Company’s Bylaws.\nb. Director Attendance. Each director is expected to attend all regular meetings of the Board\nand of the committees of which he or she is a member, and is expected to make every effort\nto attend any specially called Board or committee meetings. In addition, all directors up for\nre-election are expected to attend the Annual Meeting absent a valid reason.\nc. Agenda. In preparing the agenda for each meeting, the Chairman of the Board may solicit\nand collect possible agenda items from other members of the Board and the Chief\nExecutive Officer. Each Board committee and each individual director is encouraged to\nsuggest items for inclusion on the agenda. An agenda will be distributed in advance of each\nmeeting to each director. The Board reserves authority to meet in executive sessions to\ndiscuss sensitive matters without distribution of written materials.\nd. Advance Distribution of Materials. All information relevant to the Board’s understanding\nof matters to be discussed at an upcoming Board meeting should be distributed in writing\nor electronically to all members in advance, whenever feasible and appropriate. Each\ndirector is expected to review this information in advance of the meeting to facilitate the\nefficient use of meeting time. In preparing this information, management should ensure\nthat the materials distributed are as concise as possible, yet give directors sufficient\ninformation to make informed decisions. The Board recognizes that certain items to be\ndiscussed at Board meetings are of an extremely sensitive nature and that the distribution\nof materials on such matters prior to Board meetings may not be appropriate. Directors\nshall preserve the confidentiality of all confidential material given or presented to the\nBoard.\ne. Executive Sessions of Independent Directors. It is the policy of the Board that the\nindependent directors have regularly scheduled meetings (at which only independent\ndirectors are present) at least four times per year, before or after regularly scheduled Board\nmeetings, to discuss such matters as the independent directors consider appropriate.\n5. Access to Employees and Advisors\nThe Board should have access to Company employees to ensure that directors can ask all questions\nand obtain all information necessary to fulfill their duties. The Board may specify a protocol for making\nsuch inquiries, but generally the CEO will be advised in advance of such inquiries. Management is\nencouraged to invite Company personnel to any Board meeting at which their presence and expertise would\nhelp the Board have a full understanding of matters being considered.\nThe Board as a whole and its committees may retain, at the Company’s expense, independent legal,\nfinancial or other advisors that they deem necessary or appropriate to fulfill their respective responsibilities.\nSuch advisors shall report directly to the Board or the relevant committee, as applicable.\nThe Audit Committee is directly and solely responsible for the appointment, dismissal,\ncompensation, retention and oversight of the work of any independent auditor engaged by the Company\n(including resolution of disagreements between management and the auditor regarding financial reporting)\nfor the purpose of preparing or issuing an audit report or performing other audit, review or attest services\nfor the Company. The independent auditor shall report directly to the Audit Committee.\nThe Compensation Committee has sole authority to, as it deems appropriate in its sole discretion,\nselect, retain and/or replace, as needed, compensation and benefit consultants and other outside advisors to\nprovide independent advice to the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee will be\ndirectly responsible for the appointment, compensation, and oversight of the work of any such advisor. The\nCompensation Committee will review the independence of all compensation advisors before selecting or\nreceiving advice from such advisors and at least once annually thereafter, as required by applicable rules\nand regulations, including Nasdaq listing requirements and federal securities laws. The Company will\ndisclose information about the Compensation Committee’s use of a consultant in the Company’s annual\nproxy statement.\nThe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has authority to retain and terminate any\nsearch firm used to identify director candidates and approve such search firm’s fees and other retention\nterms.\n6. Committees of the Board\na. Number and Type of Committees. The Board will have at all times an Audit Committee, a\nCompensation Committee and a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee which\nmust operate in accordance with their respective charters as adopted and amended from\ntime to time by the Board, and applicable rules and regulations, including Nasdaq listing\nrequirements and federal securities laws. The Board may, from time to time, establish or\nmaintain additional committees as necessary or appropriate and delegate to such\ncommittees such authority permitted by applicable law and the Company’s Bylaws as the\nBoard sees fit.\nb. Committee Charters. Each permanent committee will have a charter that sets forth the\npurposes and responsibilities of that committee as well as provisions for committee\nmembership, procedures for committee member appointment and removal, committee\nstructure and operations, and committee reporting to the Board. The charters may also\nprovide that each committee will annually evaluate its performance. The full authority and\nresponsibilities of each committee may be fixed by the Bylaws, resolutions of the full\nBoard and the committee’s charter.\nc. Committee Member Selection. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is\nresponsible for evaluating (including with respect to satisfaction of applicable\nindependence requirements) qualifications for service on Board committees;\nrecommending to the Board candidates for membership on Board committees (including\nchair) and nominating candidates to fill vacancies on Board committees as they arise. The\nAudit, Compensation, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees shall\nconsist solely of independent directors. Members of the Audit and Compensation\nCommittees shall also meet any additional criteria for independence, financial literacy,\nexpertise and experience that the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), Nasdaq,\nand other applicable rules may require for those committees. If any director ceases to be\nindependent under the standards set forth herein while serving on any committee whose\nmembers must be independent, he or she shall promptly resign from that committee.\nd. Committee Functions. The chair of each committee, in consultation with the appropriate\nmembers of the committee and management, will develop the committee’s agenda. The\nchair, in consultation with the committee members, will determine the frequency, length\nand content of committee meetings consistent with any requirements set forth in the\ncommittee’s charter. The Company will provide each committee with access to Company\nemployees and the Company’s independent auditors, legal advisors and other resources, as\nrequired or appropriate, to enable the committee to carry out its responsibilities. The chair\nof each committee will report at Board meetings on committee actions, as appropriate.\n7. Performance Evaluation: Succession Planning\na. Assessing the Board and Committees. The Nominating and Corporate Governance\nCommittee is responsible for overseeing the annual performance evaluation process of the\nBoard and applicable Board committees (unless delegated to the respective chair of the\ncommittee). The Board (or the designated committee of the Board) shall establish\nperformance criteria for itself and may evaluate itself and individual members on an annual\nbasis. Board evaluation may include an assessment of whether the Board has the necessary\ndiversity of skills, backgrounds, experiences, and other qualifications to meet the\nCompany’s ongoing needs. Individual director evaluations may consider past attendance\nand participation at Board and committee meetings and the director’s contributions to their\nrespective activities. Each committee of the Board will also conduct an annual self-\nevaluation to determine whether it is functioning effectively.\nb. Annual CEO Evaluation. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will\ncoordinate a review at least annually of the performance of the CEO and lead the Board in\nan overall review of the CEO’s performance in an executive session of the non-employee\nBoard members. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will establish the\nevaluation process and determine the specific criteria on which the performance of the CEO\nis evaluated. The Compensation Committee will discuss the results of the Nominating and\nCorporate Governance Committee’s evaluation of the performance of the CEO in making\ndecisions regarding the CEO’s compensation consistent with the Compensation\nCommittee’s charter. The Chairman of the Board along with the Chair of the Nominating\nand Corporate Governance Committee will discuss the evaluation results with the CEO.\nc. Succession Planning. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will work\nwith the CEO to plan for CEO succession as well as to develop plans for interim succession\nfor the CEO in the event of an unexpected occurrence. The Nominating and Corporate\nGovernance Committee will also oversee succession planning for other senior\nmanagement, including consultation on an ongoing basis with the CEO and the Board to\nremain abreast of management development activities, including a review of the\nperformance and advancement potential of current and future senior management and\nsuccession plans for each.\n8. Director Orientation and Continuing Education\nThe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for making\nrecommendations to the Board regarding director orientation and continuing education of directors to assist\ndirectors in maintaining skills necessary or appropriate for the performance of their responsibilities.\n• Orientation programs are designed to familiarize new directors with the Company’s\nbusinesses, strategies, and policies and to assist new directors in developing the skills and\nknowledge required for their service.\n• Continuing education programs for Board members may include a combination of\ninternally developed materials and presentations, programs presented by third parties, and\nfinancial and administrative support for attendance at qualifying university or other\nindependent programs.\n9. Ethics and Conflicts of Interest\nThe Board expects Company directors, officers and employees to act ethically at all times and to\nacknowledge their adherence to the policies comprising the Company’s Code of Conduct and Ethics. In the\nabsence of exceptional circumstances, the Board will not permit any waiver of any ethics policy for any\ndirector or executive officer.\nDirectors should not enter into, without the prior approval of the disinterested members of the\nBoard, any transaction or relationship with the Company in which they will have a financial or personal\ninterest (either directly or indirectly, such as through a family member or other person or organization with\nwhich they are associated), or any transaction or situation which otherwise involves a conflict of interest.\nIf any actual or potential conflict of interest arises for a director, or a situation arises giving the appearance\nof an actual or potential conflict, the director shall promptly inform the Chairman of the Board or the Chair\nof the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. If a significant ongoing long-term conflict exists\nand cannot be resolved, the director should offer to resign. All directors will recuse themselves from any\ndiscussion or decision affecting their personal, business or professional interests. The Nominating and\nCorporate Governance Committee will consider questions of possible conflicts of interest between Board\nmembers or senior management and the Company and its subsidiaries, and monitor all other activities of\nBoard members or senior management that could interfere with such individuals’ duties to the Company.\nThe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will be responsible for resolving or addressing any\nconflict of interest question involving the CEO or any other Board-elected officer, and the CEO or his\ndesignee, including the Chief Compliance Officer, will be responsible for resolving or addressing any\nconflict of interest issue involving any other employee of the Company.\n10. Financial Reporting. Legal Compliance and Ethical Conduct\nThe Board’s governance and oversight functions do not relieve the Company’s senior management\nof its primary responsibility for preparing financial statements that accurately and fairly represent the\nCompany’s financial results and condition. The Company’s senior management shall maintain systems,\nprocedures, controls and a corporate culture that promote the accuracy of the Company’s financial reports\nand compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and the ethical conduct of the Company’s business.\n11. Reporting of Concerns to Non-Employee Directors or Committees\nAnyone who has a concern about the conduct of the Company or any of its officers or employees,\nor about the Company’s accounting practices, internal or disclosure controls and procedures, audit or\ncompensation processes and/or governance matters may communicate that concern directly to the Audit\nCommittee or the Company’s Chief Compliance Officer, as appropriate, in light of the specific concern\ninvolved. Communications of this type may be confidential or anonymous, and may be communicated in\nthe manner set forth in the Company’s Code of Conduct and Ethics from time to time. Concerns relating to\naccounting, internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, auditing matters, fraud or deceptive\nfinancial practices shall be forwarded to the Chair of the Audit Committee in the manner set forth in the\nCompany’s Code of Conduct and Ethics from time to time. The Company’s policies prohibit retaliation or\nadverse action against anyone for raising or helping to resolve an integrity concern.\n12. Related Person Transactions\nThe Board recognizes that transactions involving the Company and related parties present\nheightened risk of potential or actual conflicts of interest which may interfere, or appear to interfere, with\nthe interests of the Company. As a result, the Audit Committee, or such other committee as may be\ndesignated by the Board, shall review, approve, ratify, or disapprove any transaction with related persons\nrequired to be reported by the Company under applicable rules and regulations governing related person\ntransactions promulgated by the SEC.\n13. Stockholder Ratification of Independent Auditors\nAlthough the Board acknowledges that current law, rules and regulations, as well as the Charter of\nthe Board’s Audit Committee, require the Company’s independent auditors to be engaged, retained and\nsupervised by the Audit Committee, the Board considers the selection of independent auditors to be an\nimportant matter of stockholder concern and considers a proposal for stockholders to ratify such selection\nto be an important opportunity for stockholders to provide direct feedback to the Board on an important\nissue of corporate governance. Consequently, the Board will present such a proposal to the stockholders in\nthe Company’s annual proxy statement.\n14. Communication with the Board\nThe Company’s annual meeting of stockholders provides an opportunity each year for stockholders\nto ask questions of or otherwise communicate directly with members of the Board on appropriate matters.\nStockholders may communicate in writing with any particular director, any committee of the Board or the\ndirectors as a group, by sending such written communication to the Secretary of the Company at the\nCompany’s principal executive office, 1912 Farmer Brothers Drive, Northlake, Texas 76262. The envelope\nmust contain a clear notation indicating that the enclosed letter is a “Stockholder-Board Communication”\nor “Stockholder-Director Communication.” All such letters must identify the author as a stockholder of the\nCompany and clearly state whether the intended recipient is a particular director, a committee of the Board,\nor the directors as a group.\nCopies of written communications received at such address will be collected, organized and\nreviewed regularly by the Secretary and provided to the Board or the relevant director unless such\ncommunications are considered, in the reasonable judgment of the Secretary, to be inappropriate for\nsubmission to the intended recipient(s). Examples of stockholder communications that would be considered\ninappropriate for submission to the Board include, without limitation, customer complaints, solicitations,\ncommunications that do not relate directly or indirectly to the Company’s business, or communications that\nrelate to improper or irrelevant topics.\nThe Secretary or his or her designee may analyze and prepare a response to the information\ncontained in communications received and may deliver a copy of the communication to other Company\nemployees or agents who are responsible for analyzing or responding to complaints or requests.\nCommunications concerning possible director nominees submitted by any of the Company’s stockholders\nwill be forwarded to the members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.\nThe foregoing stockholder communications policy will be disclosed in the Company’s proxy\nstatements filed from time to time with the SEC.\n15. Board Interaction with Institutional Investors, the Media, Customers, and Suppliers.\nThe Board believes that management speaks for the Company. Individual Board members may,\nfrom time to time, meet or otherwise communicate with various constituencies that are involved with the\nCompany, but it is expected that Board members would do this with the knowledge of the CEO.\n16. Corporate Governance Guidelines\nThe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will review and reassess these Guidelines\nperiodically and recommend changes, as necessary, to the Board for its approval. The Board may amend,\nwaive, suspend or repeal any of these Guidelines at any time, with or without public notice, as it determines\nnecessary or appropriate, in the exercise of the Board’s judgment or fiduciary duties.\nThese Guidelines will be posted on the Company’s website for communication to the Company’s\nstockholders.\nLast updated February 1, 2023."

The term “employees” as\nused in this Code includes contractors.\nIt is the Company’s intention that this Code be its “code of conduct” within the meaning of the National\nAssociation of Securities Dealers Rule 5610, and its written “code of ethics” under Section 406 of the Sarbanes-\nOxley Act of 2002 in compliance with the standards set forth in Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)\nRegulation S-K, Item 406.\nThis Code is intended to be a “program that has been reasonably designed, implemented, and enforced so\nthat it generally will be effective in preventing and detecting criminal conduct” as designated by the Federal\nSentencing Guidelines for Organizations (“Sentencing Guidelines”). This Code includes the following Sentencing\nGuidelines elements:\n• Compliance standards of conduct and procedures to be followed by Farmer Bros. employees,\nofficers and directors in order to reduce the prospect of criminal conduct;\n• Assignment of overall responsibility to oversee compliance to individuals with high-level\nresponsibility in the organization;\n• Policies and procedures designed to prevent the delegation of substantial discretionary authority\nto individuals who have a propensity to engage in illegal activities;\n• Procedures for effectively communicating policies and procedures broadly to Farmer Bros.\nemployees, officers and directors through publication and dissemination of this Code, and through\nrequired participation in training programs;\n• Systems designed to detect criminal conduct by Farmer Bros. employees, officers and directors,\nincluding reporting systems through which employees and others can report criminal conduct\nwithin the organization without fear of retribution;\n• Appropriate disciplinary mechanisms; and\n• Procedures to ensure an appropriate and timely response to detected violations and procedures to\nprevent further offenses, including modification of this Code, when necessary.\n2. Policy Overview\nFarmer Bros.’ business must be conducted in accordance with applicable laws of the United States and\nother jurisdictions in which Farmer Bros. operates and in accordance with the highest ethical standards of\nbusiness conduct. Farmer Bros. employees, officers and directors are required and expected to engage in and\npromote honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest\nbetween personal and professional relationships. All employees, officers and directors shall adhere strictly to this\npolicy, without exception.\nWhile it is the Company’s explicit policy to comply with all relevant federal, state and local statutes,\nrules, regulations and applicable listing requirements, our commitment to ethical conduct in the affairs of our\nbusiness goes far beyond the prohibitions of any particular statute, rule, regulation or listing requirement. It is\nFarmer Bros.’ longstanding policy to prevent and detect unethical and unlawful behavior, to stop such behavior as\nsoon as reasonably possible, and to discipline personnel involved in impermissible behavior.\nThis Code cannot describe every practice or convey every standard which relates to Farmer Bros.’\ncommitment to personal and professional, business, ethical and legal standards. Employees, officers and directors\nfacing situations not specifically addressed in this Code should apply the overall philosophy and concepts set\nforth in this Code, along with their own good judgment and high ethical standards. It is the responsibility of each\nemployee, officer and director to comply with the laws, rules and regulations applicable to the Company and/or to\nhim or her personally. Each employee, officer and director is responsible for seeking guidance and advice, when\nneeded, and reporting violations of applicable laws, rules and regulations, as well as this Code and other Company\npolicies. No employee, officer or director may delegate these responsibilities to another person or to the Company.\nIf employees have any doubts or questions, before taking any action, they should seek advice from their\nsupervisor or the Company’s Chief Compliance Officer who will consult with the Company’s legal counsel as\nnecessary. We encourage you to voice your concerns and raise any questions which you may have related to this\npolicy free from any fear of retaliation.\n3. Compliance Monitoring\nFarmer Bros. appoints a member of senior management to act as Chief Compliance Officer. The Chief\nCompliance Officer is responsible for overseeing this Code and monitoring compliance with this Code. The Chief\nCompliance Officer is responsible for coordinating the annual review and modification, if necessary, of this Code.\nThe Chief Compliance Officer reports to Farmer Bros.’ Chief Executive Officer. The Chief Compliance Officer\nensures that the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee are knowledgeable about the purpose and content of\nthis Code. The Chief Compliance Officer will furnish the Audit Committee with regular reports regarding the\nimplementation of this Code. The Chief Compliance Officer also will provide a report, at least annually, to the\nBoard of Directors regarding the operation of this Code. The Chief Compliance Officer also will have direct\naccess to Farmer Bros.’ Chief Executive Officer and other senior management, Audit Committee and Board of\nDirectors when he or she determines, with reasonable discretion, that such direct reporting is required to address\nspecific issues or matters. The Chief Compliance Officer may delegate certain compliance duties to other Farmer\nBros. personnel. All compliance activities must be coordinated by and through the Chief Compliance Officer.\nThe designation of a Chief Compliance Officer in no way diminishes the responsibility of employees,\nofficers and directors to comply with this Code, nor does it diminish the responsibility of executive officers,\nmanagers and supervisors to ensure that the employees for whom he or she is responsible comply with this Code.\n4. Specific Obligations\na. General Business Ethics\nFarmer Bros. employees, officers and directors are required and expected to deal honestly,\ntruthfully and fairly with others in business. False or intentionally misleading statements or omissions of any kind\nshould never be made. Farmer Bros. will not tolerate any types of deceitful practices.\nb. Confidential Information\nConfidential information, either of Farmer Bros. or any other company, must be maintained\n(unless disclosure is authorized or legally mandated) and must never be misused. Confidential information should\nbe used only for legitimate business purposes and the dissemination of confidential information (both inside and\noutside the Company) should be limited to those who have a need to know the information for business purposes.\nConfidential information includes all non-public information that comes to employees, officers and directors in\nthe course of their service to the Company.\nc. Maintenance of Company Books, Records, Documents and Accounts\nFarmer Bros. corporate and business records must be maintained completely, accurately and\nhonestly at all times. The making of false or intentionally misleading entries, whether related to financial results\nor test results, is strictly prohibited. Farmer Bros. records serve as a basis for managing our business and are vital\nin serving the needs of our customers, suppliers, employees and others with whom we do business. Company\nmoney must be accurately accounted for and may only be spent for lawful, Company-related purposes. Employees\nwhose duties involve verification of expenditures of Company money are responsible for verifying that\nexpenditures are legitimate and comply with applicable Company policies, laws, rules and regulations.\nd. Financial Integrity and Public Reporting\nFarmer Bros. records are relied upon to produce reports for our management, stockholders,\ngovernmental agencies and the general public. In particular, our accounting and other business and corporate\nrecords are relied upon for preparing periodic and current reports required by the SEC and The Nasdaq Stock\nMarket, Inc. (“Nasdaq”) where our common stock is traded. These reports must provide full, fair, accurate, timely\nand understandable disclosures related to the results of our operations and our financial condition.\nEmployees charged with collecting, analyzing and providing reports related to this information\nmust always strive to ensure that our financial disclosures are accurate and transparent and that our reports contain\nall of the information required by stockholders and potential investors to assess the soundness and risks of our\nbusiness and financial position. It is the responsibility of any such employee promptly to bring or cause to be\nbrought to the attention of those responsible for public disclosure at the Company any material information of\nwhich he or she may become aware that affects the disclosures made by the Company in its public filings and\nother public communications.\ne. Protection and Proper Use of Company Assets\nAll employees, officers and directors should protect the Company’s assets and ensure their\nefficient use. Theft, carelessness and waste have a direct impact on the Company’s profitability. All Company\nassets should be used for legitimate business purposes only. The use of Company funds or assets, whether or not\nfor personal gain, for any unlawful or improper purpose is strictly prohibited.\nf. Political Contributions and Activities\nFarmer Bros. assets, including employees’ work time, use of Farmer Bros. premises, use of\nFarmer Bros. equipment or the Farmer Bros. name, and of course funds and other physical assets, may not be used\nfor or contributed to any political candidate, political action committee, party or ballot measure without prior\nwritten permission of the Chief Compliance Officer. Farmer Bros. employees, officers and directors may participate\nin any political activities of their choice on an individual basis, with their own money and on their own time.\ng. Relationships With Vendors/Customers\nFarmer Bros. vendors and customers are to be treated honestly and fairly, with respect and\ndignity, at all times, without exception. No payments, gifts of more than nominal value, or any form of preferential\ntreatment may be made to obtain or retain business, or to realize a certain price for our products. No payments,\ndirect or indirect, including gifts of more than nominal value, or any form of preferential treatment, may be\nsolicited or accepted from any vendor, customer or competitor of Farmer Bros. Money, gifts, repetitive or extensive\nentertainment and other favors which would imply or incur an obligation must not be accepted or given by\nemployees, officers, directors or members of their immediate families in connection with transactions involving\nFarmer Bros. For example, acceptance of an inappropriate gift by a member of your family from one of our suppliers\ncould create a conflict of interest and result in a violation of this Code attributable to you.\nAcceptance of a meal, refreshments or entertainment in the normal course of business relations is\npermitted and, to the extent practical, may be reciprocated consistent with other Company policies.\nFarmer Bros. will promptly terminate any employee who offers or receives a bribe or a kickback.\nSuch conduct is illegal and strictly forbidden.\nh. Conflicts of Interest\nFarmer Bros. employees, officers and directors must avoid situations that may give rise to a\nconflict of interest or the appearance of impropriety. A conflict of interest occurs when an individual’s own\ninterest (including the interest of an immediate family member or an organization with which the individual has a\nsignificant relationship) interferes or appears to interfere with the Company’s interests. Each employee, officer\nand director should carefully review his or her own situation from time to time to make sure they are, and remain,\nfree from conflicts of interest.\nAll decisions involving the Company or its business must be made solely in the best interests of\nFarmer Bros. Employees, officers and directors must not make decisions based on personal considerations which\nmight affect or appear to affect their judgment. Accordingly, they must not have, or appear to have, any direct or\nindirect personal interest, financial or otherwise, in any of Farmer Bros.’ competitors, suppliers or customers that\nwould interfere with the Company’s interests. They may not buy or sell, directly or indirectly, any property, goods\nor services from or to Farmer Bros. for their own benefit or for the benefit of their families or organizations with\nwhich they have a significant relationship. Employees, officers and directors must not accept from others, directly\nor indirectly, any form of compensation for work or services relating to their responsibilities to the Company. The\nownership, as an investor, of the securities of publicly held corporations normally would not be considered to be a\nconflict of interest, provided that such ownership constitutes less than 1% of the public company’s outstanding\nshares.\nAny employee with a question about whether a particular situation constitutes a conflict of\ninterest should discuss it with his or her supervisor or the Chief Compliance Officer. Employees should disclose\nactual or potential conflicts of interest to their supervisors.\nMany conflicts of interest or potential conflicts of interest may be resolved or avoided if they are\nappropriately disclosed and approved. In some instances, disclosure may not be sufficient and the Company may\nrequire that the conduct in question be stopped or that actions taken be reversed where possible.\nThe following are examples of situations which, depending on the facts and circumstances, might\ninvolve conflicts of interest:\n• Employment by (including consulting for) or service on the board of a competitor,\ncustomer, supplier or other service provider. Activity that enhances or supports the position\nof a competitor to the detriment of Farmer Bros. is prohibited, including employment by\nor service on the board of a competitor. Employment by or service on the board of a\ncustomer or supplier or other service provider is generally discouraged and you must\nseek authorization from the Chief Compliance Officer in advance if you plan to take such\naction.\n• Owning, directly or indirectly, a significant financial interest in any entity that does\nbusiness, seeks to do business or competes with us. In addition to the factors described\nabove, persons evaluating ownership for conflicts of interest will consider the size and\nnature of the investment; the nature of the relationship between the other entity and\nFarmer Bros.; the employee’s access to confidential information and the employee’s\nability to influence Farmer Bros.’ decisions. If you would like to acquire a financial\ninterest of that kind, you must seek approval of the Chief Compliance Officer in advance.\n• Soliciting or accepting gifts, favors, loans or preferential treatment from any person or\nentity that does business or seeks to do business with us.\n• Soliciting contributions to any charity or for any political candidate from any person or\nentity that does business or seeks to do business with us.\n• Taking personal advantage of corporate opportunities or confidential Company business\ninformation.\n• Conducting our business transactions with your family member, significant other or\nperson who shares your household or a business in which you have a significant financial\ninterest.\n• Exercising supervisory or other authority on behalf of Farmer Bros. over a co-worker\nwho is also a family member. The employee’s supervisor and/or the Chief Compliance\nOfficer will consult with the Human Resources department to assess the advisability of\nreassignment.\n• Loans to, or guarantees of obligations of, employees or their family members by Farmer\nBros. could constitute an improper personal benefit to the recipients of such loans or\nguarantees, depending on the facts and circumstances. Some loans are expressly\nprohibited by law and others may require approval by the Board of Directors or one of its\ncommittees.\ni. Related Person Transactions\nAs a general rule, you should avoid conducting Company business with a Family Member or\nsignificant other, or with a business in which a Family Member or significant other has any substantial role.\nFor purposes of this Section 4(i), “Family Member” shall have the definition set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule\n5605(a)(2) “a person's spouse, parents, children and siblings, whether by blood, marriage or adoption, or anyone\nresiding in such person's home.”\nIf such a related person transaction is unavoidable, before entering into such transaction, you\nmust fully disclose the nature of the proposed related person transaction and any plan or proposal to engage in or\ncontinue any transaction that could be a related person transaction (or, to the extent known to you any transaction\nin which any Family Member is involved), whether or not you believe that your interest in the transaction is material,\nto the Company’s Chief Compliance Officer, including the following information:\n• The related person’s name and relationship to you and the Company and, if more than\none related person, to each other;\n• The related person’s interest in the transaction with the Company, including his or her\nposition or relationship with, or ownership in, a firm, corporation or other entity that is a\nparty to or has an interest in the transaction; and\n• The approximate dollar value of the amount involved in the transaction and of the related\nperson’s interest in the transaction.\nDirectors and executive officers must fully disclose the above information to the Chief\nCompliance Officer with respect to any related person transaction of which they have knowledge, whether or not\nthe director or executive officer is a party to the transaction.\nUpon receipt of such information, the Chief Compliance Officer, in consultation with outside\ncounsel, will determine whether the transaction or relationship constitutes a related person transaction that must\nbe referred to the Audit Committee for review, approval or ratification. All related person transactions referred to\nthe Audit Committee must be reviewed and approved in writing in advance. Additionally, all related person\ntransactions approved by the Audit Committee will be disclosed to the extent required under applicable accounting\nrules, federal securities laws, SEC rules and regulations, and securities market rules.\nj. Corporate Opportunities\nAll employees, officers and directors are prohibited from taking for themselves personally\nopportunities that are discovered through the use of corporate property, information or position, using corporate\nproperty, information or position for personal gain, and competing with the Company. All employees, officers\nand directors owe a duty to the Company to advance its legitimate interests when the opportunity to do so arises.\nk. Insider Trading\nThe law prohibits insider trading – that is, buying or selling a company’s stock at a time when an\nindividual has “Material Nonpublic Information” about that company. Material Nonpublic Information is\ninformation that is not generally known or available to the public that would affect the market price of the stock\nor that a reasonable investor would consider important in making an investment decision to buy, hold or sell\nstock. An easy way to determine if you have Material Nonpublic Information is if the information makes you\nwant to buy or sell, it is likely to have the same effect on others.\nFarmer Bros. employees, officers and directors who have access to Material Nonpublic\nInformation may not profit financially by buying, selling or in any other way dealing in Farmer Bros. stock or the\nstock of another publicly traded company about which the person has obtained Material Nonpublic Information.\nThis prohibition includes benefitting financially or in any other way by passing on Material Nonpublic\nInformation to any other person. This practice, known as “tipping,” also violates the law and can result in the\nsame penalties that apply if an individual engages in insider trading directly, even if the individual does not\nreceive any money or derive any benefit from the trades.\nIf you possess Material Nonpublic Information, you must refrain from trading the stock of the\ncompany concerned, from advising anyone else to do so or from communicating the Material Nonpublic\nInformation to anyone else until you know that it has been disseminated to the public by authorized means.\nMore detailed information regarding the prohibition on insider trading is contained in the\nCompany’s Insider Trading Policy.\nl. Company Proprietary Information and Trade Secrets\nProprietary information includes data developed or assembled on Company time or at Company\nexpense, that is unique in the sense that the end result is not readily available generally without a like expenditure\nof time and money, even though the basic data is known or observable. Trade secrets include all data unique to\nFarmer Bros. and discoverable only by employees in certain positions in Farmer Bros. Information in these\ncategories is the property of Farmer Bros., and any misapplication or misappropriation of that property may\nprompt legal action by Farmer Bros.\nNo one should share proprietary information or trade secrets of Farmer Bros. with anyone outside\nFarmer Bros., or anyone within Farmer Bros. not authorized to receive that information. Nor should anyone solicit\nor accept from anyone outside Farmer Bros. any proprietary information or trade secrets of another company.\nFarmer Bros. has no interest either in receiving or using any proprietary information or trade secrets of other\ncompanies, because to do so would be unethical and improper.\nFurther, no one should make any use of materials protected by copyrights, trademarks or patents\nwithout first bringing the matter to the attention of the Chief Compliance Officer.\nm. Antitrust\nFarmer Bros. has always been, and remains, an ardent supporter of free and fair competition.\nFarmer Bros. forbids any conduct that would unfairly and unlawfully diminish competition in the marketplace.\nThe antitrust laws protect and promote free and fair competition among businesses. Examples of the types of\nconduct which are prohibited under the antitrust laws, and are therefore particularly unacceptable to Farmer Bros.,\ninclude, but are not limited to:\n• Any agreements among competitors about price, or allocation of markets, territories or\ncustomers;\n• Any agreements with customers not to deal with a competitor;\n• Restrictions on resale; or\n• Sales conditioned on agreements to purchase other products.\nn. Environmental, Health and Safety Laws and Regulations\nEnvironmental, health and safety laws and regulations are very complex and extremely important.\nFarmer Bros. has its own written operating procedures that govern our commitment to comply with all applicable\nenvironmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Compliance with these regulations is essential. In addition,\nit is essential that any reports or representations made by or on behalf of Farmer Bros. to any environmental,\nhealth or safety regulatory body is completely accurate and correct, containing no false statements or material\nomissions.\no. International Business\nFarmer Bros. will observe the highest ethical standards in all business transactions, including\nthose involving foreign countries. Farmer Bros. should not conduct business in any foreign country in a way that\nwould be illegal or improper in the United States.\nBoth the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign\nPublic Officials in International Business Transactions (also known as OECD Anti-Bribery Convention) prohibit the\nbribing of any foreign government official. Payments made to any foreign agent must be lawful and required under\nthe laws of the foreign country. Payments by or on behalf of Farmer Bros. to foreign agents should always be strictly\nfor services rendered and should be reasonable in amount given the nature of those services.\nGovernments sometimes seek to advance their own political agendas by pressuring companies\nwith whom they do business to boycott the companies or products of certain other countries. It is unlawful for\nany United States citizen or company to comply with, further or support a boycott against a country which is not\nitself the object of any form of boycott pursuant to United States law or regulation. The Company refuses to\nparticipate in furthering any form of illegal boycott.\nFarmer Bros. will be accurate and truthful in representing international business transactions to\ngovernment agencies. All information furnished to any customs official or to any agent which Farmer Bros. may\nhave hired to facilitate imports and exports must be accurate and truthful. If you conduct business internationally\non behalf of Farmer Bros., please make sure you have a thorough understanding of these laws.\np. Media and Public Discussions\nFarmer Bros. is a publicly traded company and is therefore required to make certain disclosures\nof material information concerning our business and financial operations. We make these disclosures through very\nspecific and limited channels in order to avoid inappropriate publicity and to ensure that all persons with an\ninterest in the Company have equal access to such information.\nAll inquiries or calls from financial analysts or other individuals or entities requesting financial\ninformation about Farmer Bros. should be referred to the CEO, CFO, or to the person who in the future may be\ndesignated to be in charge of investor relations for the Company. Inquiries or calls from industry or consumer\npublications requesting information about Farmer Bros. should be referred to the Communications Manager, or to the\nperson who in the future may be designated to be in charge of external communications and Public Relations. With\nthe approval of the CEO or General Counsel specific managers within the Company may be designated to speak on\ntheir area of expertise.\nq. Workplace Behavior\nThe Company is committed to providing a work environment free of discrimination and\nharassment. Farmer Bros. and its employees, officers, contractors, vendors and customers are responsible for\nmaintaining a work environment consistent with this policy. Discrimination against any group or individual on\nthe basis of race, color, national origin, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, marital status,\ncitizenship status, religion, age, physical or mental disability, ancestry or veteran status is strictly prohibited.\nLikewise, harassment of an individual in the workplace for any reason, including race, color, national origin,\ngender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, marital status, citizenship status, religion, age, physical\nor mental disability, ancestry or veteran status is prohibited. Harassing an employee off Company premises is\nalso strictly prohibited.\nFarmer Bros. will not tolerate retaliation against anyone who rejects sexual advances, makes a\nreport of harassment or provides information or assistance in the investigation of such a report.\nr. Interference With an Audit\nIt is unlawful to attempt improperly to persuade an outside auditor to approve false financial\nstatements. Farmer Bros. prohibits its employees, officers and directors, and anyone acting under their direction,\nfrom, directly or indirectly, taking any action to fraudulently influence, coerce, manipulate or mislead Farmer\nBros.’ outside auditors for the purpose of rendering the Company’s financial statements materially misleading.\ns. Preservation of Documents\nFarmer Bros. prohibits its employees, officers and directors, and anyone acting under their direction\nfrom knowingly altering, destroying, mutilating, concealing, covering up, falsifying or making a false entry in\nany records with the intent to impede, obstruct or influence an investigation in a matter within the jurisdiction\nof any federal agency or under any federal bankruptcy case.\nThe Chief Compliance Officer, with advice of outside counsel, is responsible for establishing\nprocedures to prevent the intentional or inadvertent destruction of documents that could lead to prosecution for\nobstruction of justice. If Farmer Bros. has been served with a government subpoena or has reason to believe that\nthere is an impending government investigation, it must retain all potentially responsive documents. If Farmer\nBros. is served with a subpoena or has reason to believe a subpoena may be served, the Chief Compliance Officer\nis responsible for immediately directing employees to retain all documents that may potentially respond to the\nsubpoena.\n5. Role of Supervisory Personnel\nFarmer Bros.’ executive officers, managers and supervisors are responsible for establishing a culture of\nethics and compliance throughout Farmer Bros. and for ensuring compliance with this Code. All such personnel\nare expected to set an example for all Farmer Bros. employees by always adhering to the highest ethical standards.\nSuch personnel are responsible for:\n• Providing that the employees they supervise receive copies of this Code;\n• Using their best efforts to ensure that they comply with this Code; and\n• Maintaining an organizational culture where employees feel free to raise questions and concerns.\n6. Special Responsibilities of the CEO and Senior Financial Officers\nIn addition to the other policies set forth herein, the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer,\nprincipal accounting officer or controller, and other persons performing similar functions who are designated by\neither the Board of Directors or senior management of the Company from time-to-time (collectively, the “Covered\nOfficers”) are subject to the following additional specific policies:\na.

Each Covered Officer shall promptly bring or cause to be brought to the attention of the Company’s\noutside legal counsel and to the Audit Committee any information he or she may have concerning evidence of\nany known or suspected violation of the securities or other laws, rules or regulations applicable to Farmer Bros.\nand the operation of its business, by Farmer Bros. or any agent thereof.\n7.

It is imperative, however, that even a preliminary investigation of any suspected violation\nnot be conducted without consultation with, and direction from, the Chief Compliance Officer. Investigations may\nraise complicated legal issues. Investigations conducted without the advice of Farmer Bros.’ legal counsel could\nresult in the waiver of important legal privileges.\nc. Policy Against Retaliation\nFarmer Bros. strictly prohibits retaliation against an employee who, in good faith, seeks help or\nreports known or suspected violations of this Code or the law. Reporting “in good faith” means employees will\nreport instances when they believe there has been a violation or when there is the potential or likelihood that a\nviolation will occur, and employees will not make frivolous or false reports. Anyone who retaliates against an\nemployee who in good faith reported misconduct or sought help will be subject to discipline, including possible\ntermination of employment.\n8. Disciplinary Sanctions and Waivers\na. Accountability\nAll employees, officers and directors will be held accountable for adherence to this Code.\nIndividuals who violate the policies set forth in this Code will be subject to discipline.

Co. (NASDAQ: FARM) today reported its first quarter fiscal 2025 financial results for the period ended Sept. 30, 2024. The company filed its Form 10-Q, which can be found on the [Investor Relations](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=7ZEHNYdAPARYGKNEcaXBNre13YoSH9jGKTBJRpwp44b26wNGTHgV1xA8zEUt52jyqs4bQi-hDKVzVVWIdHeLv-VVcIkSGAwQUcnPgmgcf2c=) section of the company’s website.\n\n“We are encouraged by the improvements we saw during the first quarter, particularly in terms of gross margins and adjusted EBITDA on a year-over-year basis, as well as positive trends related to sales and customer growth and retention,” said Farmer Brothers President and Chief Executive Officer John Moore. “Our focus is on driving top-line growth and sustainable profitability improvements while proactively navigating the near-term macroeconomic and commodity pricing environments. Overall, we believe this quarter’s performance provides a glimpse into the long-term potential of Farmer Brothers.”\n\n**First quarter 2025 business highlights**\n\n  * Completed additional milestones related to its SKU rationalization initiative, which is on track to be completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2025.\n  * Continued progress related to its brand pyramid initiative, including the completion of the refresh of its premiere, premium Boyd’s Coffee brand.\n  * Made marked progress related to its branch and direct store delivery (DSD) route optimization efforts.\n\n\n\n**First quarter fiscal 2025 financial results**\n\n  * Net sales increased $3.2 million, or 4%, to $85.1 million compared to $81.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\n  * Gross profit was $37.3 million, or 43.9%, compared to $30.8 million, or 37.6%, in the prior year period. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to improved pricing compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year.\n  * Operating expenses were $40.1 million or 47.2% of net sales. This was a $7.3 million increase compared to the prior year period, which saw an operating expense of $32.9 million, or 40.1% of net sales. This increase was primarily due to a $8.5 million decrease in asset sales, as there were no branch sales during the first quarter of fiscal 2025.\n  * Net loss was $5 million compared to a net loss of $1.3 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. This was primarily driven by a $1.7 million loss associated with the disposal of assets and $500,000 of non-cash stock compensation. The $1.3 million net loss for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 included a $6.8 million gain from the disposal of assets and $1.6 million of non-cash stock compensation.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA was $1.4 million, an increase of almost $2 million, compared to a loss of $452,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\n\n\n**Balance Sheet and Liquidity** As of Sept. 30, 2024, the company had $3.3 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, $1.9 million in restricted cash, $23.3 million in outstanding borrowings and $27.1 million of borrowing availability under its revolving credit facility.\n\n**Investor Conference Call** Farmer Brothers published its full first quarter fiscal 2025 financial results for the period ended Sept. 30, 2024, with the filing of its Form 10-Q, which will be available on the [Investor Relations](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=7ZEHNYdAPARYGKNEcaXBNvuClD_aQbV-2SjYPS3X_ls0BCPWlVQqELVIxIOsx47zL-O5igrB8beyIUDQXyOfRacv9EZpOmJz3SryepMA5iw=) section of the company’s website after the close of market Thursday, Nov. 7.\n\nThe company will also host an audio-only investor conference call and webcast at 5 p.m. Eastern on Thursday, Nov. 7 to provide a review of the quarter and business update.

In addition, we, or others on our behalf, may make forward-looking statements in press releases or written statements, or in our communications and discussions with investors and analysts in the normal course of business through meetings, webcasts, phone calls and conference calls. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words like “anticipates,” “estimates,” “projects,” “expects,” “plans,” “believes,” “intends,” “will,” “could,” “may,” “assumes” and other words of similar meaning. These statements are based on management’s beliefs, assumptions, estimates and observations of future events based on information available to our management at the time the statements are made and include any statements that do not relate to any historical or current fact. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and they involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed, implied or forecast by our forward-looking statements due in part to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions set forth in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 filed with the SEC on September 12, 2024, as amended by the Form 10-K/A filed on October 25, 2024 (as amended, the “2024 Form 10-K”), as well as those discussed elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and other factors described from time to time in our filings with the SEC._\n\n_Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, severe weather, levels of consumer confidence in national and local economic business conditions, developments related to pricing cycles and volumes, the impact of labor market shortages, the increase of costs due to inflation, an economic downturn caused by any pandemic, epidemic or other disease outbreak, the success of our turnaround strategy, the impact of capital improvement projects, the adequacy and availability of capital resources to fund our existing and planned business operations and our capital expenditure requirements, our ability to meet financial covenant requirements in our credit facility, which could impact, among other things, our liquidity, the relative effectiveness of compensation-based employee incentives in causing improvements in our performance, the capacity to meet the demands of our customers, the extent of execution of plans for the growth of our business and achievement of financial metrics related to those plans, our success in retaining and/or attracting qualified employees, our success in adapting to technology and new commerce channels, the effect of the capital markets, as well as other external factors on stockholder value, fluctuations in availability and cost of green coffee, competition, organizational changes, the effectiveness of our hedging strategies in reducing price, changes in consumer preferences, our ability to provide sustainability in ways that do not materially impair profitability, changes in the strength of the economy, including any effects from inflation, business conditions in the coffee industry and food industry in general, our continued success in attracting new customers, variances from budgeted sales mix and growth rates, weather and special or unusual events, as well as other risks, uncertainties and assumptions described in the 2024 Form 10-K and other factors described from time to time in our filings with the SEC._\n\n_Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Any or all of the forward-looking statements contained in this press release and any other public statement made by us, including by our management, may turn out to be incorrect. We are including this cautionary note to make applicable and take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 for forward-looking statements.

For purposes of calculating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, beginning with the period ended June 30, 2024, and any period thereafter, we are also excluding the impact of the loss related to sale of business, as this item is not reflective of our ongoing operating results.\n\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide a useful measure of the Company’s operating results, a meaningful comparison with historical results and with the results of other companies, and insight into the Company’s ongoing operating performance. Further, management utilizes these measures, in addition to GAAP measures, when evaluating and comparing the Company’s operating performance against internal financial forecasts and budgets.\n\nWe believe that EBITDA facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period by isolating the effects of certain items that vary from period to period without any correlation to core operating performance or that vary widely among similar companies. These potential differences may be caused by variations in capital structures (affecting interest expense), tax positions (such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or net operating losses) and the age and book depreciation of facilities and equipment (affecting relative depreciation expense). We also present EBITDA and EBITDA Margin because (i) we believe that these measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry, (ii) we believe that investors will find these measures useful in assessing our ability to service or incur indebtedness, and (iii) we use these measures internally as benchmarks to compare our performance to that of our competitors.\n\nEBITDA, EBITDA Margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We do not intend for non-GAAP financial measures to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nSet forth below is a reconciliation of reported net loss to EBITDA (unaudited):\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n---  \n**_(In thousands)_** | **2024** | **2023**  \nNet loss | $ | (5,002 | ) | $ | (1,307 | )  \nIncome tax expense (benefit) | 133 | (132 | )  \nInterest expense (1) | 564 | 1,007  \nDepreciation and amortization expense | 2,897 | 2,948  \nEBITDA | $ | (1,408 | ) | $ | 2,516  \nEBITDA Margin | (1.7 | )% | 3.1 | %  \n  \n____________(1) Excludes interest expense related to pension plans and postretirement benefit plans.\n\nSet forth below is a reconciliation of reported net loss to Adjusted EBITDA (unaudited):\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n---  \n**_(In thousands)_** | **2024** | **2023**  \nNet loss | $ | (5,002 | ) | $ | (1,307 | )  \nIncome tax expense (benefit) | 133 | (132 | )  \nInterest expense (1) | 564 | 1,007  \nDepreciation and amortization expense | 2,897 | 2,948  \n401(k) and share-based compensation expense | 495 | 1,552  \nNet losses (gains) on disposal of assets | 1,666 | (6,785 | )  \nSeverance costs | 664 | 2,265  \nAdjusted EBITDA | $ | 1,417 | $ | (452 | )  \nAdjusted EBITDA Margin | 1.7 | % | (0.6 | )%  \n  \n____________(1) Excludes interest expense related to pension plans and postretirement benefit plans.\n\n![](https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=OTI2OTYxMiM2NTcxMjg3IzIwMDY2MTc=) ![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/YzFlNjE1ZjgtMGM0NC00OTJiLTkyYTUtNjI1MzU2MzFhNzdmLTEwMTgxOTA=/tiny/Farmer-Bros-Co-.png)\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/30867831-e714-444d-b90d-7ab1886a648f/small/farm-transparent-png.png)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/30867831-e714-444d-b90d-7ab1886a648f)\n\n##### Contact Us\n\ninvestor relations contactellipsis\n\nfarmerbrothers@ellipsisTA.com [646-776-0886](tel:6467760886)\n\nfarmerbrothers@ellipsisTA.com[646-776-0886](tel:6467760886)\n\nmedia contactbrandi wessel director of communication\n\nbwessel@farmerbros.com [405-885-5176](tel:4058855176)\n\nbwessel@farmerbros.com[405-885-5176](tel:4058855176)\n\n[Back to News](/news)\n\n[In the Blog](/blog)\n\n### Keep Pace With Our Latest:\n\n  * [](https://www.farmerbros.com/farmer-brothers-coffee-reports-first-quarter-fiscal-2025-financial-results/)\n\nNovember 7, 2024\n\n### Farmer Brothers Coffee reports first quarter fiscal 2025 financial results\n\n[Read the News](https://www.farmerbros.com/farmer-brothers-coffee-reports-first-quarter-fiscal-2025-financial-results/)\n\n  * [](https://www.farmerbros.com/farmer-brothers-coffee-to-report-fiscal-first-quarter-2025-financial-results/)\n\nOctober 24, 2024\n\n### Farmer Brothers Coffee to report fiscal first quarter 2025 financial results\n\n[Read the News](https://www.farmerbros.com/farmer-brothers-coffee-to-report-fiscal-first-quarter-2025-financial-results/)\n\n\n\n\n[See More](/news)\n\n## See our upcoming events\n\n  * [](https://www.farmerbros.com/events/first-quarter-fiscal-2025-earnings-call/)\n\n### First Quarter Fiscal 2025 Earnings Call\n\n[Get The Details](https://www.farmerbros.com/events/first-quarter-fiscal-2025-earnings-call/)\n\n  * [](https://www.farmerbros.com/events/nacs/)\n\n### NACS\n\n[Get The Details](https://www.farmerbros.com/events/nacs/)\n\n\n\n\n[Full Calendar](/events)\n\n### Good Days Need Good Coffee\n\n[](http://www.linkedin.com/company/farmer-brothers)[](http://www.facebook.com/FarmerBrosCo)[](https://www.instagram.com/farmerbroscoffee)[](https://x.com/Farmer_Brothers)\n\n© Copyright Farmer Brothers 2024.
