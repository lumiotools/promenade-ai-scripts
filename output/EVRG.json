Adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted earnings per share (non-GAAP) are reconciled to GAAP earnings in the financial table included in this release. \n\nThird quarter 2024 adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) per share were higher than last year due primarily to new retail rates, FERC regulated investments and growth in weather-normalized demand, partially offset by cooler summer weather and higher depreciation and amortization expense. \n\n\"We were pleased to announce a unanimous settlement agreement in our Missouri West rate case which, if approved by the Missouri Public Service Commission (MPSC), delivers a constructive outcome for our Missouri West customers,\" said David Campbell, Evergy chairman and chief executive officer. \"We also recently announced the sites of two 705 megawatt combined-cycle natural gas plants that will help us meet the growing energy needs in our region, while creating jobs and tax dollars and ensuring we can attract and serve new businesses to our area given the historic opportunities ahead of us in Kansas and Missouri.\" \n\n\"We're also excited to announce our 2025E-2029E capital investment plan of $16.2 billion, which reflects the infrastructure investment needed to enable these opportunities,\" continued Campbell. \"This update incorporates a significant portion of the new generation needed to serve our growing customer base as outlined in our 2024 Integrated Resource Plans, along with other beneficial projects to modernize our transmission and distribution systems to deliver affordable, reliable and sustainable power to the communities we serve.\" \n\n\"We are reaffirming our 2024 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) guidance range of $3.73 to $3.93 and establishing 2025 adjusted EPS guidance of $3.92 to $4.12. Based on our updated financial outlook, we expect long-term adjusted EPS growth in the upper half of our 4% to 6% range starting in 2026.” \n\n**Earnings Guidance**\n\nThe Company reaffirmed its 2024 GAAP EPS guidance range of $3.73 to $3.93, along with its 2024 adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) guidance range to $3.73 to $3.93. Additionally, the Company established its 2025 GAAP EPS guidance range of $3.92 to $4.12, along with its 2025 adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) guidance range of $3.92 to $4.12. The Company also established its long-term adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) annual growth target of 4% to 6% through 2029 based on the 2025 adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) guidance midpoint of $4.02. The Company expects adjusted EPS growth in the upper half of the 4% to 6% range beginning in 2026. Adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) guidance is reconciled to GAAP EPS guidance in the financial table included in this release. \n\n**Dividend Declaration**\n\nThe Board of Directors declared a dividend on the Company’s common stock of $0.6675 per share payable on December 20, 2024. The dividends are payable to shareholders of record as of November 21, 2024. \n\n**Earnings Conference Call**\n\nEvergy management will host a conference call Thursday, November 7, with the investment community at 9:00 a.m. ET (8:00 a.m. CT).

To access via phone, investors and analysts will need to register using this [link](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fregister.vevent.com%2Fregister%2FBI2426c2a257da4b4bac20387c8d9f567c&esheet=54148437&newsitemid=20241107116537&lan=en-US&anchor=link&index=2&md5=cf2704f84e084ddd5196d8013b60d582) where they will be provided a phone number and access code. \n\nThis earnings announcement, a package of detailed third quarter financial information, the Company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2024, and other filings the Company has made with the Securities and Exchange Commission are available on the Company's website at [http://investors.evergy.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Finvestors.evergy.com&esheet=54148437&newsitemid=20241107116537&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Finvestors.evergy.com&index=3&md5=35b2dcde4acda50606509acd472f893b). \n\n**Adjusted Earnings (non-GAAP) and Adjusted Earnings Per Share (non-GAAP)**\n\nManagement believes that adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) are representative measures of Evergy's recurring earnings, assist in the comparability of results and are consistent with how management reviews performance. \n\nEvergy's adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) for the three months ended and year to date September 30, 2024 were $465.6 million or $2.02 per share and $797.3 million or $3.46 per share, respectively. For the three months ended and year to date September 30, 2023, Evergy's adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) were $432.3 million or $1.88 per share and $754.5 million or $3.27 per share, respectively. \n\nIn addition to net income attributable to Evergy, Inc. and diluted EPS, Evergy's management uses adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) to evaluate earnings and EPS without: \n\n  1. the mark-to-market impacts of economic hedges related to Evergy Kansas Central's 8% ownership share of JEC; \n  2. the costs resulting from non-regulated energy marketing margins from the February 2021 winter weather event; \n  3. the second quarter 2023 recognition of a regulatory liability for the refund to customers of revenues previously collected since October 2019 for costs related to an electric subdivision rebate program to be refunded to customers in accordance with a June 2020 KCC order; and \n  4. the recognition of a regulatory liability for future refund of amounts of revenues previously collected from customers related to COLI rate credits in accordance with a September 2023 KCC rate case unanimous settlement agreement. \n\n\n\nAdjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) are intended to aid an investor's overall understanding of results. Management believes that adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) provides a meaningful basis for evaluating Evergy's operations across periods because it excludes certain items that management does not believe are indicative of Evergy's ongoing performance or that can create period to period earnings volatility. \n\nAdjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) are used internally to measure performance against budget and in reports for management and the Evergy Board. Adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) are financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies' presentations or more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report. \n\n**Evergy, Inc**  \n---  \n**Consolidated Earnings and Diluted Earnings Per Share**  \n(Unaudited)   \n**Earnings (Loss)** |  **Earnings (Loss) per Diluted Share** |  **Earnings (Loss)** |  **Earnings (Loss) per Diluted Share**  \n**Three Months Ended September 30** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \n(millions, except per share amounts)   \nNet income attributable to Evergy, Inc. |  $  |  465.6  |  $  |  2.02  |  $  |  351.6  |  $  |  1.53   \nNon-GAAP reconciling items:   \nMark-to-market impact of JEC economic hedges, pre-tax(a) |  —  |  —  |  6.8  |  0.03   \nCustomer refund related to COLI rate credits, pre-tax(d) |  —  |  —  |  96.5  |  0.42   \nIncome tax benefit(e) |  —  |  —  |  (22.6  |  )  |  (0.10  |  )   \nAdjusted earnings (non-GAAP)  |  $  |  465.6  |  $  |  2.02  |  $  |  432.3  |  $  |  1.88   \n**Earnings (Loss)** |  **Earnings (Loss) per Diluted Share** |  **Earnings (Loss)** |  **Earnings (Loss) per Diluted Share**  \n---|---|---|---  \n**Year to Date September 30** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \n(millions, except per share amounts)   \nNet income attributable to Evergy, Inc. |  $  |  795.3  |  $  |  3.45  |  $  |  673.3  |  $  |  2.92   \nNon-GAAP reconciling items:   \nMark-to-market impact of JEC economic hedges, pre-tax(a) |  2.6  |  0.01  |  4.8  |  0.02   \nNon-regulated energy marketing costs related to February 2021 winter weather event, pre-tax(b) |  —  |  —  |  0.2  |  —   \nElectric subdivision rebate program costs refund, pre-tax(c) |  —  |  —  |  2.6  |  0.01   \nCustomer refunds related to COLI rate credits, pre-tax(d) |  —  |  —  |  96.5  |  0.42   \nIncome tax benefit (e) |  (0.6  |  )  |  —  |  (22.9  |  )  |  (0.10  |  )   \nAdjusted earnings (non-GAAP)  |  $  |  797.3  |  $  |  3.46  |  $  |  754.5  |  $  |  3.27   \n(a)  |  Reflects mark-to-market gains or losses related to forward contracts for natural gas and electricity entered into as economic hedges against fuel price volatility related to Evergy Kansas Central's 8% ownership share of JEC that are included in operating revenues on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.   \n---|---  \n(b)  |  Reflects non-regulated energy marketing incentive compensation costs related to the February 2021 winter weather event that are included in operating and maintenance expense on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.   \n(c)  |  Reflects the second quarter 2023 recognition of a regulatory liability for the refund to customers of revenues previously collected since October 2019 for costs related to an electric subdivision rebate program to be refunded to customers in accordance with a June 2020 KCC order that are included in operating revenues on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.   \n(d)  |  Reflects the recognition of a regulatory liability for the refund to customers for amounts of revenues previously collected related to COLI rate credits in accordance with a September 2023 KCC rate case unanimous settlement agreement reached between Evergy, the KCC staff and other intervenors that are included in operating revenues on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.   \n(e)  |  Reflects an income tax effect calculated at a statutory rate of approximately 22%.   \n**GAAP to Non-GAAP Earnings Guidance**  \n---  \n**Original 2023 Earnings per****Diluted Share** **Guidance** |  **2024 Earnings per****Diluted Share** **Guidance** |  **2025 Earnings per****Diluted Share** **Guidance**  \n**Net income attributable to Evergy, Inc.** |  **$3.55 - $3.75** |  **$3.73 – $3.93** |  **$3.92 – $4.12**  \nNon-GAAP reconciling items:   \n-  |  -  |  -  |  -   \n**Adjusted earnings (non-GAAP)** |  **$3.55 - $3.75** |  **$3.73 – $3.93** |  **$3.92 – $4.12**  \n  \n**About Evergy**\n\nEvergy, Inc.

(NASDAQ: EVRG) today announced it will invest in two new 705 megawatt (MW) combined-cycle natural gas plants that will be built in Kansas. The plants are expected to begin operating in 2029 and 2030. \n\n“High-efficiency modern natural gas plants will meet the electricity needs for our region’s growing economy. These plants also will bring good paying jobs and tax dollars to Kansas,” said David Campbell, Evergy Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Dispatchable natural gas is an important resource within Evergy’s growing and diverse energy portfolio, complementing our planned investment in wind and solar resources and supporting our commitment to affordable, reliable and sustainable electricity.” \n\nThe two new plants will provide flexible generation that pairs well with the abundant renewable resource potential in Evergy’s service area and will meet stringent emissions standards. The plant in Sumner County is expected to begin providing electricity in 2029, and the plant in Reno County is expected to be in service in 2030. \n\n“Kansas is experiencing record economic growth, and Evergy is prepared to deliver the reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy needed,” Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly said. “Evergy’s multi-billion dollar investment brings direct value to the Hutchinson and Sumner County areas in jobs and tax dollars. It also ensures Kansas can continue to invite business growth that benefits the entire state.” \n\nThe natural gas plants will represent a major investment in the state’s energy infrastructure that will serve customers for 40 years. During construction, more than 500 jobs are anticipated for each plant. After a 10-year exemption, each plant will provide more than $500 million in property tax revenues over its service life and will bring to the communities 20-40 skilled craft jobs that pay more than $90,000 annually. \n\n“We’re pleased to make this investment in communities we serve,” Campbell said. “As Kansas and Missouri are seeing historic opportunities for attracting new businesses to our area, Evergy is committed to providing the affordable, reliable and sustainable energy our customers need. This growth benefits all customers by helping to hold down prices.” \n\nKansas’ success in drawing new and expanding businesses has driven the need for more electric generation. During the 2024 Kansas legislative session, a bipartisan effort resulted in legislation that enhances Kansas policies related to electric infrastructure investment, which will help Kansas compete with other states for investment and ultimately save customers money. \n\nDan Hawkins, Speaker of the House, said, “We are pleased that a legislative policy we championed is helping ensure a strong energy future for the state of Kansas. I look forward to seeing the benefits this brings in terms of jobs, economic growth and energy security for our state for years to come.” \n\nSenate President Ty Masterson, added, “Kansans depend on reliable electricity each and every day to power their lives and their businesses. These investments by a long-time Kansas energy company will make our state even more attractive to those wanting to live, work and grow a business in our great state.” \n\nEarlier this year, Evergy filed with the Kansas Corporation Commission and the Missouri Public Service Commission its 20-year plan for meeting customers’ energy needs, which included these generation plants. With strong economic growth expected in Kansas and Missouri over the next decade, The plan maps out a responsible generation transition as Evergy prepares for growing energy demand and for older plants to retire. It ensures customers’ needs are met today and in the future. \n\n**About Evergy**\n\nEvergy, Inc. (NASDAQ: EVRG), serves 1.7 million customers in Kansas and Missouri.
