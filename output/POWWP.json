Received Notification of Deficiency from Nasdaq Related to Delayed Filing of Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q\n\nNovember 26, 2024\n\n**SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Nov. 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --** AMMO, Inc. (Nasdaq: POWW, POWWP) (“AMMO,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company”), the owner of [GunBroker.com](http://GunBroker.com), the largest online marketplace serving the firearms and shooting sports industries, and a leading vertically integrated producer of high-performance ammunition and components, today announced that it received an expected deficiency notification letter from the Listing Qualifications Staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) on November 20, 2024 (the “Notice”). The Notice indicated that the Company was not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) (the “Listing Rule”) as a result of the Company’s failure to timely file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 (the “Form 10-Q”), as described more fully in the Company’s Form 12b-25 Notification of Late Filing filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on November 13, 2024 (the “Form 12b-25”). The Listing Rule requires Nasdaq-listed companies to timely file all required periodic financial reports with the SEC.\n\nAs reported in the Form 12b-25, the Form 10-Q cannot be filed within the prescribed time period without unreasonable effort or expense as a result of the ongoing independent investigation (the “Investigation”) conducted by a law firm retained by a Special Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company.\n\nThe Company has until January 21, 2025, to submit a plan to regain compliance with the Listing Rule (the “Plan”). The Company intends to timely submit the Plan, if necessary. Pursuant to the Notice, if Nasdaq accepts the Plan, Nasdaq has the discretion to grant the Company an exception of up to 180 calendar days (the “Compliance Period”) from the due date of the Form 10-Q, or until May 19, 2025, to regain compliance with the Listing Rule. While the Company cannot provide specific timing regarding the filing of the Form 10-Q, the Company continues to work diligently to complete the Form 10-Q and intends to file the Form 10-Q as soon as practicable to regain compliance with the Listing Rule within the Compliance Period.\n\nNo assurance can be given that the Company will be able to regain compliance with the Listing Rule or maintain compliance with the other continued listing requirements set forth in the Nasdaq Listing Rules. If the Company does not regain compliance with the Listing Rule within the Compliance Period, Nasdaq could provide notice that the Company’s securities will become subject to delisting. If the Company receives notice that its securities are being delisted, Nasdaq rules permit the Company to appeal any delisting determination by Nasdaq staff to a hearings panel.\n\nThe Notice has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company’s common stock or preferred stock on Nasdaq. \n\n**About AMMO, Inc.**\n\nWith its corporate offices headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona, AMMO designs and manufactures products for a variety of aptitudes, including law enforcement, military, sport shooting and self-defense.

Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as “target,” “believe,” “expect,” “will,” “may,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “would,” “positioned,” “future,” and other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements regarding the Company’s intent to timely submit the Plan and the Company’s plans and expectations about the completion and filing of the Form 10-Q. Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on Company management’s current beliefs, expectations and assumptions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the Company’s control. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the timing of completion of the Investigation; Nasdaq’s acceptance of the Plan, and the duration of any extension that may be granted by Nasdaq; the potential inability to meet Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements; uncertainties associated with the Company’s preparation of the Form 10-Q and the related financial statements, including the possibility that accounting errors or corrections will be identified; and the possibility of additional delays in the filing of the Form 10-Q and the Company’s other SEC filings. Therefore, investors should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements and should review the risks and uncertainties described under the caption “Risk Factors” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on June 13, 2024, and additional disclosures the Company makes in its other filings with the SEC, which are available on the SEC’s website at [www.sec.gov](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Y4gRGmS_iHflWhPCNq1u8W9LtBp6Mxcu4Xr5VwkDAD7-k5Fc_BZRWKic2nSV8IyYGZcLR3XTQLOQJk4uXfGDvA==).

(Nasdaq: POWW, POWWP) (“AMMO” or the “Company”), the owner of [GunBroker.com](http://GunBroker.com), the largest online marketplace serving the firearms and shooting sports industries, and a leading vertically integrated producer of high-performance ammunition and components, today reported results for its first quarter of fiscal 2025, ended June 30, 2024.\n\n**First Quarter Fiscal 2025 vs. First Quarter Fiscal 2024**\n\n●| Net Revenues of $31.0 million  \n---|---  \n●| Gross profit margin of approximately 31.6% compared to 40.9%  \n●| Adjusted EBITDA of $2.0 million compared to $6.6 million  \n●| Net loss of ($7.1) million, compared to a net loss of ($1.1) million  \n●| Diluted EPS of ($0.07), compared to ($0.02)  \n●| Adjusted EPS of $0.01, compared to $0.05  \n  \n**[GunBroker.com](http://GunBroker.com) “Marketplace” Metrics – First Quarter 2025**\n\n●| Marketplace revenue of approximately $12.3 million  \n---|---  \n●| New user growth averaged approximately 25,000 per month  \n●| Average take rate increased to 6.2% compared to 5.8% in Q1 FY 2024  \n  \nJared Smith, AMMO’s CEO, commented “In our first quarter of fiscal 2025, we continued to make progress on the primary core initiatives for each of our business units, transforming our ammunition plant to higher margin rifle and pistol production and transforming our marketplace into an innovative ecommerce leader.\n\n“We have been building ammunition inventories to accelerate sales this fall for the launch of our new premium rifle hunting segments, and we started delivering on our 12.7X108 cases under our contractual obligations to ZRO Delta. At GunBroker, we see take rates further increasing in the quarters ahead as we push ahead with our Gearfire financing solution, and an anticipated increase in non-firearm accessory sales as we monetize the algorithms and tune our cross-selling capabilities,” Mr. Smith concluded.\n\n**First Quarter 2025 Results**\n\nWe ended the first quarter of our 2025 fiscal year with total revenues of approximately $31.0 million in comparison to $34.3 million in the prior year quarter. Our ammunition segment made up $18.7 million of the total revenues and our marketplace segment generated the remaining $12.3 million in revenues. The decrease in revenue was primarily related to a decrease in activity across both our reporting segments, which we believe decreased as a result of the current macroeconomic environment impacting our industry as well as others.\n\nCost of revenues was approximately $21.2 million for the quarter compared to $20.2 million in the comparable prior year quarter. Cost of revenues for our marketplace segment was $1.8 million and our ammunition segment cost of revenues were $19.4 million.\n\nThis resulted in a total gross margin for the quarter of $9.8 million or 31.6% compared to $14.0 million or 40.9% in the prior year period. Our marketplace segment gross margin was $10.5 million or 85.6%. The gross margin for our ammunition segment was negative $0.7 million or (4.0%).\n\nThe increase in cost of revenues and decrease in gross profit margin was related to the shift in sales mix and production inefficiencies in our ammunition segment in comparison to the prior year period.\n\nAlthough our margins decreased from the prior year period, the robust margins on GunBroker continue to hold strong, and while the margins in the ammunition segment remained down as the plant ramp is still underway, we are beginning to see increased production throughput and expect that we will see increased product marginality in future periods if we are able to continue with this trend.\n\nThere was approximately $6.3 million of nonrecurring expenses in the quarter related to legal and professional fees, which we have included as an addback to adjusted EBITDA. The $6.3 million of nonrecurring expenses also included a $3.2 million expense related to a contingency stemming from litigation GunBroker was involved with prior to our acquisition. We expect to recover 2.9 million shares of common stock as a result of this settlement, which will be cancelled and returned to our authorized but unissued share pool.\n\nFor the quarter, we recorded Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $2.0 million, compared to prior year quarter Adjusted EBITDA of $6.6 million.\n\nThis resulted in a loss per share of $0.07 for the quarter or Adjusted Net Income per Share of $0.01 in comparison to a loss per share of $0.02 in the prior year quarter or Adjusted Net Income per Share of $0.05.\n\nLooking forward, we are continuing to focus on streamlining our manufacturing processes, which should improve product throughput and marginality. For GunBroker, efforts to offer a flexible financing option to customers is well underway as well as our cross-selling solution which provides our users with the ability to view and purchase compatible items when going through the checkout process. We expect these enhancements will drive sales growth through better functionality and enhanced purchasing power of buyers.\n\nOur financial position remains strong given our net working capital position as we have reported $134.0 million in current assets including $50.8 million of cash and cash equivalents along with $42.3 million of current liabilities. We believe this strong position will continue to stimulate our transformation efforts.\n\nWe repurchased approximately 580,000 shares of our common stock under our repurchase plan in the reported quarter, bringing us to just over 1.9 million total shares repurchased under the plan since December 2022.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nManagement will host a conference call at 5:00 PM ET today, August 8, 2024, to review financial results and provide an update on corporate developments.

We believe these measures are useful for period-to-period comparisons of the Company.

We were inactive until the following series of events in December 2016 and March 2017.\nOn December 15, 2016, the Company’s majority shareholders sold their common stock to Mr. Fred W. Wagenhals (“Mr. Wagenhals”) resulting in a\nchange in control of the Company. Mr. Wagenhals was appointed as sole officer and the sole member of the Company’s Board of Directors.\nThe Company also approved (i) doing business in the name AMMO, Inc., (ii) a change to the Company’s OTC trading symbol to POWW, (iii) an\nagreement and plan of merger to re-domicile and change the Company’s state of incorporation from California to Delaware, and (iv) a 1-for-25 reverse stock\nsplit of the issued and outstanding shares of the common stock of the Company. These transactions were effective as of December 30, 2016.\nOn March 17, 2017, the Company entered into a definitive agreement with AMMO, Inc. a Delaware Corporation (“PRIVCO”) under which the\nCompany acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of PRIVCO. PRIVCO subsequently changes its name to AMMO Munitions, Inc.\nNOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nAccounting Basis\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q\nhave been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and reflect all adjustments,\nwhich consist solely of normal recurring adjustments, needed to fairly present the financial results for these periods. Additionally, these condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements and related disclosures are presented pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities Exchange Commission (“SEC”).\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited condensed consolidated financial\nstatements and related disclosures contained in the Company’s Annual Report filed with the SEC on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024. The results\nfor the three months ended June 30, 2024, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire fiscal year. Accordingly, certain\ninformation and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been omitted pursuant to the rules\nand regulations of the SEC. In the opinion of management, all adjustments have been made, which consist only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a\nfair statement of (a) the results of operations for the three month periods ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, (b) the financial position at June 30, 2024, and (c) cash\nflows for the three month periods ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.\n8\nAMMO, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nWe use the accrual basis of accounting and U.S. GAAP, and all amounts are expressed in U.S. dollars. The Company has a fiscal year-end of March\n31st.\nUnless the context otherwise requires, all references to “Ammo”, “we”, “us”, “our,” or the “Company” are to AMMO, Inc., a Delaware corporation,\nand its consolidated subsidiaries.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AMMO, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany\naccounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets\nand liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the balance sheet and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the\nreporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates made in preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements\ninclude the valuation of allowances for credit losses, valuation of deferred tax assets, inventories, useful lives of assets, goodwill, intangible assets, stock-based\ncompensation, and warrant-based compensation.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Policies\nA summary of our critical accounting policies is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024, under\n“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” There have been no significant changes to these policies during\nthe three months ended June 30, 2024. For disclosure regarding recent accounting pronouncements and the anticipated impact they will have on our operations,\nplease refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024.\nGoodwill\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs, or circumstances change that would more likely than not\nreduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. In testing for goodwill impairment, we may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to\nevaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If our qualitative assessment indicates that\ngoodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform a two-step impairment test. We test goodwill for impairment under the two-step impairment test by\nfirst comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative\nfactors indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference\nbetween the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value. We estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of\nfuture cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily on expected category expansion, pricing, market\nsegment share, and general economic conditions. Due to the declines in the value of our stock price and market capitalization in the year ended March 31,\n2023, we assessed qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the Marketplace segment is less than its carrying amount.\nThrough our analysis we determined our stock price and market capitalization decline is not indicative of a decrease in the fair value of our Marketplace\nsegment and a fair value calculation using the discounted cash flows was more appropriate due to the operational performance of the reporting segment.\nAccordingly, the impairment of Goodwill was not warranted for the year ended March 31, 2024. As of June 30, 2024, the Company has a goodwill carrying\nvalue of $90,870,094, all of which is assigned to the Marketplace segment. However, it is possible that the book values of our Marketplace segment could\nexceed its fair value, which may result in the recognition of a material, noncash impairment of goodwill for the year ending March 31, 2025.\n9\nAMMO, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses\nOur accounts receivable represents amounts due from customers for products sold and include an allowance for estimated credit losses which is\nestimated based on the collectability and age of the accounts receivable balances and categorization of customers with similar financial condition. At June 30,\n2024 and March 31, 2024, we reserved $3,782,553 and $3,666,078, respectively, of allowance for credit losses.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nFor purposes of the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, we consider highly liquid financial instruments purchased with a maturity of\nthree months or less to be cash equivalents.\nLicense Agreements\nWe are a party to a license agreement with Jesse James, a well-known motorcycle designer, and Jesse James Firearms, LLC, a Texas limited liability\ncompany. The license agreement grants us the exclusive worldwide rights through April 12, 2026 to Mr. James’ image rights and trademarks associated with\nhim in connection with the marketing, promotion, advertising, sale, and commercial exploitation of Jesse James Branded Products. We agreed to pay Mr. James\nroyalty fees on the sale of ammunition and non-ammunition Branded Products and to reimburse him for any out-of-pocket expenses and reasonable travel\nexpenses.\nPatents\nOn September 28, 2017, AMMO Technologies Inc. (“ATI”), an Arizona corporation, which is 100% owned by us, merged with Hallam, Inc, a Texas\ncorporation, with ATI being the survivor. The primary asset of Hallam, Inc. was an exclusive license to produce projectiles and ammunition using the Hybrid\nLuminescence Ammunition Technology under patent U.S. 8,402,896 B1 with a publication date of March 26, 2013, owned by University of Louisiana at\nLafayette. The license was formally amended and assigned to AMMO Technologies Inc. pursuant to an Assignment and First Amendment to Exclusive License\nAssumption Agreement dated to be effective as of August 22, 2017, the Merger closing date. This asset will be amortized from September 2017, the first full\nmonth of the acquired rights, through October 29, 2028.\nUnder the terms of the Exclusive License Agreement, the Company is obligated to pay a quarterly royalty to the patent holder, based on a $0.01 per\nunit basis for each round of ammunition sold that incorporates this patented technology through October 29, 2028. For the three months ended June 30, 2024\nand 2023, the Company recognized royalty expenses of $1,864 and $5,060, respectively under this agreement.\n10\nAMMO, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn August 2018, we applied for additional patent coverage for the manufacturing methods or application of the Hybrid Luminescence Ammunition\nTechnology on a variety of projectile and ammunition types. The costs of filing this patent were expensed.\nOn October 5, 2018, we completed the acquisition of SW Kenetics Inc. AMMO Technologies, Inc. succeeded all of the assets of SW Kenetics, Inc.\nand assumed all of the liabilities.\nThe primary asset of SW Kenetics Inc. was a pending patent for modular projectiles. All rights to patent pending application were assigned and\ntransferred to AMMO Technologies, Inc. pursuant to Intellectual Property Rights Agreement on September 27, 2018.\nWe intend to continue building our patent portfolio to protect our proprietary technologies and processes and will file new applications where\nappropriate to preserve our rights to manufacture and sell our branded lines of ammunition.\nOther Intangible Assets\nOn March 15, 2019, Enlight Group II, LLC d/b/a Jagemann Munition Components, a wholly owned subsidiary of AMMO, Inc., completed its\nacquisition of assets of Jagemann Stamping Company’s ammunition casing manufacturing and sales operations pursuant to the terms of the Amended and\nRestated Asset Purchase Agreement (See Note 12). The intangible assets acquired include a tradename, customer relationships, and intellectual property.\nOn April 30, 2021, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among the Company, SpeedLight Group I,\nLLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and Gemini Direct Investments, LLC, a Nevada limited liability\ncompany. Whereby SpeedLight Group I, LLC merged with and into Gemini Direct Investments, LLC, with SpeedLight Group I, LLC surviving the merger as a\nwholly owned subsidiary of the Company. At the time of the Merger, Gemini Direct Investments, LLC had nine (9) subsidiaries, all of which are related to\nGemini’s ownership of GunBroker, an online auction marketplace dedicated to firearms, hunting, shooting, and related products. The intangible assets acquired\ninclude a tradename, customer relationships, intellectual property, software, and domain names.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. When\nsuch events or changes in circumstances are present, we assess the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets\nwill be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, we\nrecognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of\nthe carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell. No impairment expense was recognized for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate revenue from the production and sale of ammunition, ammunition casings, and marketplace fee revenue, which includes auction revenue,\npayment processing revenue, and shipping income. We recognize revenue according to Accounting Standard Codification – Revenue from Contract with\nCustomers (“ASC 606”). When the customer obtains control over the promised goods or services, we record revenue in the amount of consideration that we\ncan expect to receive in exchange for those goods and services. We apply the following five-step model to determine revenue recognition:\n● Identification of a contract with a customer\n● Identification of the performance obligations in the contact\n● Determination of the transaction price\n● Allocation of the transaction price to the separate performance allocation\n● Recognition of revenue when performance obligations are satisfied\n11\nAMMO, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nWe only apply the five-step model when it is probable that we will collect the consideration we are entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it\ntransfers to the customer. At contract inception and once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we assess the goods or services\npromised within each contract and determine those that are performance obligations, and assess whether each promised good or service is distinct.\nFor Ammunition Sales and Casing Sales, our contracts contain a single performance obligation and the entire transaction price is allocated to the\nsingle performance obligation. We recognize as revenues the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when the\nperformance obligation is satisfied or as it is satisfied. Accordingly, we recognize revenues (net) when the customer obtains control of our product, which\ntypically occurs upon shipment of the product or the performance of the service. In the year ended March 31, 2021, we began accepting contract liabilities or\ndeferred revenue. We included Deferred Revenue in our Accrued Liabilities. We will recognize revenue when the performance obligation is met.\nFor Marketplace revenue, the performance obligation is satisfied, and revenue is recognized as follows:\nAuction revenue consists of optional listing fees with variable pricing components based on customer options selected from the GunBroker website\nand final value fees based on a percentage of the final selling price of the listed item. The performance obligation is to process the transactions as initiated by\nthe customer. Revenue is recognized at a point in time when the transaction is processed.\nCompliance fee revenue consists of fees charged to customers based on a percentage of the final price of an item at the time of purchase. The\nperformance obligation is to process the transactions as initiated by the customer. Revenue is recognized at a point in time when the transaction is processed.\nPayment processing revenue consists of fees charged to customers on a transactional basis. The performance obligation is to process the transactions\nas initiated by the customer. The price is set by the GunBroker user agreement on the website based on stand-alone selling prices. Revenue is recognized at a\npoint in time when the transaction is processed.\nShipping income consists of fees charged to customers for shipping of sold items listed on the GunBroker website. The performance obligation is to\nship the item sold as initiated by the customer. The price is set based on the third-party service provider selected to be used by the customer as well as the speed\nand location of shipment. Revenue is recognized at a point in time when the shipping label is printed.\nBanner Advertising Campaign Revenue consists of fees charged to customers for advertisement placement and impressions generated through the\nGunBroker website. The performance obligation is to generate the number of impressions specified by the customer on banner advertisements on the\nGunBroker website using the placement selected by the customer. The price is set by the GunBroker user agreement on the website based on standalone selling\nprices, or by advertising insertion order as negotiated by a media broker. If the number of impressions promised is not generated, the customer receives a\nrefund and the refund is applied to the transaction price. Banner advertising campaigns generally run for one month, and revenue is recognized at a point in\ntime at the end of the selected month.\nProduct Sales consists of fees charged for the liquidation of excess inventory for partner distributors. The performance obligation is to sell and ship the\ninventory item as initiated by the customer. The price depends on whether the inventory is a fixed price item or an auction item. For a fixed price item, the\nCompany performs research to determine the current market rate for such an item, and the item is listed at that price. For an auction item, the price is set by\nwhat the buyer is willing to pay. The Company acts as a principal in these transactions due to the extent of control they have over the product prior to the sale.\nDue to the principal determination, gross revenue is recognized at a point in time when the item has been shipped.\nIdentity Verification consists of fees charged to customers for identity verification in order to gain access to the GunBroker website. The performance\nobligation is to process the identity verification as initiated by the customer. The price is set by the GunBroker user agreement on the website based on a stand-\nalone selling price. Revenue is recognized at a point in time when the identity verification is completed.\n12\nAMMO, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2024 and year end March 31, 2024, the Company’s customers that comprised more than ten percent (10%) of\ntotal revenues and accounts receivable were as follows.\nRevenues at\nJune 30, 2024\nThree Months Accounts Receivable\nPERCENTAGES Ended June 30, 2024 March 31, 2024\nCustomers:\nA - - 11.8%\n- - -\nDisaggregated Revenue Information\nThe following table represents a disaggregation of revenue from customers by category. We attribute net sales to categories by product or service\ntypes; ammunition, ammunition casings, and marketplace fees. We note that revenue recognition processes are consistent between product and service type,\nhowever, the amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows may vary by each product type due to the customers of each product and service type.\nFor the Three Months Ended\nJune 30, 2024 June 30, 2023\nAmmunition sales(1) $ 13,359,554 $ 14,106,029\nMarketplace fee revenue 12,281,991 13,912,202\nAmmunition casings sales 5,312,005 6,236,344\nTotal Sales $ 30,953,550 $ 34,254,575\n(1) Included in revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 are excise taxes of $1,303,603 and $1,175,796, respectively.\nAmmunition products are sold through “Big Box” retailers, manufacturers, local ammunition stores, and shooting range operators. We also sell direct\nto customers online. In contrast, our ammunition casings products are sold to manufacturers. Marketplace fees are generated through our GunBroker online\nauction marketplace.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of Revenues for our ammunition segment consists of product cost and cost directly and indirectly associated with getting those products to a\nsellable state and for our marketplace segment, consists of cost associated with facilitating transactions on the platform.\nAdvertising Costs\nWe expense advertising costs under our Ammunition segment as they are incurred in selling and marketing expenses of operating expenses.\nMarketplace Segment advertising costs are expensed as they are incurred in cost of revenues. We incurred advertising expenses under our Ammunition segment\nof $108,802 and $119,638 for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, recognized in selling and marketing expenses and $110,542 and\n$138,657 of Marketplace segment advertising expenses recognized in cost of revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nInventories\nWe state inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We determine cost using the average cost method. Our inventory consists of raw\nmaterials, work in progress, and finished goods. Cost of inventory includes cost of parts, labor, quality control, and all other costs incurred to bring our\ninventories to condition ready to be sold. We periodically evaluate and adjust inventories for obsolescence.\n13\nAMMO, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nProperty and Equipment\nWe state property and equipment at cost, less accumulated depreciation. We capitalize major renewals and improvements, while we charge minor\nreplacements, maintenance, and repairs to current operations. We compute depreciation by applying the straight-line method over estimated useful lives, which\nare generally 5 to 10 years for equipment and 40 years for our building.\nCompensated Absences\nWe accrue a liability for compensated absences in accordance with Accounting Standards Codifications 710 – Compensation – General (“ASC 710”).\nResearch and Development\nTo date, we have expensed all costs associated with developing our product specifications, manufacturing procedures, and products through our cost\nof products sold, as this work was done by the same employees who produced the finished product. We anticipate that it may become necessary to reclassify\nresearch and development costs into our operating expenditures for reporting purposes as we begin to develop new technologies and lines of ammunition.\nExcise Tax\nAs a result of regulations imposed by the Federal Government for sales of ammunition to non-government U.S. entities, we charge and collect an 11%\nexcise tax for all products sold into these channels. During the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized approximately $1.3 million and $1.2\nmillion respectively, in excise taxes. For ease in selling to commercial markets, excise tax is included in our unit price for the products sold. We record this\nthrough net sales and expense the offsetting tax expense to cost of goods sold.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nFair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to us as of June 30, 2024. The\nrespective carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair value. These financial instruments include cash, accounts\nreceivable, accounts payable, amounts due to related parties, and the construction note payable. Fair values were assumed to approximate carrying values\nbecause they are short term in nature and their carrying amounts approximate fair values or they are payable on demand.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for stock-based compensation at fair value in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 718 – Compensation – Stock\nCompensation (“ASC 718”), which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards to employees and\ndirectors. Stock-based compensation is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting periods and forfeitures are recognized in the periods they occur. We\naccount for common stock purchase option awards by estimating the fair value of each option award on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing\nmodel that uses assumption and estimates that we believe are reasonable. There were 155,129 and 390,111 shares of common stock issued to employees,\nmembers of the Board of Directors, and members of our advisory committee for services during the three months ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023,\nrespectively.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nAccounts at banks are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) up to $250,000. As of June 30, 2024, our bank account\nbalances exceeded federally insured limits, however, we have not incurred losses related to these deposits.\nIncome Taxes\nWe file federal and state income tax returns in accordance with the applicable rules of each jurisdiction. We account for income taxes under the asset\nand liability method in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 740 - Income Taxes (“ASC 740”). The provision for income taxes includes federal,\nstate, and local income taxes currently payable, and deferred taxes. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable\nto differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. We measure deferred tax assets\nand liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable amounts in years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or\nsettled. If it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recognized. In accordance with\nASC 740, we recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. We measure recognized income\ntax positions at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. We reflect changes in recognition or measurement in the period in which the\nchange in judgment occurs.\n14\nAMMO, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nContingencies\nCertain conditions may exist as of the date the condensed consolidated financial statements are issued that may result in a loss to us but will only be\nresolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. We assess such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of\njudgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against us or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, we\nevaluate the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims and the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought\ntherein.\nIf the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability is reasonably\nestimated, the estimated liability would be accrued in our condensed consolidated financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material\nloss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an\nestimate of range of possible loss if determinable and material, would be disclosed.\nThe Company also received notice in October 2022 that an OSHA whistleblower complaint had been filed with the US Department of Labor by an\nemployee that had been terminated for cause. The regulatory filing was received after AMMO refused to capitulate to the former employee’s demands. AMMO\nhas produced documents and submitted its position statement to OSHA and the matters is currently pending at the agency level.\nA former employee was terminated for cause who is seeking contract wages and stock that was earned but clawed back upon their termination. In that\ncase, the Company received a favorable ruling on a partial motion for summary judgment wherein the arbitrator ruled the employee had refused to return funds\nhe received as reimbursement for invoices he never paid. The arbitrator, thus, granted the Company’s partially dispositive motion. The remaining claims went\nto an arbitration hearing which was completed and the arbitrator ordered closing briefs, which the parties exchanged. On June 11, 2024, the Arbitrator entered\nan Arbitration Award in which found in the former employee’s favor of their contract claim, but against the former employee on their breach of the implied\ncovenant of good faith and fair dealing. The Arbitrator awarded the Company an offset for the invalid business expenses for which the former employee was\nreimbursed. The Arbitrator also ordered return of the shares to which AMMO claimed entitlement. The Arbitrator awarded the former employee severance\npayments, attorneys fees and costs, which the Company timely paid the arbitration award.\nOn April 30, 2023, Director and stockholder Steve Urvan filed suit in the Delaware Court of Chancery against the Company, and certain AMMO\ndirectors, former directors, employees, former employees and consultants. Urvan’s claims include fraudulent inducement, unjust enrichment and violations of\nthe Arizona Securities Act. The suit seeks a Court order for partial recission of the Merger and compensatory damages of not less than $140 million. The\nCompany received a declination of coverage from one insurer. With the assistance of counsel, the Company is investigating additional available actions\nconcerning that opinion, while continuing to pursue other available coverage concerning a separate policy. The Company and named defendants are in\nalignment in all material respects and reasonably believe at this date that Urvan’s claims are without merit. The Company has engaged Delaware Court of\nChancery litigation specialists to defend its interests in all respects in this case. The Company timely responded to the Urvan Complaint by filing a motion to\ndismiss. On August 1, 2023, AMMO filed a separate lawsuit against Urvan in the Delaware Court of Chancery alleging, among other things, that Urvan\ncommitted fraud in connection with the GunBroker.com sale, and that Urvan breached their indemnification obligations to AMMO after the sale. On September\n11, 2023, the Delaware Court of Chancery consolidated AMMO’s lawsuit against Urvan with Urvan’s lawsuit against AMMO and the individual defendants.\nOn September 18, 2023, AMMO filed an amended complaint that added a claim against Urvan for breach of the Arizona Securities Act. Urvan moved to\ndismiss AMMO’s complaint in full. On December 18, 2023, the Court of Chancery heard argument on the parties’ motions to dismiss in the consolidated\naction. On February 27, 2024, the Court issued an opinion resolving all pending motions to dismiss. The Court dismissed Urvan’s aiding and abetting claims\nagainst the individual defendants, but it declined to dismiss Urvan’s other claims against the individuals and declined to dismiss Urvan’s claims against\nAMMO. The Court rejected Urvan’s motion to dismiss AMMO’s claims against him in its entirety. On May 8, 2024, the Court ordered a case schedule\nculminating in a five-day trial on July 28, 2025. In the interim, discovery between the parties remains ongoing.\n15\nAMMO, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nOn December 6, 2023, Steve Urvan initiated a separate action against the Company in his capacity as director under 8 Del. C. § 220(d) to inspect\ncertain of the Company’s books and records (the “Books and Records Action”). In the Books and Records Action, Mr. Urvan alleges that the Company\nwrongfully refused to provide him with access to certain categories of documents following demands that he made on the Company on March 3, 2023, and\nNovember 9, 2023. The Company asserted as an affirmative defense that Mr. Urvan’s primary purpose for their demands is to obtain documents to support their\nclaims in the Delaware Plenary Litigation, in which discovery was then stayed, and to undercut AMMO’s positions before the SEC. The Court held a one-day\ntrial on February 26, 2024, in Georgetown, Delaware. On February 27, 2024, the Court in the Delaware Plenary Litigation issued an opinion that had the effect\nof lifting the discovery stay. On February 28, 2024, AMMO informed the judge presiding over the Books and Records Action that “[i]n AMMO’s view, the\n[Plenary Action] Opinion has effectively mooted this [Books and Records] action.” On April 9, 2024, AMMO began producing documents in response to Mr.\nUrvan’s demands pursuant to a Stipulation and Order Governing AMMO’s Document Productions. The Court has not issued a post-trial ruling and document\nproduction remains ongoing.\nOn January 18, 2024, Innovative Computer Professionals, Inc. d/b/a Digital Cash Processing (“DCP”) filed a civil action in Minnesota state court\nagainst Outdoors Online, LLC d/b/a Gunbroker.com (“Gunbroker”) for breach of contract (the “MN Action”). In the MN Action, DCP alleges that\nGunbroker.com breached a May 2021 contract, pursuant to which DCP was to provide specified digital payment processing services, and it alleges $100\nmillion in damages. On February 7, 2024, Gunbroker.com removed the MN Action to the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota. On\nFebruary 14, 2024, Gunbroker moved to dismiss the MN Action for lack of personal jurisdiction and for failure to adequately state a claim, or, in the\nalternative, to transfer the MN Action to the United States District Court for the District of Arizona (the “Motion”). The Court denied the Motion and\nGunBroker filed its Answer and Counterclaims. Gunbroker denies the allegations in the MN Action, and it plans to vigorously defend the claims asserted\nagainst it. The Parties’ initial disclosure statements are due to be exchanged in August 2024, after which the parties will engage in discovery. The Company\ndoes not feel as though it has a high level of risk exposure at this time.\nOn June 24, 2024 the Company entered into a Confidential Settlement Agreement and Mutual General Release (the “Settlement Agreement”) with\nTriton Value Partners, LLC, Donald Gasgarth, Paul Freischlag, Jr., Jeff Zwitter (the “Plaintiffs,” and together with the Defendants and the Company, the\n“Parties” or, individually, “Party”), and Steven Urvan and TVP Investments LLC (the “Urvan Defendants”) and Gunbroker.com, LLC, IA TECH, LLC, and GB\nInvestments, Inc. (the “Gunbroker Defendants,” and collectively with the Urvan Defendants, the “Defendants”) to fully resolve and settle all disputes and\nclaims related to the litigation between the Defendants and Plaintiffs captioned Triton Value Partners, LLC et al. v. TVP Investments, LLC et al., Cobb County\nSuperior Court, CAFN 18104869 (the “Action”). Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the GunBroker Defendants agreed to pay the Plaintiffs $8,000,000 (the\n“Settlement Amount”) in a single lump sum payment. AMMO agreed to tender the Settlement Amount to an escrow agent on behalf of the GunBroker\nDefendants within 45 days of the Settlement Agreement’s execution. Within five business days of the receipt of the Settlement Amount from the escrow agent,\nthe Plaintiffs agreed to dismiss the Action with prejudice, and the Urvan Defendants agreed to dismiss all counterclaims against the Plaintiffs with prejudice.\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement (as defined above), Urvan has the exclusive right to settle the Action on behalf of all Defendants and Urvan is obligated to\nindemnify the Company for certain liabilities, including certain liabilities incurred in connection with the Action. In connection with the Merger Agreement, on\nApril 30, 2021, the Company and Urvan entered into a Pledge and Escrow Agreement (the “Pledge and Escrow Agreement”), pursuant to which ten stock\ncertificates in the name of Urvan, with each certificate representing $2.8 million worth of shares of the Company’s common stock as of the date of the Pledge\nand Escrow Agreement (the “Pledged Securities”) were placed in escrow pending resolution of the Action. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, a portion of\nthe Pledged Securities in the form of a stock certificate for 2,857,143 shares (“Stock Certificate”) shall be sent to the Company’s transfer agent for cancellation\non the date and at the time the escrow agent releases the Settlement Amount to the Plaintiffs. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, at Urvan’s sole and\nabsolute discretion, he may elect to make the Settlement Payment instead of surrendering the Stock Certificate for cancelation. If Urvan elects to make the\nSettlement Payment, the Company agrees to release the Stock Certificate to Urvan, subject to certain conditions and limitations. Pursuant to the Settlement\nAgreement, each of the Plaintiffs and the Defendants provides mutual releases of all claims as of the Effective Date, arising from any allegations set forth in the\nAction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and the Gunbroker Defendants do not release any claims asserted against Urvan, and Urvan does not\nrelease any claims asserted against the Company, the Gunbroker Defendants or any individual or entity related to or affiliated with the Company.\nWe have accrued for contingencies totaling approximately $8.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 related to the Settlement Agreement,\nwhich resulted in $4.8 million recognized in Due from related parties (see Note 5) and $3.2 million in expenses recognized in Corporate general and\nadministrative expenses. There were no other known contingencies as of June 30, 2024.\n16\nAMMO, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 3 – LOSS PER COMMON SHARE\nWe calculate basic loss per share using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each reporting period. Diluted\nloss per share includes potentially dilutive securities, such as outstanding options and warrants. We use the treasury stock method in the determination of\ndilutive shares outstanding during each reporting period. We have issued warrants to purchase 1,668,830 shares of common stock. Due to the net loss\nattributable to common shareholders for the three months ended June 30, 2024, potentially dilutive securities, which consists of 200,000 of respective common\nstock purchase options were excluded, as a result of the treasury stock method, from the dilutive EPS calculation as the effect would be antidilutive. Due to the\nloss from operations for the three months ended June 30, 2023, potentially dilutive securities, which consists of 911 warrants and 9,090 equity incentive awards\nwere excluded, as a result of the treasury stock method, from the dilutive EPS calculation as the effect would be antidilutive.\nFor the Three Months Ended\nJune 30,\n2024 2023\nNumerator:\nNet loss $ (7,061,287) $ (1,093,033)\nLess: Preferred stock dividends (774,132) (774,132)\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders $ (7,835,419) $ (1,867,165)\nDenominator:\nWeighted average shares of common stock – Basic 119,105,502 117,713,805\nEffect of dilutive common stock purchase warrants - -\nEffect of dilutive equity incentive awards - -\nEffect of dilutive common stock purchase options - -\n119,105,502 117,713,805\nEarnings per share:\nLoss per share attributable to common stockholders – basic $ (0.07) $ (0.02)\nLoss per share attributable to common stockholders – diluted $ (0.07) $ (0.02)\nNOTE 4 – INVENTORIES\nAt June 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, the inventory balances are composed of:\nJune 30, 2024 March 31, 2024\nFinished product $ 17,519,027 $ 11,055,061\nRaw materials 27,630,691 24,158,244\nWork in process 9,567,991 10,350,029\n$ 54,717,709 $ 45,563,334\n17\nAMMO, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 5 – DUE FROM RELATED PARTIES\nAs a result of the contingency recognized for the Settlement Agreement described in the Contingencies section of Note 2, we have recorded a\nreceivable of $4,800,000 to recognize the value of shares to be returned to the Company upon the release of the Settlement Payment.

FSW may purchase from time to time\nthe Company’s Accounts Receivables with recourse on an account by account basis. The twenty-four month agreement contains a maximum advance amount\nof $5,000,000 on 85% of eligible accounts and has an annualized interest rate of the Prime Rate published from time to time by the Wall Street Journal plus\n4.5%. The agreement contains a fee of 3% ($150,000) of the Maximum Facility assessed to the Company. Our obligations under this agreement are secured by\npresent and future accounts receivables and related assets, inventory, and equipment. The Company has the right to terminate the agreement, with 30 days\nwritten notice, upon obtaining a non-factoring credit facility. This agreement provides the Company with the ability to convert our account receivables into\ncash. On June 17, 2021, this agreement was amended which extended the maturity date to June 17, 2025. On November 29, 2023, we provided FSW notice of\ntermination of the agreement. The agreement terminated on December 29, 2023. We did not have an outstanding balance on our Factoring liability as of the\nthree months ended June 30, 2023. There was no interest expense recognized on the Factoring Liability for the three months ended June 30, 2024. For the three\nmonths ended June 30, 2023, we recognized interest expense of $45,385.\nNOTE 8 – LEASES\nWe lease office, manufacturing, and warehouse space in Scottsdale, AZ, Atlanta and Marietta, GA, and Manitowoc, WI under contracts we classify as\noperating leases. None of our leases are financing leases. The Scottsdale lease has been extended through 2029 and does not include a renewal option.

The Loan\nAgreement specifies that Hiawatha may lend up to $11,625,000 to the Borrower to pay a portion of the construction costs of an approximately 160,000 square\nfoot manufacturing facility to be constructed on our property (the “Loan”). The first advance of Loan funds by Hiawatha was made on October 14, 2021, in the\namount of $329,843. We received advances of Loan funds approximately every month as our “owner’s equity” was fully funded into the ongoing new plant\nconstruction project. The Loan is an advancing term loan and not a revolving loan so any portion of the principal repaid cannot be reborrowed.\nAdditionally, on October 14, 2021, we issued a Promissory Note in favor of Hiawatha (the “Note”) in the amount of up to $11,625,000 with an interest\nrate of four and one-half percent (4.5%). The maturity date of the Note is October 14, 2026. Under the terms of the Loan Agreement, we are required to make\nmonthly payments of $64,620 which consists of principial and interest until the maturity date, at which time the remaining principial balance of the Loan would\nbecome due.\nWe can prepay the Note in whole or in part starting in July 2022 with a prepayment premium of one percent (1%) of the principal being prepaid.\nThe Loan Agreement contains customary events of default including, but not limited to, a failure to make any payments pursuant to the Loan\nAgreement or Note, a failure to complete construction of the project, a lien of $100,000 or more against the property, or a transfer of the property without\nHiawatha’s consent. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, among other remedies, the amounts due pursuant to the Loan can be accelerated, Hiawatha can\nforeclose on the property pursuant to the mortgage, and a late charge of five percent (5%) of the amount due will be owed with all amounts then owed pursuant\nto the Note bearing interest at an increased rate.\nWe are required to maintain a Debt Service Coverage Ratio, as defined in the terms of the Loan Agreement, of not less than 1.25 to 1.00 for the period\ndefined below and continuing to and including the Maturity Date. The Debt Service Coverage Ratio shall be tested on an annual basis, as of July 1, for each\nprevious year. We maintained compliance under the Loan Agreement since its inception.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2023, approximately $11.2 million of Loan funds were advanced including $1.0 million of cash collateral or\nrestricted cash as security for the Loan. We made $42,816 and $64,959 in principal payments for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023,\nrespectively. The restricted cash can be released per the terms documented in the Loan Agreement filed with the Commission as an exhibit to Form 10-Q on\nFebruary 14, 2022. During the year ended March 31, 2023, $500,000 of restricted cash was released with $500,000 remaining restricted.

During the three\nmonths ended June 30, 2024, the effective tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to employee stock awards. For the three months\nended June 30, 2024, the effective tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate due to state income taxes.\nThe Company has never had an Internal Revenue Service audit; therefore, the tax periods ended March 31, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 are subject to\naudit.\nNOTE 15 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nThrough our acquisition of Gemini, a related party relationship was created through one of our directors, Mr. Steve Urvan, by their ownership of\nentities that provided services to Gemini.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is provided to assist the reader in understanding the results\nof operations, financial condition, and liquidity through the eyes of our management team. This section should be read in conjunction with other sections of this\nQuarterly Report, specifically, our condensed consolidated financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis document contains certain “forward-looking statements.” All statements other than statements of historical fact are “forward-looking\nstatements” for purposes of federal and state securities laws, including, but not limited to, any projections of earnings, revenue or other financial items; any\nstatements of the plans, strategies, goals and objectives of management for future operations; any statements concerning proposed new products and services or\ndevelopments thereof; any statements regarding future economic conditions or performance; any statements or belief; and any statements of assumptions\nunderlying any of the foregoing.\nForward looking statements may include the words “may,” “could,” “estimate,” “intend,” “continue,” “believe,” “expect,” or “anticipate,” or other\nsimilar words, or the negative thereof. These forward-looking statements present our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this report. Accordingly,\nreaders are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the dates on which they are made. We do not\nundertake to update forward-looking statements to reflect the impact of circumstances or events that arise after the dates they are made. You should, however,\nconsult further disclosures and risk factors we included in the section titled Risk Factors contained herein.\nIn our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, references to “AMMO, Inc.”, “AMMO”, “the Company”, “we,” “us,” “our” and similar\nterms refer to AMMO, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries.\nOverview\nAMMO, Inc., owner of the GunBroker Marketplace, the largest online marketplace serving the firearms and shooting sports industries, and a vertically\nintegrated producer of high-performance ammunition and premium components began its operations in 2017.\nThrough our GunBroker Marketplace segment (acquired in April 2021), we allow third party sellers to list items consisting of firearms, hunting gear,\nfishing equipment, outdoor gear, collectibles, and much more on our site, while facilitating compliance with federal and state laws that govern the sale of\nfirearms and restricted items. This allows our base of over 8.1 million users to follow ownership policies and regulations through our network of over 31,000\nfederally licensed firearms dealers as transfer agents. The nature and operation of the Marketplace as an online auction and sales platform also affords our\nCompany a unique view into the total domestic market for the purpose of understanding sales trends at a granular level across all elements of the outdoor sports\nand shooting space. Our vision is to expand the services on GunBroker and to become a peer to those in our industry. Recent expansions we have made to the\nplatform are;\n● Payment Processing – facilitating payment between parties allowing sellers to offer fast and secure electronic payments and allowing buyers to\nexperience the ease of instant checkout.\n● Carting Ability – enables our buyers to checkout multiple items from multiple sellers in a single transaction. Our buyers are able to finalize one\ntransaction including both regulated and nonregulated items, while also affording them the ability to ship their purchases to more than one location.\n● GunBroker Analytics – through the compilation and refinement of vast Marketplace data, we offer e-commerce market analytics to our industry\npeers allowing them to better manage business strategy and planning. The analytics offering will be rebranded to Outdoor Analytics during fiscal year\n2025 to expand service offerings.\n● GunBroker Advertising – content creation for manufactures, email campaigns and banner ads are all part of our advertising offerings to the outdoor\nindustry.\nThrough our Ammunition segment, we are tailoring our focus of our manufacturing operations to the production of premium pistol and rifle\nammunition and supporting industry partners with manufactured components such as premium pistol and rifle brass casings. We will continue to leverage our\nflagship brands that are proprietary in nature like STREAK VISUAL AMMUNITION™ , /stelTH/™, Signature-on-Target, and HUNT and extend our product\noffering with premium rifle lines and brands that complement our technologically innovative heritage. We also continue to ensure dynamic performance under\nthe exacting standards of the U.S. military complex in support of our cutting-edge developmental ammunition programs as we seek out and effectively execute\nupon new governmental-based opportunities.\n25\nResults of Operations\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is intended to provide our financial statements with a\nnarrative from the perspective of management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and certain other factors that may affect our future\nresults. The following information should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report\nbeginning on page 3.\nOur financial results for the three months ended June 30, 2024, reflect our transition into our new operational strategic position, focusing on higher\nbrass casing production and sales. We believe that we have hired a strong team of professionals and developed innovative products to establish our presence as\na high-quality ammunition provider and marketplace. We continue to focus on building profitability through our rifle brass manufacturing. We experienced a\n9.6% decrease in our Net Revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared with the three months ended June 30, 2023. This was the result of\ndecreased revenue in both of our reporting segments due to changes in market demand as discussed below, and specifically for our ammunition division,\nchanges in pricing, and sales mix. We believe that the shift in our operational strategy focusing on higher brass casing production and sales negatively impacted\nour sales in the three months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023. Our focus on creating profitability is in contrast to\nrevenue growth.\nThe following table presents summarized financial information taken from our consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended June\n30, 2024, compared with the three months ended June 30, 2023:\nFor the Three Months Ended\nJune 30, 2024 June 30, 2023\n(Unaudited) (Unaudited)\nNet Revenues $ 30,953,550 $ 34,254,575\nCost of Revenues 21,164,428 20,230,035\nGross Margin 9,789,122 14,024,540\nSales, General and Administrative Expenses 19,465,461 15,703,467\nLoss from Operations (9,676,339) (1,678,927)\nOther income (expense)\nOther expense 55,710 488,750\nLoss before provision for income taxes $ (9,620,629) $ (1,190,177)\nBenefit for income taxes (2,559,342) (97,144)\nNet Loss $ (7,061,287) $ (1,093,033)\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe analyze operational and financial data to evaluate our business, allocate our resources, and assess our performance. In addition to total net sales,\nnet loss, and other results under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), the following information includes key operating\nmetrics and non-GAAP financial measures that we use to evaluate our business. We believe that these measures are useful for period-to-period comparisons of\nthe Company. We have included these non-GAAP financial measures in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because they are key measures we use to evaluate\nour operational performance, produce future strategies for our operations, and make strategic decisions, including those relating to operating expenses and the\nallocation of our resources. Accordingly, we believe that these measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our\noperating results in the same manner as our management and Board of Directors.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nFor the Three Months Ended\n30-Jun-24 30-Jun-23\nReconciliation of GAAP net loss to Adjusted EBITDA\nNet Loss $ (7,061,287) $ (1,093,033)\nBenefit for income taxes (2,559,342) (97,144)\nDepreciation and amortization 4,692,556 4,620,087\nInterest expense, net 196,522 204,201\nEmployee stock awards 606,199 822,797\nStock grants 68,750 50,750\nCommon stock purchase options 41,055 -\nOther income (expense), net (252,232) (692,951)\nContingent consideration fair value (19,986) (21,024)\nOther nonrecurring expenses(1) 6,249,893 2,759,726\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 1,962,128 $ 6,553,409\n(1) For the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, other nonrecurring expenses consist of professional and legal fees that are nonrecurring in nature.\nThere were $3.2 million in expenses related to the settlement contingency included in other nonrecurring expenses for the three months ended June 30,\n2024.\n26\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that displays our net loss, adjusted to eliminate the effect of certain items as described below.\nWe have excluded the following non-cash expenses from our non-GAAP financial measures: provision or benefit for income taxes; depreciation and\namortization; share-based or warrant-based compensation expenses; and changes to the contingent consideration fair value. Adjusted EBITDA as a non-GAAP\nfinancial measure also excludes other cash interest income and expense, and non-recurring expenses related to professional and legal fees as the nature of these\nitems are not components of our core operations. We believe that it is useful to exclude these non-cash expenses and non-recurring expenses because the\namount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations.\nNon-GAAP financial measures have limitations, should be considered as supplemental in nature and are not meant as a substitute for the related\nfinancial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. These limitations include the following:\n● Employee stock awards, stock grants, and common stock purchase options expense has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a\nsignificant recurring expense in the Company and an important part of our compensation strategy;\n● the assets being depreciated or amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and the non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect cash capital\nexpenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditures or other capital commitments;\n● non-GAAP measures do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; and\n● other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate their non-GAAP financial measures differently or not at all, which reduces\ntheir usefulness as comparative measures.\nBecause of these limitations, you should consider the non-GAAP financial measures alongside other financial performance measures, including our\nnet loss and our other financial results presented in accordance with GAAP.\nNet Revenues\nThe following table shows our revenues by the various categories that comprise our total revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and June\n30, 2023. “Proprietary ammunition” includes those lines of ammunition that we manufacture at our facilities and sell under the brand names “STREAK\nVISUAL AMMUNITION™” and “/stelTH/™”. We define “standard ammunition” as non-proprietary ammunition that directly competes with other brand\nmanufacturers. Our “standard ammunition” includes ammunition that we manufacture at our facilities as well as any completed ammunition that we acquire in\nthe open market for sale to others. Also included in this category is low-cost target pistol and rifle ammunition as well as bulk packaged ammunition that we\nmanufacture using reprocessed brass casings. Ammunition within the standard ammunition product line typically carries much lower gross margins than our\nproprietary ammunition.\nFor the Three Months Ended\nJune 30, 2024 June 30, 2023\nProprietary Ammunition $ 1,359,263 $ 1,154,802\nStandard Ammunition 12,000,291 12,951,227\nAmmunition Casings 5,312,005 6,236,344\nMarketplace Revenue 12,281,991 13,912,202\nTotal Sales $ 30,953,550 $ 34,254,575\n27\nNet Revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2024, decreased by $3.4 million, or 9.6%, from the prior year due to changes in market conditions.\nThis was due to the result of a decrease of $1.0 million in sales of bulk pistol and rifle ammunition, $1.0 million in our casing sales and $1.6 million in sales\ngenerated from our GunBroker Marketplace, which primarily consists of auction revenue, as well as payment processing revenue, and shipping income,\npartially offset by an increase of $0.2 million in sales of Proprietary Ammunition. We believe that the shift in our operational strategy focusing on higher brass\ncasing production and sales negatively impacted our sales in the three months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023.\nAdditionally, equipment malfunction related to rifle production in our manufacturing facility in Manitowoc caused lower production output contributing to\nlower sales results. Management anticipates an increase in ammunition casings sales as capacities come online in its new Manitowoc facility.\nThe opening in August 2022 of our manufacturing plant in Manitowoc, WI, grants us the ability to increase capacity based upon the needs of the\nmarket and through further expansion of our casing and loading lines and allow us to continue to expand distribution into commercial markets, introduce new\nproduct lines, and continue to initiate sales to U.S. law enforcement, military, and international markets.\nFor example, through our acquisition of SWK, the Company has developed and deployed a line of tactical armor piercing (“AP”) and hard armor\npiercing incendiary (“HAPI”) precision ammunition to meet the lethality requirements of both the U.S. and foreign military customers. We continue to\ndemonstrate our AP and HAPI ammunition to military personnel at scheduled and invite only events, resulting in increased interest and procurement\ndiscussions. The Company has since developed the ballistic match (“BMMPR”) and Signature-on-Target rounds under contract with the U.S. Government in\nsupport of U.S. special operations which have been publicly announced pursuant to governmental authorization. Additional work continues in support of the\nmilitary operations of the U.S. and its ally military components which is not currently subject to disclosure.\nIt is important to note that, although U.S. law enforcement, military and international markets represent significant opportunities for our Company,\nthey also have a long sales cycle. The Company’s sales team has been effective in establishing sales and distribution channels, both in the United States and\nabroad, that we anticipated will drive sustained sales opportunity in the military, law enforcement, and commercial markets.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of Revenues decreased by approximately $1.0 million from $21.2 million to $20.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared\nto the three months ended June 30, 2023. This was the result of a decrease in net sales as well increases to non-cash depreciation related to increases in\nproduction equipment, expensing of increased labor, and overhead used to produce finished product during 2024 as compared to 2023. Cost of Revenues for\nour ammunition segment consists of product cost and cost directly and indirectly associated with getting those products to a sellable state and for our\nmarketplace segment, consists of cost associated with facilitating transactions on the platform.\nGross Margin\nOur gross margin percentage, which measures our gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to 31.6% during the three months ended June 30,\n2024, from 40.9% for the three months ended June 30, 2023. This was a result of increased cost of materials, labor, and overhead in our ammunition segment,\nwhich was offset by our marketplace, GunBroker.com which, by nature has significantly higher margins than our manufactured products.\n28\nWe believe that as we grow ammunition segment sales through new markets and expanded distribution that our gross margins will continue to\nincrease. Our goal in the next 12 to 24 months is to continue to improve our gross margins. This will be accomplished through the following:\n● Capacity improvements at our manufacturing plant and expansion of our rifle casing and loading lines;\n● Increased product sales, specifically of proprietary and flagship lines of ammunition, like the STREAK VISUAL AMMUNITION™, /stelTH/™,\nSignature-on-Target, and HUNT all of which carry higher margins as a percentage of their selling price;\n● Introduction of new lines of ammunition that carry higher margins in the consumer and government sectors;\n● Reduced component costs through insourced operations of our ammunition segment and expansion of strategic relationships with component\nproviders resulting in cost savings;\n● Expanded use of automation equipment that reduces the total labor required to assemble finished products;\n● Vertical integration into tooling manufacturing and annealing of rifle cases that have previously been outsourced;\n● Better leverage of our fixed costs through expanded production to support the sales objectives\n● With the addition of the multi-item cart, the payment processing, we’ve adjusted our category fees for nonregulated items that will enable us to\nincrease our take rate across the platform as we enable cross selling;\n● And, we are growing our advertising sales, financing partnerships, and bringing shipping options to our community.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses consists of selling and marketing expenses, corporate general & administrative, and employee salaries and related expenses.\nOperating expenses increased by approximately $3.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023, and\nincreased as a percentage of sales to 62.9% from 45.8% for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This increase was primarily due to\nthe $3.2 million expenses recognized for the settlement contingency and a $0.3 million, or 8.4%, increase in employee salaries and related expenses during the\nthree months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023.\nSelling and marketing expenses consist of commissions related to our sales, as well as advertising and marketing expenses. During the three months\nended June 30, 2024, our selling and marketing expense remained constant primarily due to the varying volumes product sales affecting the amounts of sales\ncommissions.\nThe increase in our corporate general and administrative expenses was due primarily to the $3.2 million expenses recognized for the settlement\ncontingency and an increase of $0.2 million of nonrecurring expenses, consisting of professional and legal fees that are nonrecurring in nature.\nOther Income and Expenses\nTotal other expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2024, decreased by $0.4 million compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023. This\nwas primarily the result of $0.3 decrease in other income.\nInterest expense remained constant for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the prior year period.\nIncome Taxes\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded a benefit for federal and state income taxes of approximately $2.6 million and $0.1\nmillion, respectively.\nNet Loss\nWe ended the three months ended June 30, 2024, with a Net Loss of approximately $7.1 million compared with a Net Loss of approximately $1.1\nmillion for the three months ended June 30, 2023.\n29\nOur goal is to continue to improve our operating results as we focus on increasing sales and reducing our operating expenses.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of June 30, 2024, we had $50,754,570 of cash and cash equivalents, a decrease of $4,831,871 from March 31, 2024.\nWorking Capital is summarized and compared as follows:\nJune 30, 2024 March 31, 2024\nCurrent assets $ 133,953,188 $ 131,525,266\nCurrent liabilities 42,266,339 30,940,272\n$ 91,686,849 $ 100,584,994\nChanges in cash flows are summarized as follows:\nOperating Activities\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2024, net cash used in operations totaled $0.5 million. This was primarily the result of our net loss of $7.1\nmillion, increases in inventories of $9.2 million, accrued liabilities of $5.2 million, deposits of $1.0 million, and due from related parties of $4.8 million offset\nby decreases to our accounts receivable of $8.7 million. The cash provided by operations included the benefit of non-cash expenses for depreciation and\namortization of $4.7 million, deferred tax benefits of $2.6 million and employee stock compensation of $0.6 million.\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2023, net cash provided by operations totaled approximately $13.0 million. This was primarily the result of net\nloss of approximately $1.1 million, which was offset by decreases in our accounts receivable of approximately $7.1 million, decreases in prepaid expenses of\napproximately $0.9 million, and decreases in our accounts payable of approximately $1.7 million, increases in our inventories of approximately $1.6 million,\nand decreases in deposits of approximately $3.0 million. Non-cash expenses for depreciation and amortization totaled approximately $4.6 million and non-cash\nexpenses for employee stock awards totaled $0.8 million.\nInvesting Activities\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2024, we used $1.4 million in net cash for investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities consisted of\n$1.4 million related to purchases of production equipment, and capitalized development costs related to our marketplace, GunBroker.\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2023, we used approximately $1.3 million in net cash for investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities\nconsisted of approximately $1.3 million related to purchases of production equipment for our new manufacturing facility in Manitowoc, WI and capitalized\ndevelopment costs related to our marketplace, GunBroker.\nFinancing Activities\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was $2.9 million, consisting of $0.7 million of insurance premium note\npayments, $0.6 million of preferred stock dividends paid, $1.1 million used to repurchase shares of Common Stock pursuant to our repurchase plan, and $0.4\nmillion used in the repurchase of common shares.\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2023, net cash used in financing activities was approximately $3.3 million. This was the net effect of\napproximately $1.5 million used in our common stock repurchased plan, $1.0 million from insurance premium note payments, approximately $0.6 million of\nPreferred Stock dividends paid, and the generation of approximately $14.6 million from accounts receivable factoring, which was offset by payments of\napproximately $14.6 million.\n30\nLiquidity\nExisting working capital, cash flow from operations, bank borrowings, and sales of equity and debt securities are expected to be adequate to fund our\noperations over the next year. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of stock sales, bank financings, and related-party notes.\nThese sources have been adequate to fund our recurring cash expenditures including but not limited to our working capital requirements, capital expenditures\nto expand our operations, debt repayments, and acquisitions. We intend to continue to use the aforementioned sources of funding for capital expenditures, debt\nrepayments, share repurchases and any potential acquisitions.\nLeases\nWe lease three locations that are used for our offices, production, and warehousing. As of June 30, 2024, we had $2.3 million of fixed lease payment\nobligations with $0.5 million payable within the next 12 months. Please refer to Note 8 – Leases in our financial statements for additional information.\nConstruction Note Payable\nWe have financed a portion of our new production facility with our Construction Note Payable. We expect to make $0.8 million in principal and\ninterest payments within the next 12 months. The principal balance of the Construction Note will mature on October 14, 2026.\nRevolving Loan\nWe have obtained a Revolving Loan with Sunflower Bank, National Association (“N.A.”) for up to $20,000,000 in December of 2023. The proceeds\nmay be used for working capital, general corporate purposes, Permitted Acquisitions, to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Revolving Line,\nto facilitate our stock repurchase program and to fund our general business requirements. We have not made use of the Revolving Loan as of the date of this\nfiling.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of June 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect\non our financial condition, net sales, expenses, results of operations, liquidity capital expenditures, or capital resources.\n31\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Policies\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which\nhave been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements require us to make estimates and\njudgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, however actual results may differ from these estimates. We have\nidentified several accounting principles that we believe are key to the understanding of our financial statements. These important accounting policies and\nestimates require our most difficult subjective judgements.\nWe believe that certain assumptions and estimates associated with the valuation of allowances for credit losses, valuation of deferred tax assets,\ninventories, useful lives of assets, goodwill, intangible assets, stock-based compensation, and warrant-based compensation are material in nature due to the\nsubjectivity associated with them and have the greatest potential impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider the\nassumptions and estimates associated with these (as further detailed below) to be our critical accounting estimates. Please refer to Note 2 – Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies of our condensed consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31,\n2024.\nGoodwill\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not\nreduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. In testing for goodwill impairment, we may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to\nevaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If our qualitative assessment indicates that\ngoodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform a two-step impairment test. We test goodwill for impairment under the two-step impairment test by\nfirst comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative\nfactors indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference\nbetween the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value. We estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of\nfuture cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily on expected category expansion, pricing, market\nsegment share, and general economic conditions. Due to the declines in the value of our stock price and market capitalization in the year ended March 31,\n2023, we assessed qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the Marketplace segment is less than its carrying amount.\nThrough our analysis we determined our stock price and market capitalization decline it is not indicative of a decrease in the fair value of our Marketplace\nsegment and a fair value calculation using the discounted cash flows was more appropriate due to the operational performance of the reporting segment.\nAccordingly, the impairment of Goodwill was not warranted the three months ended June 30, 2024. As of June 2024, the Company has a goodwill carrying\nvalue of $90,870,094 , all of which is assigned to the Marketplace segment. However, it is possible that the book values of our Marketplace segment could\nexceed its fair value, which may result in the recognition of a material, noncash impairment of goodwill for the year ending March 31, 2025.\n32\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nOur market risks are similar to those disclosed under the caption “Quantitative And Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in Part II, Item 7A of\nour Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024 and filed with the SEC on June 13, 2024 and is hereby incorporated by reference.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(c) and 15d-15(e) under the\nExchange Act, as of June 30, 2024. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to\ndisclose in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as\nappropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures, and is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in\nthe SEC’s rules and forms.\nBased on this evaluation, and because of the material weaknesses described below, our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and\nprocedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level as of June 30, 2024.\nNotwithstanding the material weaknesses that were identified and continued to exist as of June 30, 2024, management believes that the financial\nstatements included in this report present fairly in all material respects our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the period presented, nor\nwere there changes to previously released financial results.\nMaterial weaknesses and management’s remediation plan\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, within the meaning of Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\n(“PCAOB”) Auditing Standard AS 2201, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of\nthe Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nInternal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting remained\nas of June 30, 2024:\nThe Company failed to maintain an effective control environment due to the following:\n● the Company failed to fully resolve identified segregation of duties conflicts with system access for designated business and IT users, thus related\nuser access review and application change management procedures around logging could not be relied upon for select Company systems.\n● the Company failed to maintain effectively designed Information Technology General Controls (“ITGCs”) in the areas of user access, application\nchange management, logical access controls, and segregation of duties for one of the Company’s third-party information technology system that\nsupports the Company’s financial reporting process.\n● the Company failed to effectively execute management review procedures to validate the completeness and accuracy of transactions and to clearly\ndefine and evidence the process used and criteria and judgment applied in performance of critical business activities.\n33\nManagement’s Remediation Initiatives\nWe have concluded that these material weaknesses arose because we did not have the necessary business processes, systems, personnel, and related\ninternal controls.\nIn response to the material weaknesses, management, with the oversight of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, has continued the process\nof, and is committed to, designing and implementing effective measures to strengthen our internal controls over financial reporting and remediate the material\nweaknesses. The Company is committed to ensuring that a proper, consistent tone is communicated throughout the organization, which emphasizes the\nexpectation that previously existing deficiencies will be rectified through implementation of processes and controls to ensure strict compliance with U.S.\nGAAP and regulatory requirements.\nOur third–party consulting firm that specializes in internal audit work, and more specifically internal controls over financial reporting work, has\nassisted management and will continue to assist management with our risk assessment of internal control over financial reporting as well as documentation and\ntesting of our internal control structure and evaluation of material weaknesses, with special focus on assisting management in the establishment and evaluation\nof proper segregation of duties procedures and monitoring and controls over ITGCs for the systems that support our financial reporting process. Specifically,\nwith the right compliment of accounting and finance team members now in place, our entire control environment is being evaluated for enhancement of our\ninternal controls over financial reporting.\nIn addition to the measures noted above, we have made progress in our remediation plan including the following items:\nWe continue to make enhancements to our control environment by improving guidance, communication of expectations, and importance of internal\ncontrols. The Company continues to hire personnel in key positions, and management continues to assess the hiring of additional personnel to ensure that the\nCompany has a sufficient complement of qualified personnel at the right levels, based on any identified gaps in personnel requirements.\nAs previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024, due to accounting system limitations, management is\nlimited in its ability to effectively design and implement general information technology controls around select systems that support the underlying business\ncycle controls. Management is planning an evaluation of a new accounting system during the current fiscal period for adoption in the next fiscal period. The\nnew system will allow management to effectively design and implement appropriate general information technology controls including enforced segregation of\nduties. Management has continued the rollout of IT remediation action plans, including developing an enhanced risk assessment process for third-party IT\nsystems and implementation of IT monitoring procedures. In addition, management will continue to evaluate organization structure and hiring of personnel,\nand enhancement of management review procedures to validate completeness and accuracy of transactions at the time of review.\nCommencing during the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, management, with the help of our third-party consulting firm, will perform walkthroughs\nof our key controls, including those that would be necessary to effectively remediate the existing material weaknesses. A walkthrough is performed to gain\ncomfort regarding the design effectiveness of the key controls. Based on our assessment of the walkthrough results, we will determine if our key controls have\nbeen designed effectively. Further assessments will be made of these controls to ascertain operating effectiveness, after which we will be able to determine if\nthe existing material weaknesses have been remediated.\nWhile these actions and planned actions are subject to ongoing management evaluation and will require validation and testing of the design and\noperating effectiveness of internal controls over a sustained period of financial reporting cycles, we are committed to the continuous improvement of our\ninternal control over financial reporting and will continue to diligently review our internal control over financial reporting.\nChanges in Internal Controls\nOther than the changes described above, there have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in\nExchange Act in Rule 13a-15(c) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended June 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are\nreasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n34\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1.
