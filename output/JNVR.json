Right now, we’re set on getting to cash flow positive through growth and controlled costs and I have to say, the year ahead looks very promising for Janover.\"\n\n**Financial Results**\n\nRevenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately $619,000 as compared to approximately $584,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of approximately $35,000, or 6%. Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased sequentially by approximately 40% compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024. We will focus our efforts on revenue growth, with an emphasis on our most profitable cohorts of customers. We will target increasing both our number of transactions closed and our revenue per transaction closed. During fiscal 2024, we focused on larger loan opportunities, which should increase our average loan size. With the acquisition of Groundbreaker and the recent launch of our Insurtech, an increasing portion of our total revenue will be recurring revenue, where we receive annual, quarterly, and monthly subscriptions, and annual insurance premium commissions. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024 approximately 22% of our total revenue was recurring revenue compared to 20% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. The company will continue to migrate our revenue to recurring and subscription revenue for the remainder of fiscal 2024 and beyond. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024 subscription revenue was approximately $134,000 compared to $0 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Subscription revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased sequentially by approximately 51% compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024 our annual recurring revenue (“ARR”) run-rate reached approximately $480,000, compared to no annual recurring revenue in the prior year. ARR increased sequentially by approximately 58%, which was approximately $303,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2024. ARR represents an annualization of our recurring revenue, which assumes a full year of revenue.\n\nNet loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately $471,000 as compared to approximately $1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of approximately $1.1 million, or 70%. Net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased sequentially by approximately 41% compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024. The reduction to our net loss was primarily due to significant cost cutting across the organization and one-time IPO related expenses and stock issuances for services in the prior year.\n\n![clipboard-image-1730908300.jpg](https://media.graphassets.com/MGXfn4uR7mC8KAKReJBS)\n\n![clipboard-image-1730908317.jpg](https://media.graphassets.com/rSvfU9isT5a6bDoN4hKI)\n\n![clipboard-image-1730908327.jpg](https://media.graphassets.com/ZhLrAH2TZmtFPdqahg4N)\n\n![clipboard-image-1730908343.png](https://media.graphassets.com/SVbN2nmcR1aV9hYpIunK)\n\n**About Janover Inc.**\n\nJanover is an AI-enabled platform that connects the commercial real estate industry.

The Company also plans to introduce a significantly more capable outbound AI application in Q4 2024 to actively reach out to and engage with potential insurance clients with large, sophisticated projects.\n\nBlake Janover, CEO of Janover, commented, “We continue to make significant enhancements to our AI platform as we rapidly advance towards our goal of becoming the premier one-stop shop for forward-thinking multifamily and commercial property owners. Our AI tools will improve closing rates and reduce costs while providing faster, smarter service to our clients compared to the ‘traditional way’ of doing things without losing the critical human touch needed when and where it’s needed. We believe we can continue to significantly advance our capabilities in Q4 2024. With over 100 million annual impressions on Google and a suite of products for the enterprising multifamily and commercial property owner and developer, we are committed to integrating insurance throughout our entire ecosystem. Furthermore, insurance brokerage is a high gross margin, recurring revenue business line that creates sticky and, in our case, happy customers. It is an important part of our strategy as we have become a multi-product enterprise delivering solutions to multifamily, commercial property, and small business operators, while driving our recurring and subscription-based business model.”\n\n**About Janover Inc.**\n\nJanover is an AI-enabled platform for commercial real estate transactions.

(Nasdaq: JNVR)** (“Janover” or the “Company”), an AI-enabled platform for commercial real estate transactions, today announced the launch of Janover Pro, an innovative subscription-based service that provides users access to a rich and dynamic dataset of commercial lenders through Janover’s user interface (“UI”). Additionally, the Company announces that it has signed up its first Janover Pro subscriber.\n\nJanover Pro offers unparalleled access to a vast network of multifamily, commercial property, and SBA lenders, including more than 10% of all U.S. banks, 35% of the top 100 credit unions, and over 1,000 additional commercial lenders. This comprehensive data set features major products such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, FHA, CMBS, life companies, debt funds, and a diverse range of other loan products and lenders. More importantly, it features banks and credit unions from every corner of the nation, with lenders directly providing first-party data to the platform which is regularly updated. Janover Pro provides detailed lender and originator credit box information and contact details, equipping users with the same tools and resources used by Janover’s professional advisors. This enables them to compete with the biggest names in the industry like JLL, Walker & Dunlop, CBRE and beyond. The service is generally available on a 3-year subscription basis, providing continuous updates and access to the latest lender information with many additional features planned that the Janover Capital Markets team already uses.\n\nBlake Janover, CEO of Janover, commented, “Janover Pro is a game-changer. We’re democratizing the data that has separated institutional debt shops from mom and pops and the small multifamily and commercial property operators, from the biggest players. Although it is currently in its infancy, we envision creating a platform akin to Costar for commercial loan origination. This fits squarely inside our box of migrating to subscription revenue and provides the deepest value we can to our clients. Our aim is to become the name that people trust in our industry for forward thinking solutions that drive real value. It also allows us to continue to provide the high touch, bespoke service that we have become well known for on the capital markets side. We think this addition fits like a glove.”\n\n“Janover Pro is another exciting milestone on our journey to operating primarily as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and recurring revenue business. This is only the beginning, as we continually innovate and expand Janover Pro's functionality to better serve our users' needs. Future updates will include features that our internal team is already successfully using such as the ability to create and share professional offering memorandums directly with lenders through the platform, advanced deal shopping, and more. We think there are some exciting opportunities to embed an AI commercial loan advisor right into the product as well. Our ultimate goal is to make the commercial real estate financing process as seamless and efficient as possible and make it available to everyone, Janover Pro is an exciting step on this journey,” concluded Mr. Janover.\n\nFor more information about Janover Pro and to subscribe, please visit [_pro.janover.co_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=n01qfdfvfgLcyWefDWy5UvxM_aT27Ldxp_VQfsKYDeUetWZJ8gZm9NBTWmeHy2AoEJYyxBu7Kavl9rFSADLusw== \"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=n01qfdfvfgLcyWefDWy5UvxM_aT27Ldxp_VQfsKYDeUetWZJ8gZm9NBTWmeHy2AoEJYyxBu7Kavl9rFSADLusw==\").\n\n**About Janover Inc.**\n\nJanover is an AI-enabled platform for commercial real estate transactions.

(Nasdaq: JNVR)** (“Janover” or the “Company”), an AI-enabled platform for commercial real estate transactions, provided a business update, and announced its financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\n**Q2 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * 7% sequential increase in revenue for Q2 2024 compared to Q1 2024;\n  * 20% of revenue from recurring and subscription revenue in Q2 2024;\n  * Groundbreaker Platform achieved profitability in Q2 2024, with over 200% quarterly increase in operating margin;\n  * Janover Insurance Group achieved profitability in its second month of operation, increasing total recurring revenue by more than 60% in May;\n  * $3.2 million in cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2024; and\n  * No debt on the balance sheet as of June 30, 2024.\n\n\n\nBlake Janover, CEO of Janover, stated, “While achieving single digit sequential growth in the second quarter of 2024, we drove an impressive 20% of our total revenue from recurring, high-margin software-as-a-service (SaaS) subscriptions and Insurtech commissions. With the acquisition of Groundbreaker, the recent launch of our insurance business, and our other AI and software products for real estate professionals; we will continue to migrate from transactional to compounding recurring revenue. Our AI technology has continued to drive impressive value within our organization, and we think it has exciting applications as a subscription service as well. Ultimately, we are a platform providing capital, technology and insurance services to multifamily and commercial property owners and professionals and occupy a very unique space in the market. I can confidently say that I have never been more excited about our future and the value we can drive for our customers and shareholders.”\n\n**Financial Results**\n\nRevenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, was approximately $441,000 compared to approximately $602,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in closed loans compared to the same period in 2023. Revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2024, increased sequentially by approximately 7% compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024. Additionally, 20% of our total revenue consisted of recurring revenue. Sales and marketing expenses for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, were approximately $414,000, compared to approximately $315,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. The majority of the increase can be attributed to an increase in compensation and benefits expense during the three months ended June 30, 2024, due to an increase in employees, compared to the same period in 2023. Net loss was approximately $805,000, or $0.07 basic and diluted loss per share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to net loss of approximately $398,000, or $0.06 basic and diluted loss per share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. Adjusted EBITDA loss was approximately $697,000, or $0.06 basic and diluted loss per share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to adjusted EBITDA loss of approximately $143,000, or $0.03 basic and diluted loss per share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA per share are non-GAAP financial measures (defined below).\n\n**About Janover Inc.**\n\nJanover is an AI-enabled platform for commercial real estate transactions.

D&O liability insurance is designed to protect the company’s board of directors and executive officers from personal losses if they are named in a lawsuit as a result of serving as a director or officer of a business or other type of organization. It can also cover the legal fees and other costs the organization may incur as a result of such a lawsuit.\n\nBlake Janover, CEO of Janover, stated, “We are excited to offer D&O insurance on our platform, building on our successful track record in solving difficult problems in complex markets. We believe we can leverage our expertise in building marketplaces and solving similar problem sets and apply it to D&O; a corner of the industry that is sorely underserved and perhaps more than occasionally overpriced.”\n\nThe introduction of D&O liability insurance marks a significant expansion of Janover Insurance’s service offerings. This move aligns with Janover Insurance’s strategic vision of becoming a one-stop-shop for all commercial real estate and business insurance needs. By broadening our portfolio, Janover Insurance aims to attract a wider range of clients and enhance the Company’s market position.\n\nBlake Janover added, “As we continue to grow and diversify our services, our primary goal remains to delight our clients with world class products they need, while transitioning to recurring and subscription revenues. The launch of our D&O liability insurance offering through our agency is a testament to our dedication to meeting the evolving needs of the market and providing unmatched value to our clients.”\n\nAbout Janover Inc.\n\nJanover is an AI-enabled platform for commercial real estate transactions. The Company seeks to revolutionize the commercial real estate lending market by making it hyper-efficient, transparent, and accessible to all rather than the few. Through the Company’s online platform, it provides technology that connects commercial mortgage borrowers looking for capital to refinance, build, or purchase commercial property, including, but not limited to, apartment buildings, to commercial property lenders. Borrowers include, but are not limited to, owners, operators, and developers of commercial real estate including multifamily properties and most recently, a growing segment of small business owners, which Janover believes represents a significant growth opportunity. Lenders include small banks, credit unions, REITs, Fannie Mae® and Freddie Mac® multifamily lenders, FHA® multifamily lenders, debt funds, CMBS lenders, SBA lenders, and more.

(Nasdaq: JNVR)** (“Janover” or the “Company”), an AI-enabled platform for commercial real estate transactions, today provided a business update, and announced its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024.\n\n**Q1 2024 Key Financials**\n\n  * 17% sequential increase in revenue for Q1 2024 compared to Q4 2023;\n  * 16% sequential increase in Small Business Administration (SBA) revenue for Q1 2024 compared to Q4 2023;\n  * Revenue per transaction increased 10% year-over-year for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024;\n  * 18% of the total revenue consisted of recurring subscription revenue in Q1 2024;\n  * $3.9 million in cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2024; and\n  * No material debt or other instruments on the balance sheet.\n\n\n\nBlake Janover, CEO of Janover, stated, “I am pleased to report that despite significant dislocation in the commercial real estate market, we achieved more than 17% sequential growth for the first quarter of 2024. This was due in part to the strength of our SBA business line, which experienced a sequential increase of 16%, as well as our focus on pursuing larger loan opportunities to enhance revenue per transaction. This strategy has resulted in a 10% year-over-year increase in revenue per transaction for the quarter ending March 31, 2024. Perhaps most importantly, approximately 18% of our total revenue consisted of recurring revenue in the first quarter of 2024 from software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) subscriptions. The acquisition of Groundbreaker in November 2023, a recurring revenue B2B SaaS platform for commercial property professionals, coupled with the recent launch of Janover Insurance Group (“Janover Insurance\"), positions us to significantly bolster recurring and contractual revenue for the remainder of fiscal 2024. We will continue to focus on improving revenue by focusing on larger loan opportunities and products per transaction, while moving towards more and more recurring, subscription, and contractual revenue offerings.”\n\n“We are cultivating a robust array of premium, tech-powered product offerings aimed at delivering maximum value and experience to our customers and ultimately our shareholders. Our product mix is increasingly comprised of high margin, recurring revenue products, including Groundbreaker and Janover Insurance (which renews annually), supported by our cutting-edge AI enabled platform. Additionally, our digital media assets include dozens of websites, generating over 100 million impressions annually on Google and facilitating tens of billions of dollars in loan applications each year. Our core multifamily, commercial real estate, and SBA finance marketplace round out our comprehensive suite of services. All of this is enabled by a team that provides world-class customer service and a team of expert advisors. We believe we have established a meaningful foundation and a highly scalable infrastructure, which we believe positions us well for future growth and real value to our shareholders in the years to come. I appreciate everyone that is with us on the journey during what we know is a challenged market. We’ve built something special here and I’m incredibly excited about where our new business lines combined with our current offerings will take us in the years ahead.”\n\n**Financial Results**\n\nRevenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, was approximately $411,000 compared to approximately $467,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in closed loans compared to the same period in 2023. However, revenue per transaction increased 10% due to the increase in loan size. Additionally, 18% of our total revenue consisted of recurring revenue. Sales and marketing expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, were approximately $416,000, compared to approximately $294,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. The majority of the increase can be attributed to an increase in compensation and benefits expense during the three months ended March 31, 2024, due to an increase in employees, compared to the same period in 2023. Net loss was approximately $964,000, or $0.09 basic and diluted loss per share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, compared to net loss of approximately $220,000, or $0.03 basic and diluted loss per share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. Adjusted EBITDA loss was approximately $837,000, or $0.07 basic and diluted loss per share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, compared to adjusted EBITDA loss of approximately $175,000, or $0.03 basic and diluted loss per share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA per share are non-GAAP financial measures (defined below).\n\n**About Janover Inc.**\n\nJanover is an AI-enabled platform for commercial real estate transactions.

We have provided reconciliations of adjusted EBITDA to net loss and adjusted EBITDA per share to earnings per share, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\n\nWe have included adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA per share, herein, because they are key measures used by our management and Board of Directors to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans, and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating adjusted EBITDA facilitates operating performance comparability across reporting periods by removing the effect of non-cash expenses. Accordingly, we believe that adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA per share provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and Board of Directors.\n"

Organic traffic is the number of website visitors that come from unpaid search engine results. Organic impressions represent the instances, as reported by Google, when a user sees a link to the website while conducting a search without the aid of paid advertising.\n\n“We are pleased to have surpassed the 100 million impression mark in a calendar year. It’s a testament to the anti-fragility of a marketplace and how market dislocations can add value to corners of the business,” said Blake Janover, Chairman, and CEO of Janover Inc. “Since inception, we've taken well over $200 billion in commercial loan applications, almost entirely through organic traffic from search engine optimization (SEO), which drives inbound applications at zero incremental cost to us. Moreover, we had more than 100 million impressions on Google. The increase in organic website traffic and organic impressions are a direct result of our successful SEO efforts and strategies as well as the nature of our business, which over the long term, we expect to benefit from market dislocations. These 100 million impressions contribute to our brand and its subsequent visibility which we believe will ultimately improve conversion rates as well.”\n\n“We’re modernizing financial services for entrepreneurial commercial real estate and small business owners and the first step of that process happens online.

(Nasdaq: JNVR)** (“Janover” or the “Company”), an AI-enabled platform for commercial real estate transactions, today provided the following letter to shareholders from the Company’s Chairman and CEO, Blake Janover:\n\n_To my fellow shareholders,_\n\n_Thank you for taking a moment to read my first shareholder letter to Janover public company investors. 2023 was a monumental year for us as a business and for me personally as the Founder & CEO of our company. I say our company because whether you own one share or, as is in my case, many, it’s ours. As long-term partners in this enterprise, we share in its successes and challenges together. I'm grateful to have you alongside me on this journey._\n\n_For those of you that don’t know, we are a small company with considerable ambitions, tackling one of the most significant industries in the world – commercial real estate. We have a track record of improving multifamily, commercial real estate and small business debt transactions by being fanatical about delighting our customers and executing on a sound, intelligent strategy. I personally navigated the Great Financial Crisis in the residential and commercial real estate finance space and have the scars and learnings that come along with that. Today, our team has built a resilient foundation to weather, and ultimately benefit, from macro-economic swings. I look ahead and clearly see billions of dollars of addressable market right ahead of us for the taking._\n\n_The past year was a whirlwind. Our colleagues at Sachem Capital (SACH) made a strategic investment in us, we listed on the Nasdaq, our stock price jumped on IPO day and then dropped precipitously, the Fed ran interest rates higher, commercial real estate liquidity seized up, banks collapsed, my daughter learned to ride a bike, we acquired Groundbreaker to begin our transition to recurring revenue, we pushed AI to its limits inside our business, there’s war in Israel and Ukraine and so the world spins._\n\n_None of our plans involve moderate growth, modest investor returns, or irresponsible spending (come by our office for freeze dried coffee served up on Amazon-purchased kitchen tables). While we are not proud of the 2023 top-line financials, we believe we are setting the stage for hitting an inflection point as we make strategic investments in technology and productive personnel. We outperformed many of our peers and incumbents in multiple categories while driving 100%+ growth for the second year in a row in our small business finance category, deploying ever improving AI into our operations, and scaling revenue per transaction on our platform by 54% in 2023. I don’t consider any one year (or certainly any quarter) a measure of our success or failure. I plan for this to be something we will be able to measure in decades. Our job is to create long-term shareholder value well beyond appropriate benchmarks by delighting our customers and fostering a culture of performance, service, curiosity and excellence. Sometimes this means sacrificing short term results for long term outcomes – in the case of 2023, it meant optimizing for building the most useful, scalable AI infrastructure while allocating valuable resources to listing our company and raising capital in a difficult market. We made these choices at the expense of building an army of junior sales associates which would have been the short-termism choice. We are long-term focused._\n\n_As the great mathematician Richard Feynman once said, “You can always recognize truth by its beauty and simplicity.” In that spirit..._\n\n_Our plan for 2024 is:_\n\n  1. _Attract more, new high-quality customers. [1]_\n  2. _Sell additional high-quality products that our customers want and need. [2]_\n  3. _Improve productivity per employee._\n\n\n\n_We aim to achieve these plans by engaging in the following activities:_\n\n  1. _Building referral partnerships and outbound [3] sales capabilities._\n  2. _Incubating, partnering or acquiring (M &A) to add or enhance valuable (primarily recurring) revenue products [4] to our mix._\n  3. _Scaling our AI and automation to improve per-employee productivity while obsessively focused on delighting customers and our KPIs; ensuring the right people are in the right seats._\n\n\n\n_There may very well be continued macro headwinds on the horizon. It’s been a “funny” thing to stand squarely at the intersection of commercial real estate, banking, and fintech at what seems to be such an inopportune time. We think this is in fact the most opportune time in decades to stand where we are. Warren Buffet said, “be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” It’s a nice time to be (thoughtfully) greedy._\n\n_Our organization will continue to build out a resilient mix of high-quality product offerings to drive value to our customers and as an extension, our shareholders.

          "url": "https://ir.janover.co/files/JNVR_Shareholder_Letter_2023.pdf",
          "content": "To my fellow shareholders,\nThank you for taking a moment to read my first shareholder letter to Janover public company investors.\n2023 was a monumental year for us as a business and for me personally as the Founder & CEO of our\ncompany. I say our company because whether you own one share or, as is in my case, many, it’s ours. As\nlong-term partners in this enterprise, we share in its successes and challenges together. I'm grateful to have\nyou alongside me on this journey.\nFor those of you that don’t know, we are a small company with considerable ambitions, tackling one of the\nmost significant industries in the world – commercial real estate. We have a track record of improving\nmultifamily, commercial real estate and small business debt transactions by being fanatical about delighting\nour customers and executing on a sound, intelligent strategy. I personally navigated the Great Financial\nCrisis in the residential and commercial real estate finance space and have the scars and learnings that come\nalong with that. Today, our team has built a resilient foundation to weather, and ultimately benefit, from\nmacro-economic swings. I look ahead and clearly see billions of dollars of addressable market right ahead\nof us for the taking.\nThe past year was a whirlwind. Our colleagues at Sachem Capital (NYSE: SACH) made a strategic\ninvestment in us, we listed on the Nasdaq, our stock price jumped on IPO day and then dropped\nprecipitously, the Fed ran interest rates higher, commercial real estate liquidity seized up, banks collapsed,\nmy daughter learned to ride a bike, we acquired Groundbreaker to begin our transition to recurring revenue,\nwe pushed AI to its limits inside our business, there’s war in Israel and Ukraine and so the world spins.\nNone of our plans involve moderate growth, modest investor returns, or irresponsible spending (come by\nour office for freeze dried coffee served up on Amazon-purchased kitchen tables). While we are not proud\nof the 2023 top-line financials, we believe we are setting the stage for hitting an inflection point as we make\nstrategic investments in technology and productive personnel. We outperformed many of our peers and\nincumbents in multiple categories while driving 100%+ growth for the second year in a row in our small\nbusiness finance category, deploying ever improving AI into our operations, and scaling revenue per\ntransaction on our platform by 54% in 2023. I don’t consider any one year (or certainly any quarter) a\nmeasure of our success or failure. I plan for this to be something we will be able to measure in decades.\nOur job is to create long-term shareholder value well beyond appropriate benchmarks by delighting our\ncustomers and fostering a culture of performance, service, curiosity and excellence. Sometimes this means\nsacrificing short term results for long term outcomes – in the case of 2023, it meant optimizing for building\nthe most useful, scalable AI infrastructure while allocating valuable resources to listing our company and\nraising capital in a difficult market. We made these choices at the expense of building an army of junior\nsales associates which would have been the short-termism choice. We are long-term focused.\nAs the great mathematician Richard Feynman once said, “You can always recognize truth by its beauty and\nsimplicity.” In that spirit...\nOur plan for 2024 is:\n1. Attract more, new high-quality customers.1\n1 Until recently, we’ve had one primary source of borrower-customers (“SEO”) and we’ve sold primarily one widget; a\nmultifamily, commercial real estate, and recently, small business loan into that market. “New customers” generally\nmeans new borrowers via direct referral, new channels and programmatic partnerships that are “up market” from\nwhere we are now in terms of loan size and revenue per transaction.\n2. Sell additional high-quality products that our customers want and need.2\n3. Improve productivity per employee.\nWe aim to achieve these plans by engaging in the following activities:\n1. Building referral partnerships and outbound3 sales capabilities.\n2. Incubating, partnering or acquiring (M&A) to add or enhance valuable (primarily recurring)\nrevenue products4 to our mix.\n3. Scaling our AI and automation to improve per-employee productivity while obsessively focused on\ndelighting customers and our KPIs; ensuring the right people are in the right seats.\nThere may very well be continued macro headwinds on the horizon. It’s been a “funny” thing to stand\nsquarely at the intersection of commercial real estate, banking, and fintech at what seems to be such an\ninopportune time. We think this is in fact the most opportune time in decades to stand where we are. Warren\nBuffet said, “be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” It’s a nice time to be\n(thoughtfully) greedy.\nOur organization will continue to build out a resilient mix of high-quality product offerings to drive value\nto our customers and as an extension, our shareholders. We see our portfolio as a valuable assemblage of\nassets including Groundbreaker (our B2B SaaS for investor management), Janover Insurance Group (which\njust received its licensing), our AI technology platform, and our digital media assets including a dozen\nwebsites generating more than 80M impressions a year on Google and tens of billions of dollars of loan\napplications annually, not to mention our core multifamily, commercial real estate, and SBA finance\nmarketplace. Ultimately, we plan to drive revenue per employee and per customer as we look forward to\ngetting back to cashflow5 positive (which we achieved from 2019 to 2021).\nAs a fellow shareholder, I encourage you to tell our story to the world; we’re small (for now) so many don’t\nknow about us. You can directly drive impact to our organization and we, in turn, will drive that impact\nback to you, our valued shareholder, by fanatically delighting our customers, day in, and day out.\nThank you for your trust and support.\nBlake Janover\nChairman & CEO\nJanover (Nasdaq:JNVR)\n2 We have a wonderful captive audience of high-net-worth real estate investors and business owners as well as more\nthan two thousand bankers (lenders) across the nation. We have the opportunity to introduce useful (recurring\nrevenue) products like commercial insurance, B2B SaaS and more; creating happier, more loyal, more profitable\ncustomers.\n3 Nearly all our business to-date has been through SEO and content marketing. We aim to expand that capability to\nmultiple channels.\n4 Building on the successful acquisition of Groundbreaker (the B2B SaaS platform we acquired in 2023) to efficiently\ntransition to recurring revenue. We see opportunity in commercial insurance and additional B2B SaaS products.\n5 Cashflow from operations"

I am passionate about the stock market and like to find companies that provide an opportunity for above-average returns on investment. Many small and microcap companies are doing amazing things, solving huge problems, making homes and job sites safer, providing services and products that make us more efficient, improving the quality of life, and positively impacting our health & environment. My vision is to bring together investors, consumers, influencers, and brand ambassadors who understand the benefits to humanity these companies represent. Our role is to make people aware of these companies and put them on the fast track to success. There is strength in numbers. We collaborate and drive awareness because it is the right thing to do. We increase the momentum of an adoption curve because these companies fill a need & have a positive impact on all of humanity. \n\n[Coya misinterpeted Clinical trial resuls equals opportunity43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmPvH_OOMes)\n\nShare\n\nInclude playlist\n\nAn error occurred while retrieving sharing information.
