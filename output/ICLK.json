(\"Merger Sub\"), a Cayman Islands exempted company and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of iClick and Amber DWM Holding Limited (\"Amber DWM\"), a Cayman Islands exempted company and the holding entity of Amber Group's digital wealth management business, known as Amber Premium (\"Amber Premium\"). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Amber DWM, with Amber DWM continuing as the surviving entity and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the \"Merger\"), and the shareholders of Amber DWM will exchange all of the issued and outstanding share capital of Amber DWM for a mixture of newly issued Class A and Class B ordinary shares of the Company on the terms and conditions set forth therein in a transaction exempt from the registration requirements under the Securities Act of 1933.\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/iClick Interactive Asia Group Limited\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2568555/image_5006331_38095984_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2568555/image_5006331_38095984_Logo.html)\n\n\"This merger represents a transformative opportunity to broaden our business portfolio by integrating Amber DWM's state-of-the-art digital wealth management solutions.

The Board also resolved to recommend that the Company's shareholders vote to authorize and approve the Transaction Documents and the Transactions when they are submitted for shareholder approval.\n\nIn connection with the Transaction, each of the shareholders of Amber DWM immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger is entering into a lock-up agreement with the Company pursuant to which they have agreed not to transfer the shares received in consideration of the Merger for a period of 12 months following the Merger closing.\n\nThe completion of the Transactions is subject to the satisfaction of closing conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, including, among other things, receipt of the Company's shareholder approval and regulatory/stock exchange approvals (if applicable). The Merger Agreement provides for a long-stop date if the Merger is not completed by June 30, 2025.\n\nWayne Huo, Chief Executive Officer and Director of Amber DWM, said: \"We are thrilled to embark on this transformative journey with iClick.

The Company will continue to focus on improving the financial performance and cash flows, while exploring strategic opportunities for broader business growth.\", said Mr. Jian Tang, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of iClick.\n\n\"We continue monitoring and evaluating operations and market trends proactively in order to optimize our business and enhance profitability. We have recently completed the disposal of our mainland China Enterprise Solutions business and demand side Marketing Solutions business. The results of these businesses are presented under discontinued operations.\"\n\n**First Half Year of 2024 Results on Continuing Operations:**\n\n**Revenue** for the first half of 2024 was US$14.2 million, compared with US$17.0 million for the first half of 2023. Revenue from Marketing Solutions declined to US$9.3 million for the first half of 2024, compared with US$12.7 million for the first half of 2023. It was resulted from our strategic contraction of lower margin and higher risk businesses, with weaker demand from clients on advertising spending due to uncertainty in the macro-economic environment. Revenue from Enterprise Solutions was US$4.9 million for the first half of 2024, improved from US$4.3 million in the first half of 2023 due to the increasing demand for digital transformation and services.\n\n**Gross profit** for the first half of 2024 was US$8.1 million, compared with US$9.3 million for the first half of 2023. With the effort of reducing lower margin and higher risk businesses, and a rising revenue contribution from the higher-margin Enterprise Solutions business, gross profit margin increased to 56.9% for the first half of 2024 from 54.6% for the first half of 2023.\n\n**Total operating expenses** were US$12.4 million for the first half of 2024, decreased from US$14.1 million for the first half of 2023. The change was primarily due to our cost optimization execution, which resulted in reduction of staff cost and savings on promotional expenses. The expected credit losses provision of trade receivables was also reduced because of our close monitoring of cash collection.\n\n**Net loss from continuing operations** was US$1.3 million for the first half of 2024, significantly improved from the net loss of US$10.3 million for the first half of 2023, mainly due to no impairment of equity investments in the first half of 2024, which we recorded US$5.6 million in the first half of 2023. Operating loss was reduced by US$0.6 million.\n\nNet loss from continuing operations attributable to the Company's shareholders per basic and diluted ADS for the first half of 2024 was US$0.12, compared with a net loss attributable to the Company's shareholders per basic and diluted ADS of US$1.01 for the first half of 2023.\n\n**Gross billing** 1 from continuing operations was US$23.1 million for the first half of 2024, compared with US$30.0 million for the first half of 2023, mainly as a result of our continued strategy of reducing lower margin and higher risk businesses, as well as clients' reduced advertising spending.\n\n**Net loss from discontinued operations** was US$5.1 million for the first half of 2024, compared with the net loss of US$18.3 million for the first half of 2023, mainly due to cost optimization, and gain on disposal of discontinued operations amounting to US$2.6 million in the first half of 2024.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the continuing operations of the Company had cash and cash equivalents, time deposits and restricted cash of US$70.2 million, compared with US$41.3 million as of December 31, 2023.\n\n**About iClick Interactive Asia Group Limited**\n\nFounded in 2009, iClick Interactive Asia Group Limited (NASDAQ: ICLK) is a renowned online marketing and enterprise solutions provider in Asia.
