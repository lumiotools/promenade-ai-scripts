Unless amended or extended by Trinity's board of directors, the Company expects the repurchase program to be in place until the earlier of November 7, 2025, or until $30 million of Trinity's outstanding shares of common stock have been repurchased.\n\nThe Company's board of directors authorized the repurchase program because it believes sustained macroeconomic pressures and other market factors may cause the Company's common stock to be undervalued from time to time, especially relative to the Company's performance and its peers, and that such repurchase demonstrates the Company's stability and strength, including the resilience and creditworthiness of its portfolio. The timing and number of shares to be repurchased will depend on a number of factors, including market conditions and alternative investment opportunities. In addition, any repurchases will be conducted in accordance with the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The Company has not yet been active in the repurchase program and there are no assurances that it will engage in repurchases, but if market conditions warrant, Trinity now has the ability to take advantage of situations where the Company's management believes share repurchases would be advantageous to the Company and to its shareholders.\n\n**About Trinity Capital Inc.**\n\nTrinity Capital Inc.

Effective yields generally include the effects of fees and income accelerations attributed to early loan repayments and other one-time events. They may also fluctuate quarter-to-quarter depending on the amount of prepayment activity.\n\nTotal operating expenses and excise taxes, excluding interest expense, for the third quarter of 2024 were $15.5 million, compared to $12.2Â­ million during the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to higher compensation associated with additional headcount and higher interest expenses associated with the credit facility with KeyBank, National Association (the \"KeyBank Credit Facility\").\n\nInterest expense for the third quarter of 2024 was $16.9 million, compared to $10.8 million during the third quarter of 2023. The increase is primarily due to increased borrowings and increased base rate under our KeyBank Credit Facility.\n\nNet investment income was approximately $29.4 million, or $0.54 per share based on 54.4 million basic weighted average shares outstanding for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $23.4 million or $0.58 per share for the third quarter of 2023 based on 40.1 million basic weighted average shares outstanding.\n\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, our net unrealized appreciation totaled approximately $8.9 million, which included net unrealized appreciation of $3.9 million from our debt investments, net unrealized appreciation of $2.0 million from our equity investments and net unrealized appreciation of $3.0 million from our warrant investments.\n\nNet realized loss on investments was approximately $13.9 million, primarily consisting of one debt position partially offset by realized gains from one equipment financing.\n\nNet increase in net assets resulting from operations was $24.4 million, or $0.45 per share, based on 54.4 million basic weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $16.8 million, or $0.42 per share, based on 40.1 million basic weighted average shares outstanding for the third quarter of 2023. Trinity's higher weighted average shares outstanding for the third quarter as compared to the same period in the prior year was mostly attributable to additional shares issued during the twelve-month period.\n\n**Net Asset Value**\n\nTotal net assets at the end of the third quarter of 2024 increased by 11.3% to $756.8 million, compared to $680.0 million at the end of the second quarter of 2024. The increase in total net assets was primarily due to net investment income exceeding the declared dividend, portfolio activity, and accretive ATM offerings. NAV per share increased to $13.13 per share in the third quarter from $13.12 per share in the prior quarter.\n\n**Portfolio and Investment Activity**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, our investment portfolio had an aggregate fair value of approximately $1,686.9 million and was comprised of approximately $1,269.7 million in secured loans, $305.1 million in equipment financings, and $112.1 million in equity and warrants, across 145 portfolio companies. The Company's debt portfolio is comprised of 80.0% first-lien loans and 20.0% second-lien loans, with 76.6% of the debt portfolio at floating rates based on principal outstanding.\n\nDuring the third quarter, the Company originated approximately $629.2 million of total new commitments. Third quarter gross investments funded totaled approximately $459.0 million, which was comprised of $254.5 million of investments in 11 new portfolio companies, $202.3 million of investments in 20 existing portfolio companies and a $2.2 million investment in multi-sector holdings. Gross investment fundings during the quarter for secured loans totaled $406.0 million, equipment financings totaled $39.2 million, and warrant and equity investments totaled $13.8 million.\n\nProceeds received from exits and repayments of the Company's investments during the third quarter totaled approximately $198.4 million, which included $100.4 million from early debt repayments, $56.8 million from normal amortization, and $41.2 million primarily from investments sold to multi-sector holdings. The investment portfolio increased by $253.1 million on a cost basis, an increase of 17.2%, and $262.0 million on a fair value basis, an increase of 18.4% as compared to June 30, 2024.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter, loans to three portfolio companies and equipment financings to two portfolio companies were on non-accrual status with a total fair value of approximately $22.2 million, or 1.4% of the Company's debt investment portfolio at fair value.\n\nThe following table shows the distribution of the Company's loan and equipment financing investments on the 1 to 5 investment risk rating scale at fair value as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands):\n\n**September 30, 2024** |  **December 31, 2023**  \n---|---  \n**Investment Risk Rating Scale Range** |  **Designation** |  **Investments at Fair Value** |  **Percentage of Total Portfolio** |  **Investments atFair Value** |  **Percentage of Total Portfolio**  \n4.0 - 5.0 |  Very Strong Performance |  $ 105,385 |  6.7 % |  $ 40,584 |  3.3 %  \n3.0 - 3.9 |  Strong Performance |  458,494 |  29.1 % |  277,867 |  22.9 %  \n2.0 - 2.9 |  Performing |  918,292 |  58.4 % |  805,730 |  65.9 %  \n1.6 - 1.9 |  Watch |  57,457 |  3.6 % |  56,740 |  4.6 %  \n1.0 - 1.5 |  Default/Workout |  22,201 |  1.4 % |  33,452 |  2.7 %  \nTotal Debt Investments excluding Senior Credit Corp 2022 LLC |  1,561,829 |  99.2 % |  1,214,373 |  99.4 %  \nSenior Credit Corp 2022 LLC (1) |  12,885 |  0.8 % |  7,704 |  0.6 %  \nTotal Debt Investments |  $ 1,574,714 |  100.0 % |  $ 1,222,077 |  100.0 %  \n  \n_____________  \n---  \n(1) An investment risk rating is not applied to Senior Credit Corp 2022 LLC.  \n  \nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company's loan and equipment financing investments had a weighted average risk rating score of 2.9 as compared to 2.7 as of June 30, 2024. Trinity Capital's grading scale is comprised of numerous factors, two key factors being liquidity and performance to plan. A company may be downgraded as it approaches the need for additional capital or if it is underperforming relative to its business plans. Conversely, it may be upgraded upon a capitalization event or if it is exceeding its plan. As such, the overall grading may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter.\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately $228.5 million in available liquidity, including $8.5 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents. At the end of the period, the Company had approximately $220.0 million in available borrowing capacity under its KeyBank Credit Facility, subject to existing terms and advance rates and regulatory and covenant requirements. This excludes capital raised by the JV and funds managed by our wholly owned RIA subsidiary.\n\nDuring the quarter, the Company issued and sold $115.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its unsecured 7.875% Notes due 2029 (the \"September 2029 Notes\") under its shelf Registration Statement on Form N-2, which amount includes the underwriters' exercise, in full, of their option to purchase an additional $15.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the September 2029 Notes. The September 2029 Notes began trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol \"TRINI\" on July 22, 2024.\n\nDuring the quarter, Trinity entered into an amendment to its KeyBank Credit Facility. Among other changes, the amendment and associated joinder agreement increased the commitment amount available for borrowing under the KeyBank Credit Facility from $350 million to $510 million, permits the Company to request an increased amount of commitments from a total of up to $400 million to a total of up to $690 million in maximum capacity, and extended the maturity date from October 27, 2026 to July 27, 2029.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, Trinity's leverage, or debt-to-equity ratio, was approximately 122% as compared to 114% as of June 30, 2024.\n\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, Trinity utilized its ATM offering program to sell 5,723,189 million shares of its common stock at a weighted average price of $14.07 per share, raising $79.4 million of net proceeds.\n\n**Distributions**\n\nOn September 18, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors declared a regular dividend totaling $0.51 per share with respect to the quarter ended September 30, 2024, which was paid on October 15, 2024, to stockholders of record as of September 30, 2024.

(Nasdaq: TRIN) (\"Trinity\" or the \"Company\"), a leading provider of diversified financial solutions to growth-oriented companies, today announced its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/Trinity Capital Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1248863/Trinity_Capital_v1_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1248863/Trinity_Capital_v1_Logo.html)\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * Record total investment income of $61.8 million, an increase of 33.2% year-over-year\n  * Record net investment income (\"NII\") of $29.4 million, or $0.54 per basic share\n  * Net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $24.4 million, or $0.45 per basic share\n  * 16.2% Return on Average Equity \"ROAE\" (NII/Average Equity)\n  * 7.1% Return on Average Assets \"ROAA\" (NII/Average Assets)\n  * Net Asset Value of $756.8 million, or $13.13 per share at the end of Q3\n  * Total gross investment commitments of $629.2 million\n  * Total gross investments funded of $459.0 million, comprised of $254.5 million in 11 new portfolio companies, $202.3 million across 20 existing portfolio companies and $2.2 million in the multi-sector holdings\n  * Total investment exits and repayments of $198.4 million, including $100.4 million from early debt repayments and refinancings, $56.8 million from scheduled/amortizing debt payments and $41.2 million from investments sold primarily to multi-sector holdings\n  * Total platform assets under management (\"AUM\") increased to a total of $2.0 billion, up 54% year-over-year\n  * 19th consecutive quarter of a consistent or increased regular dividend, with a third quarter distribution of $0.51 per share\n\n\n\n\"Trinity's record third-quarter performance is a testament to our team's focus on disciplined underwriting and proactive portfolio management,\" said Kyle Brown, Chief Executive Officer of Trinity. \"As an alternative asset manager focused on direct lending to growth-oriented companies, our robust systems and processes, combined with the continued growth across our five distinct business verticals, positions us to consistently deliver long-term value for our investors.\"\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Operating Results**\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, total investment income was $61.8 million, compared to $46.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The effective yield on the average debt investments at cost was 16.1% for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 16.7% for the third quarter of 2023. Effective yields generally include the effects of fees and income accelerations attributed to early loan repayments and other one-time events. They may also fluctuate quarter-to-quarter depending on the amount of prepayment activity.\n\nTotal operating expenses and excise taxes, excluding interest expense, for the third quarter of 2024 were $15.5 million, compared to $12.2Â­ million during the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to higher compensation associated with additional headcount and higher interest expenses associated with the credit facility with KeyBank, National Association (the \"KeyBank Credit Facility\").\n\nInterest expense for the third quarter of 2024 was $16.9 million, compared to $10.8 million during the third quarter of 2023. The increase is primarily due to increased borrowings and increased base rate under our KeyBank Credit Facility.\n\nNet investment income was approximately $29.4 million, or $0.54 per share based on 54.4 million basic weighted average shares outstanding for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $23.4 million or $0.58 per share for the third quarter of 2023 based on 40.1 million basic weighted average shares outstanding.\n\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, our net unrealized appreciation totaled approximately $8.9 million, which included net unrealized appreciation of $3.9 million from our debt investments, net unrealized appreciation of $2.0 million from our equity investments and net unrealized appreciation of $3.0 million from our warrant investments.\n\nNet realized loss on investments was approximately $13.9 million, primarily consisting of one debt position partially offset by realized gains from one equipment financing.\n\nNet increase in net assets resulting from operations was $24.4 million, or $0.45 per share, based on 54.4 million basic weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $16.8 million, or $0.42 per share, based on 40.1 million basic weighted average shares outstanding for the third quarter of 2023. Trinity's higher weighted average shares outstanding for the third quarter as compared to the same period in the prior year was mostly attributable to additional shares issued during the twelve-month period.\n\n**Net Asset Value**\n\nTotal net assets at the end of the third quarter of 2024 increased by 11.3% to $756.8 million, compared to $680.0 million at the end of the second quarter of 2024. The increase in total net assets was primarily due to net investment income exceeding the declared dividend, portfolio activity, and accretive ATM offerings. NAV per share increased to $13.13 per share in the third quarter from $13.12 per share in the prior quarter.\n\n**Portfolio and Investment Activity**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, our investment portfolio had an aggregate fair value of approximately $1,686.9 million and was comprised of approximately $1,269.7 million in secured loans, $305.1 million in equipment financings, and $112.1 million in equity and warrants, across 145 portfolio companies. The Company's debt portfolio is comprised of 80.0% first-lien loans and 20.0% second-lien loans, with 76.6% of the debt portfolio at floating rates based on principal outstanding.\n\nDuring the third quarter, the Company originated approximately $629.2 million of total new commitments. Third quarter gross investments funded totaled approximately $459.0 million, which was comprised of $254.5 million of investments in 11 new portfolio companies, $202.3 million of investments in 20 existing portfolio companies and a $2.2 million investment in multi-sector holdings. Gross investment fundings during the quarter for secured loans totaled $406.0 million, equipment financings totaled $39.2 million, and warrant and equity investments totaled $13.8 million.\n\nProceeds received from exits and repayments of the Company's investments during the third quarter totaled approximately $198.4 million, which included $100.4 million from early debt repayments, $56.8 million from normal amortization, and $41.2 million primarily from investments sold to multi-sector holdings. The investment portfolio increased by $253.1 million on a cost basis, an increase of 17.2%, and $262.0 million on a fair value basis, an increase of 18.4% as compared to June 30, 2024.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter, loans to three portfolio companies and equipment financings to two portfolio companies were on non-accrual status with a total fair value of approximately $22.2 million, or 1.4% of the Company's debt investment portfolio at fair value.\n\nThe following table shows the distribution of the Company's loan and equipment financing investments on the 1 to 5 investment risk rating scale at fair value as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands):\n\n**September 30, 2024** |  **December 31, 2023**  \n---|---  \n**Investment Risk Rating Scale Range** |  **Designation** |  **Investments at Fair Value** |  **Percentage of Total Portfolio** |  **Investments atFair Value** |  **Percentage of Total Portfolio**  \n4.0 - 5.0 |  Very Strong Performance |  $ 105,385 |  6.7 % |  $ 40,584 |  3.3 %  \n3.0 - 3.9 |  Strong Performance |  458,494 |  29.1 % |  277,867 |  22.9 %  \n2.0 - 2.9 |  Performing |  918,292 |  58.4 % |  805,730 |  65.9 %  \n1.6 - 1.9 |  Watch |  57,457 |  3.6 % |  56,740 |  4.6 %  \n1.0 - 1.5 |  Default/Workout |  22,201 |  1.4 % |  33,452 |  2.7 %  \nTotal Debt Investments excluding Senior Credit Corp 2022 LLC |  1,561,829 |  99.2 % |  1,214,373 |  99.4 %  \nSenior Credit Corp 2022 LLC (1) |  12,885 |  0.8 % |  7,704 |  0.6 %  \nTotal Debt Investments |  $ 1,574,714 |  100.0 % |  $ 1,222,077 |  100.0 %  \n  \n_____________  \n---  \n(1) An investment risk rating is not applied to Senior Credit Corp 2022 LLC.  \n  \nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company's loan and equipment financing investments had a weighted average risk rating score of 2.9 as compared to 2.7 as of June 30, 2024. Trinity Capital's grading scale is comprised of numerous factors, two key factors being liquidity and performance to plan. A company may be downgraded as it approaches the need for additional capital or if it is underperforming relative to its business plans. Conversely, it may be upgraded upon a capitalization event or if it is exceeding its plan. As such, the overall grading may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter.\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately $228.5 million in available liquidity, including $8.5 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents. At the end of the period, the Company had approximately $220.0 million in available borrowing capacity under its KeyBank Credit Facility, subject to existing terms and advance rates and regulatory and covenant requirements. This excludes capital raised by the JV and funds managed by our wholly owned RIA subsidiary.\n\nDuring the quarter, the Company issued and sold $115.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its unsecured 7.875% Notes due 2029 (the \"September 2029 Notes\") under its shelf Registration Statement on Form N-2, which amount includes the underwriters' exercise, in full, of their option to purchase an additional $15.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the September 2029 Notes. The September 2029 Notes began trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol \"TRINI\" on July 22, 2024.\n\nDuring the quarter, Trinity entered into an amendment to its KeyBank Credit Facility. Among other changes, the amendment and associated joinder agreement increased the commitment amount available for borrowing under the KeyBank Credit Facility from $350 million to $510 million, permits the Company to request an increased amount of commitments from a total of up to $400 million to a total of up to $690 million in maximum capacity, and extended the maturity date from October 27, 2026 to July 27, 2029.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, Trinity's leverage, or debt-to-equity ratio, was approximately 122% as compared to 114% as of June 30, 2024.\n\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, Trinity utilized its ATM offering program to sell 5,723,189 million shares of its common stock at a weighted average price of $14.07 per share, raising $79.4 million of net proceeds.\n\n**Distributions**\n\nOn September 18, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors declared a regular dividend totaling $0.51 per share with respect to the quarter ended September 30, 2024, which was paid on October 15, 2024, to stockholders of record as of September 30, 2024. The Board of Directors generally determines and announces the Company's dividend distribution on a quarterly basis.\n\n**Recent Developments**\n\nOn October 29, 2024, the Company issued (i) $55.5 million in the aggregate principal amount of 7.54% Series A Senior Notes, Tranche A, due October 29, 2027 (the \"Series A 2027 Notes\"), (ii) $73.0 million in the aggregate principal amount of 7.60% Series A Senior Notes, Tranche B, due October 29, 2028 (the \"Series A 2028 Notes\") and (iii) $14.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.66% Series A Senior Notes, Tranche C, due October 29, 2029 (the \"Series A 2029 Notes\" and, together with the Series A 2027 Notes and Series A 2028 Notes, collectively, the \"Series A Notes\") to certain qualified institutional investors in a private placement.\n\nFor the period from October 1, 2024 to October 29, 2024, the Company issued and sold 1,243,121 shares of its common stock at a weighted-average price of $13.77 per share and raised $16.8 million of net proceeds after deducting commissions to the sales agents on shares sold under the ATM program.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nTrinity Capital will hold a conference call to discuss its third quarter 2024 financial results at 8:00 a.m. Pacific Time (11:00 a.m. Eastern Time) on Wednesday, October 30, 2024.\n\nTo listen to the call, please dial (800) 267-6316, or (203) 518-9783 internationally, and reference Conference ID: TRINQ324 if asked, approximately 10 minutes prior to the start of the call.\n\nA taped replay will be made available approximately two hours after the conclusion of the call and will remain available for seven days.
