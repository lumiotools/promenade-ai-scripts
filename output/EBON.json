Reports Unaudited Financial Results for the First Six Months of Fiscal Year 2024\n\nAugust 23, 2024 \n\n[PDF Version](/node/7286/pdf)\n\nSINGAPORE, Aug. 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ebang International Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: EBON, the “Company,” “we” or “our”), today announced its unaudited financial results for the first six months of fiscal year 2024.\n\n**Operational and Financial Highlights for the First Six Months of Fiscal Year 2024**\n\n**Total net revenues** in the first six months of 2024 were US$2.11 million, representing a 37.41% period-over-period decrease from US$3.38 million in the same period of 2023.\n\n**Gross profit** in the first six months of 2024 was US$0.08 million compared to the gross profit of US$0.28 million in the same period of 2023.\n\n**Net loss** in the first six months of 2024 was US$6.65 million compared to US$8.38 million in the same period of 2023.\n\nDong Hu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, commented, “Our financial results for the first half of 2024 reflect our continuing efforts to transition our business while we expand our products and services into industries that we believe will be supported by our existing core technologies, R&D expertise and manufacturing capacity. We are pleased with the progress that we have been able to make, particularly as we have faced and will continue to face challenges from macroeconomic conditions, policy changes, market fluctuations, evolving or shifting trends, and competition within the industry, that contributed to both highlights and downturns in our financial performance. We have been reflecting on our strengths and core competencies and experience in design, R&D and manufacturing and determined that there was an unmet need in the renewable energy space for us to exploit, where we aim to integrate cutting-edge technology into this market, with a particular focus on advanced solar cell manufacturing.”\n\nContinued Mr. Hu: “We believe that this year will mark a significant turning point for us where we build on past achievements and monetize our prior efforts. The transition will begin paying off now that we have commenced our strategic entry into the renewable energy sector. Our past experiences have equipped us with invaluable expertise in R&D and manufacturing, forming the core of our competitive advantage. These advanced professional skills and substantial technological reserves have become our foundation for mutual learning and collaboration across various industries. We are resolute in our belief that opportunities and challenges coexist and are committed to actively expanding new business areas and commercial models while maintaining strict control over operational costs to ensure the Company’s sustainable and stable development. We believe that through technological innovation, we can stand out and meet the ever-growing and evolving market demands for this new industry sector we’re pursuing, i.e. renewable energy production, and contribute to the betterment of our planet and future.” \n\n**Unaudited Financial Results for the First Six Months of Fiscal Year 2024**\n\n**Total net revenues** in the first six months of 2024 were US$2.11 million, representing a 37.41% period-over-period decrease from US$3.38 million in the same period of 2023. The period-over-period decrease in total net revenues was due to changes in the market condition in the first six months of 2024, which resulted in a decrease in service revenue and product revenue in the first six months of 2024 as compared to the same period of 2023.\n\n**Cost of revenues** in the first six months of 2024 was US$2.03 million, representing a 34.32% period-over-period decrease from US$3.09 million in the same period of 2023. The period-over-period decrease in cost of revenues was mainly due to the impact of a decrease in impairment cost in relation to products for the first six months of 2024, compared to the same period in 2023.\n\n**Gross profit** in the first six months of 2024 was US$0.08 million, compared to the gross profit of US$0.28 million in the same period of 2023.\n\n**Total operating expenses** in the first six months of 2024 were US$12.50 million compared to US$13.64 million in the same period of 2023.\n\n  * **Selling expenses** in the first six months of 2024 were US$0.66 million compared to US$0.75 million in the same period of 2023. The period-over-period decrease in selling expenses was mainly caused by decreased general advertising and marketing expenses related to our Fintech business for the first six months of 2024.\n  * **General and administrative expenses** in the first six months of 2024 were US$11.84 million compared to US$12.89 million in the same period of 2023. The period-over-period decrease in general and administrative expenses was mainly due to our optimization and streamlining of business operations, including resource allocation, cost, and expense control.\n\n\n\n**Loss from operations** in the first six months of 2024 was US$12.42 million compared to US$13.35 million in the same period of 2023.\n\n**Interest income** in the first six months of 2024 was US$6.04 million compared to US$3.22 million in the same period of 2023. The period-over-period increase in interest income was mainly caused by an increase in interest rate for US dollar deposits and the Company had more fixed-term deposit with large principals for the first six months of 2024, compared to the same period in 2023.\n\n**Other income** in the first six months of 2024 was US$0.33 million compared to US$1.04 million in the same period of 2023. The period-over-period decrease in other income was mainly due to the Company taking possession of customer deposits collected from previous years as a result of defaults by customers under their respective contracts with the Company for the first six months of 2023, while no such event occurred in the first six months of 2024.\n\n**Other expense** in the first six months of 2024 was US$0.06 million compared to US$0.04 million in the same period of 2023.\n\n**Net loss** in the first six months of 2024 was US$6.65 million compared to US$8.38 million in the same period of 2023.\n\n**Net loss attributable to Ebang International Holdings Inc.** in the first six months of 2024 was US$6.23 million compared to US$7.82 million in the same period of 2023.\n\n**Basic and diluted net loss per share** in the first six months of 2024 were both US$0.99 compared to US$1.25 in the same period of 2023.\n\n**About Ebang International Holdings Inc.**\n\nEbang International Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: EBON) is a global blockchain technology and Fintech company with strong application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chip design and manufacturing capability.

(Nasdaq: EBON, the “Company,” “we” or “our”), a global blockchain technology and Fintech company, today announced its financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n**Operational and Financial Highlights for Fiscal Year 2023**\n\n**Total net revenues** in the 2023 fiscal year decreased by 85.0% to US$4.9 million, from US$32.3 million in the 2022 fiscal year.\n\n**Gross loss** in the 2023 fiscal year was US$16.7 million, compared to a gross profit of US$15.4 million in the 2022 fiscal year.\n\n**Net loss** in the 2023 fiscal year was US$38.0 million, compared to US$45.8 million in the 2022 fiscal year.\n\nMr. Dong Hu, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, commented, “Opportunities and challenges have coexisted since 2023; however, the approval and listing of spot Bitcoin ETFs have given us a glimpse of a promising future for the cryptocurrency market. The strengthening of Fintech regulatory systems and regimes has made our commitment to compliance mechanisms unwavering. Despite the fluctuations in the industry and the impact of the macroeconomic environment, we remain true to our original aspiration, and strive to develop and improve our global Fintech businesses. As for the 2023 fiscal year, our revenue generated from our cryptocurrency exchange and cross-border payment and foreign exchange businesses increased by approximately 36% as compared to the 2022 fiscal year. In the future, we will continue to promote innovation in products and technologies, make real-time adjustments to business strategies in response to the constantly changing market environments, streamline costs and expenses, enhance capital utilization, and prepare for new opportunities in the market.”\n\n**Financial Results for Fiscal Year 2023**\n\n**Total net revenues** in the 2023 fiscal year decreased by 85.0% to US$4.9 million, from US$32.3 million in the 2022 fiscal year, primarily due to: (1) the bankruptcy of virtual currency banks in the United States and the exposure of certain fraud incidents on international trading platforms, which led market participants to become increasingly cautious about cryptocurrency related products and services in 2023; and (2) the absence in 2023 of revenue derived from a one-time payment corresponding to the recognition of RMB173.4 million in revenue in 2022 following our receipt of RMB173.4 million (approximately US$25.8 million), a one-time payment from two former customers as a result of court mediations.\n\n**Cost of revenues** in the 2023 fiscal year increased by 27.4% to US$21.6 million, from US$16.9 million in the 2022 fiscal year, which is primarily due to a VAT recoverable impairment of US$16.7 million, which was recognized in cost of revenue in the 2023 fiscal year as it is expected that VAT will not be recovered in the foreseeable future; and offset by decrease of inventory impairment from US$6.5 million in the 2022 fiscal year to US$0.3 million in the 2023 fiscal year.\n\n**Gross loss** in the 2023 fiscal year was US$16.7 million, compared to a gross profit of US$15.4 million in the 2022 fiscal year.\n\n**Total operating expenses** in the 2023 fiscal year decreased by 41.7% to US$36.9 million, from US$63.4 million in the 2022 fiscal year, primarily due to decreases in both selling expenses and general and administrative expenses.\n\n  * **Selling expenses** in the 2023 fiscal year decreased by 3.2% to US$1.9 million, from US$2.0 million in the 2022 fiscal year, mainly due to decreased advertising and marketing expenses related to our Fintech businesses.\n  * **General and administrative expenses** in the 2023 fiscal year decreased by 28.7% to US$29.0 million, from US$40.7 million in the 2022 fiscal year, primarily due to decreases in amortization expenses and stock-based compensation expenses.\n  * **Impairment of intangible assets** in the 2023 fiscal year was US$3.7 million. The US$3.7 million was related to an impairment loss charge on a financial license in the 2023 fiscal year.\n  * **Impairment of goodwill** in the 2023 fiscal year was US$2.3 million. The Company didn’t have impairment of goodwill in the 2022 fiscal year.

Reports Unaudited Financial Results for the First Six Months of Fiscal Year 2023\n\nAugust 25, 2023 \n\n[PDF Version](/node/7236/pdf)\n\nSINGAPORE, Aug. 25, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ebang International Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: EBON, the “Company,” “we” or “our”), a global blockchain technology and Fintech company, today announced its unaudited financial results for the first six months of fiscal year 2023.\n\n**Operational and Financial Highlights for the First Six Months of Fiscal Year 2023**\n\n**Total net revenues** in the first six months of 2023 were US$4.09 million, representing an 83.69% period-over-period decrease from US$25.06 million in the same period of 2022.\n\n**Gross profit** in the first six months of 2023 was US$0.99 million compared to the gross profit of US$14.24 million in the same period of 2022.\n\n**Net loss** in the first six months of 2023 was US$8.38 million compared to US$10.92 million in the same period of 2022.\n\nMr. Dong Hu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, commented, “The first half of 2023 was a challenging period. Industry fluctuations and macroeconomic impacts have not yet led to a qualitative improvement in our performance, our cryptocurrency exchange business and cross-border payment and foreign exchange business have been developing steadily. Still, we have seen signs of gradual stability in consumer demand and the prospects for a sustainable economic market. We will continue to focus on providing personalized and diversified technology platforms and services, so that our customers can enjoy safer and more stable, efficient, and sustainable products and services, and we will continue to strive for customer satisfaction. Additionally, we have improved our cost control and capital utilization.”\n\nMr. Hu continues, “Looking forward to the future, we will continue to expand our business within selected regulated markets, adhere to technological innovation as our core driving force, develop and implement a new business strategy to achieve consistent growth, and actively embrace various opportunities while tackling challenges in the future. We are confident in our long-term prospects.” \n\n**Unaudited Financial Results for the First Six Months of Fiscal Year 2023**\n\n**Total net revenues** in the first six months of 2023 were US$4.09 million, representing an 83.69% period-over-period decrease from US$25.06 million in the same period of 2022. The period-over-period decrease in total net revenues was due to the combined impact of: 1) a decrease in sale of products in the first six months of 2023; and 2) the receipt of payment from a former customer as a result of a court mediation in the first six months of 2022.\n\n**Cost of revenues** in the first six months of 2023 was US$3.09 million, representing a 71.40% period-over-period decrease from US$10.82 million in the same period of 2022. The period-over-period decrease in cost of revenues was mainly due to the combined impact of a decrease in the Company’s sales of products, and decreased inventory write-downs for the potentially obsolete and slow-moving inventories for the first six months of 2023, compared to the same period in 2022.\n\n**Gross profit** in the first six months of 2023 was US$0.99 million, compared to the gross profit of US$14.24 million in the same period of 2022.\n\n**Total operating expenses** in the first six months of 2023 were US$13.64 million compared to US$24.59 million in the same period of 2022.\n\n  * **Selling expenses** in the first six months of 2023 were US$0.75 million compared to US$1.69 million in the same period of 2022. The period-over-period decrease in selling expenses was mainly caused by decreased general advertising and marketing expenses due to the adoption of precise advertising and other marketing methods related to our Fintech business for the first six months of 2023.\n  * **General and administrative expenses** in the first six months of 2023 were US$12.89 million compared to US$22.90 million in the same period of 2022. The period-over-period decrease in general and administrative expenses was mainly due to the combined impact of 1) the Company’s optimization of its internal cost control; 2) lower bad debt expenses and depreciation expenses; 3) lower amortization expenses due to full impairment of intangible assets during the year of 2022.\n\n\n\n**Loss from operations** in the first six months of 2023 was US$12.64 million compared to US$10.34 million in the same period of 2022.\n\n**Interest income** in the first six months of 2023 was US$3.22 million compared to US$1.16 million in the same period of 2022. The period-over-period increase in interest income was mainly caused by an increase in interest rate for US dollar deposits and the Company had more fixed-term deposit with large principals for the first six months of 2023, compared to the same period in 2022.\n\n**Other income** in the first six months of 2023 was US$1.04 million compared to US$0.57 million in the same period of 2022. The period-over-period increase in other income was mainly due to the Company taking possession of customer deposits collected from previous years as a result of defaults by customers under their respective contracts with the Company.\n\n**Other expense** in the first six months of 2023 was US$0.04 million compared to US$0.39 million in the same period of 2022.\n\n**Net loss** in the first six months of 2023 was US$8.38 million compared to US$10.92 million in the same period of 2022.\n\n**Net loss attributable to Ebang International Holdings Inc.** in the first six months of 2023 was US$7.82 million compared to US$10.08 million in the same period of 2022.\n\n**Basic and diluted net loss per share** in the first six months of 2023 were both US$1.25 compared to US$1.61 in the same period of 2022.\n\n**About Ebang International Holdings Inc.**\n\nEbang International Holdings Inc. is a global blockchain technology and Fintech company with strong application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chip design capability. With years of industry experience and expertise, it has become a global Bitcoin mining machine producer.

(Nasdaq: EBON, the “Company,” “we” or “our”), a global blockchain technology and Fintech company, today announced its financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.\n\n**Operational and Financial Highlights for Fiscal Year 2022**\n\n**Total computing power sold** in fiscal year 2022 was 0.41 million Thash/s, representing a year-over-year decrease of 72.27% from 1.47 million Thash/s in fiscal year 2021.\n\n**Total net revenues** in fiscal year 2022 were US$32.33 million, representing a 37.17% year-over-year decrease from US$51.45 million in fiscal year 2021.\n\n**Gross profit** in fiscal year 2022 was US$15.41 million compared to the gross profit of US$29.22 million in fiscal year 2021.\n\n**Net loss** in fiscal year 2022 was US$45.76 million compared to net income of US$2.77 million in fiscal year 2021.\n\nMr. Dong Hu, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, commented, “In the past year, we have been committed to expanding our global Fintech business. While our cryptocurrency exchange, cross-border payment and foreign exchange business are in their infancy due to the well-publicized industry volatility and the macroeconomic environment, we continue to believe in the future prospects of blockchain technology and Fintech industry generally. As these business lines develop beyond their infancy, we expect to distinguish ourselves from other industry participants by prioritizing the expansion of our business within a sound regulatory system, providing quality online trading services to our customers, and striving to improve the protection mechanism for safety, reliability and compliance. We are confident in the various opportunities and challenges ahead, and at the same time, as always, we adhere to Fintech as our core driver to continuously launch diversified products and services.”\n\n**Financial Results for Fiscal Year 2022**\n\n**Total net revenues** in fiscal year 2022 were US$32.33 million, compared to US$51.45 million in fiscal year 2021. The year-over-year decrease in total net revenues was primarily due to, among others, Bitcoin price’s continued decrease and large cryptocurrency exchange platforms declaring bankruptcy in 2022, which led to investors being increasingly cautious in investment. Our chip suppliers also reduced their production capacity due to the impact of COVID-19, resulting in our inability to produce at full capacity, insufficient inventory and inability to meet the market demand. With limited raw materials, we optimized our hardware structure to ensure our products’ competitiveness.\n\n**Cost of revenues** in fiscal year 2022 was US$16.92 million, compared to US$22.23 million in fiscal year 2021. The year-over-year decrease in cost of revenues was a result of a decrease in sales. Our cost of revenues for fiscal year 2022 primarily consists of impairment charge on write-downs for the potentially obsolete, slow-moving inventory and lower of cost or market, and VAT recoverable impairment of $4.5 million recorded in 2022 which was mainly associated with the disposal of Wuhai Ebang Information Technology Co., Ltd.\n\n**Gross profit** in fiscal year 2022 was US$15.41 million, compared to the gross profit of US$29.22 million in fiscal year 2021.\n\n**Total operating expenses** in the fiscal year 2022 were US$63.41 million compared to US$27.19 million in fiscal year 2021.\n\n  * **Selling expenses** in fiscal year 2022 were US$1.96 million compared to US$1.42 million in fiscal year 2021. The year-over-year increase in selling expenses was mainly due to increased advertising and marketing expenses occurred in relation to development of our Fintech businesses.\n  * **General and administrative expenses** in fiscal year 2022 were US$61.45 million compared to US$25.77 million in fiscal year 2021. The year-over-year increase in general and administrative expenses was mainly due to increases in amortization expenses and impairment losses relating to intangible assets and employee stock ownership plan related expenses.\n\n\n\n**Gain from disposal of subsidiaries** in fiscal year 2022 was US$0.006 million compared to nil in fiscal year 2021. The year-over-year increase in gain from disposal of subsidiaries was primarily due to the disposal of Ebang Hongling and Wuhai Ebang during 2022.\n\n**Loss from operations** in fiscal year 2022 was US$47.99 million compared to income from operations of US$2.03 million in fiscal year 2021.\n\n**Interest income** in fiscal year 2022 was US$4.36 million compared to US$1.78 million in fiscal year 2021. The year-over-year increase in interest income was primarily due to the interest income from our investments in term deposit and financing products in 2022.\n\n**Other income** in fiscal year 2022 was US$1.03 million compared to US$0.13 million in fiscal year 2021. The year-over-year increase in interest income was primarily due to the liability waived before the deregistration of a subsidiary.\n\n**Government grants** in fiscal year 2022 were US$0.08 million compared to US$0.44 million in fiscal year 2021. The year-over-year decrease in government grants was primarily due to the decrease of non-recurring rebates from local government.\n\n**Net loss** in fiscal year 2022 was US$45.76 million compared to net income of US$2.77 million in fiscal year 2021.\n\n**Net loss attributable to Ebang International Holdings Inc.** in fiscal year 2022 was US$43.89 million compared to net income attributable to Ebang International Holdings Inc. of US$4.43 million in fiscal year 2021.\n\n**Basic and diluted net loss per share** in fiscal year 2022 was US$7.03 compared to basic and diluted net earnings per share of US$0.75 in fiscal year 2021.\n\n**Cash and cash equivalents** were US$251.29 million as of December 31, 2022, compared with US$239.87 million as of December 31, 2021.\n\n**About Ebang International Holdings Inc.**\n\nEbang International Holdings Inc. is a global blockchain technology and Fintech company with strong application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chip design capability.
