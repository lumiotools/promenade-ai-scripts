In making these statements, we rely upon assumptions and analysis based on our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, and expected future developments, as well as other factors we consider appropriate under the circumstances. We believe these judgments are reasonable, but these statements are not guarantees of any future events or financial results.

Many actual events and circumstances are beyond our control.\n\nThese forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the ability of Stardust Power to recognize the anticipated benefits of the business combination, which may be affected by, among other things, competition, the ability of Stardust Power to grow and manage growth profitably, maintain key relationships and retain its management and key employees; risks related to the price of Stardust Power’s securities, including volatility resulting from sales of equity pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, changes in the competitive and highly regulated industries in which Stardust Power plans to operate, variations in performance across competitors, changes in laws and regulations affecting Stardust Power’s business and changes in the combined capital structure; Stardust Power’s need for substantial additional financing to execute our business plan and our ability to access capital and the financial markets; worldwide growth in the adoption and use of lithium products; the negotiation and execution of definitive documentation regarding the licensing arrangement with KMX and the ability of Stardust Power to realize the anticipated benefits of KMX’s technology; risks related to the ability to implement business plans, forecasts, and other expectations and identify and realize additional opportunities; and those factors described or referenced in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive. If any of these risks materialize or our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these forward-looking statements.

The collaboration between MUFG and Stardust Power is a testament to that vision,” stated Adam Johnson, Chief Commercial Officer of Stardust Power.

(NASDAQ: SDST) (“Stardust Power” or the “Company”), an American developer of battery-grade lithium products, and KMX Technologies, Inc. (“KMX”) announced that it has entered into a 90-day exclusivity period during which Stardust Power and KMX will negotiate the terms and conditions related to Stardust Power’s exclusive use of lithium brine concentration technology from KMX (the “Licensing Arrangement”). The transaction is subject to the negotiation and execution of definitive documentation and the parties’ mutual board approvals.\n\nThis important technology would allow Stardust Power to potentially lower operating costs and capital expenditures across its supply chain, including at its 50,000 metric tons per annum battery-grade lithium refinery under development in Muskogee, Oklahoma, while also potentially reducing the energy and carbon intensity of the refining process. A definitive agreement could give Stardust Power exclusive use of the technology for lithium in the United States and Canada, as well as certain other jurisdictions around the world.\n\nStardust Power remains focused on increasing its sustainability and recycling water following commencement of its operations. KMX’s unique technology, known as vacuum membrane distillation (“VMD”), uses hydrophobic membranes to separate lithium while creating a high quality water as its byproduct. This process is less costly and potentially less energy-intensive than many competing solutions. The distilled quality water can also be used by lithium project developers as part of their direct lithium extraction washing process, in lieu of tapping sparse local freshwater resources and other uses.\n\nStardust Power’s Chief Executive Officer and Founder, Roshan Pujari, commented: “Creating battery-grade lithium requires energy and water, and KMX’s technology is highly efficient on both fronts. Their VMD technology produces an extremely high-quality concentrate with significantly improved water recycling. Following the execution of definitive documentation, Stardust Power would intend to deploy this technology across the supply chain at its Oklahoma refinery, when it is put into operation, and at upstream sites. This is another step forward for Stardust Power, leading at the forefront of sustainability within the U.S. lithium supply chain.”\n\nZachary Sadow, KMX Chief Executive Officer, said, “We are proud to partner with Stardust Power, pioneers in the critical mineral industry, as they build out the North American lithium supply chain.”\n\nKMX’s lithium concentration technology has been publicly validated by the Canadian government, showing its ability to concentrate lithium without significant losses, generating substantially enhanced project economics.\n\n**About Stardust Power Inc.**\n\nStardust Power is a developer of battery-grade lithium products designed to supply the electric vehicle (EV) industry and bolster America’s energy leadership by building resilient supply chains. Stardust Power is developing a strategically central lithium refinery in Muskogee, Oklahoma with the anticipated capacity of producing up to 50,000 metric tons per annum of battery-grade lithium.

The FEL-3 is a culmination of significant technical work Stardust Power has already commissioned.\n\nThe study will deliver a process design with the development of a complete 3D engineering model, from which engineers and contractors can provide a comprehensive estimated total cost for the construction and machinery for the refinery. Stardust Power will use this information to provide the market with a cost basis for the project and line up the applicable financing options. Once the FEL-3 study concludes, and with requisite financing in place, the detailed engineering and long-lead procurement effort will commence immediately, enabling the project to commence major construction.\n\nStardust Power has a unique strategy to optimize its large central refinery for multiple sources of brine input. “We are honored to support Stardust Power’s innovative mission to build American supply chains, Primero will provide the support needed to commence major construction,” commented Matthew Taylor, General Manager of Primero USA. “This is an essential project for Primero and for the United States,” he added.\n\n“Commencing the FEL-3 study marks another exciting milestone for the Stardust Power team, highlighting our dedication to building resilient American supply chains and constructing one of the largest lithium refineries in North America,” stated Roshan Pujari, Founder and CEO of Stardust Power. “The initial phase of FEL-3 began in July, and we anticipate its completion by early 2025. We are steamrolling toward the next crucial inflection point, major construction of our refinery.”\n\n**About Stardust Power**\n\nStardust Power is a developer of battery-grade lithium products designed to supply the electric vehicle (EV) industry and bolster America’s energy leadership by building resilient supply chains.

(“Stardust Power” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: SDST), a development stage American manufacturer of battery-grade lithium products, today announced that Founder and CEO Roshan Pujari and other members of the Stardust Power management team will ring the opening bell of the Nasdaq Global Market (“Nasdaq”) on July 11, 2024, to commemorate Stardust Power’s public listing, which follows its recently completed business combination (the “Business Combination”) with Global Partner Acquisition Corp II (“GPAC II”). Stardust Power’s shares of Class A common stock and public warrants began trading on the Nasdaq exchange on July 9, 2024, under the ticker symbol “SDST” and “SDSTW,” respectively.\n\n“This opening bell ceremony marks an important moment for Stardust Power’s team as we continue our mission to become a leading U.S. producer of battery-grade lithium,” said Roshan Pujari, Founder and CEO of Stardust Power. “I’d like to thank our team, partners and stakeholders for helping us get to this point, and welcome new investors who are excited by our future plans for strategic expansion as a public company.”\n\nUnprecedented demand for lithium is being driven by more than a 20-fold increase in the use of electric vehicles.1 United States lithium supply currently relies almost entirely on imports.2 As consumer demand and policy initiatives are transforming energy and transportation, there is a potential need to galvanize new capacity by 2030.3 Stardust Power intends to lead the charge in America’s energy future, contributing to U.S. energy leadership by manufacturing battery-grade lithium products and developing an integrated domestic lithium supply designed for advanced energy storage systems and the electric vehicle industry.\n\nMr. Pujari continued: “Bolstering domestic lithium production is a critical national security priority for the United States, and we are aligned with the government to meet this demand and help our country achieve lithium independence. Already, we are expected to be eligible for up to $257 million in state incentives for our strategically central 66-acre facility build-out in Oklahoma, and there are many federal incentive programs Stardust Power may be eligible for under the Department of Energy and the Department of Defense. Together with our public and private partners, we anticipate making significant contributions to U.S. energy leadership.”\n\nThe live ceremony will begin at 9:30 AM Eastern Time from the Nasdaq MarketSite in New York City, and it can be viewed at: [https://www.nasdaq.com/marketsite/bell-ringing-ceremony](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=LXqBEyVRm4QsosJPPo-n7Mdvo2oc9RFaqIrbojaLjmsAG0ADdwoirKnGTgP1W4OUypTF-tjfd2-8Y72-4c2Kwfhz32lcEErxOkSQNZa6G7RXgV42a9EsPPl1MLxR9DkReLCJgTzp_0tMfgVRmmXrYO_g0e_DVXqTTnjHQVjgBYdkljsTLqywidOjblTsvdB0 \"https://www.nasdaq.com/marketsite/bell-ringing-ceremony \\(opens in new tab\\)\").\n\nReferences:\n\n  1.
