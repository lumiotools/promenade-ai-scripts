Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure based on US GAAP, excluding interest income, net, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, litigation costs, and write-off of long-lived assets and others. We define adjusted EBITDA margin as adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. Adjusted net income is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure based on US GAAP, excluding share-based compensation expense, amortization of share-based compensation capitalized in intangible assets, and discrete tax items, and including the tax effect of adjustments. We define adjusted earnings per share as adjusted net income divided by the weighted average shares outstanding. We define adjusted gross profit as revenue less cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization), and adjusted gross margin as adjusted gross profit as a percentage of revenue. We define FCF as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by purchase of property and equipment, and capitalized costs included in intangible assets.\n\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n\nThis press release contains \"forward-looking statements,\" as that term is defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA), which statements may be identified by words such as \"expects,\" \"plans,\" \"projects,\" \"will,\" \"may,\" \"anticipate,\" \"believes,\" \"should,\" \"intends,\" \"estimates,\" and other words of similar meaning.

We define FCF as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by purchase of property and equipment, and capitalized costs included in intangible assets.\n\nThe following is a reconciliation of net income, the most directly comparable US GAAP financial measure, to adjusted EBITDA:\n\nThree Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n(Dollars in thousands) | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \nNet income | $ | 1,719 | $ | 12,495 | $ | 6,140 | $ | 14,599  \nInterest income, net | (353 | ) | (346 | ) | (1,032 | ) | (947 | )  \nIncome tax expense (benefit) | 1,132 | (10,384 | ) | 2,441 | (10,253 | )  \nDepreciation and amortization | 2,434 | 2,171 | 7,081 | 6,141  \nShare-based compensation expense | 1,657 | 1,369 | 4,452 | 4,058  \nLitigation costs | 7 | 1 | 7 | 49  \nWrite-off of long-lived assets and others | 82 | 56 | 89 | 58  \nAdjusted EBITDA | $ | 6,678 | $ | 5,362 | $ | 19,178 | $ | 13,705  \nRevenue | $ | 19,057 | $ | 15,837 | $ | 55,624 | $ | 45,143  \nNet income margin | 9 | % | 79 | % | 11 | % | 32 | %  \nAdjusted EBITDA margin | 35 | % | 34 | % | 34 | % | 30 | %  \n  \nThe following is a reconciliation of net income, the most directly comparable US GAAP financial measure, to adjusted net income:\n\nThree Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n(Dollars in thousands, except share data) | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \nNet income | $ | 1,719 | $ | 12,495 | $ | 6,140 | $ | 14,599  \nShare-based compensation expense | 1,657 | 1,369 | 4,452 | 4,058  \nAmortization of share-based compensation capitalized in intangible assets | 292 | 249 | 853 | 706  \nDiscrete tax items(1) | - | (10,272 | ) | - | (10,272 | )  \nTax effect of adjustments(2) | (518 | ) | (1,275 | ) | (1,251 | ) | (1,275 | )  \nAdjusted net income | $ | 3,150 | $ | 2,566 | $ | 10,194 | $ | 7,816  \nEarnings per share:  \nBasic | $ | 0.12 | $ | 0.90 | $ | 0.44 | $ | 1.05  \nDiluted | $ | 0.12 | $ | 0.87 | $ | 0.43 | $ | 1.03  \nAdjusted earnings per share:  \nBasic | $ | 0.23 | $ | 0.18 | $ | 0.74 | $ | 0.56  \nDiluted | $ | 0.22 | $ | 0.18 | $ | 0.72 | $ | 0.55  \nWeighted average shares outstanding:  \nBasic | 13,782,476 | 13,952,426 | 13,852,947 | 13,970,317  \nDiluted | 14,311,575 | 14,329,878 | 14,224,285 | 14,207,673  \n  \n(1) During the three months ended September 30, 2023, $10.3 million of income tax benefit was recognized as a result of the release of the valuation allowance previously recorded on our deferred tax asset and the cumulative research and development tax credit, which were excluded to calculate the adjusted net income.\n\n6\n\n(2) The tax effect of adjustments is calculated using the expected federal and state statutory tax rate.

We believe they provide useful information to our investors as they eliminate the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our cash operations and ongoing operating performance. In addition, we use them as an integral part of our internal reporting to measure the performance and operating strength of our business.\n\nWe believe adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, and FCF are relevant and provide useful information frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of the operating performance of companies similar to ours and are indicators of the operational strength of our business. We believe adjusted EBITDA eliminates the uneven effect of considerable amounts of non-cash depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense and the impact of other non-recurring items, providing useful comparisons versus prior periods or forecasts. Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated as adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. We believe adjusted net income provides additional means of evaluating period-over-period operating performance by eliminating certain non-cash expenses and other items that might otherwise make comparisons of our ongoing business with prior periods more difficult and obscure trends in ongoing operations. Adjusted net income is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income, excluding share-based compensation expense, and amortization of share-based compensation capitalized in intangible assets, and including the tax effect of adjustments. We define adjusted earnings per share as adjusted net income divided by the weighted average shares outstanding. Our adjusted gross profit is a measure used by management in evaluating the business’s current operating performance by excluding the impact of prior historical costs of assets that are expensed systematically and allocated over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which may not be indicative of the current operating activity. Our adjusted gross profit is calculated by using revenue, less cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization). We believe adjusted gross profit provides useful information to our investors by eliminating the impact of non-cash depreciation and amortization, and specifically the amortization of software developed for internal use, providing a baseline of our core operating results that allow for analyzing trends in our underlying business consistently over multiple periods. Adjusted gross margin is calculated as adjusted gross profit as a percentage of revenue. We believe FCF is an important liquidity measure of the cash that is available, after capital expenditures, for operational expenses and investment in our business. FCF is a measure used by management to understand and evaluate the business’s operating performance and trends over time. FCF is calculated by using net cash provided by operating activities, less purchase of property and equipment, and capitalized costs included in intangible assets.\n\n7\n\nAdjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, and FCF are not intended to be performance measures that should be regarded as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, financial measures presented in accordance with US GAAP. In addition, FCF is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenses and is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs. The way we measure adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, and FCF may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies, and may not be identical to corresponding measures used in our various agreements.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL METRICS\n\nThe following metrics are intended as a supplement to the financial statements found in this release and other information furnished or filed with the SEC. These supplemental metrics are not necessarily derived from any underlying financial statement amounts. We believe these supplemental metrics help investors understand trends within our business and evaluate the performance of such trends quickly and effectively. In the event of discrepancies between amounts in these tables and the Company's historical disclosures or financial statements, readers should rely on the Company's filings with the SEC and financial statements in the Company's most recent earnings release.\n\nWe intend to periodically review and refine the definition, methodology and appropriateness of each of these supplemental metrics. As a result, metrics are subject to removal and/or changes, and such changes could be material.\n\n(Unaudited)  \n---  \n(Dollars in thousands) | Q4'22 | Q1'23 | Q2'23 | Q3'23 | Q4'23 | Q1'24 | Q2'24 | Q3'24  \nCustomer metrics  \nIDI - billable customers(1) | 7,021 | 7,256 | 7,497 | 7,769 | 7,875 | 8,241 | 8,477 | 8,743  \nFOREWARN - users(2) | 116,960 | 131,348 | 146,537 | 168,356 | 185,380 | 236,639 | 263,876 | 284,967  \nRevenue metrics  \nContractual revenue %(3) | 77 | % | 75 | % | 79 | % | 79 | % | 82 | % | 78 | % | 74 | % | 77 | %  \nGross revenue retention %(4) | 95 | % | 94 | % | 94 | % | 94 | % | 92 | % | 93 | % | 94 | % | 94 | %  \nOther metrics  \nEmployees - sales and marketing | 68 | 61 | 63 | 65 | 71 | 76 | 86 | 93  \nEmployees - support | 10 | 10 | 9 | 9 | 9 | 10 | 10 | 11  \nEmployees - infrastructure | 28 | 27 | 26 | 27 | 27 | 29 | 27 | 29  \nEmployees - engineering | 54 | 47 | 47 | 47 | 51 | 51 | 56 | 58  \nEmployees - administration | 27 | 25 | 25 | 25 | 25 | 25 | 25 | 26  \n  \n(1) We define a billable customer of IDI as a single entity that generated revenue in the last three months of the period. Billable customers are typically corporate organizations. In most cases, corporate organizations will have multiple users and/or departments purchasing our solutions, however, we count the entire organization as a discrete customer.\n\n(2) We define a user of FOREWARN as a unique person that has a subscription to use the FOREWARN service as of the last day of the period. A unique person can only have one user account.\n\n(3) Contractual revenue % represents revenue generated from customers pursuant to pricing contracts containing a monthly fee and any additional overage divided by total revenue. Pricing contracts are generally annual contracts or longer, with auto renewal.\n\n(4) Gross revenue retention is defined as the revenue retained from existing customers, net of reinstated revenue, and excluding expansion revenue. Revenue is measured once a customer has generated revenue for six consecutive months. Revenue is considered lost when all revenue from a customer ceases for three consecutive months; revenue generated by a customer after the three-month loss period is defined as reinstated revenue. Gross revenue retention percentage is calculated on a trailing twelve-month basis. The numerator of which is revenue lost during the period due to attrition, net of reinstated revenue, and the denominator of which is total revenue based on an average of total revenue at the beginning of each month during the period, with the quotient subtracted from one. Our gross revenue retention calculation excludes revenue from idiVERIFIED, which is purely transactional and currently represents less than 3% of total revenue.\n\n8\n\nEX-99.2\n\nExhibit 99.2\n\nRed Violet, Inc.

Good afternoon and welcome to those joining us today to discuss our third quarter 2024 results. Following a very strong first half of the year, we are pleased to deliver another record quarter across various financial metrics. We generated record revenue, gross profit, and cash flow in the third quarter. Our performance underscores the strength of our business and the commitment of our exceptional team. It was yet another quarter of strong new customer onboarding and growth from our existing customer base, with balanced transaction volume increases across verticals. Given our continued investment in the business, driven by strong customer demand generating record cash flows, we remain very well positioned to close out a record 2024 and to drive accelerated growth in 2025.\n\nRevenue for the quarter was up 20% to a record $19.1 million, producing a record adjusted gross profit of $15.7 million and record margin of 83%. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was up 25% to $6.7 million, producing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 35%. Adjusted net income increased 23% to $3.1 million for the quarter, resulting in adjusted earnings of 22 cents per diluted share. We generated a record $4.8 million in free cash flow in the quarter.\n\nWithin IDI, we added 266 customers sequentially from the second quarter, reflecting strong demand across our verticals. Revenue growth remains robust, led by our Investigative vertical on a percentage basis and closely followed by Emerging Markets and our Financial and Corporate Risk verticals, each achieving impressive double-digit growth in the third quarter. Our Collections vertical continues to demonstrate encouraging signs of a durable recovery. Favorable factors such as asset appreciation and low unemployment are supporting consumers and driving transaction volumes across many of our verticals, while lower-income consumers face ongoing challenges from inflation, high interest rates, and the depletion of government subsidies, which, in turn, lends support to our Collections and other related verticals. Given the current economic landscape and anticipated interest rate reductions, barring unforeseen circumstances, we expect this favorable environment to continue benefiting our business through the remainder of the year and throughout 2025.\n\n2\n\nFOREWARN continues to solidify its position as the leading proactive safety tool for face-to-face engagement. FOREWARN added 21,091 users during the quarter. Over 500 Realtor® Associations are now contracted to use FOREWARN.\n\nOur achievements year to date have enabled us to strategically invest in our business throughout the year, continuing to execute upon our product roadmap and enhance our go-to-market strategies. After adding thirteen team members in the second quarter, we again added another thirteen team members in the third quarter, with emphasis on various sales and marketing capabilities. Notwithstanding the continued investment in the business, due to the operational leverage of our business model, we still produced record free cash flow, adding approximately $5 million of cash to the balance sheet sequentially from the second quarter. Given the continued momentum we are seeing in the business, we are optimistic that we will close out a record 2024 and drive continued momentum throughout 2025.\n\nNow, I will turn it over to Dan to discuss the financials.\n\nDan MacLachlan\n\nThank you, Derek, and good afternoon. We had another great quarter, hitting new records for revenue, gross profit and free cash flow. We continue to see strong growth from new customer onboarding and increased volume within the existing customer base. Revenue increased 20% to a record $19.1 million, producing $6.7 million in adjusted EBITDA with a margin of 35% in the third quarter. To date, 2024 has been a great year across the board, hitting record revenue milestones in each quarter and driving strong profitability and cash flow, all while continuing to invest in the business, including our go-to-market strategy.\n\nTurning now to our third quarter results, for clarity, all the comparisons I will discuss today will be against the third quarter of 2023, unless noted otherwise.\n\nTotal revenue was a record $19.1 million, a 20% increase over prior year. We produced a record $15.7 million in adjusted gross profit, resulting in a record adjusted gross margin of 83% in the third quarter, up 4-percentage points. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $6.7 million, up 25% over prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 35%, up 1-percentage point. Adjusted net income increased 23% to $3.1 million for the quarter, resulting in adjusted earnings of 22 cents per diluted share.\n\nMoving through the details of our P&L, as mentioned, revenue was $19.1 million for the third quarter. I would note that this is an increase of $1.0 million sequentially from the second quarter when you exclude the one-time transactional revenue customer win that we discussed last quarter. There was no material one-time transactional revenue in the third quarter.\n\nWithin IDI, we continue to see strong growth across verticals. Our Investigative vertical continues to outperform, led by Law Enforcement which had its eleventh consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth. Within our Emerging Markets vertical, we continue to see strong double-digit revenue growth across industries, including Retail, Repossession, Legal, Healthcare, and Government. We also experienced strong double-digit revenue growth within our Financial\n\n3\n\nand Corporate Risk vertical, with both the Insurance and Financial industries being key contributors to the growth. Our Collections vertical had its third consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth as we continue to see signs of recovery in the Collections industry. IDI’s Real Estate vertical, which does not include FOREWARN, was down approximately 10% in the third quarter.\n\nAs it relates to FOREWARN, we experienced another quarter of strong revenue growth. This is FOREWARN’s eighteenth consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth.\n\nOur contractual revenue was 77% for the quarter, down 2-percentage points from prior year.\n\nOur gross revenue retention percentage remained unchanged at 94%.\n\nMoving back to the P&L, our cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) remained flat at $3.3 million. Adjusted gross profit increased 26% to $15.7 million, producing an adjusted gross margin of 83%, a 4-percentage point increase from prior year.\n\nSales and marketing expenses increased $1.4 million or 43% to $4.8 million for the quarter. This increase was due primarily to an increase in salaries and benefits from the additional employees added to our sales and marketing team, and the increase in sales commissions.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $0.8 million or 15% to $6.0 million for the quarter.\n\nDepreciation and amortization increased $0.2 million or 12% to $2.4 million for the quarter.\n\nOur income before taxes increased $0.8 million or 35% to $2.9 million.\n\nOur net income for the quarter decreased $10.8 million or 86% to $1.7 million, which produced earnings of 12 cents per diluted share. Note, prior year third quarter included a one-time deferred income tax benefit of $10.3 million.\n\nAdjusted net income for the quarter increased $0.6 million or 23% to $3.2 million, which produced adjusted earnings of 22 cents per diluted share.\n\nMoving on to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents were $35.7 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $32.0 million at December 31, 2023. Current assets were $45.9million compared to $40.3 million and current liabilities were $4.6 million compared to $4.9 million.\n\nWe generated a record $7.2 million in cash from operating activities in the third quarter, compared to generating $5.8 million for the same period in 2023.\n\nWe generated a record $4.8 million in free cash flow in the third quarter, compared to generating $3.3 million in the same period 2023.\n\n4\n\nWe did not purchase any shares of Company stock in the third quarter under our stock repurchase program. Year to date, we have purchased a total of 292,744 shares at an average price of $19.81 per share. We have $4.6 million remaining under our stock repurchase program.\n\nIn closing, we’ve had three consecutive quarters this year of record revenue, each with approximately 20%-30% revenue growth, strong profitability, and strong cash flow. We expect this momentum to continue in the fourth quarter and throughout 2025. We are extremely proud of the way the team is performing and feel red violet is well positioned to continue this growth trajectory for years to come.\n\nWith that, our operator will now open the line for Q&A?\n\nOperator (Operator Instructions)\n\nOur first question comes from the line of Josh Nichols of B. Riley. Josh, your line is open.\n\nJosh Nichols\n\nYes. Thanks for taking my question. Great to see the record 3Q results. And also I was just digging into the numbers. So a nice increase in IDI customers where you actually added some more subs than what was added in 2Q. I know you've been investing in some additional sales and marketing.\n\nAre you starting to see material results from those newer hires? And is that what's given you so much confidence to start talking about the momentum that you're seeing today continue through 2025?\n\nDerek Dubner\n\nThanks, Josh. It's Derek. Appreciate the question. Absolutely. As we've been pretty clear on each of the calls and relaying that, the strategic initiatives that we've been investing in over the last 18 months or so, given that we're generating such strong cash flow, enable us to build out the sales and marketing capabilities around certain areas that we're very early in penetrating these verticals.\n\nSo, as we add these team members, very highly-qualified individuals in their respective subject matter areas, we're seeing the fruits of that investment. And we've been very pleased with the customer onboarding, gosh, for I would say for the last 18 months.\n\nSo, we've been putting up just about at least, at or about, record highs in customer onboarding on a monthly basis, which is a really strong indicator for us, giving us visibility into future sales, of course.\n\nSo we feel very confident about the teams we're putting together.\n\nWe continue to evaluate productivity and increase that productivity by adding to these teams. And we've just been, it's been a continuation of the strength we've been seeing all year, sort of paying dividends from the investments we've made.\n\n5\n\nSo, because of that, we're very excited about 2025.\n\nJosh Nichols\n\nThat's great. And then I think you touched on this briefly in some of the commentary earlier on the call.\n\nBut I'm kind of curious, how should we think about the split between what's driving growth in terms of the new customer adds, but also the land and expand strategy and increasing volumes that you kind of touched on briefly with existing customers overall?\n\nDan MacLachlan\n\nYes, Josh. Thanks. And this is Dan. Thanks for the question.\n\nSo yes, we've done a good job as an organization even at what I would consider kind of small and medium enterprise-sized customers, to not only onboard them with initial volume, but also increase that volume over time.\n\nSo as we look at revenue growth this quarter, it's a good combination of both new customer revenue and existing customer growth.\n\nWhat really excites us about the opportunity ahead is that, as you know we've been working on moving up tier to larger enterprise, larger government customers. And that really is where there's just tremendous opportunity to really land and expand within that customer base because not only are you going in there for one use case and potentially increasing volume there, but you have the opportunity to expand out the organization with additional use cases.\n\nSo when we look at this quarter, great growth both in new customer onboarding and existing customers.\n\nBut also as we move forward moving up enterprise into larger enterprise, we have even more of an opportunity to grow that existing base and expand. So we're really excited as we continue to move forward on this journey.\n\nJosh Nichols\n\nI appreciate the detail there. And last question for me, then I'll let someone else take a stab at it. Looking at FOREWARN, it's been really impressive growth that's been pretty persistent throughout this year.\n\nI'm just curious now where you think you are in terms of penetration and how much is left in terms of other MLS or Realty agencies that you could continue to penetrate that will drive sustainable growth based on where you are today and the opportunities that remain in the market.\n\nDan MacLachlan\n\nSure. Thanks. This is Dan again, and I'll take that question. So yes, today we announced just over 500 associations today. Within the US, there's approximately around 1,100 associations. So still have a lot of go-get within FOREWARN and the real estate industry.\n\n6\n\nBut what we're also looking at now is taking that brand, taking that concept of really that protective safety due diligence tool for user-to-user engagement and expanding it out into additional industries for a number of use cases.\n\nSo, plenty of go-get within the real estate industry, as I said, what 500 associations today, about 1,100 associations in total. But really now spending time, resources and investing and looking to take that brand into new industries.\n\nDerek Dubner\n\nYes. This is Derek also, Josh.\n\nObviously, the exciting part about FOREWARN is that it's the leading proactive safety tool. And we love the fact that many, many realtor professionals, real estate professionals, provide their feedback to us and express their gratitude in protecting them prior to facing a difficult situation, a dangerous situation.\n\nSo, we're very excited about introducing it to other small business ventures and we think it has applicability across many industries.\n\nJosh Nichols\n\nAppreciate it. Thanks, guys. I'll hop back in the queue.\n\nDerek Dubner\n\nThank you, Josh.\n\nDan MacLachlan\n\nThank you, Josh.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you very much. At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I would now like to turn it back to Derek Dubner for closing remarks.\n\nDerek Dubner\n\nThank you. We are pleased to deliver another record quarter and a continuation of the strong performance year to date. Given the progress against our strategic initiatives, we are very optimistic about the remainder of the year and 2025. Good afternoon.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.\n\n7\n"

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure based on US GAAP, excluding interest income, net, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, litigation costs, and write-off of long-lived assets and others. We define adjusted EBITDA margin as adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. Adjusted net income is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure based on US GAAP, excluding share-based compensation expense, amortization of share-based compensation capitalized in intangible assets, and discrete tax items, and including the tax effect of adjustments. We define adjusted earnings per share as adjusted net income divided by the weighted average shares outstanding. We define adjusted gross profit as revenue less cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization), and adjusted gross margin as adjusted gross profit as a percentage of revenue. We define FCF as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by purchase of property and equipment, and capitalized costs included in intangible assets.\n\n**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**\n\nThis press release contains \"forward-looking statements,\" as that term is defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA), which statements may be identified by words such as \"expects,\" \"plans,\" \"projects,\" \"will,\" \"may,\" \"anticipate,\" \"believes,\" \"should,\" \"intends,\" \"estimates,\" and other words of similar meaning.

We believe they provide useful information to our investors as they eliminate the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our cash operations and ongoing operating performance. In addition, we use them as an integral part of our internal reporting to measure the performance and operating strength of our business.\n\nWe believe adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, and FCF are relevant and provide useful information frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of the operating performance of companies similar to ours and are indicators of the operational strength of our business. We believe adjusted EBITDA eliminates the uneven effect of considerable amounts of non-cash depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense and the impact of other non-recurring items, providing useful comparisons versus prior periods or forecasts. Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated as adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. We believe adjusted net income provides additional means of evaluating period-over-period operating performance by eliminating certain non-cash expenses and other items that might otherwise make comparisons of our ongoing business with prior periods more difficult and obscure trends in ongoing operations. Adjusted net income is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income, excluding share-based compensation expense, and amortization of share-based compensation capitalized in intangible assets, and including the tax effect of adjustments. We define adjusted earnings per share as adjusted net income divided by the weighted average shares outstanding. Our adjusted gross profit is a measure used by management in evaluating the business’s current operating performance by excluding the impact of prior historical costs of assets that are expensed systematically and allocated over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which may not be indicative of the current operating activity. Our adjusted gross profit is calculated by using revenue, less cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization). We believe adjusted gross profit provides useful information to our investors by eliminating the impact of non-cash depreciation and amortization, and specifically the amortization of software developed for internal use, providing a baseline of our core operating results that allow for analyzing trends in our underlying business consistently over multiple periods. Adjusted gross margin is calculated as adjusted gross profit as a percentage of revenue. We believe FCF is an important liquidity measure of the cash that is available, after capital expenditures, for operational expenses and investment in our business. FCF is a measure used by management to understand and evaluate the business’s operating performance and trends over time. FCF is calculated by using net cash provided by operating activities, less purchase of property and equipment, and capitalized costs included in intangible assets.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, and FCF are not intended to be performance measures that should be regarded as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, financial measures presented in accordance with US GAAP. In addition, FCF is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenses and is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs. The way we measure adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, and FCF may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies, and may not be identical to corresponding measures used in our various agreements.\n\n**SUPPLEMENTAL METRICS**\n\nThe following metrics are intended as a supplement to the financial statements found in this release and other information furnished or filed with the SEC. These supplemental metrics are not necessarily derived from any underlying financial statement amounts. We believe these supplemental metrics help investors understand trends within our business and evaluate the performance of such trends quickly and effectively. In the event of discrepancies between amounts in these tables and the Company's historical disclosures or financial statements, readers should rely on the Company's filings with the SEC and financial statements in the Company's most recent earnings release.\n\nWe intend to periodically review and refine the definition, methodology and appropriateness of each of these supplemental metrics. As a result, metrics are subject to removal and/or changes, and such changes could be material.\n\n**(Unaudited)**  \n---  \n**(Dollars in thousands)** | **Q4'22** | **Q1'23** | **Q2'23** | **Q3'23** | **Q4'23** | **Q1'24** | **Q2'24** | **Q3'24**  \n**Customer metrics**  \nIDI - billable customers(1) | 7,021 | 7,256 | 7,497 | 7,769 | 7,875 | 8,241 | 8,477 | 8,743  \nFOREWARN - users(2) | 116,960 | 131,348 | 146,537 | 168,356 | 185,380 | 236,639 | 263,876 | 284,967  \n**Revenue metrics**  \nContractual revenue %(3) | 77% | 75% | 79% | 79% | 82% | 78% | 74% | 77%  \nGross revenue retention %(4) | 95% | 94% | 94% | 94% | 92% | 93% | 94% | 94%  \n**Other metrics**  \nEmployees - sales and marketing | 68 | 61 | 63 | 65 | 71 | 76 | 86 | 93  \nEmployees - support | 10 | 10 | 9 | 9 | 9 | 10 | 10 | 11  \nEmployees - infrastructure | 28 | 27 | 26 | 27 | 27 | 29 | 27 | 29  \nEmployees - engineering | 54 | 47 | 47 | 47 | 51 | 51 | 56 | 58  \nEmployees - administration | 27 | 25 | 25 | 25 | 25 | 25 | 25 | 26  \n  \n(1) We define a billable customer of IDI as a single entity that generated revenue in the last three months of the period. Billable customers are typically corporate organizations. In most cases, corporate organizations will have multiple users and/or departments purchasing our solutions, however, we count the entire organization as a discrete customer.\n\n(2) We define a user of FOREWARN as a unique person that has a subscription to use the FOREWARN service as of the last day of the period. A unique person can only have one user account.\n\n(3) Contractual revenue % represents revenue generated from customers pursuant to pricing contracts containing a monthly fee and any additional overage divided by total revenue. Pricing contracts are generally annual contracts or longer, with auto renewal.\n\n(4) Gross revenue retention is defined as the revenue retained from existing customers, net of reinstated revenue, and excluding expansion revenue. Revenue is measured once a customer has generated revenue for six consecutive months. Revenue is considered lost when all revenue from a customer ceases for three consecutive months; revenue generated by a customer after the three-month loss period is defined as reinstated revenue. Gross revenue retention percentage is calculated on a trailing twelve-month basis. The numerator of which is revenue lost during the period due to attrition, net of reinstated revenue, and the denominator of which is total revenue based on an average of total revenue at the beginning of each month during the period, with the quotient subtracted from one. Our gross revenue retention calculation excludes revenue from idiVERIFIED, which is purely transactional and currently represents less than 3% of total revenue.\n\n![](https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=OTI2ODU5OSM2NTY4MzcyIzIwOTg2NzQ=)![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/YjYyZjhiN2YtN2QzYy00NGVlLWFhODMtZGRiYWNiNGM5MjcyLTExMTAyNDU=/tiny/Red-Violet-Inc-.png)\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/4dc7fabe-cd1d-4df2-b795-98a00ec6df86/small/rv-jpg.jpg)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/4dc7fabe-cd1d-4df2-b795-98a00ec6df86)\n\nSource: Red Violet, Inc.\n"
