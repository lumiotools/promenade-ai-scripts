(Nasdaq: LXEO), a clinical stage genetic medicine company dedicated to pioneering treatments for genetically defined cardiovascular diseases and APOE4-associated Alzheimer’s disease, today provided business updates across its portfolio of programs and reported third quarter 2024 financial results.\n\n“We have made significant progress over the last few months across all our clinical stage programs, including reaching alignment with the FDA on registrational endpoints to support an accelerated approval pathway for LX2006. We believe this highly constructive feedback, along with RMAT designation, positions us to rapidly advance this promising potential treatment in a pivotal clinical study,” said R. Nolan Townsend, Chief Executive Officer of Lexeo Therapeutics. “With enrollment completed in the LX2006 SUNRISE-FA Phase 1/2 trial in Friedreich ataxia cardiomyopathy and in the first cohort of the LX2020 HEROIC-PKP2 Phase 1/2 trial in PKP2-ACM, we look forward to sharing meaningful updates across our cardiac gene therapy programs in 2025. In addition, we were pleased to present highly encouraging interim data from our Phase 1/2 study of LX1001 for the treatment of APOE4-associated Alzheimer’s disease at the CTAD conference.”\n\n**Business and Program Updates**\n\n  * **LX2006 for the Treatment of FA Cardiomyopathy:**\n    * **_Regulatory Update:_** Alignment on key elements of accelerated development pathway following a Type C meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA): \n      * Increase in frataxin expression and reduction in left ventricular mass index (LVMI) as co-primary registrational endpoints to support accelerated approval\n      * Target levels including 10% reduction in LVMI and 40% frataxin positive area as measured by immunohistochemistry (IHC)\n      * Histology-based measurement of frataxin and cardiac MRI as acceptable measurement tools\n      * Use of secondary endpoints including left ventricular wall thickness and troponin as supportive measures of efficacy\n      * Enrollment of participants with elevated LVMI in pivotal trial\n      * Final dose selection and size of registrational trial alignment expected in 2025 guided by cohort 3 cardiac biopsy results\n    * **_RMAT Designation:_** In October 2024, the FDA granted Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation for LX2006 for the treatment of FA cardiomyopathy based on interim clinical data announced in July 2024. \n      * RMAT designation is granted for regenerative medicines that are intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition with preliminary clinical evidence that indicates the therapy has the potential to address unmet medical needs. This designation permits sponsor companies to have early and frequent interactions with the FDA through BLA filing.\n    * **_Completion of Enrollment of SUNRISE-FA:_** Completion of enrollment of SUNRISE-FA Phase 1/2 trial, with four participants administered LX2006 in cohort 3. \n      * To date, eight participants have received LX2006 in SUNRISE-FA and eight participants have received LX2006 in an ongoing Weill Cornell-sponsored investigator-initiated trial.\n    * **_International Congress for Ataxia Research (ICAR) Presentation:_** Lexeo will share new cardiac biopsy data from one participant in cohort 2 and functional scales from three participants in the Lexeo-sponsored SUNRISE-FA trial at ICAR on November 15, 2024. \n      * **One Newly Reported Cardiac Biopsy Result from Cohort 2:** Observed a 35% increase in frataxin protein expression from baseline as measured by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS), and a 279% increase from baseline in frataxin positive area from 7% pre-treatment to 26% post-treatment from baseline as measured by IHC. The post-treatment average across cohort 1 and cohort 2 biopsy samples is 44% frataxin positive area as measured by IHC.\n      * **Newly Reported Functional Results from July 2024 Interim Data Set:** All three participants had more than a 5-point improvement in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnare-12 (KCCQ-12) and at least a 1-point improvement in the modified Friedreich Ataxia Rating Scale (mFARS) as of their latest visit (2 participants at 12-months, and 1 participant at 6-months).\n\n\n  * **_LX2006 Continues to be Generally Well Tolerated:_** LX2006 has been generally well tolerated across both SUNRISE-FA and Weill Cornell investigator-initiated trials to date. One possibly treatment-related Grade 2 event of asymptomatic myocarditis was observed one year after dosing in a participant with multiple comorbidities and history of flu-like symptoms prior to diagnosis, which may have been a contributing factor. A biopsy was performed six weeks after initial diagnosis and results were negative for myocarditis; participant remains asymptomatic.\n\n\n  * **LX2020 for the Treatment of PKP2-ACM:** Completed enrollment of cohort 1 (n=3) of HEROIC-PKP2 Phase 1/2 trial. \n    * LX2020 has been generally well tolerated to date, with no evidence of complement activation and no unexpected safety events or toxicities associated with study drug observed.\n    * Anticipate proceeding to cohort 2 following data review by independent data safety and monitoring board.\n    * Initial data from cohort 1 with a focus on safety and biodistribution as assessed via cardiac biopsy expected in late Q1 / early Q2 2025.\n  * **LX1001 for the Treatment of APOE4-associated Alzheimer’s Disease:** Announced positive interim Phase 1/2 results for LX1001 at the CTAD conference. LX1001 was generally well tolerated to date across all dose cohorts with no reports of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA). A dose and time-dependent increase in neuroprotective APOE2 expression was observed in all participants with ongoing durability at 12 months, and reductions in CSF tau biomarkers and tau PET were seen in a majority of participants.\n  * **Appointment of Tolga Tanguler to Board of Directors:** In November 2024, Lexeo appointed Tolga Tanguler to its Board of Directors. Mr. Tanguler currently serves as Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer at Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a global leader in RNA interference therapeutics. In his role, he has led Alnylam’s transformation into a fully integrated biotech company, expanding its commercial presence both in the U.S. and internationally, and is leading the launch of Amvuttra (vutrisiran), an RNAi treatment for TTR amyloid cardiomyopathy. Mr. Tanguler brings over 25 years of senior leadership experience across notable organizations including Alnylam, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Pfizer Inc.\n\n\n\nLexeo expects to provide an overview of upcoming program milestones at the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in January 2025.

(Nasdaq: LXEO), a clinical stage genetic medicine company dedicated to pioneering treatments for genetically defined cardiovascular diseases and APOE4-associated Alzheimer’s disease, today announced positive interim results from the Phase 1/2 study of LX1001 ([NCT03634007](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=uBbzRFukt8tkA9IB9neg4Ssk45ruoVHGrxZzXOMHUk2Uyqb7hgctrXK3zAAg5Xf_XhJ0JdYKuKL6jdnnvfg_Si7zEK6RujK9rj-86z6mxmM=)) for the treatment of APOE4-associated Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Treatment with LX1001 led to dose-dependent increases in APOE2 protein expression and improvements in AD-associated tau biomarkers, measures which have been closely correlated with cognitive outcomes. LX1001 also demonstrated a favorable safety profile with no reports of ARIA1. The data were presented today in a late-breaking oral presentation at the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer’s Disease (CTAD) conference in Madrid, Spain and expand the body of evidence on LX1001 as a potential therapy for the more progressive course of Alzheimer’s seen in APOE4 homozygotes.\n\n“APOE4 homozygotes are approximately 15 times more likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease than the general population, have faster disease progression, and have an increased risk of ARIA with currently available therapies that can cause serious complications,” said Dr. Kim Johnson, Division Chief, Memory Disorders at the Department of Neurology of Duke University School of Medicine and a principal investigator in the Phase 1/2 study. “Today’s results suggest the potential of LX1001, which based on available data is well tolerated without reports of ARIA. The study also resulted in notable reductions in tau biomarkers, which suggest a possible effect on Alzheimer’s disease pathology.”\n\nLX1001 is an AAVrh10-based gene therapy candidate designed to deliver the protective APOE2 allele into the central nervous system of APOE4 homozygous patients, who have two copies of the toxic APOE4 allele. APOE2 is associated with a significantly lower risk of Alzheimer’s onset and slower disease progression. In the Phase 1/2 study, which completed enrollment in Q4 2023, fifteen patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild or moderate AD were dosed with LX1001 in four dose-ascending cohorts. The study’s primary objective was to assess safety and tolerability, with secondary outcomes including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) APOE2 protein expression and change in tau and amyloid biomarkers.\n\n“In light of the rapid progression of Alzheimer’s disease in this population, these data highlight the therapeutic potential of delivering APOE2, which can impact multiple mechanisms of Alzheimer’s disease upstream of any specific pathway and thereby meaningfully alter the devastating course of this complex disease,” said Dr. Sandi See Tai, Chief Development Officer of Lexeo Therapeutics. “These data are highly encouraging and provide clinical evidence of the unique and targeted mechanism of LX1001 to potentially treat Alzheimer’s disease.”\n\nThe interim Phase 1/2 data include follow-up through 12-months for dose Cohorts 1 through 3 and follow-up through 6-months for dose Cohort 4, demonstrating:\n\n  * CSF APOE2 protein expression in all participants, with dose- and time-dependent increases in expression and durability out to 12 months\n  * Stabilization of amyloid pathology in the majority of participants, with minimal change from baseline in Aß42/40 ratio and amyloid PET\n  * Consistent reductions across CSF tau biomarkers including CSF T-tau, P-tau181, P-tau2172 and P-tau2312, in over two thirds of participants relative to baseline and natural history\n  * Reductions at 6 months in global tau PET3 SUVR in 5 of 6 participants and in regional SUVR in a majority of participants across all brain regions\n  * Participants with moderate AD (n=4) generally demonstrated the most improvement across various biomarker endpoints\n  * Four SAEs were reported, with three deemed unrelated to treatment and one event of mild-moderate sensorineural hearing loss assessed as possibly related to treatment with repeat audiometry pending.\n\n\n\nThe Company has initiated engagement with FDA on these data and expects to provide an update on regulatory interactions and further LX1001 development plans in 2025.\n\n**Conference Call Information** Lexeo will host a webcast today at 7:00 AM ET to review these data and next steps for the program.

Individuals homozygous for APOE4, an allele of the gene APOE, are approximately 15 times more likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease than the general population, and it is estimated that there are approximately 900,000 APOE4 homozygous patients with Alzheimer’s disease in the United States. Conversely, individuals homozygous for the APOE allele APOE2 are 40% less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease than the general population. LX1001 is designed to express the protective APOE2 gene in the central nervous system of APOE4 homozygous patients, potentially slowing or halting the progression of Alzheimer’s disease. LX1001 has been granted Fast Track designation by the FDA.\n\n**About Lexeo Therapeutics** Lexeo Therapeutics is a New York City-based, clinical stage genetic medicine company dedicated to transforming healthcare by applying pioneering science to fundamentally change how genetically defined cardiovascular diseases and APOE4-associated Alzheimer’s disease are treated.

(Nasdaq: LXEO), a clinical stage genetic medicine company dedicated to pioneering treatments for genetically defined cardiovascular diseases and APOE4-associated Alzheimer’s disease, today announced that interim data from the ongoing Phase 1/2 trial ([NCT03634007](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=o099e8Q2FPxQZZGUix3KfO706WHf4XPiZO1Y7oORyS4QzlKVF56bP-uL7s3ZxeTtbNt1gwJVbVWvcR1IqDzHrgmqdzmZq-KgKaP7FlkVRVg=)) of LX1001 have been selected as a late-breaking oral presentation at the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer’s Disease (CTAD) conference taking place October 29 - November 1, 2024, in Madrid, Spain. The presentation will include new safety and biomarker data from four dose cohorts of LX1001, an AAVrh10-based gene therapy candidate designed to deliver the protective APOE2 gene into the central nervous systems of APOE4 homozygotes with Alzheimer’s disease.\n\n“APOE4-associated Alzheimer’s disease is a devastating, genetically distinct condition and despite recent therapeutic advances, patients with this genetic profile have limited effective treatment options,” said Dr. Sandi See Tai, Chief Development Officer of Lexeo Therapeutics. “We look forward to presenting new data from the first clinical trial seeking to address the underlying genetic cause of APOE4-associated Alzheimer’s disease with a targeted approach.”\n\nThe Phase 1/2 clinical trial is an open-label, dose-ranging study evaluating the safety and tolerability of LX1001 in fifteen patients with Alzheimer’s disease and two copies of the APOE4 allele (APOE4 homozygous patients). Study enrollment was completed in Q4 2023. The presentation will review safety as well as multiple measures of efficacy, including protein expression and tau and amyloid biomarkers. 12-month data will be presented for all patients in Cohorts 1-3, and 6-month data for Cohort 4. \n\n**Oral presentation details:**\n\n  * **Title:** Safety and Preliminary Efficacy of AAV Gene Therapy (LX1001) in Patients with APOE4 Homozygote Alzheimer’s Disease – Interim Data from a Phase 1/2, Open-Label, 52-Week, Multicenter Study, Abstract #486\n  * **Date/Time:** Wednesday, October 30, at 10:50AM, CET (5:50AM ET)\n\n\n\n**About LX1001** LX1001 is an AAVrh10-based gene therapy candidate for the treatment of APOE4-homozygous Alzheimer’s disease. Individuals homozygous for APOE4, an allele of the gene APOE, are approximately 15 times more likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease than the general population, and it is estimated that there are approximately 900,000 APOE4 homozygous patients with Alzheimer’s disease in the United States. Conversely, individuals homozygous for the APOE allele APOE2 are 40% less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease than the general population. LX1001 is designed to express the protective APOE2 gene in the central nervous system of APOE4 homozygous patients, potentially slowing or halting the progression of Alzheimer’s disease. LX1001 has been granted Fast Track designation by the FDA.\n\n**About Lexeo Therapeutics** Lexeo Therapeutics is a New York City-based, clinical stage genetic medicine company dedicated to transforming healthcare by applying pioneering science to fundamentally change how genetically defined cardiovascular diseases and APOE4-associated Alzheimer’s disease are treated. Using a stepwise development approach, Lexeo is leveraging early proof-of-concept functional and biomarker data to advance a pipeline of cardiovascular and APOE4-associated Alzheimer’s disease programs.\n\n**Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements** Certain statements in this press release may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including, but not limited to, our expectations and plans regarding our current product candidates and programs, including statements regarding the potential benefits of LX1001 for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease and the timing for receipt and announcement of data from its clinical trials, and the timing and likelihood of potential regulatory approval. Words such as “may,” “might,” “will,” “objective,” “intend,” “should,” “could,” “can,” “would,” “expect,” “believe,” “design,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” “develop,” “plan” or the negative of these terms, and similar expressions, or statements regarding intent, belief, or current expectations, are forward-looking statements. While Lexeo believes these forward-looking statements are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on any such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based upon current information available to the company as well as certain estimates and assumptions and are subject to various risks and uncertainties (including, without limitation, those set forth in Lexeo’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)), many of which are beyond the company’s control and subject to change. Actual results could be materially different from those indicated by such forward looking statements as a result of many factors, including but not limited to: risks and uncertainties related to global macroeconomic conditions and related volatility; expectations regarding the initiation, progress, and expected results of Lexeo’s preclinical studies, clinical trials and research and development programs; the unpredictable relationship between preclinical study results and clinical study results; delays in submission of regulatory filings or failure to receive regulatory approval; liquidity and capital resources; and other risks and uncertainties identified in Lexeo’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2024, filed with the SEC on August 12, 2024, and subsequent future filings Lexeo may make with the SEC. New risks and uncertainties may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible to predict all risks and uncertainties. Lexeo claims the protection of the Safe Harbor contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 for forward-looking statements. Lexeo expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter any statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. **Media:** Media@lexeotx.com\n\n**Investors:** Carlo Tanzi, Ph.D.ctanzi@kendallir.com\n\n![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/MDU5MDdlZmQtODI5MS00YmVhLTkxY2MtNmM3ZTkxYjUwZjA1LTEyNDQ3Mzk=/tiny/Lexeo-Therapeutics.png)\n\n## Contact Us\n\n  * ![Investor Inquiries](/sites/g/files/knoqqb84871/themes/site/client_site_202/dist/images/investor-colored-thin.svg)\n\n**Investor Inquiries**\n\ninvestors@lexeotx.com\n\n  * ![Media Inquiries](/sites/g/files/knoqqb84871/themes/site/client_site_202/dist/images/chat-colored-thin.svg)\n\n**Media Inquiries**\n\nmedia@lexeotx.com\n\n\n\n  * [ ![Print page](/sites/g/files/knoqqb84871/themes/site/client_site_202/dist/images/printer.svg) Print page ]()\n  * [ ![Email alerts](/sites/g/files/knoqqb84871/themes/site/client_site_202/dist/images/email.svg) Email alerts ](/resources/email-alerts)\n\n\n"
