Reports Third Quarter 2024 Results; Releases Q4 2024 and Reaffirms Full Year 2024 Guidance\n\nNovember 07, 2024\n\n[ Download (opens in new window) ](//s22.q4cdn.com/277469214/files/doc_financials/2024/q3/Press-Release-Q3-2024-Final.pdf)\n\nLOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--  Consensus Cloud Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ: CCSI) today reported financial results for the third quarter of 2024. \n\n“I am pleased with our Q3 results and the continued execution against our four point plan for 2024. Corporate and SoHo revenues were ahead of expectations, with Corporate revenues growing at their fastest pace in six quarters. Our continued strong operating performance and free cash flow allowed us to retire an additional $31 million of debt in the quarter and brings us very close to achieving our leverage goal. Since the program began approximately one year ago, we have retired $187 million of our debt.” said Scott Turicchi, CEO of Consensus. \n\n** THIRD QUARTER UNAUDITED 2024 HIGHLIGHTS **\n\nQ3 2024 quarterly revenues decreased by $2.8 million or 3.1% to $87.8 million compared to $90.6 million for Q3 2023. This decline was primarily due to an anticipated decrease of $5.5 million or 13.6% in our Small office home office (“SoHo”) business, partially offset by an increase of $2.7 million or 5.3% in our Corporate business. \n\nNet income  (1) decreased to $21.1 million in Q3 2024 compared to $24.0 million for Q3 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a loss of $2.1 million due to a noncash foreign exchange revaluation in Q3 2024 compared to a noncash foreign exchange revaluation gain of $3.7 million in Q3 2023, partially offset by a favorable decrease of $2.9 million in interest expense. Q3 2024 net income margin (1) was 24.1% compared to 26.5% for Q3 2023. \n\nEarnings per diluted share (1) decreased to $1.09 or 10.7% in Q3 2024 compared to $1.22 for Q3 2023. The decrease was due to the items discussed above, which was slightly offset due to a lower share count as a result of share repurchases. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA (3)(4) for Q3 2024 of $46.9 million decreased compared to Q3 2023 of $47.5 million primarily driven by a 3.1% decline in revenues, partially offset by the benefit of our cost saving measures. Q3 2024 Adjusted EBITDA margin (3) of 53.5% was an increase of approximately 1 percentage point over Q3 2023. \n\nAdjusted net income (1)(2)  in Q3 2024 decreased to $25.5 million from $29.7 million in Q3 2023 due to the items discussed above. \n\nAdjusted earnings per diluted share (1)(2) for the quarter decreased to $1.31 or 13.2% compared to $1.51 for Q3 2023 primarily due to the items discussed above, which was slightly offset due to a lower share count as a result of share repurchases. \n\nNet cash provided by operating activities in Q3 2024 decreased to $41.6 million from $60.0 million in Q3 2023. Free cash flow (5) in Q3 2024 decreased to $33.6 million from $49.9 million in Q3 2023. The decrease in these two items was primarily due to the impact on Q3 2023 of a foreign tax refund and the deferral of the Q2 and Q3 2023 federal income tax payments under the California Disaster Relief Act which were subsequently paid in Q4 2023. \n\nKey financial results from operations for Q3 2024 versus Q3 2023 are set forth in the following table. Reconciliations of GAAP measures to comparable non-GAAP financial measures accompany this press release. \n\n**(Unaudited, in thousands except per share amounts and percentages)** |  **Favorable / (Unfavorable)**  \n---|---  \n**Q3 2024** |  **Q3 2023** |  **Change**  \n**Revenues** |  $  |  87,753  |  $  |  90,562  |  (3.1  |  )%   \n**Net income(1) ** |  $  |  21,120  |  $  |  24,007  |  (12.0  |  )%   \n**Net income margin(1) ** |  24.1  |  %  |  26.5  |  %  |  (2.4) pts   \n**Earnings per diluted share(1) ** |  $  |  1.09  |  $  |  1.22  |  (10.7  |  )%   \n**Adjusted net income(1)(2) ** |  $  |  25,478  |  $  |  29,721  |  (14.3  |  )%   \n**Adjusted earnings per diluted share(1)(2) ** |  $  |  1.31  |  $  |  1.51  |  (13.2  |  )%   \n**Adjusted EBITDA(3)(4) ** |  $  |  46,916  |  $  |  47,501  |  (1.2  |  )%   \n**Adjusted EBITDA margin(3) ** |  53.5  |  %  |  52.5  |  %  |  1.0 pts   \n**Net cash provided by operating activities** |  $  |  41,567  |  $  |  59,987  |  (30.7  |  )%   \n**Free cash flow(5) ** |  $  |  33,586  |  $  |  49,937  |  (32.7  |  )%   \n  \n** Notes ** : \n\n(1)  |  The effective tax rates were approximately 22.5% for Q3 2024 and 23.9% for Q3 2023. The non-GAAP effective tax rates were approximately 18.9% for Q3 2024 and 19.1% for Q3 2023. The calculation for net income margin is net income divided by revenues.   \n---|---  \n(2)  |  Adjusted net income and Adjusted earnings per diluted share exclude certain non-GAAP items, as defined in the accompanying Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP Financial Measures. Such exclusions totaled $0.22 and $0.29 per diluted share, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Adjusted net income and Adjusted earnings per diluted share are not meant as a substitute for measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, but are presented solely for informational purposes.   \n(3)  |  Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest expense; interest income; other (expense) income, net; income tax expense; depreciation and amortization; and other items used to reconcile net income per diluted share to Adjusted earnings per diluted share, as presented in the Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP Financial Measures. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenues. Adjusted EBITDA amounts and Adjusted EBITDA margin are not meant as a substitute for measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, but are presented solely for informational purposes. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin is net income and net income margin.   \n(4)  |  See Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation for the components of Adjusted EBITDA.   \n(5)  |  Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, less purchases of property and equipment. Free cash flow amounts are not meant as a substitute for measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, but are solely for informational purposes.   \n  \n** CAPITAL ALLOCATION STRATEGIC INITIATIVES **\n\nConsensus ended the quarter with $54.6 million in cash and cash equivalents after the cash outlays detailed below. \n\nThe following table consists of our material capital allocation strategic initiatives (in thousands): \n\n**Capital Allocation:** |  **Q3 2024** |  **Cumulative Total** |  **Remaining** **Under the Plan**  \n---|---|---|---  \nDebt repurchase program (6) |  $  |  31,075  |  $  |  186,772  |  $  |  113,228   \nCommon stock repurchase program (7) |  $  |  —  |  $  |  31,790  |  $  |  68,210   \n**Q3 2024** |  **Q3 2023** |  **Change**  \nPurchases of property and equipment  |  $  |  (7,981  |  )  |  $  |  (10,050  |  )  |  (20.6  |  )%   \n  \n** Notes ** : \n\n(6)  |  On November 9, 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a debt repurchase program, pursuant to which Consensus may reduce, through redemptions, open market purchases, tender offers, privately negotiated purchases or other retirements, a combination of the outstanding principal balance of the 2026 Senior Notes and 2028 Senior Notes. The authorization permits an aggregate principal amount reduction of up to $300 million and expires on November 9, 2026.   \n---|---  \n(7)  |  On March 1, 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a share buyback program. Under this program, the Company may purchase in the public market or in off-market transactions up to $100.0 million worth of the Company’s common stock through February 2025.   \n  \n** Q4 2024 GUIDANCE (i) **\n\nThe following table presents ranges for the Company’s Q4 2024 guidance (in millions, except per share amounts): \n\n**Low** |  **Midpoint** |  **High**  \n---|---|---  \nRevenues  |  $  |  83.0  |  $  |  85.0  |  $  |  87.0   \nAdjusted EBITDA  |  $  |  42.0  |  $  |  43.5  |  $  |  45.0   \nAdjusted earnings per diluted share (ii) |  $  |  1.14  |  $  |  1.19  |  $  |  1.24   \n  \n** FULL YEAR 2024 GUIDANCE (i) **\n\nThe following table presents ranges for the Company’s 2024 full year guidance (in millions, except per share amounts). The Revenues and Adjusted EBITDA range has been narrowed within previously provided guidance based on year to date 2024 performance plus Q4 2024 guidance presented above: \n\n**Prior as of August 8, 2024** |  **Updated as of November 7, 2024**  \n---|---  \n**Low** |  **High** |  **Low** |  **High**  \nRevenues  |  $  |  338  |  $  |  353  |  $  |  346  |  $  |  350   \nAdjusted EBITDA  |  $  |  182  |  $  |  194  |  $  |  186  |  $  |  189   \nAdjusted earnings per diluted share (ii) |  $  |  5.45  |  $  |  5.55  |  $  |  5.45  |  $  |  5.55   \n  \n** Notes ** : \n\n(i)  |  Annual and quarterly guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis, except revenues, only because certain information necessary to calculate the most comparable GAAP measures is unavailable due to the uncertainty and inherent difficulty of predicting the occurrence and the future financial statement impact of certain items. Therefore, as a result of the uncertainty and variability of the nature and amount of future adjustments, which could be significant, we are unable to provide a reconciliation of these measures without unreasonable effort.   \n---|---  \n(ii)  |  Annual and quarterly guidance for Adjusted earnings per diluted share excludes share-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles and certain gains or costs related to non-routine and other matters that are nonrecurring, in each case net of tax. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for Q4 2024 is expected to be between 20.5% and 22.5%.   \n  \n**About Consensus Cloud Solutions**\n\nConsensus Cloud Solutions, Inc.

These forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations or beliefs and are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. These factors and uncertainties include, among other items: the Company’s ability to grow fax revenues, profitability and cash flows; the Company’s ability to identify, close and successfully transition acquisitions; subscriber growth and retention; variability of the Company’s revenue based on changing conditions in particular industries and the economy generally; protection of the Company’s proprietary technology or infringement by the Company of intellectual property of others; the risk of adverse changes in the U.S. or international regulatory environments, including but not limited to the imposition or increase of taxes or regulatory-related fees; general economic and political conditions, including political tensions and war (such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the Middle East); and the numerous other factors set forth in Consensus’ filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). For a more detailed description of the risk factors and uncertainties affecting Consensus, refer to the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed by Consensus on February 28, 2024, and the other reports filed by Consensus from time-to-time with the SEC, each of which is available at [www.sec.gov](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sec.gov&esheet=54149134&newsitemid=20241107423506&lan=en-US&anchor=www.sec.gov&index=1&md5=360d16a189884a8dd600c65b41f2d2fc).

The presentation of this non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. \n\nWe use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business. \n\nFor more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the appropriate GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation tables included within the attached Exhibit to this Release. \n\n**CONSENSUS CLOUD SOLUTIONS, INC.

These reclassifications had no effect on the reported Adjusted net income or Adjusted earnings per diluted share. \n\nAdjusted net income as calculated above represents net income and the items used to reconcile GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures, including (1) share-based compensation; (2) amortization; (3) intra-entity transfers; (4) debt extinguishment gain; (5) other benefits or costs related to non-routine and other matters; and (6) income tax impact. Adjusted net income and weighted average diluted shares are then used to calculate Adjusted earnings per diluted share. The Company discloses these measures as a supplemental non-GAAP financial performance measure, as it believes it is a useful metric by which to compare the performance of its business from period to period. The Company also understands that measures are broadly used by analysts, rating agencies and investors in assessing our performance. Accordingly, the Company believes that the presentation of these measures provides useful information to investors. \n\nAdjusted net income and Adjusted earnings per diluted share are not calculated in accordance with, or presented as an alternative to, net income or earnings per diluted share, and may be different from similarly or identically named non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. These non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations determined in accordance with GAAP. \n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nTo supplement its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: Adjusted net income, Adjusted earnings per diluted share, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Free cash flow (collectively the “non-GAAP financial measures”). The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. The Company believes that they provide useful information about core operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. \n\nThe Company’s non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the following items: \n\n_(1) Share-based compensation._ The Company excludes share-based compensation because it is non-cash in nature and because the Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provides meaningful supplemental information regarding the operational performance of the business. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peers, many of which similarly exclude this item. \n\n_(2) Amortization._ The Company excludes amortization of patents and acquired intangible assets because it is non-cash in nature and because the Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provides meaningful supplemental information regarding the operational performance of the business. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peers, many of which similarly exclude this item. \n\n_(3) Intra-entity transfers._ The Company excludes certain effects of intra-entity transfers to the extent the related tax asset or liability in the financial statement is not recovered or settled, respectively during the year. During December 2019, the Company entered into an intra-entity asset transfer that resulted in the recording of a tax benefit and related tax asset representing tax deductible amounts to be realized in future years which is expected to be recovered over a period of up to 20 years. The Company believes that excluding the cumulative future unrealized benefit of the assets transferred in 2019 and amortization of the tax asset in the subsequent years in the non-GAAP financial measures, thereby presenting the tax benefit in the non-GAAP measures in the year of realization, provides meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and facilitates comparisons to historical operating results. \n\n_(4) Debt extinguishment gain._ The Company excludes certain gains associated with the retirement of our debt. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provides meaningful supplemental information regarding the operational performance of the business. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peers, many of which similarly exclude this item. \n\n_(5) Other._ The Company excludes certain benefits or costs related to non-routine and other matters. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provides meaningful supplemental information regarding the operational performance of the business. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results. \n\n**CONSENSUS CLOUD SOLUTIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES** **NET INCOME TO ADJUSTED EBITDA RECONCILIATION** **(UNAUDITED, IN THOUSANDS)**\n\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: \n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n---  \n**2024** |  **2023 ***  \n**Net income** |  **$** |  **21,120** |  **$** |  **24,007**  \nPlus:   \nInterest expense  |  9,760  |  12,615   \nInterest income  |  (659  |  )  |  (1,519  |  )   \nOther expense (income), net  |  2,069  |  (3,725  |  )   \nIncome tax expense  |  6,135  |  7,537   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  5,038  |  4,364   \nEBITDA:   \nPlus:   \nShare-based compensation  |  3,422  |  3,754   \nOther  |  31  |  468   \n**Adjusted EBITDA** |  **$** |  **46,916** |  **$** |  **47,501**  \n  \n* The prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on Adjusted EBITDA. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA as calculated above represents earnings before interest expense, interest income, other expense (income), net, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization and the items used to reconcile GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures, including (1) share-based compensation; and (2) other benefits or costs related to non-routine and other matters. The Company discloses Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental non-GAAP financial performance measure, as it believes it is a useful metric by which to compare the performance of its business from period to period. The Company also understands that measures similar to Adjusted EBITDA are broadly used by analysts, rating agencies and investors in assessing our performance. Accordingly, the Company believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA is not calculated in accordance with, or presented as an alternative to, net income, and may be different from similarly or identically named non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. This Adjusted non-GAAP measure has limitations in that it does not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations determined in accordance with GAAP. \n\n**CONSENSUS CLOUD SOLUTIONS, INC.

Free cash flow in Q3 2024 decreased to $33.6 million from $49.9 million in Q3 2023. The decrease in these two items was primarily due to the impact on Q3 2023 of a foreign tax refund and the deferral of the Q2 and Q3 2023 federal income tax payments under the California Disaster Relief Act which were subsequently paid in Q4 2023. \n\nThe term Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, less purchases of property and equipment. The Company discloses Free cash flow as a supplemental non-GAAP financial performance measure, as it believes it is a useful metric by which to compare the performance of its business from period to period. The Company also understands that this non-GAAP measure is broadly used by analysts, rating agencies and investors in assessing the Company’s performance. Accordingly, the Company believes that the presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. \n\nFree cash flow is not calculated in accordance with, or presented as an alternative to, net cash provided by operating activities, and may be different from non-GAAP measures with similar or even identical names used by other companies. In addition, free cash flow is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. This non-GAAP measure has limitations in that it does not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations determined in accordance with GAAP. \n\n**Key Performance Metrics (Unaudited)**\n\nThe following table sets forth certain key performance metrics for Consensus for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands, except for percentages and Average Revenue per Customer Account): \n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n---  \n**2024** |  **2023**  \nCorporate revenue  |  $  |  53,085  |  $  |  50,430   \nCorporate customer accounts (1) |  58  |  54   \nCorporate Average Revenue per Customer Account (“ARPA”) (2) |  $  |  310.13  |  $  |  312.45   \nCorporate paid adds (3) |  5  |  3   \nCorporate monthly account churn (4) |  2.61  |  %  |  1.49  |  %   \nSoHo revenue  |  $  |  34,664  |  $  |  40,129   \nSoHo customer accounts (1) |  767  |  859   \nSoHo ARPA (2) |  $  |  14.88  |  $  |  15.31   \nSoHo paid adds (3) |  64  |  64   \nSoHo monthly account churn (4) |  3.38  |  %  |  3.49  |  %   \n  \n(1)  Consensus customers are defined as paying Corporate and SoHo customer accounts. \n\n(2)  Represents a monthly ARPA for the quarter and is calculated as follows: Monthly ARPA on a quarterly basis is calculated using our standard convention of dividing revenue for the quarter by the average of the quarter’s beginning and ending customer base and dividing that amount by 3 months. Consensus believes ARPA provides investors an understanding of the average monthly revenues we recognize per account associated within Consensus’ customer base. As ARPA varies based on fixed subscription fee and variable usage components, Consensus believes it can serve as a measure by which investors can evaluate trends in the types of services, levels of services and the usage levels of those services across Consensus’ customers. \n\n(3)  Paid Adds represents paying new Consensus customer accounts added during the periods presented. \n\n(4)  Monthly churn represents paid monthly SoHo and Corporate customer accounts that were cancelled during each month of the quarter divided by the average number of customers during each month of the same quarter (including the paid adds). The period measured is the quarter and expressed as a monthly churn rate over the respective period. \n\n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20241107423506r1&sid=q4-prod&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\nLaura Hinson Consensus Cloud Solutions, Inc 844-211-1711 investor@consensus.com\n\nSource: Consensus Cloud Solutions, Inc.\n\n[View All News](https://investor.consensus.com/news/default.aspx)\n\n## Quick Links\n\n  * [SEC Filings](https://investor.consensus.com/financials/sec-filings/default.aspx)\n  * [Information Request Form](https://investor.consensus.com/shareholder-services/information-request-form/default.aspx)\n  * [Corporate Governance](https://investor.consensus.com/board-esg/governance/default.aspx)\n\n\n\n### Investor Alerts\n\nTo opt-in for investor email alerts, please enter your email address and select at least one alert option.

          "content": "Consensus Cloud Solutions, Inc.\nReports Third Quarter 2024 Results\nReleases Q4 2024 and Reaffirms Full Year 2024 Guidance\nLOS ANGELES -- Consensus Cloud Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ: CCSI) today reported financial results for the third quarter of\n2024.\n“I am pleased with our Q3 results and the continued execution against our four point plan for 2024. Corporate and SoHo\nrevenues were ahead of expectations, with Corporate revenues growing at their fastest pace in six quarters. Our continued\nstrong operating performance and free cash flow allowed us to retire an additional $31 million of debt in the quarter and brings\nus very close to achieving our leverage goal. Since the program began approximately one year ago, we have retired $187\nmillion of our debt.” said Scott Turicchi, CEO of Consensus.\nTHIRD QUARTER UNAUDITED 2024 HIGHLIGHTS\nQ3 2024 quarterly revenues decreased by $2.8 million or 3.1% to $87.8 million compared to $90.6 million for Q3 2023. This\ndecline was primarily due to an anticipated decrease of $5.5 million or 13.6% in our Small office home office (“SoHo”)\nbusiness, partially offset by an increase of $2.7 million or 5.3% in our Corporate business.\nNet income (1) decreased to $21.1 million in Q3 2024 compared to $24.0 million for Q3 2023. The decrease was primarily due\nto a loss of $2.1 million due to a noncash foreign exchange revaluation in Q3 2024 compared to a noncash foreign exchange\nrevaluation gain of $3.7 million in Q3 2023, partially offset by a favorable decrease of $2.9 million in interest expense. Q3\n2024 net income margin (1) was 24.1% compared to 26.5% for Q3 2023.\nEarnings per diluted share (1) decreased to $1.09 or 10.7% in Q3 2024 compared to $1.22 for Q3 2023. The decrease was due to\nthe items discussed above, which was slightly offset due to a lower share count as a result of share repurchases.\nAdjusted EBITDA (3)(4) for Q3 2024 of $46.9 million decreased compared to Q3 2023 of $47.5 million primarily driven by a\n3.1% decline in revenues, partially offset by the benefit of our cost saving measures. Q3 2024 Adjusted EBITDA margin (3) of\n53.5% was an increase of approximately 1 percentage point over Q3 2023.\nAdjusted net income (1)(2) in Q3 2024 decreased to $25.5 million from $29.7 million in Q3 2023 due to the items discussed\nabove.\nAdjusted earnings per diluted share (1)(2) for the quarter decreased to $1.31 or 13.2% compared to $1.51 for Q3 2023 primarily\ndue to the items discussed above, which was slightly offset due to a lower share count as a result of share repurchases.\nNet cash provided by operating activities in Q3 2024 decreased to $41.6 million from $60.0 million in Q3 2023. Free cash\nflow(5) in Q3 2024 decreased to $33.6 million from $49.9 million in Q3 2023. The decrease in these two items was primarily\ndue to the impact on Q3 2023 of a foreign tax refund and the deferral of the Q2 and Q3 2023 federal income tax payments\nunder the California Disaster Relief Act which were subsequently paid in Q4 2023.\n1\nKey financial results from operations for Q3 2024 versus Q3 2023 are set forth in the following table. Reconciliations of GAAP\nmeasures to comparable non-GAAP financial measures accompany this press release.\n(Unaudited, in thousands except per share amounts and Favorable /\npercentages) (Unfavorable)\nQ3 2024 Q3 2023 Change\nRevenues $ 87,753 $ 90,562 (3.1)%\nNet income (1) $ 21,120 $ 24,007 (12.0)%\nNet income margin (1) 24.1 % 26.5 % (2.4) pts\nEarnings per diluted share (1) $ 1.09 $ 1.22 (10.7)%\nAdjusted net income (1)(2) $ 25,478 $ 29,721 (14.3)%\nAdjusted earnings per diluted share (1)(2) $ 1.31 $ 1.51 (13.2)%\nAdjusted EBITDA (3)(4) $ 46,916 $ 47,501 (1.2)%\nAdjusted EBITDA margin (3) 53.5 % 52.5 % 1.0 pts\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 41,567 $ 59,987 (30.7)%\nFree cash flow (5) $ 33,586 $ 49,937 (32.7)%\nNotes:\n(1) The effective tax rates were approximately 22.5% for Q3 2024 and 23.9% for Q3 2023. The non-GAAP effective tax rates\nwere approximately 18.9% for Q3 2024 and 19.1% for Q3 2023. The calculation for net income margin is net income\ndivided by revenues.\n(2) Adjusted net income and Adjusted earnings per diluted share exclude certain non-GAAP items, as defined in the\naccompanying Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP Financial Measures. Such exclusions totaled $0.22 and $0.29 per\ndiluted share, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Adjusted net income and Adjusted\nearnings per diluted share are not meant as a substitute for measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, but are\npresented solely for informational purposes.\n(3) Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest expense; interest income; other (expense) income, net; income\ntax expense; depreciation and amortization; and other items used to reconcile net income per diluted share to Adjusted\nearnings per diluted share, as presented in the Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP Financial Measures. Adjusted\nEBITDA margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenues. Adjusted EBITDA amounts and Adjusted EBITDA\nmargin are not meant as a substitute for measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, but are presented solely for\ninformational purposes. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted\nEBITDA margin is net income and net income margin.\n(4) See Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation for the components of Adjusted EBITDA.\n(5) Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, less purchases of property and equipment. Free\ncash flow amounts are not meant as a substitute for measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, but are solely for\ninformational purposes.\n2\nCAPITAL ALLOCATION STRATEGIC INITIATIVES\nConsensus ended the quarter with $54.6 million in cash and cash equivalents after the cash outlays detailed below.\nThe following table consists of our material capital allocation strategic initiatives (in thousands):\nRemaining\nCapital Allocation: Q3 2024 Cumulative Total Under the Plan\nDebt repurchase program (6) $ 31,075 $ 186,772 $ 113,228\nCommon stock repurchase program (7) $ — $ 31,790 $ 68,210\nQ3 2024 Q3 2023 Change\nPurchases of property and equipment $ (7,981) $ (10,050) (20.6)%\nNotes:\n(6) On November 9, 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a debt repurchase program, pursuant to which\nConsensus may reduce, through redemptions, open market purchases, tender offers, privately negotiated purchases or\nother retirements, a combination of the outstanding principal balance of the 2026 Senior Notes and 2028 Senior Notes.\nThe authorization permits an aggregate principal amount reduction of up to $300 million and expires on November 9,\n2026.\n(7) On March 1, 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a share buyback program. Under this program, the\nCompany may purchase in the public market or in off-market transactions up to $100.0 million worth of the Company’s\ncommon stock through February 2025.\n3\nQ4 2024 GUIDANCE (i)\nThe following table presents ranges for the Company’s Q4 2024 guidance (in millions, except per share amounts):\nLow Midpoint High\nRevenues $ 83.0 $ 85.0 $ 87.0\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 42.0 $ 43.5 $ 45.0\nAdjusted earnings per diluted share (ii) $ 1.14 $ 1.19 $ 1.24\nFULL YEAR 2024 GUIDANCE (i)\nThe following table presents ranges for the Company’s 2024 full year guidance (in millions, except per share amounts). The\nRevenues and Adjusted EBITDA range has been narrowed within previously provided guidance based on year to date 2024\nperformance plus Q4 2024 guidance presented above:\nPrior as of August 8, 2024 Updated as of November 7, 2024\nLow High Low High\nRevenues $ 338 $ 353 $ 346 $ 350\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 182 $ 194 $ 186 $ 189\nAdjusted earnings per diluted share (ii) $ 5.45 $ 5.55 $ 5.45 $ 5.55\nNotes:\n(i) Annual and quarterly guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis, except revenues, only because certain information\nnecessary to calculate the most comparable GAAP measures is unavailable due to the uncertainty and inherent difficulty\nof predicting the occurrence and the future financial statement impact of certain items. Therefore, as a result of the\nuncertainty and variability of the nature and amount of future adjustments, which could be significant, we are unable to\nprovide a reconciliation of these measures without unreasonable effort.\n(ii) Annual and quarterly guidance for Adjusted earnings per diluted share excludes share-based compensation, amortization\nof acquired intangibles and certain gains or costs related to non-routine and other matters that are nonrecurring, in each\ncase net of tax. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for Q4 2024 is expected to be between 20.5% and 22.5%.\nAbout Consensus Cloud Solutions\nConsensus Cloud Solutions, Inc.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nRECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n(UNAUDITED, IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE AMOUNTS)\nThe following table sets forth the reconciliation of net income to Adjusted net income for the three months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 Per Diluted Share 2023 * Per Diluted Share *\nNet income $ 21,120 $ 1.09 $ 24,007 $ 1.22\nPlus:\nShare-based compensation (1) 3,422 0.18 3,754 0.19\nAmortization (2) 834 0.04 977 0.05\nIntra-entity transfers (3) 937 0.05 1,041 0.05\nDebt extinguishment gain (4) (112) (0.01) — —\nOther (5) 31 — 464 0.03\nIncome tax impact of above items (754) (0.04) (522) (0.03)\nAdjusted net income $ 25,478 $ 1.31 $ 29,721 $ 1.51\n* The prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current year presentation. These reclassifications had\nno effect on the reported Adjusted net income or Adjusted earnings per diluted share.\nAdjusted net income as calculated above represents net income and the items used to reconcile GAAP to non-GAAP financial\nmeasures, including (1) share-based compensation; (2) amortization; (3) intra-entity transfers; (4) debt extinguishment gain; (5)\nother benefits or costs related to non-routine and other matters; and (6) income tax impact. Adjusted net income and weighted\naverage diluted shares are then used to calculate Adjusted earnings per diluted share. The Company discloses these measures as\na supplemental non-GAAP financial performance measure, as it believes it is a useful metric by which to compare the\nperformance of its business from period to period. The Company also understands that measures are broadly used by analysts,\nrating agencies and investors in assessing our performance. Accordingly, the Company believes that the presentation of these\nmeasures provides useful information to investors.\nAdjusted net income and Adjusted earnings per diluted share are not calculated in accordance with, or presented as an\nalternative to, net income or earnings per diluted share, and may be different from similarly or identically named non-GAAP\nmeasures used by other companies. In addition, these measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or\nprinciples. These non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the\nCompany’s results of operations determined in accordance with GAAP.\n9\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company uses the following non-GAAP financial\nmeasures: Adjusted net income, Adjusted earnings per diluted share, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Free\ncash flow (collectively the “non-GAAP financial measures”). The presentation of this financial information is not intended to\nbe considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance\nwith U.S. GAAP. The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as\na means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. The Company believes that they provide useful information about core\noperating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater\ntransparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making.\nThe Company’s non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the following items:\n(1) Share-based compensation. The Company excludes share-based compensation because it is non-cash in nature and because\nthe Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provides meaningful supplemental\ninformation regarding the operational performance of the business. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP\nmeasures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peers, many of which similarly exclude this\nitem.\n(2) Amortization. The Company excludes amortization of patents and acquired intangible assets because it is non-cash in nature\nand because the Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provides meaningful\nsupplemental information regarding the operational performance of the business. In addition, excluding this item from the non-\nGAAP measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peers, many of which similarly\nexclude this item.\n(3) Intra-entity transfers.

During December 2019, the\nCompany entered into an intra-entity asset transfer that resulted in the recording of a tax benefit and related tax asset\nrepresenting tax deductible amounts to be realized in future years which is expected to be recovered over a period of up to 20\nyears. The Company believes that excluding the cumulative future unrealized benefit of the assets transferred in 2019 and\namortization of the tax asset in the subsequent years in the non-GAAP financial measures, thereby presenting the tax benefit in\nthe non-GAAP measures in the year of realization, provides meaningful supplemental information regarding operational\nperformance and facilitates comparisons to historical operating results.\n(4) Debt extinguishment gain. The Company excludes certain gains associated with the retirement of our debt. The Company\nbelieves that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provides meaningful supplemental information regarding\nthe operational performance of the business. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP measures facilitates\ncomparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peers, many of which similarly exclude this item.\n(5) Other.

In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to historical\noperating results.\n10\nCONSENSUS CLOUD SOLUTIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNET INCOME TO ADJUSTED EBITDA RECONCILIATION\n(UNAUDITED, IN THOUSANDS)\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 *\nNet income $ 21,120 $ 24,007\nPlus:\nInterest expense 9,760 12,615\nInterest income (659) (1,519)\nOther expense (income), net 2,069 (3,725)\nIncome tax expense 6,135 7,537\nDepreciation and amortization 5,038 4,364\nEBITDA:\nPlus:\nShare-based compensation 3,422 3,754\nOther 31 468\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 46,916 $ 47,501\n* The prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current year presentation. These reclassifications had\nno effect on Adjusted EBITDA.\nAdjusted EBITDA as calculated above represents earnings before interest expense, interest income, other expense (income),\nnet, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization and the items used to reconcile GAAP to non-GAAP financial\nmeasures, including (1) share-based compensation; and (2) other benefits or costs related to non-routine and other matters. The\nCompany discloses Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental non-GAAP financial performance measure, as it believes it is a useful\nmetric by which to compare the performance of its business from period to period. The Company also understands that\nmeasures similar to Adjusted EBITDA are broadly used by analysts, rating agencies and investors in assessing our performance.\nAccordingly, the Company believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors.\nAdjusted EBITDA is not calculated in accordance with, or presented as an alternative to, net income, and may be different from\nsimilarly or identically named non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is not based on\nany comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. This Adjusted non-GAAP measure has limitations in that it does not\nreflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations determined in accordance with GAAP.\n11\nCONSENSUS CLOUD SOLUTIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO FREE CASH FLOW RECONCILIATION\n(UNAUDITED, IN THOUSANDS)\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 41,567 $ 59,987 $ 110,621 $ 112,079\nLess: Purchases of property and equipment (7,981) (10,050) (25,460) (28,725)\nFree cash flow $ 33,586 $ 49,937 $ 85,161 $ 83,354\nNet cash provided by operating activities in Q3 2024 decreased to $41.6 million from $60.0 million in Q3 2023. Free cash flow\nin Q3 2024 decreased to $33.6 million from $49.9 million in Q3 2023. The decrease in these two items was primarily due to the\nimpact on Q3 2023 of a foreign tax refund and the deferral of the Q2 and Q3 2023 federal income tax payments under the\nCalifornia Disaster Relief Act which were subsequently paid in Q4 2023.\nThe term Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, less purchases of property and equipment. The\nCompany discloses Free cash flow as a supplemental non-GAAP financial performance measure, as it believes it is a useful\nmetric by which to compare the performance of its business from period to period. The Company also understands that this\nnon-GAAP measure is broadly used by analysts, rating agencies and investors in assessing the Company’s performance.\nAccordingly, the Company believes that the presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information to\ninvestors.\nFree cash flow is not calculated in accordance with, or presented as an alternative to, net cash provided by operating activities,\nand may be different from non-GAAP measures with similar or even identical names used by other companies. In addition, free\ncash flow is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. This non-GAAP measure has limitations in\nthat it does not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations determined in accordance with\nGAAP.\n12\nKey Performance Metrics (Unaudited)\nThe following table sets forth certain key performance metrics for Consensus for the three months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023 (in thousands, except for percentages and Average Revenue per Customer Account):\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nCorporate revenue $ 53,085 $ 50,430\nCorporate customer accounts (1) 58 54\nCorporate Average Revenue per Customer Account (“ARPA”) (2) $ 310.13 $ 312.45\nCorporate paid adds (3) 5 3\nCorporate monthly account churn (4) 2.61 % 1.49 %\nSoHo revenue $ 34,664 $ 40,129\nSoHo customer accounts (1) 767 859\nSoHo ARPA (2) $ 14.88 $ 15.31\nSoHo paid adds (3) 64 64\nSoHo monthly account churn (4) 3.38 % 3.49 %\n(1) Consensus customers are defined as paying Corporate and SoHo customer accounts.\n(2) Represents a monthly ARPA for the quarter and is calculated as follows: Monthly ARPA on a quarterly basis is calculated\nusing our standard convention of dividing revenue for the quarter by the average of the quarter’s beginning and ending\ncustomer base and dividing that amount by 3 months. Consensus believes ARPA provides investors an understanding of the\naverage monthly revenues we recognize per account associated within Consensus’ customer base. As ARPA varies based on\nfixed subscription fee and variable usage components, Consensus believes it can serve as a measure by which investors can\nevaluate trends in the types of services, levels of services and the usage levels of those services across Consensus’ customers.\n(3) Paid Adds represents paying new Consensus customer accounts added during the periods presented.\n(4) Monthly churn represents paid monthly SoHo and Corporate customer accounts that were cancelled during each month of\nthe quarter divided by the average number of customers during each month of the same quarter (including the paid adds). The\nperiod measured is the quarter and expressed as a monthly churn rate over the respective period.\n13"

Monthly ARPA on a year-to-date basis is calculated by dividing revenue for the year-to-date period by the average customer base for\nthe applicable period and dividing that amount by the respective period. We believe ARPA provides investors an understanding of the average monthly revenues we recognize per account associated within Consensus’\ncustomer base.

The period measured is the quarter or year-to-date and expressed as a monthly churn rate over the respective period.\nNet Income to Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation\nAdjusted EBITDA as calculated above represents earnings before interest expense, interest income, other income (expense), net, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization and the items used to reconcile GAAP to Adjusted non-GAAP financial measures, including (1) share-based compensation; and (2)\nother benefits or costs related to non-routine and other matters. The Company discloses Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental non-GAAP financial performance measure, as it believes it is a useful metric by which to compare the performance of its business from period to period. The Company also understands that\nmeasures similar to Adjusted EBITDA are broadly used by analysts, rating agencies and investors in assessing our performance.Accordingly, the Company believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors.\nAdjusted EBITDA is not calculated in accordance with, or presented as an alternative to, net income, and may be different from similarly or identically named non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. This\nAdjusted non-GAAP measure has limitations in that it does not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations determined in accordance with GAAP.\n©2024 Consensus Cloud Solutions Inc.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(UNAUDITED)\n1. Basis of Presentation\nThe Company\nConsensus Cloud Solutions, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (“Consensus Cloud Solutions”, “Consensus”, the\n“Company”, “our”, “us” or “we”), is a provider of secure information delivery services with a scalable Software-as-a-Service\n(“SaaS”) platform. Consensus serves approximately 825 thousand customers of all sizes, from enterprises to individuals, across\napproximately 45 countries and multiple industry verticals including healthcare, government, financial services, law and\neducation. Beginning as an online fax company over two decades ago, Consensus has evolved into a global provider of\nenterprise secure communication solutions. Our communication and digital signature solutions enable our customers to securely\nand cooperatively access, exchange and use information across organizational, regional and national boundaries.\nConsensus Cloud Solutions, Inc. Spin-Off\nOn September 21, 2021, J2 Global, Inc., known since October 7, 2021 as Ziff Davis, Inc. (“Ziff Davis” or the “Former\nParent”) announced that its Board of Directors approved its separation of the Cloud Fax business (the “Separation” or the\n“Spin-Off”), into an independent publicly traded company, Consensus Cloud Solutions, Inc. On October 7, 2021, the Separation\nwas completed and the Former Parent transferred certain assets and liabilities associated with its Cloud Fax business to\nConsensus, including the equity interests in J2 Cloud Services, LLC (“J2 Cloud Services”), in exchange for approximately\n$259.1 million in cash, an asset related to $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 6.5% Senior Notes due in 2028,\nand the return of the assets and liabilities related to the non-fax business back to Ziff Davis. On October 8, 2021, Consensus\nbegan trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) under the stock symbol “CCSI”. Ziff Davis retained a 19.9%\ninterest in Consensus following the Separation. Subsequently, Ziff Davis has sold, or otherwise disposed of, its Consensus\nshares, reducing its beneficial ownership in the Company to zero as of September 30, 2024 (see Note 15 - Related Party\nTransactions).\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Consensus and its\nwholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited and have been prepared in\naccordance with instructions for Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X issued by the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (“SEC”). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for complete financial statements. The Company\nbelieves that the disclosures made are adequate to make that information not misleading. In the opinion of management, all\nadjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for the fair statement of these interim financial\nstatements have been reflected. It is suggested that these financial statements be read in conjunction with the audited financial\nstatements and the related notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2023, included in our Annual Report (Form 10-K)\nfiled with the SEC on February 28, 2024. Accordingly, significant accounting policies and other disclosures normally provided\nhave been omitted since such items are disclosed therein.\nThe results of operations for this interim period are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year\nor for any future period.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to\nmake estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements,\nincluding judgments about the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The Company believes\nthat its most significant estimates are those related to revenue recognition, internal-use software development costs, share-based\n-9-\ncompensation expense and income taxes. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates based on historical\nexperience and on various other factors that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results\ncould materially differ from those estimates due to risks and uncertainties, including uncertainty in the current economic\nenvironment due to factors such as inflationary pressures and elevated interest rates.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nThere have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies from our Annual Report on Form 10-K for\nthe fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\nSegment Reporting\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) ASC Topic No. 280, Segment Reporting (“ASC 280”), establishes\nstandards for the way that public business enterprises report information about operating segments in their annual consolidated\nfinancial statements and requires that those enterprises report selected information about operating segments in interim financial\nreports. ASC 280 also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services, geographic areas and major\ncustomers. The Company’s business segment is based on the organization’s structure used by the chief operating decision\nmaker, who is our chief executive officer (CEO), for making operating and investment decisions and for assessing performance.\nThe Company’s chief executive officer reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of\nassessing performance and making decisions on how to allocate resources. The chief operating decision maker views the\nCompany as one reportable segment known as Cloud Fax (see Note 14 - Segment Information).\nReclassifications\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current year presentation. These\nreclassifications had no effect on the reported results of operations.\n2. Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn October 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-06, Disclosure Improvements: Codification Amendments in\nResponse to the SEC’s Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative, which amends the disclosure or presentation\nrequirements of a variety of topics in the accounting standards codification in order to conform with certain SEC amendments\nin Release No. 33-10532, Disclosure Update and Simplification. The effective date for each amendment will be the date on\nwhich the SEC removes that related disclosure from its rules. However, if by June 30, 2027, the SEC has not removed the\nrelated disclosure from its regulations, the amendments will be removed from the Codification and not become effective. The\nCompany is evaluating the potential impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable\nSegment Disclosures. The amendments are intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through\nenhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. In addition, the amendments enhance interim disclosure\nrequirements, clarify circumstances in which an entity can disclose multiple segment measures of profit or loss, provide new\nsegment disclosure requirements for entities with a single reportable segment, and contain other disclosure requirements. The\namendments in this ASU are effective for all fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal\nyears beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments should be applied retrospectively to all\nprior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company is evaluating the potential impact of this guidance on its\nconsolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax\nDisclosures. The amendments are intended to improve the transparency of income tax disclosures by requiring (1) consistent\ncategories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and (2) income taxes paid disaggregated by\njurisdiction. The amendments in this ASU should be applied on either a prospective or retrospective basis. The amendments in\nthis ASU are effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is\nevaluating the potential impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.\n3. Revenues\nThe Company earns revenue from contracts with customers, primarily through the provision of cloud-based\ncommunication and digital signature solutions that allow customers to access the Company’s software without taking\npossession. The contracts include both recurring subscription and usage-based fees, and the total transaction price is allocated to\n-10-\nperformance obligations in each contract as appropriate. Revenue for cloud-based services is recognized over time in the period\nearned. The contracts may be terminated early. Fees collected in advance are non-refundable, and they are deferred and\nrecognized in revenue when the related performance obligations are satisfied. Standard Corporate contracts billed monthly\ninclude a termination charge equal to the minimum fees payable through the last day of the contract term.\nRevenues from external customers classified by revenue source are as follows (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenues\nCorporate $ 53,085 $ 50,430 $ 156,195 $ 150,198\nSmall office home office (“SoHo”) 34,664 40,129 107,197 124,588\nOther 4 3 7 22\nTotal $ 87,753 $ 90,562 $ 263,399 $ 274,808\nTiming of revenue recognition\nPoint in time $ 289 $ 112 $ 737 $ 410\nOver time 87,464 90,450 262,662 274,398\nTotal $ 87,753 $ 90,562 $ 263,399 $ 274,808\nThe Company has recorded $4.1 million and $4.2 million of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023, respectively, and $18.6 million and $20.2 million of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023, respectively, that was previously included in the deferred revenue balance as of the beginning of each respective year.\nPerformance Obligations\nGenerally, the Company’s contracts with customers include one performance obligation, however, certain contracts\nmay include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, revenues are allocated to each performance obligation\nbased on their relative standalone selling price.\nThe Company satisfies its performance obligations upon delivery of products or services to its customers. Payment\nterms vary by type and location of the Company’s customers and the products and services offered. The time between invoicing\nand when payment is due is not significant. Due to the nature of the services provided, there are no obligations for returns.\nSignificant Judgments\nDetermining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations may require significant\njudgment. When a contract includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud-based services, judgment is required to\ndetermine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for\ntogether with the cloud-based service and recognized over time.\nJudgment is also required to determine the standalone selling price for each distinct performance obligation when there\nare multiple performance obligations. In certain cases, the Company is able to establish the standalone selling price based on\nobservable prices of products or services sold or priced separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. The\nCompany uses a range of amounts to estimate the standalone selling price when each of the products and services is sold\nseparately to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative standalone selling price of the various\nproducts and services.\nPerformance Obligations Satisfied Over Time\nThe Company’s business consists primarily of performance obligations that are satisfied over time based on the fact\nthat the nature of the cloud-based services offered is subscription based where the customer simultaneously receives and\nconsumes the benefit of the services provided regardless of whether the customer uses the services or not. Depending on the\nindividual contracts with the customer, revenue for these services is recognized over the contract period when services are\nprovided. The Company expects to recognize revenue for Corporate contracts typically in a range from month-to-month up to\n36 months and recognize revenue for SoHo contracts in a range from month-to-month up to one year. Revenue from usage-\n-11-\nbased fees is recognized in proportion to the amount for which the Company has the right to invoice for services performed,\nwhich corresponds with the utilization of the services by the customer.\nThe Company has concluded that the best measure of progress toward the complete satisfaction of the performance\nobligations over time is a time-based measure. The Company recognizes revenue on a straight-line basis throughout the\nsubscription period and believes that the method used is a faithful depiction of the transfer of goods and services.\nPractical Expedients\nExistence of a Significant Financing Component in a Contract\nAs a practical expedient, the Company has not assessed whether a contract has a significant financing component\nbecause the Company expects at contract inception that the period between payment by the customer and the transfer of\npromised goods or services by the Company to the customer will be one year or less. In addition, the Company has determined\nthat the payment terms the Company provides to its customers are structured primarily for reasons other than the provision of\nfinance to the Company. The Company typically charges an upfront subscription amount for services, or amount for usage in\narrears, or a combination thereof, as other payment terms would affect the nature of the risk assumed by the Company due to\nthe costs of the customer acquisition and the highly competitive and commoditized nature of the business the Company\noperates.\nCosts to Fulfill a Contract\nThe Company’s revenues are primarily generated from customer contracts that are for one year or less. Costs primarily\nconsist of incentive compensation paid based on the achievements of sales targets in a given period for related revenue streams\nand are recognized in the month when the revenue is earned. Incentive compensation is paid upon the issuance or renewal of the\ncustomer contract. As a practical expedient, for amortization periods that are determined to be one year or less, the Company\nexpenses any incremental costs of obtaining the contract with a customer when incurred. For those customer contracts greater\nthan one year, the Company capitalizes and amortizes the expenses, when appropriate, over the period of benefit.\nRevenues Invoiced\nThe Company has applied the practical expedient for certain revenue streams to exclude the value of remaining\nperformance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected term of one year or less or (ii) contracts for which the\nCompany recognizes revenue in proportion to the amount it has the right to invoice for services performed.\n4. Fair Value Measurements\nThe Company complies with the provisions of FASB ASC Topic No. 820, Fair Value Measurement, (“ASC 820”),\nwhich defines fair value, provides a framework for measuring fair value and expands the disclosures required for fair value\nmeasurements of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. ASC 820 clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing\nthe amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market\nparticipants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that is determined based on assumptions that market\nparticipants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, ASC 820 establishes a\nthree-tier value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value:\n§ Level 1 – Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active\nmarkets.\n§ Level 2 – Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities,\nquoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are\nobservable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or\nliabilities.\n§ Level 3 – Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity.\nThe fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of\nunobservable inputs when measuring fair value.\n-12-\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash\nequivalents. Cash and cash equivalents include money market funds of $43.1 million and $72.1 million as of September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which are valued based on Level 1 inputs consisting of quoted prices in active\nmarkets. The carrying value of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value.\nThe fair value of long-term debt is determined using recent quoted market prices or dealer quotes for each of the\nCompany’s instruments, which are Level 1 inputs (see Note 7 - Long-Term Debt). The carrying value of long-term debt is\nreflected in the financial statements at cost.\nAssets Measured on a Non-Recurring Basis\nThe Company’s non-financial assets, which primarily consist of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, long-lived\nassets and equity securities without a readily determinable fair value are reported at carrying value, or at fair value as of their\nacquisition dates, and are not required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis. However, if any of these types of assets\nbecome impaired, the carrying values of the assets are written down to fair value using Level 3 inputs.\n5. Property and Equipment\nProperty and equipment, stated at cost, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 consisted of the following\n(in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nInternal-use software development costs $ 82,982 $ 51,396\nComputers, software and equipment 19,327 21,701\nFurniture and fixtures 888 887\nLeasehold improvements 1,720 1,720\nInternal-use software development costs in process 43,508 48,022\n148,425 123,726\nLess: Accumulated depreciation and amortization (52,083) (42,530)\nTotal property and equipment, net $ 96,342 $ 81,196\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $4.1 million and $3.3 million for the three months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023, respectively, and $12.2 million and $9.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively.\nNo impairment was recorded in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n6.

Long-Term Debt\nLong-term debt as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 consists of the following (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\n2026 Senior Notes $ 255,532 $ 280,014\n2028 Senior Notes 362,696 462,414\nTotal 618,228 742,428\nLess: deferred issuance costs (5,738) (8,448)\nTotal debt 612,490 733,980\nLess: current portion, net of debt issuance costs (9,366) (8,575)\nTotal long-term debt, less current portion $ 603,124 $ 725,405\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the estimated fair value of the 2026 Senior Notes was\napproximately $254.9 million and $266.0 million, respectively, and was based on quoted market prices or dealer quotes for the\n2026 Senior Notes which are Level 1 inputs in the fair value hierarchy.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the estimated fair value of the 2028 Senior Notes was\napproximately $361.8 million and $422.5 million, respectively, and was based on quoted market prices or dealer quotes for the\n2028 Senior Notes which are Level 1 inputs in the fair value hierarchy.\nAt September 30, 2024, future contractual principal payments for debt were as follows (in thousands):\nFiscal year: Total\n2024 (1) (remainder) $ 9,111\n2025 —\n2026 248,980\n2027 —\n2028 360,137\nThereafter —\nTotal $ 618,228\n(1) The Company has reclassified $6.5 million and $2.6 million from the 2026 and 2028 periods, respectively, into the 2024\nperiod as debt repurchases were made subsequent to September 30, 2024 but prior to the filing of these financial statements (see\nNote 16 - Subsequent Event).\nThe Company capitalized $0.7 million and $0.7 million of interest expense within property and equipment, net on the\nCompany’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively, and $2.1 million and $1.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n2026 Senior Notes\nOn October 7, 2021, Consensus issued $305.0 million of senior notes due in 2026 (the “2026 Senior Notes”), receiving\nnet proceeds of $301.2 million, after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts, commissions and offering expenses. The 2026\nSenior Notes are presented as current portion of long-term debt and long-term debt, net of current portion, net of deferred\nissuance costs, on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The 2026\nSenior Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.0% per annum and mature on October 15, 2026.\nThe indenture pursuant to which the 2026 Senior Notes were issued contains covenants that restrict the Company’s\nability to (i) pay dividends or make distributions on the Company’s common stock; (ii) make certain restricted payments; (iii)\ncreate liens or enter into sale and leaseback transactions; (iv) enter into transactions with affiliates; (v) merge or consolidate\nwith another company; and (vi) transfer and sell assets. These covenants contain certain exceptions. Restricted payments are\napplicable only if Consensus Cloud Solutions, Inc. and subsidiaries designated as restricted subsidiaries has a net leverage ratio\n-15-\nof greater than 3.0 to 1.0. In addition, if such net leverage ratio is in excess of 3.0 to 1.0, the restriction on restricted payments is\nsubject to various exceptions, including the total aggregate amount not to exceed the greater of (A) $100.0 million and (B)\n50.0% of EBITDA for the most recently ended four fiscal quarter period ended immediately prior to such date for which\ninternal financial statements are available. The Company is in compliance with its debt covenants as of September 30, 2024.\n2028 Senior Notes\nOn October 7, 2021, Consensus issued $500.0 million of 6.5% senior notes due in 2028 (the “2028 Senior Notes”) to\nZiff Davis (see Note 15 - Related Party Transactions) in exchange for the equity interest in the Company. Ziff Davis then\nexchanged the 2028 Senior Notes with lenders under its credit agreement (or their affiliates) in exchange for extinguishment of\na similar amount of indebtedness under such credit agreement for a total amount of $483.8 million, after deducting the initial\npurchasers’ discounts, commissions and offering expenses. The 2028 Senior Notes are presented as current portion of long-term\ndebt and long-term debt, net of current portion, net of deferred issuance costs, on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\nas of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The 2028 Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.5% per annum and mature\non October 15, 2028.\nThe indenture pursuant to which the 2028 Senior Notes were issued contains covenants that restrict the Company’s\nability to (i) pay dividends or make distributions on the Company’s common stock; (ii) make certain restricted payments; (iii)\ncreate liens or enter into sale and leaseback transactions; (iv) enter into transactions with affiliates; (v) merge or consolidate\nwith another company; and (vi) transfer and sell assets. These covenants contain certain exceptions. Restricted payments are\napplicable only if Consensus Cloud Solutions, Inc. and subsidiaries designated as restricted subsidiaries has a net leverage ratio\nof greater than 3.0 to 1.0. In addition, if such net leverage ratio is in excess of 3.0 to 1.0, the restriction on restricted payments is\nsubject to various exceptions, including the total aggregate amount not to exceed the greater of (A) $100.0 million and (B)\n50.0% of EBITDA for the most recently ended four fiscal quarter period ended immediately prior to such date for which\ninternal financial statements are available. The Company is in compliance with its debt covenants as of September 30, 2024.\nCredit Agreement\nOn March 4, 2022, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with certain lenders party\nthereto (the “Lenders”) and MUFG Union Bank, N.A., as agent (the “Agent”). Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the Lenders\nhave provided Consensus with a senior secured revolving credit facility of $25.0 million (the “Credit Facility”) with an option\nheld by the Company to obtain an additional commitment of up to a maximum of $25.0 million. The final maturity of the Credit\nFacility will occur on March 4, 2027. As of September 30, 2024, no amount had been drawn down on the Credit Facility. The\nCredit Facility is guaranteed by each wholly-owned material domestic subsidiary of Consensus, and secured by substantially all\nassets of Consensus and the guarantors. The loans made under the Credit Facility are subject to a Secured Overnight Financing\nRate (“SOFR”) base interest rate plus a SOFR margin between 1.75% - 2.50%, with stepdowns subject to the total net leverage\nratio.\nThe Credit Facility is subject to a total net leverage ratio covenant and a minimum EBITDA requirement, in each case\ntested on a quarterly basis. The Credit Agreement contains covenants that restrict the Company’s ability to (i) pay dividends or\nmake distributions on the Company’s common stock; (ii) make certain restricted payments; (iii) create liens or enter into sale\nand leaseback transactions; (iv) enter into transactions with affiliates; (v) merge or consolidate with another company; and (vi)\ntransfer and sell assets. These covenants contain certain exceptions. Unsecured indebtedness may be incurred, assets may be\ndisposed of, restricted payments may be made and investments may be made, in each case subject to compliance with the\nCompany’s financial covenants. The Company is in compliance with its covenants as of September 30, 2024.\nDebt Repurchase Program\nOn November 9, 2023, the Board of Directors approved a debt repurchase program, pursuant to which Consensus may\nreduce, through redemptions, open market purchases, tender offers, privately negotiated purchases or other retirements, a\ncombination of the outstanding principal balance of the 2026 Senior Notes and 2028 Senior Notes (“Debt Repurchase\nProgram”). The authorization permits an aggregate principal amount reduction of up to $300 million and expires on November\n9, 2026. The timing and amounts of purchases will be determined by the Company, depending on market conditions and other\nfactors it deems relevant. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company retired $31.1 million and\n$124.2 million, respectively, in principal of its senior notes. Refer to Note 16 - Subsequent Event for debt repurchases made\nsubsequent to September 30, 2024 but prior to the filing of these financial statements. During the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, the Company retired zero in principal of its senior notes. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had\n-16-\nretired an aggregate of $186.8 million in principal of its senior notes under this program. In connection with the Debt\nRepurchase Program, the Company reclassified $9.4 million and $8.6 million of long-term debt, net of current portion to the\ncurrent portion of long-term debt as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, as the Company had the\nintention and cash on hand to extinguish the respective amounts of debt within twelve months of the end of the reporting\nperiods.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, a net gain on debt extinguishment of $0.1 million and\n$6.7 million, respectively, related to the Debt Repurchase Program is included in interest expense on the Condensed\nConsolidated Statements of Income. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, no net gain on debt\nextinguishment was recorded.\n8. Commitments and Contingencies\nLitigation\nFrom time to time, the Company and its affiliates are involved in litigation and other legal disputes or regulatory\ninquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business. Any claims or regulatory actions against the Company and its affiliates,\nwhether meritorious or not, could be time consuming and costly, and could divert significant operational resources. The\noutcomes of such matters are subject to inherent uncertainties, carrying the potential for unfavorable rulings that could include\nmonetary damages and injunctive relief.\nThe Company does not believe, based on current knowledge, that any legal proceedings or claims currently exist\nwhich, after giving effect to existing accrued liabilities, are likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s\nconsolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. It is the Company’s policy to expense legal fees related to\nany litigation as incurred.\nNon-Income Related Taxes\nIn the third quarter of 2022, the Company initiated a Voluntary Disclosure Agreement (“VDA”) process to voluntarily\nreport sales tax liability related to prior periods where the Company had previously not been able to estimate its exposure. The\nCompany recorded an accrual as the exposure became probable and estimable. The VDA process was completed in the fourth\nquarter of 2023. While the Company believes that it has sufficiently reserved for historical sales tax liabilities under FASB ASC\nTopic No. 450, Contingencies, some state taxing authorities may still challenge the Company’s sales tax position, the\nmethodology used to calculate the sales tax liability, and may also impose other taxes on its business. Taxing authorities may\nsuccessfully assert that the Company should have collected, or in the future should collect sales and use, telecommunications or\nsimilar taxes, and could be subject to liability with respect to past or future tax, which could adversely affect the Company’s\noperating results.\nThe Company recorded a sales tax expense within general and administrative expenses in the Condensed Consolidated\nStatements of Income of $0.1 million and $0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively,\nand $1.2 million and $2.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe Company will continue to review and monitor the impact of sales tax rules in order to mitigate any associated\nrisks on its business. The sales tax liability within accounts payable and accrued expenses on the Company’s Condensed\nConsolidated Balance Sheets was $5.9 million and $7.3 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n-17-\n9. Other Balance Sheet Account Details\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets consisted of the following (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nPrepaid insurance $ 97 $ 939\nPrepaid income taxes 3,111 3,698\nPrepaid software licenses 3,154 3,232\nOther prepaid expenses 2,718 1,799\nOther current assets 350 523\nTotal $ 9,430 $ 10,191\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses consisted of the following (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nAccounts payable $ 9,518 $ 9,858\nAccrued sales and other taxes 7,486 8,806\nAccrued interest 17,876 9,885\nAccrued compensation 8,043 4,337\nAccrued advertising expenses 2,021 2,485\nOther accrued expenses 2,478 1,135\nTotal $ 47,422 $ 36,506\n10. Income Taxes\nThe Company’s tax provision for interim periods is determined using an estimate of the Company’s annual effective\ntax rate adjusted for discrete interim period tax impacts. Each quarter the Company updates its estimated annual effective tax\nrate and, if the estimate changes, makes a cumulative adjustment. Changes in the geographical mix, permanent differences or\nthe estimated level of annual pre-tax income can affect the effective tax rate. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 22.5% and 23.9%, respectively. The Company’s effective tax rate for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 25.7% and 23.8%, respectively. The decrease in the Company’s effective\nincome tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the change in the geographical mix of\nincome. The increase in the Company’s effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily\nattributable to the change in the geographical mix of income, an increase in the valuation allowance and an increase in state\ntaxes on foreign earnings not permanently reinvested.\nThe Company’s effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 differed from the\nU.S. federal statutory rates of 21% primarily as a result of state income taxes, nondeductible expenses for tax purposes, foreign\nrate differential, research and development credits and uncertain tax positions.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $11.9 million and $9.7 million, respectively, in\nliabilities for uncertain income tax positions, including interest and penalties. Accrued interest and penalties related to\nunrecognized tax benefits are recognized in income tax expense on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of\nIncome.\nIncome Tax Audits\nThe Company is required to file tax returns in the United States, Ireland, Canada, Japan, Netherlands, France and Hong\nKong. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was not under audit in any jurisdiction that it operates within. In respect to\nthese international subsidiaries, tax returns for the years from 2017 onwards are still open to examination by tax authorities.\n-18-\n11. Stockholders’ Deficit\nCommon Stock Repurchase Program\nOn March 1, 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a share buyback program. Under this program, the\nCompany may purchase in the public market or in off-market transactions up to $100.0 million of the Company’s common\nstock through February 2025. The timing and amounts of purchases will be determined by the Company, depending on market\nconditions and other factors it deems relevant. The Company entered into Rule 10b-18 and Rule 10b5-1 trading plans under this\nprogram. There were no shares repurchased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 under this program. During the\nthree months ended September 30, 2023, the Company repurchased 152,399 shares under this program at an aggregate cost of\n$3.8 million, inclusive of excise tax of $0.1 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company\nrepurchased 42,962 and 490,953 shares, respectively, at an aggregate cost of $0.7 million and $15.1 million, respectively,\ninclusive of excise tax of zero and $0.1 million, respectively. Cumulatively as of September 30, 2024, 1,071,624 shares have\nbeen repurchased under this program at an aggregate cost of $32.0 million (inclusive of excise tax of $0.2 million). The excise\ntax is assessed at 1% of the fair market value of net stock repurchases after December 31, 2022.\nVested Restricted Stock\nAt the time of certain vesting events related to restricted stock units or restricted stock awards that are held by\nparticipants in Consensus’ Equity Incentive Plan, a portion of the awards subject to vesting are withheld by the Company to\nsatisfy the employees’ tax withholding obligations that arise upon the vesting of restricted stock. As a result, the number of\nshares issued upon vesting for these awards is net of the statutory withholding requirements that the Company pays on behalf of\nits employees. Although shares withheld are not issued, they are treated as common share repurchases in the Company’s\ncondensed consolidated financial statements, as they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting.\nThese shares do not count against the authorized capacity under the Company’s share repurchase program described above.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company withheld shares on its vested restricted stock units\nand restricted stock awards relating to its share-based compensation plans of 3,489 shares and 2,412 shares, respectively.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company withheld shares on its vested restricted stock units\nand restricted stock awards relating to its share-based compensation plans of 40,396 shares and 35,368 shares, respectively.\nDividends\nThe Company currently does not issue dividends to Consensus shareholders. Future dividends are subject to Board\napproval. Our current debt agreements could trigger restrictions on dividend payments under certain circumstances (see Note 7\n- Long-Term Debt).\n12. Equity Incentive Plan\nThe Company’s share-based compensation plans include the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”).\n2021 Equity Incentive Plan\nIn December 2021, Consensus’ Board of Directors adopted the 2021 Plan, which provides for the grant of incentive\nstock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares and share units and other\nshare-based awards. Under the 2021 Plan, 4,000,000 shares of common stock are authorized to be granted. As of September 30,\n2024, 2,147,611 shares were available to be used under the 2021 Plan.\nRestricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units\nThe Company has awarded restricted stock and restricted stock units to its Board of Directors and certain employees\npursuant to the 2021 Plan. Compensation expense resulting from restricted stock and restricted stock unit grants is measured at\nfair value on the date of grant and is recognized as share-based compensation expense over the applicable vesting period.\nVesting periods are generally one year for awards to members of the Company’s Board of Directors, four years for employees\nand five years for the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer.\n-19-\nRestricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units with Market Conditions\nThe Company has awarded certain key employees market-based restricted stock and restricted stock units pursuant to\nthe 2021 Plan. The market-based awards have vesting conditions that are based on specified stock price targets of the\nCompany’s common stock. Market conditions were factored into the grant date fair value using a Monte Carlo valuation model,\nwhich utilized multiple input variables to determine the probability of the Company achieving the specified stock price targets\nfor 20 out of 30 trading days or 20 out of 25 trading days (look-back period), based on the award agreement. Stock-based\ncompensation expense related to an award with a market condition is recognized over the requisite service period using the\ngraded-vesting method, unless the market condition has been met and requisite service period has been completed, then the\nexpense will be accelerated and recognized in the period that the market condition and service period requirement have been\nmet. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company awarded zero market-based restricted stock\nawards and restricted stock units.\nRestricted stock activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is set forth below:\nWeighted-\nAverage\nNumber of Grant-Date\nShares Fair Value\nNonvested at January 1, 2024 15,679 $ 39.24\nGranted — —\nVested (9,225) 37.95\nCanceled (6,454) 41.07\nNonvested at September 30, 2024 — $ —\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had no remaining unrecognized share-based compensation cost related to its\nrestricted stock awards, as they have been fully expensed as of the end of the period.\nRestricted stock unit activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is set forth below:\nWeighted-\nAverage\nNumber of Grant-Date\nShares Fair Value\nOutstanding at January 1, 2024 1,560,557 $ 40.27\nGranted 101,067 16.46\nVested (103,366) 54.37\nCanceled (54,344) 40.04\nOutstanding at September 30, 2024 1,503,914 $ 37.71\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had unrecognized share-based compensation cost related to its restricted\nstock units of $22.2 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.3 years.\nThe Company capitalized $0.7 million and $0.5 million of share-based compensation cost during the three months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $2.2 million and $1.5 million during the nine months ended September\n30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, within property and equipment, net on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n-20-\n13.

We undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any\nrevision to these forward-looking statements. Readers should carefully review the Risk Factors and the risk factors set forth in\nother documents we file from time to time with the SEC.\nSome factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking\nstatements include, but are not limited to, our ability and intention to:\n◦ Sustain growth or profitability, particularly in light of an uncertain U.S. or worldwide economy, recent global\nconflicts, inflationary pressures, elevated interest rates, and the prospect of a U.S. federal government shutdown, and\nthe related impact on customer acquisition and retention rates, customer usage levels and credit and debit card payment\ndeclines;\n◦ Maintain and increase our customer base and average revenue per user;\n◦ Generate sufficient cash flow to make interest and debt payments, reinvest in our business and pursue desired activities\nand business plans while satisfying restrictive covenants relating to debt obligations;\n◦ Acquire businesses on acceptable terms and successfully integrate and realize anticipated synergies from such\nacquisitions;\n◦ Continue to expand our Cloud Fax businesses and operations internationally in the wake of numerous risks, including\nadverse currency fluctuations, difficulty in staffing and managing international operations, higher operating costs as a\npercentage of revenues or the implementation of adverse regulations;\n◦ Maintain our financial position, operating results and cash flows in the event that we incur new or unanticipated costs\nor tax liabilities, including those relating to federal and state income tax and indirect taxes, such as sales, value-added\nand telecommunication taxes;\n◦ Accurately estimate the assumptions underlying our effective worldwide tax rate;\n◦ Manage risks from our international operations, including risks associated with currency fluctuations and foreign\nexchange controls and adverse changes in global financial markets;\n◦ Manage certain risks inherent to our business, such as costs associated with fraudulent activity, system failure or\nnetwork security breach; effectively maintaining and managing our billing systems; allocating time and resources\nrequired to manage our legal proceedings; liability for legal and other claims; or adhering to our internal controls and\nprocedures;\n◦ Compete with other similar providers with regard to price, service and functionality;\n◦ Cost-effectively procure, retain and deploy large quantities of fax numbers in desired locations in the United States and\nabroad;\n◦ Achieve business and financial objectives in light of burdensome domestic and international telecommunications,\ninternet or other regulations including data privacy, access, security and retention;\n◦ Successfully manage our growth, including but not limited to, our operational and personnel-related resources, and\nintegration of newly acquired businesses;\n◦ Successfully adapt to technological changes and diversify services and related revenues at acceptable levels of\nfinancial return;\n◦ Successfully develop and protect our intellectual property, both domestically and internationally, including our brands,\npatents, trademarks and domain names, and avoid infringing upon the proprietary rights of others;\n◦ Recruit and retain key personnel; and\n◦ Maintain favorable relationships with critical third-party vendors whose financial condition will not negatively impact\nthe services they provide.\n-23-\nIn addition, other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-\nlooking statements or materially impact our financial results include the risks associated with new accounting pronouncements,\nas well as those associated with natural disasters, public health crises and other catastrophic events outside of our control.\nOverview\nConsensus is a leading provider of secure information delivery services with a scalable Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”)\nplatform.

Its mission is\nto democratize secure information interchange across technologies and industries, and solve the healthcare interoperability\nchallenge. Consensus’ communication and interoperability solutions enable its customers to securely and cooperatively access,\nexchange and use information across organizational, regional and national boundaries.\nThe global economy continues to be impacted by macroeconomic uncertainty and volatility resulting from recent\nglobal conflicts, inflationary pressures, higher interest rates, supply chain disruptions and challenges as well as labor market\npressures, all of which could adversely impact the efficiency of our operations. We continue to actively monitor the situation\nand will continue to adapt our business operations as necessary.\nFor purposes of this management’s discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of\nConsensus (“MD&A”) section, we use the terms “the Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” to refer to Consensus.\n-24-\nKey Performance Metrics\nWe use the following metrics to generally assess the operational and financial performance of our business, including\nthe growth of our business, the value provided by customers to our business and our customer retention that provide insights\nthat contribute to certain of our business planning decisions. We believe these financial measures are useful to investors both\nbecause (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational\ndecision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health\nof our business.\nThe following table sets forth certain key performance metrics for our operations for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands, except for percentages and Average Revenue per Customer Account):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenue\nCorporate $ 53,085 $ 50,430 $ 156,195 $ 150,198\nSmall office home office (“SoHo”) 34,664 40,129 107,197 124,588\nTotal 87,749 90,559 263,392 274,786\nOther revenues 4 3 7 22\nConsolidated $ 87,753 $ 90,562 $ 263,399 $ 274,808\nAverage Revenue per Customer Account\n(“ARPA”) (1)(2)\nCorporate $ 310.13 $ 312.45 $ 312.13 $ 314.92\nSoHo $ 14.88 $ 15.31 $ 14.93 $ 15.37\nConsolidated $ 35.09 $ 32.54 $ 34.31 $ 32.02\nCustomer Accounts (1)\nCorporate 58 54 58 54\nSoHo 767 859 767 859\nConsolidated 825 913 825 913\nPaid Adds (3)\nCorporate 5 3 14 9\nSoHo 64 64 187 217\nConsolidated 69 67 201 226\nMonthly Churn % (4)\nCorporate 2.61 % 1.49 % 2.27 % 1.38 %\nSoHo 3.38 % 3.49 % 3.40 % 3.61 %\nConsolidated 3.33 % 3.37 % 3.33 % 3.48 %\n(1) Consensus customers are defined as paying Corporate and SoHo customer accounts.\n(2) Represents a monthly ARPA for the quarter or year-to-date period, calculated as follows: Monthly ARPA on a\nquarterly basis is calculated using our standard convention of dividing revenue for the quarter by the average of the\nquarter’s beginning and ending customer base and dividing that amount by 3 months. Monthly ARPA on a year-to-\ndate basis is calculated by dividing revenue for the year-to-date period by the average customer base for the applicable\nperiod and dividing that amount by the respective period. We believe ARPA provides investors an understanding of\nthe average monthly revenues we recognize per account associated within Consensus’ customer base. As ARPA varies\nbased on fixed subscription fee and variable usage components, we believe it can serve as a measure by which\ninvestors can evaluate trends in the types of services, levels of services and the usage levels of those services across\nConsensus’ customers.\n(3) Paid Adds represents paying new Consensus customer accounts added during the periods presented.\n-25-\n(4) Monthly churn represents paid monthly SoHo and Corporate customer accounts that were cancelled during each month\nof the quarter or year-to-date period divided by the average number of customers during each month of the same\nquarter or year-to-date period (including the paid adds). The period measured is the quarter or year-to-date and\nexpressed as a monthly churn rate over the respective period.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nIn the ordinary course of business, we have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of\nresults of operations and financial condition in the preparation of our financial statements. Actual results could differ\nsignificantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions. Our critical accounting policies are described in\nour 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 28, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30,\n2024, there were no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates.\nResults of Operations for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nThe main strategic focus of our Consensus offerings is to enable our customers to securely and cooperatively access,\nexchange and use information across organizational, regional and national boundaries.

Our sales personnel consist of a combination of inside sales and outside sales professionals.\nThe decrease in sales and marketing expenses of $2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 over the\nprior year comparable period was primarily due to a reduction in third party advertising spend of $2.7 million, predominantly in\nSoHo.\nThe decrease in sales and marketing expenses of $12.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 over the\nprior year comparable period was primarily due to a reduction in third party advertising spend of $12.8 million, predominantly\nin SoHo.\nResearch, Development and Engineering\nThree Months Ended Percentage Nine Months Ended Percentage\n(in thousands, except percentages) September 30, Change September 30, Change\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nResearch, development and engineering $2,034 $1,677 21% $5,582 $5,346 4%\nAs a percent of revenue 2% 2% 2% 2%\nOur research, development and engineering costs consist primarily of personnel-related expenses.\nThe increase in research, development and engineering for the three months ended September 30, 2024 over the prior\nyear comparable period was primarily due to an increase of $0.3 million in personnel-related expenses.\nThe increase in research, development and engineering for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 over the prior\nyear comparable period was primarily due to increases of $0.1 million in personnel-related expenses and $0.1 million in\ncomputer related expense.\nGeneral and Administrative\nThree Months Ended Percentage Nine Months Ended Percentage\n(in thousands, except percentages) September 30, Change September 30, Change\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nGeneral and administrative $17,136 $17,798 (4)% $53,240 $56,382 (6)%\nAs a percent of revenue 20% 20% 20% 21%\nOur general and administrative costs consist primarily of personnel-related expenses (inclusive of share-based\ncompensation), professional fees, depreciation and amortization and bad debt expense.\nThe decrease in general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 over the prior\nyear comparable period was primarily due to decreases of $0.7 million in non-income related tax expenses.\n-27-\nThe decrease in general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 over the prior year\ncomparable period was primarily due to decreases of $1.5 million in personnel-related expenses and $1.4 million in\nprofessional fees.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe following table represents share-based compensation expense included in cost of revenues and operating expenses\nin the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023 (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nCost of revenues $ 465 $ 309 $ 1,449 $ 939\nOperating expenses:\nSales and marketing 592 375 1,856 1,134\nResearch, development and engineering 95 61 260 153\nGeneral and administrative 2,270 3,009 8,045 11,331\nTotal $ 3,422 $ 3,754 $ 11,610 $ 13,557\nNon-Operating Income and Expenses\nInterest expense. Our interest expense is due to outstanding debt and is reduced by any capitalized interest. Interest\nexpense was $9.8 million and $12.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $24.6\nmillion and $38.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease between periods\nwas primarily due to the partial extinguishment of debt, resulting in a gain of $0.1 million and $6.7 million for the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.\nInterest income. Our interest income is generated from interest earned on cash and cash equivalents. Interest income\nwas $0.7 million and $1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $2.2 million and\n$2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest income for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 decreased compared to the prior year comparable period as the Company decreased its investment in\nmoney market funds in order to repurchase long-term debt. Interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was\nconsistent with the prior year comparable period.\nOther (expense) income, net. Our other (expense) income, net is generated primarily from foreign currency and\nmiscellaneous items. Other (expense) income, net was $(2.1) million and $3.7 million for the three months ended September\n30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $2.5 million and $3.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. The change between periods was primarily attributable to exchange rate fluctuations on intercompany balances\nbetween periods in foreign subsidiaries that were in functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar.\nIncome Taxes\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and in evaluating our tax positions on a\nworldwide basis. We believe our tax positions, including intercompany transfer pricing policies, are consistent with the tax laws\nin the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Certain of these tax positions have, in the past been challenged, and this\nmay have a significant impact on our effective tax rate if our tax reserves are insufficient.\nOur effective tax rate is based on pre-tax income, statutory tax rates, tax regulations and different tax rates in the\nvarious jurisdictions in which we operate. The tax basis of our assets and liabilities reflect our best estimate of the tax benefits\nand costs we expect to realize. When necessary, we establish valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to an\namount that will more likely than not be realized.\nThe provision for income taxes was $6.1 million and $7.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023, respectively, and $24.7 million and $18.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n-28-\nOur effective tax rate was 22.5% and 23.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively,\nand 25.7% and 23.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in our effective\nincome tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the change in the geographical mix of\nincome. The increase in our effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable\nto the change in the geographical mix of income, an increase in the valuation allowance and an increase in state taxes on foreign\nearnings not permanently reinvested.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $54.6 million compared to $88.7 million as of\nDecember 31, 2023. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents resulted primarily from cash used for debt repurchases,\ncapitalized expenditures and common stock repurchases, partially offset by cash provided by operations. As of September 30,\n2024, cash and cash equivalents held within domestic and foreign jurisdictions were $29.3 million and $25.3 million,\nrespectively.\nCredit Agreement\nOn March 4, 2022, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement with certain lenders party thereto (collectively, the\n“Lenders”) and MUFG Union Bank, N.A., as agent (the “Agent”). Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the Lenders have\nprovided Consensus with a revolving credit facility of $25.0 million (the “Credit Facility”) with an option held by the Company\nto obtain an additional commitment of up to a maximum of $25.0 million. The final maturity of the Credit Facility will occur on\nMarch 4, 2027. As of September 30, 2024, no amount had been drawn down on the Credit Facility.\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nOur long-term contractual obligations generally include our debt and related interest payments, noncancellable\noperating leases as well as other commitments. As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding $618.2 million in aggregate\nprincipal amount of indebtedness (see Note 7 - Long-Term Debt of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial\nStatements) and total minimum lease payments of $18.0 million, which had a weighted average remaining lease term of 5.9\nyears. As of September 30, 2024, our liability for uncertain tax positions was $11.9 million. Due to uncertainties in the timing\nof the amounts and timing of cash settlement with the taxing authorities, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate\nof the timing of payments.\nWe currently anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will be\nsufficient to fund our anticipated needs for working capital, capital expenditures, stock and debt repurchases, if any, for at least\nthe next 12 months and the foreseeable future.\nDebt Repurchase Program\nOn November 9, 2023, the Board of Directors approved a debt repurchase program, pursuant to which Consensus may\nreduce, through redemptions, open market purchases, tender offers, privately negotiated purchases or other retirements, a\ncombination of the outstanding principal balance of the 2026 Senior Notes and 2028 Senior Notes (“Debt Repurchase\nProgram”). The authorization permits an aggregate principal amount reduction of up to $300.0 million and expires on\nNovember 9, 2026. The timing and amounts of purchases will be determined by the Company, depending on market conditions\nand other factors it deems relevant. Any gains or losses on extinguishment of debt are recognized in interest expense on the\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Income. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had retired an aggregate of\n$186.8 million in principal of its senior notes under this program. In connection with the Company’s Debt Repurchase Program\n(see Note 7 - Long-Term Debt), the Company paid $9.2 million, which includes accrued interest, to repurchase $9.1 million in\nprincipal of its senior notes subsequent to the period ended September 30, 2024.\nCommon Stock Repurchase Program\nOn March 1, 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a share buyback program. Under this program, the\nCompany may purchase in the public market or in off-market transactions up to $100.0 million worth of the Company’s\ncommon stock through February 2025. The timing and amounts of purchases will be determined by the Company, depending\non market conditions and other factors it deems relevant. The Company entered into Rule 10b-18 and Rule 10b5-1 trading plans\n-29-\nunder this program. There were no shares repurchased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 under this program.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2023 the Company repurchased 152,399 shares under this program at an\naggregate cost of $3.8 million, inclusive of excise tax of $0.1 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023, the Company repurchased 42,962 and 490,953 shares, respectively, at an aggregate cost of $0.7 million and\n$15.1 million, respectively, inclusive of excise tax of zero and $0.1 million, respectively. Cumulatively as of September 30,\n2024, 1,071,624 shares have been repurchased under this program at an aggregate cost of $32.0 million (inclusive of excise tax\nof $0.2 million). The excise tax is assessed at 1% of the fair market value of net stock repurchases after December 31, 2022.\nVested Restricted Stock\nAt the time of certain vesting events related to restricted stock units or restricted stock awards that are held by\nparticipants in Consensus’ Equity Incentive Plan, a portion of the awards subject to vesting are withheld by the Company to\nsatisfy the employees’ tax withholding obligations that arise upon the vesting of restricted stock. As a result, the number of\nshares issued upon vesting for these awards is net of the statutory withholding requirements that the Company pays on behalf of\nits employees. Although shares withheld are not issued, they are treated as common share repurchases in the Company’s\ncondensed consolidated financial statements, as they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting.\nThese shares do not count against the authorized capacity under the Company’s share repurchase program described above.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company withheld shares on its vested restricted stock units\nand restricted stock awards relating to its share-based compensation plans of 3,489 shares and 2,412 shares, respectively.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company withheld shares on its vested restricted stock units\nand restricted stock awards relating to its share-based compensation plans of 40,396 shares and 35,368 shares, respectively.\nCash Flows\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations, together with cash and cash equivalents.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $110.6 million and $112.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023, respectively. Our operating cash flows resulted primarily from cash received from our customers offset by cash\npayments we made to third parties for their services and employee compensation. The decrease in our net cash provided by\noperating activities over the prior comparable period was primarily attributable to a decrease in our net working capital\naccounts of $3.4 million, partially offset by increased income of $1.9 million after excluding noncash items.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $25.5 million and $32.7 million for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities consisted of\ncapital expenditures associated with the purchase of property and equipment (including capitalized labor). The decrease in our\nnet cash used in investing activities over the prior comparable period was primarily attributable to less cash used for\ninvestments and capital expenditures associated with the purchase of property and equipment (including capitalized labor).\nNet cash used in financing activities was $116.8 million and $14.1 million for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was primarily\nattributable to cash outlays the Company used to repurchase a portion of its outstanding senior notes debt facilities. For the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to cash used to repurchase\ncommon stock. The change in net cash used in financing activities over the prior comparable period was primarily attributable\nto an increase in cash outflows related to the repurchase of our debt in the current period, which was absent in the prior period,\npartially offset by a decrease in the repurchases of the Company’s common stock.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThe following discussion of the market risks we face contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements\nare subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking\nstatements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect\nmanagement’s opinions only as of the date hereof. Consensus undertakes no obligation to revise or publicly release the results\nof any revision to these forward-looking statements, except as required by law. Readers should carefully review the risk factors\ndescribed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as well as in other documents we file\nfrom time to time with the SEC, including the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and any Current Reports on Form 8-K filed or\nto be filed by us in 2024.\n-30-\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these\ninstruments. As of September 30, 2024, the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents approximated fair value. Our return\non these investments is subject to interest rate fluctuations.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalent investments, primarily in money\nmarket funds and cash held in foreign and domestic bank accounts, of $54.6 million and $88.7 million, respectively. We do not\nhave interest rate risk on our outstanding long-term debt as these arrangements have fixed interest rates.\nWe cannot ensure that future interest rate movements will not have a material adverse effect on our future business,\nprospects, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. To date, we have not entered into interest rate hedging\ntransactions to control or minimize certain of these risks.\nForeign Currency Risk\nOur principal exposure to foreign currency risk relates to investment and intercompany debt in foreign subsidiaries that\ntransact business in functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, primarily the Euro and the Japanese Yen. If we are unable\nto settle our short-term intercompany debts in a timely manner, we remain exposed to foreign currency fluctuations.\nAs we expand our international presence, we become further exposed to foreign currency risk by entering new markets\nwith additional foreign currencies. The economic impact of currency exchange rate movements is often linked to variability in\nreal growth, inflation, interest rates, governmental actions and other factors. These changes, if material, could cause us to adjust\nour financing and operating strategies.\nAs currency exchange rates change, translation of the income statements of the international businesses into U.S.\nDollars affects year-over-year comparability of operating results, the impact of which is immaterial to the comparisons set forth\nin this Form 10-Q.\nHistorically, we have not hedged translation risks because cash flows from international operations were generally\nreinvested locally; however, we may do so in the future. Our objective in managing foreign exchange risk is to minimize the\npotential exposure to changes that exchange rates might have on earnings, cash flows and our financial position. We currently\ndo not have derivative financial instruments for hedging, speculative or trading purposes and therefore are not subject to such\nhedging risk. However, we may in the future engage in hedging transactions to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign\ncurrency exchange rates.\nForeign exchange (loss) gain was $(2.1) million and $3.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023, respectively. Foreign exchange gain was $2.5 million and $3.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023, respectively. The change in foreign exchange gain was primarily attributable to the translation of certain intra-entity\nbalances in foreign currencies.\nCumulative translation adjustment gain (loss), included in other comprehensive income, was $6.1 million and $(6.2)\nmillion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cumulative translation adjustment loss,\nincluded in other comprehensive income, was $1.6 million and $4.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023, respectively.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\n(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed\nin the Company’s reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods\nspecified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and\ncommunicated to the Company’s management, including the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer, as\nappropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and\nprincipal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such\n-31-\nterm is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the quarterly period ended\nSeptember 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures were effective, at a reasonable assurance level.\nLimitations on the Effectiveness of Controls\nOur disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable\nassurance of achieving their objectives as specified above. Management does not expect, however, that our disclosure controls\nand procedures will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is\nbased on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further,\nno evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all\ncontrol issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.\n(b) Changes in Internal Controls\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the\nExchange Act) which occurred during the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are\nreasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nPart II - Other Information\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nSee Note 8 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Part\nI, Item 1) for information regarding certain legal proceedings in which we are involved.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part\n1, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as well as in other\ndocuments we file from time to time. There have been no material changes to the risk factors from those described in our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nItem 2.

Scott Turicchi\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Consensus Cloud Solutions, Inc.\nThank you, Adam. We had another strong quarter in Q3, beating our expectations for revenue adjusted EBITDA\nand adjusted non-GAAP net income per share. The outperformance occurred in both channels of revenue. This,\ncombined with our disciplined approach to cost, resulted in another quarter of excellent EBITDA performance and\nan EBITDA margin above the midpoint of our range of 50% to 55%. As we laid out in our Q4 2023 earnings call,\nour goals for this year include, first, eliminating certain costs of the SoHo channel, especially in the area of\nmarketing to provide for stabilization of the base of revenue over time, which Johnny will address in his remarks.\nTwo, continuing to pursue the acquisition of customers primarily in the healthcare space for our Corporate\nchannel. Three, reviewing our overall cost structure with the goal of driving adjusted EBITDA margins north of\n54%. I would note it's 54.7% for the nine months. And four, continuing the repurchase of our debt to further\nreduce our total debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio in anticipation of the first tranche maturing in October of 2026.\nOur Corporate channel had the best revenue growth in six quarters. The 5.3% growth was driven by new\ncustomer additions and record usage for a quarter. The new adds came primarily through our e-commerce efforts\nof eFax Protect, supplemented by upgrades from our SoHo base as well as several key enterprise\nwins.Notwithstanding the lower ARPA of eFax Protect customers than our current average, we were still able to\nmaintain a $310 ARPA per customer in a tight range over the past several quarters. As predicted, we continue to\nsee additional sites from the VA rollout driving new levels of usage and revenue. In addition, we saw a return to\n100% LTM revenue retention in our Corporate channel.\nOur SoHo revenues beat our expectations for the quarter. The rate of decline slowed from Q2 and we expect that\nthere will be a reduction in the pace of decline in 2025. We continue to track ahead of our 2024 budget and have\ntested additional marketing opportunities while maintaining a strong LTV-to-CAC. We were able to substantially\nreduce our marketing spend and still generate 64,000 paid adds similar to Q3 2023 and more adds than in the\npreceding three quarters. The combination of robust adjusted EBITDA, strong cash collections and retirement of\ndebt allowed us to generate free cash flow of approximately $34 million. The change in free cash flow from the\nprior year is driven by the timing of tax payments, which Jim will address in more detail.\nWe were also able to repurchase an additional $31.1 million of debt in the quarter. This brings our total\nrepurchases since launching the program in November 2023 to $187 million and reducing our outstanding total\ndebt to $618 million or 3.2 times our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA and 2.9 times on a net debt basis to our\nadjusted EBITDA. Jim will discuss our guidance for Q4 and the fiscal year in his portion of the presentation.\nHowever, I would like to note that Q4 usually has the fewest business days of the four quarters. And since\napproximately one-third of our total revenues are usage-based, this puts downward pressure on Q4 revenues\nrelative to Q3. This year however the calendar is the most punitive as Christmas and New Year's Day both fall on\na Wednesday. Based on historical analysis, we have compensated for this in the calculation of our Q4 business\ndays. As a result, we expect approximately 61 business days in Q4 of 2024, which is one and a quarter business\ndays less than Q4 of 2023 and approximately three and a quarter business days less than Q3 of 2024.\nI will now turn the call over to Johnny to provide more operational updates.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJohnny Hecker\nExecutive Vice President-Operations & Chief Revenue Officer, Consensus Cloud Solutions, Inc.\nThank you, Scott, and hello, everyone. I will provide an update on operations and go-to-market for the Corporate\nand SoHo businesses respectively, including details on revenue, customer counts and go-to-market strategy. Q3\n3\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nConsensus Cloud Solutions, Inc.\n(CCSI) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 07-Nov-2024\nwas another record revenue quarter for our Corporate business. I'm very pleased with our growth and the\nincreased momentum resulting in another solid performance in Q3. Our revenue for the third quarter increased by\napproximately 5.3% compared to the same period last year, the highest rate in the last six quarters. We have\nreached a total of $53.1 million, up from $50.4 million in Q3 of the previous year, particularly Cloud Fax, especially\nin healthcare, showed solid consumption growth within our existing customer base while we were able to\nimplement and ramp recently one new customers across the board.\nOur Corporate customer count has reached roughly 58,000, the highest ever for Consensus. And I am pleased to\nreport that Corporate ARPA has maintained flat quarter-over-quarter at $310 and well within the stable $305 to\n$320 dollars range for eight quarters now. Driven by automation, e-commerce and SoHo upsell to Corporate\nadded over 3,000 customers to the overall Corporate account base in Q3, another significant increase since last\nquarter. Our eFax Protect service is experiencing sustained growth. To further capitalize on this momentum, we're\ninvesting in its expansion as outlined in the go-to-market strategy we presented last year. While the recently\nintroduced in-product upsell options from SoHo to Corporate has been successful in reducing the need for direct\ncustomer interaction and driving growth, we're seeing this upsell strategy plateau after many successful quarters.\nMoving forward, we'll maintain this profitable program but continue to shift our focus towards e-commerce as the\nprimary driver for acquiring small Corporate accounts.\nThe success and growth of Corporate accounts on the lower end of the ARPA spectrum, driven by those new\ncustomers acquired through the e-commerce channel or upsell from SoHo, continues to influence the Corporate\ncancellation rate. It has increased by 112 basis points year-over-year and 32 basis points quarter-over-quarter\nreaching 2.61% in Q3 of 2024. It is important to note that our cancellation rate is calculated on a per account\nbasis rather than on revenue. As a result, we believe that the revenue retention metric is more relevant than the\ncancellation rate. Our dedication to customer retention, upselling and cross-selling is yielding positive results with\na modest increase in revenue retention to 100% over the past 12 months in the Corporate channel. This is\nanother encouraging indicator of our momentum and remarkable success in the Corporate revenue channel.\nI am pleased that our go-to-market plan for 2024 is unfolding successfully. The green shoots we have previously\nmentioned are driving revenue growth across our entire customer base. As service utilization continues to rise,\ncustomers who have made a purchase are demonstrating a strong commitment to swift adoption.\nLet me share a quick update on the VA. The implementation of ECFax at the Department of Veterans Affairs is\nprogressing as planned. We have observed steady growth that is aligned with our projections and allows us to\nconfidently confirm the forecast of over $2 million in revenue from the ECFax program in 2024. As we move\nforward, we anticipate sustained growth in the coming months and years, further solidifying the program's success\nat and beyond the VA. In-line with our vision for 2025, our core fax business remains our primary focus. We\nmaintain our commitment to investing in the ongoing development and enhancement of our Cloud Fax platform.\nWith customer satisfaction at the forefront, we are consistently working to improve the platform while ensuring our\ncontinued economic success. Clarity, which features AI technology, continues to generate significant interest\namong potential customers. We're actively engaged in implementing the solution for clients. Simultaneously,\nwe're diligently addressing our increasing backlog of proof-of-concepts to ensure that all interested parties have\nthe opportunity to experience the capabilities of Clarity.\nI am now shifting to the SoHo channel. In the third quarter, the SoHo business generated a revenue of $34.7\nmillion, a decrease from the previous year's $40.1 million. This represents a decline rate of 13.6%, which is a\nslower decline compared to the previous quarter. The total SoHo account base has also slightly decreased from\n785,000 to 768,000 during the quarter. Despite experiencing this decline, our SoHo business manages to\nmodestly exceed expectations, showcasing the robust strength of our brand portfolio, particularly exemplified by\n4\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nConsensus Cloud Solutions, Inc.\n(CCSI) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 07-Nov-2024\neFax. The introduction of new first-month discounted pricing plans across several brands has proven effective in\nboosting revenue velocity within SoHo. Moreover, in Q3, the average revenue per account remained relatively\nstable at $14.88. Additionally, the cancel rate showed a modest sequential improvement to 3.38% compared to\n3.49% in Q3 of the previous year.\nLooking ahead, we remained focused on executing our strategy for the SoHo business, maintaining profitable\nstability and optimizing current operations and resources. Rather than pursuing aggressive growth strategies, we\naim to leverage our existing strength and offerings to ensure the long-term sustainability of our business in this\nmarket. Our smarter ad spend strategy designed to enhance customer acquisition profitability has delivered\nsustained success. We've maintained a focused on automating and optimizing this program, resulting in marginal\noutperformance across all brands compared to our projected outcomes. The synergy between our digital\nadvertising strategy and SCO initiatives have been instrumental in optimizing our LTV-to-CAC ratio. By integrating\nthese channels, we have achieved a holistic and comprehensive approach to digital marketing, effectively\nreaching our target audience and driving profitable customer acquisition.\nIn closing, I'd like to provide an update on the current market conditions. While they remain less than optimal,\nwe've been successful in navigating around the challenges and building a sales pipeline resulting in closing new\ncustomers across our customer spectrum, particularly multi-location and specialty healthcare, as well as state and\nlocal government have shown promising results. Also, some positive signs are emerging. Macroeconomic\nuncertainties persist. Despite these, we stay committed to our strategy prioritizing cash generation and\nprofitability. Our go-to-market efforts will continue to focus on driving growth within the Corporate business.\nWith that, I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our employees for their extraordinary commitment and to our\ncustomers and partners for their continued collaboration and trust.\nAnd now I will hand the call over to our CFO, Jim Malone, who will provide an update about our financial results\nand guidance. Over to you, Jim.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJames C. Malone\nChief Financial Officer, Consensus Cloud Solutions, Inc.\nThank you, Johnny. And good afternoon, everyone. In our press release and in our earnings call today, we are\ndisclosing Q3 2024 results plus Q4 2024 and 2024 full-year guidance. We expect to file our Q3 10-Q today.\nLet's go over to our Corporate business results. Q3 2024 revenue was a record $53.1 million, up $2.7 million or\n5.3% versus prior year and performing better than expectations. Corporate ARPA of $310 was essentially flat with\nthe prior quarter and in-line with the last several quarters, ranging from $305 to $320. Q3 2024 customer churn of\n2.61% increased 112 basis points year-over-year and 32 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by customer\nchurn at the lower end of the customer continuum. Normalized for eFax Protect, the cancel rate would have been\napproximately 2%. Notwithstanding this, these customers are net economically beneficial. I would also like to\nrepeat Johnny's comment that our cancel rate is calculated on a per account basis. A better measure is revenue\nretention, which came in at 100% over the trailing 12 months, a 1% improvement sequentially.\nSoHo results. Q3 2024 revenue of $34.7 million is a decrease of $5.5 million or 13.6% over the prior year and in-\nline with expectations. As mentioned previously, this decrease is driven by our planned reduction in advertising\nspend and the corresponding year-over-year base reduction due to lower paid adds. ARPA of $14.88, decreased\n2.8% year-over-year as a result of the shifting to price plans with a discounted first month versus a free trial.\nThese plans are net economically benefit. It should be noted that year-over-year paid adds were flat amid an\n5\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nConsensus Cloud Solutions, Inc.\n(CCSI) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 07-Nov-2024\napproximate 40% lower spend as we continued to optimize our advertising campaigns. Churn declined 11 basis\npoints to 3.38% year-over-year and 2 basis points sequentially in-line with expectations.\nMoving to consolidated results. Q3 revenue of $87.8 million is a decrease of $2.8 million or 3.1% over Q3 2023,\nagain in-line with expectations. Adjusted EBITDA of $46.9 million, a decrease of $0.6 million or 1.2% over Q3\n2023 was ahead of expectations and driven by lower revenue, partially offset by cost structure optimization,\nprimarily in the area of SoHo advertising. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 53.5% was 100 basis points better than the\nprior-year comparable period, delivering a solid EBITDA margin amid continued cost optimization. Adjusted net\nincome of $25.5 million is a decrease of $4.2 million or 14.3% over prior year, driven primarily by a $5.8 million\nnon-cash foreign exchange reevaluation of intercompany balances, partially offset by lower interest expenses on\nthe success of our bond repurchase program and lower income taxes. Adjusted EPS of $1.31 is lower than the\nprior year by 13.2% or $0.20, driven by the items previously mentioned and a modestly lower share count. Q3\n2024 non-GAAP tax rate and share count was approximately 19% and approximately 19.4 million shares.\nAs mentioned in our Q3 November 2023 earnings call, we announced a $300 million three-year bond repurchase\nprogram. In Q3 2024, we repurchased $31.1 million face value for $30.6 million cash. Program to-date, we have\nrepurchased $187 million face value for $173 million cash and have approximately $113 million bond repurchases\nremaining under this program. With the debt repurchases just mentioned, total debt-to-adjusted EBITDA is 3.2\ntimes and net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio is 2.9 times. We're getting very close to achieving our total debt-to-\nadjusted EBITDA target of 3 times.\nWe ended Q3 2024 with $55 million in cash, which is sufficient to fund our operations and repurchases of debt\nand equity. Q3 2024 free cash flow is $33.6 million versus $49.9 million in the prior comparable period. This\ndecrease was probably primarily due to a foreign tax refund and the deferral of Q2 and Q3 2023 federal income\ntax payments under the California Disaster Recovery – Relief Act, which were subsequently paid in Q4 2023. Q3\n2024 CapEx of $8 million is down $2 million or 20% versus the prior year.\nNow, let's talk about guidance going forward here. Q4 2024 guidance. Revenues between $83 million and\n$87million with $85 million at the midpoint. Adjusted EBITDA between $42 million and $45 million with $43.5\nmillion at the midpoint. Adjusted EPS of $1.14 to $1.24 with a $1.19 at the midpoint. Q4 estimated share count\nand income tax rate are 19.5 million shares and 19.5% to 21.5% tax rate.\nMoving to full year. Our revenue and adjusted EBITDA range has been narrowed within previously provided\nguidance based on year-to-date Q3 2024 performance, plus our Q4 2024 guidance range. Revenues between\n$346 million and $350 million. Adjusted EBITDA between $186 million and $189 million. Adjusted EPS between\n$5.45 to $5.55. Therefore, we're narrowing the full-year 2024 revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance while\nmaintaining adjusted EPS range of $5.45 to $5.55. Our estimated share count and non-GAAP income tax rate are\n19.5 million shares and 19.5% to 21.5% tax rate.\nThat concludes my formal comments. Now, I'd like to turn the call back to the operator.\n6\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nConsensus Cloud Solutions, Inc.\n(CCSI) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 07-Nov-2024\nQUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And\nthe first question today is coming from David Larsen from BTIG. David, your line is live.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJenny Shen Q\nAnalyst, BTIG LLC\nHi. This is Jenny Shen on for Dave. Congrats on the quarter and thanks for the question. I'm just doubling down\non the hospital environment right now. I know the general consensus has been that it's kind of a two-sided coin\nwith some hospitals doing better than others. Just broadly speaking, what are you guys seeing in terms of the\nlabor and inflation trends for hospital? And also whether you think the recent election or even CMS's recent\nphysician fee schedule will have any impact on your hospital customers if they have said anything yet so far?\nThanks.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJohnny Hecker A\nExecutive Vice President-Operations & Chief Revenue Officer, Consensus Cloud Solutions, Inc.\nYeah. Hi, Jenny. And thank you for the question. This is Johnny. I think it's a really good question. And you\npartially answered it already, right. Some hospitals are doing well. Others are struggling. I think I mentioned it in\nthe call, right, we see the green shoots actually growing and converting. So I think we've found a way, especially\nin the specialty healthcare space, in the multi-location healthcare providers, where we can find customers with, let\nme call it, accelerated interest and conversion. So, while we still have some very large clients that take their time\nand we still see continued headwinds in that area, we have found ways to convert and actually ramp new\ncustomers. So, like you said, it's a diverse environment out there and some customers are really accelerating,\nwhich is encouraging. Even more encouraging that we find them and can engage with them and others continue\nto be slow.\nFrom the question about the administrative change and the new rules from the CMS, we don't see any particular\nimpact on our business at this point. I don't know, Scott, if you want to...?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nR. Scott Turicchi A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Consensus Cloud Solutions, Inc.\nNo. I think you had a third question, which is about the election and any impact it might have specifically on\ncustomer acquisition. My guess is generally the answer is going to be no. Obviously, there's a lot of unknowns at\nthis point. There's still an undecided House race. And so I think if you listen to even Chairman Powell today on the\ninterest rate cut and his commentary going forward, two things. One, there's a lot of unknowns because we don't\nhave a settled Congress; and two, a lot of the policies that have been talked about and may be implemented are\nprobably still months in the future in terms of getting through, even a unified Congress and then actually getting\nimplemented.\nSo, it's obviously something we will watch. There's all kinds of different pieces to it obviously but how does it\naffect the economy? Generally interest rates, you can see already moving around. Tax implications, there's a\nwhole myriad of things but I think it's too early to call. But, in general, I would say that elections and the different\nparties that can be in control of a divided government doesn't have a huge impact on our customer acquisition,\ngo-to-market strategy. Clearly, if things either give an accelerant to the economy or a headwind that could have\nan impact. But in terms of the direct correlation, I'd say it's generally weak.\n7\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nConsensus Cloud Solutions, Inc.\n(CCSI) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 07-Nov-2024\nJenny Shen Q\nAnalyst, BTIG LLC\nGot it.

I will\nnow hand the call back to Scott Turicchi for closing remarks.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nR. Scott Turicchi\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Consensus Cloud Solutions, Inc.\nGreat. Well, thank you very much for joining us today. It was obviously a very busy day to report earnings. So, if\nany of you, in listening to the replay or reading the transcript have questions, please feel free to reach out to us.\nWe will have probably one or two conferences between now and our next reporting period, which we'll target for\nthe third week of February. Of course on that call, we will discuss not only the Q4 results but we'll release 2025\nguidance on revenues, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP earnings per share as much as we've done this year. So\nwe look forward to talking to you in the interim and then giving you that update in about three months. Thank you.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Thank you.

The Company discloses Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental non-GAAP financial performance measure, as it believes it is a useful metric by which to compare the performance of its business from period to period. The Company also understands that\nmeasures similar to Adjusted EBITDA are broadly used by analysts, rating agencies and investors in assessing our performance.Accordingly, the Company believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors.\nAdjusted EBITDA is not calculated in accordance with, or presented as an alternative to, net income, and may be different from similarly or identically named non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. This\nAdjusted non-GAAP measure has limitations in that it does not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations determined in accordance with GAAP.\n©2024 Consensus Cloud Solutions Inc.
