(Nasdaq: SNSE), a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of next-generation therapeutics for cancer patients, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and provided corporate updates.\n\n“The third quarter of 2024 saw significant progress in advancing patient enrollment in the dose expansion portion of the Phase 1 study for SNS-101 across dose levels and patients with primary and acquired resistance to PD-1 inhibitors. Looking ahead, management has focused its attention on preparing for Phase 2 studies,” said John Celebi, President and Chief Executive Officer. “We believe SNS-101 has disruptive potential for the treatment of a multitude of cancer indications and for this reason we are making the difficult decision to reduce our headcount to focus our resources on advancing the clinical development of SNS-101. We anticipate that these changes will extend our cash runway into the second quarter of 2026. We look forward to sharing a clinical update focused primarily on the activity profile of SNS-101 and additional details about the design of Phase 2 studies. I want to express my gratitude to all our affected employees for the contributions they have made to the Company.”\n\n**Clinical Highlights and Milestones**\n\n_SNS-101_\n\nSNS-101 is a conditionally active antibody designed to selectively target the immune checkpoint VISTA (V-domain Ig suppressor of T cell activation) within the tumor microenvironment. VISTA is implicated in numerous cancer indications and its expression correlates with low survival rates.\n\nSensei is conducting a multi-center Phase 1/2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of SNS-101 as both a monotherapy and in combination with Regeneron’s PD-1 inhibitor Libtayo® (cemiplimab) in patients with advanced solid tumors.\n\n  * Patient enrollment is advancing in the dose expansion portion of the Phase 1/2 study, with approximately half of the dose expansion study enrolled. To further the Company’s objective of generating clinical data that informs both the optimal dose and patient population for Phase 2 studies, including comprehensive data from patients with both primary and acquired resistance to PD-1 inhibitors, the Company expects to report clinical data across two dose levels in multiple tumor types in the first half of 2025.\n  * Sensei received preliminary guidance from the FDA on the dose optimization strategy for SNS-101. The Company plans to re-engage with the agency following additional data from the dose expansion portion of the Phase 1/2 clinical trial.\n  * SNS-101 continues to be well tolerated with a best-in-class pharmacological profile among anti-VISTA antibodies.\n  * In November, Sensei presented an overview of SNS-101 at PEGS Europe: Protein and Antibody Engineering Summit.\n  * [In November](https://investors.senseibio.com/static-files/735ec33f-9355-4cb8-af47-0856f9a284bd), the Company presented data on spatial proteomic profiling of VISTA and PSGL-1 interactions across cancer indications in a poster presentation at the Society of Immunotherapy Cancer (SITC) 39th Annual Meeting.\n\n\n\n**_Corporate Updates_**\n\n  * Sensei is announcing an organizational restructuring to streamline operations and focus resources on advancing the clinical development of SNS-101. The Company will close its research site in Rockville, Maryland and reduce its workforce by approximately 46 percent, with most of the headcount reductions in the Company’s preclinical research and development group. These changes are anticipated to extend cash runway into the second quarter of 2026.\n  * In July, the Company announced the appointment of Josiah Craver as Senior Vice President, Finance. In September, Josiah was appointed as the Company’s principal financial officer and principal accounting officer.\n\n\n\n**_Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results_**\n\n**Cash Position:** Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $47.0 million as of September 30, 2024. Sensei expects its current cash balance to fund operations into the second quarter of 2026.\n\n**Research and Development (R &D) Expenses: **R&D expenses were $4.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $3.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase in R&D expenses was primarily attributable to higher expense associated with clinical trials, personnel costs and manufacturing related expense partially offset by lower costs for preclinical research and lower consulting fees.\n\n**General and Administrative (G &A) Expenses: **G&A expenses were $3.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $3.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in G&A expense was primarily attributable to decreased costs associated with insurance premiums as well as lower outside services expense, personnel costs and license fees.\n\n**Net Loss:** Net loss was $7.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $7.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. \n\n**About Sensei Biotherapeutics** Sensei Biotherapeutics (Nasdaq: SNSE) is a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of next-generation therapeutics for cancer patients.

Sensei’s lead investigational candidate is SNS-101, a conditionally active antibody designed to block the V-domain Ig suppressor of T cell activation (VISTA) checkpoint selectively within the low pH tumor microenvironment, where VISTA acts as a suppressor of T cells by binding the receptor PSGL-1. The company is also developing SNS-102, a conditionally active monoclonal antibody targeting V-Set and Immunoglobulin Domain Containing 4 (VSIG-4); SNS-103, a conditionally active monoclonal antibody targeting ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase-1 (ENTPDase1), also known as CD39; and SNS-201, a conditionally active VISTAxCD28 bispecific antibody consisting of a CD28 agonist arm and a pH-sensitive anti-VISTA arm.
