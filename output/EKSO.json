(Nasdaq: EKSO) (the “Company”), an industry leader in exoskeleton technology for medical and industrial use, today reported financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Recent Highlights and Accomplishments**\n\n  * Reported revenue of $4.1 million in the third quarter of 2024\n  * Sold a total of 33 EksoHealth devices in the third quarter of 2024\n  * Announced receipt of initial Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) reimbursement for Ekso Indego Personal\n  * Achieved gross margin of 53.5% in the third quarter of 2024\n  * Completed underwritten offering resulting in net proceeds of approximately $5.0 million in September 2024 \n\n\n\n“The receipt of initial CMS reimbursement through our Durable Medical Equipment Medicare Administrative Contractors (“DMEs”) for our Ekso Indego Personal was a major milestone for us and, importantly, spinal cord injury (“SCI”) patients, allowing those covered by Medicare to access the transformative mobility benefits of our Ekso Indego Personal at home and in community settings,” said Scott Davis, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. “With a growing number of CMS claim submissions in our pipeline, we are actively collaborating with our network of existing neuro-rehabilitation facilities, physicians, and DMEs to lay the groundwork for future sales. Going forward, we remain focused on expanding access to our family of EksoHealth devices across the continuum of care while getting back on pace as procurement cycles with Integrated Delivery Networks (“IDNs”) normalize in the near-term.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nRevenue was $4.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $4.6 million for the same period in 2023.

The increase in gross margin was primarily driven by cost savings in supply chain and a reduction in service costs, partially offset by lower margin sales related to increased volume through distribution.\n\nSales and marketing expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were $1.8 million, compared to $2.1 million for the same period in 2023. The 14% decrease was primarily due to lower headcount, discretionary payroll, and travel expenses.\n\nResearch and development expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were $0.8 million, compared to $1.2 million for the same period in 2023. The 33% decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the use of product development consultants.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were $2.3 million, compared to $2.2 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher consulting costs.\n\nNet loss applicable to common stockholders for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 narrowed to $2.1 million, or $0.10 per basic and diluted share, from a net loss of $3.4 million, or $0.24 per basic and diluted share, for the same period in 2023.\n\n**Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024**\n\nRevenue was $12.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $13.4 million for the same period in 2023. The Company sold a total of 99 EksoHealth devices in the first nine months of 2024.\n\nGross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $6.8 million, representing a gross margin of approximately 53%, compared to gross profit of $6.7 million for the same period in 2023, representing a gross margin of 50%. The increase in gross margin was primarily driven by cost savings in supply chain and a reduction in service costs.\n\nSales and marketing expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $5.4 million, compared to $6.5 million the same period in 2023. The 16% decrease was primarily due to lower headcount, discretionary payroll, and consultant costs.\n\nResearch and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $3.0 million, compared to $3.7 million for the same period in 2023. The 18% decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the use of product development consultants and lower discretionary payroll costs.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $6.6 million, compared to $8.2 million for the same period in 2023. The 20% decrease was primarily due to lower discretionary payroll, accounting, and legal costs.\n\nNet loss applicable to common stockholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $7.9 million, or $0.42 per basic and diluted share, compared to net loss of $12.0 million, or $0.88 per basic and diluted share, for the same period in 2023.\n\nCash on hand on September 30, 2024 was $8.3 million, compared to $8.6 million at December 31, 2023. In September 2024, the Company closed a firm commitment underwritten public offering, resulting in net proceeds to the Company of approximately $5.0 million.

(Nasdaq: EKSO) (the “Company”), an industry leader in exoskeleton technology for medical and industrial use, today reported financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Recent Highlights and Accomplishments**\n\n  * Reported revenue of $4.1 million in the third quarter of 2024\n  * Sold a total of 33 EksoHealth devices in the third quarter of 2024\n  * Announced receipt of initial Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) reimbursement for Ekso Indego Personal\n  * Achieved gross margin of 53.5% in the third quarter of 2024\n  * Completed underwritten offering resulting in net proceeds of approximately $5.0 million in September 2024 \n\n\n\n“The receipt of initial CMS reimbursement through our Durable Medical Equipment Medicare Administrative Contractors (“DMEs”) for our Ekso Indego Personal was a major milestone for us and, importantly, spinal cord injury (“SCI”) patients, allowing those covered by Medicare to access the transformative mobility benefits of our Ekso Indego Personal at home and in community settings,” said Scott Davis, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. “With a growing number of CMS claim submissions in our pipeline, we are actively collaborating with our network of existing neuro-rehabilitation facilities, physicians, and DMEs to lay the groundwork for future sales. Going forward, we remain focused on expanding access to our family of EksoHealth devices across the continuum of care while getting back on pace as procurement cycles with Integrated Delivery Networks (“IDNs”) normalize in the near-term.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nRevenue was $4.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $4.6 million for the same period in 2023. The Company sold a total of 33 EksoHealth devices in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nGross profit for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was $2.2 million, representing a gross margin of approximately 53.5%, compared to $2.5 million for the same period in 2023, representing a gross margin of 53.3%. The increase in gross margin was primarily driven by cost savings in supply chain and a reduction in service costs, partially offset by lower margin sales related to increased volume through distribution.\n\nSales and marketing expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were $1.8 million, compared to $2.1 million for the same period in 2023. The 14% decrease was primarily due to lower headcount, discretionary payroll, and travel expenses.\n\nResearch and development expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were $0.8 million, compared to $1.2 million for the same period in 2023. The 33% decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the use of product development consultants.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were $2.3 million, compared to $2.2 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher consulting costs.\n\nNet loss applicable to common stockholders for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 narrowed to $2.1 million, or $0.10 per basic and diluted share, from a net loss of $3.4 million, or $0.24 per basic and diluted share, for the same period in 2023.\n\n**Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024**\n\nRevenue was $12.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $13.4 million for the same period in 2023. The Company sold a total of 99 EksoHealth devices in the first nine months of 2024.\n\nGross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $6.8 million, representing a gross margin of approximately 53%, compared to gross profit of $6.7 million for the same period in 2023, representing a gross margin of 50%. The increase in gross margin was primarily driven by cost savings in supply chain and a reduction in service costs.\n\nSales and marketing expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $5.4 million, compared to $6.5 million the same period in 2023. The 16% decrease was primarily due to lower headcount, discretionary payroll, and consultant costs.\n\nResearch and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $3.0 million, compared to $3.7 million for the same period in 2023. The 18% decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the use of product development consultants and lower discretionary payroll costs.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $6.6 million, compared to $8.2 million for the same period in 2023. The 20% decrease was primarily due to lower discretionary payroll, accounting, and legal costs.\n\nNet loss applicable to common stockholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $7.9 million, or $0.42 per basic and diluted share, compared to net loss of $12.0 million, or $0.88 per basic and diluted share, for the same period in 2023.\n\nCash on hand on September 30, 2024 was $8.3 million, compared to $8.6 million at December 31, 2023. In September 2024, the Company closed a firm commitment underwritten public offering, resulting in net proceeds to the Company of approximately $5.0 million.
