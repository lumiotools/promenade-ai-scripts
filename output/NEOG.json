In our Food Safety segment, we saw encouraging initial traction from our targeted share-gain activities and generated positive core revenue growth while continuing to navigate soft end-market conditions. In our Animal Safety segment, the end market is near what we believe are cyclical lows. However, sales of our products to end users remained supportive, with the decline in core revenue driven by a combination of mixed channel inventory movements at our distribution partners and timing impacts. Operationally, our margins in the quarter were affected by the lower total volumes, as well as some higher costs in the area of shipping and distribution. We have mitigating initiatives currently underway and will be taking additional targeted actions to protect margins.”\n\nAdent continued, “The value proposition of Neogen’s food safety solutions and expertise has never been more relevant than it is today. We provide an important and relatively inexpensive line of defense in the rapid detection of contaminants in the production and distribution of food and beverages. As evidenced by some unfortunate higher-profile incidents recently, contaminated products reaching consumers is something we all work to avoid. Beyond the obvious tragic consequences that can result, the costs of any associated recalls, litigation, brand damage or even facility closures can be tremendous. In addition to our broad portfolio of globally validated products, we have longstanding experience as a trusted partner that we’re able to leverage in structuring robust food safety testing programs to help avoid these outcomes. Our commercial teams are having an increasing amount of constructive dialogue with customers on this front and we’re looking forward to continuing to demonstrate our capabilities as a reliable, knowledgeable source of leading food safety testing solutions.”\n\n[Read the Full Press Release](/4ab206/globalassets/pdfs/quarterly-and-annual-forms/fy2025-q1-results.pdf)\n\nfacebook\n\ntwitter\n\nlinkedin\n\nCategory: Earnings\n\n[ ](# \"Scroll to Top\")\n\nBy clicking “Accept All Cookies”, you agree to the storing of cookies on your device to enhance site navigation, analyze site usage, and assist in our marketing efforts. \n\nReject All Accept All Cookies\n\nCookies Settings\n\n![Company Logo](https://cdn.cookielaw.org/logos/b7d23954-35b5-4371-a714-b05f78a4ac7c/01912e7a-5c0e-7092-bb14-f2e83affffff/32b87ff0-c25e-4424-9aee-82549c2fe2d4/Official_NEOGEN_logo_Green.jpg)\n\n## Privacy Preference Center\n\nWhen you visit any website, it may store or retrieve information on your browser, mostly in the form of cookies.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nDESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\nNeogen Corporation and subsidiaries (\"Neogen,\" \"we,\" \"our\" or the \"Company\") develop, manufacture and market a\ndiverse line of products and services dedicated to food and animal safety. Our Food Safety segment consists\nprimarily of diagnostic test kits and complementary products (e.g., culture media) sold to food producers and\nprocessors to detect dangerous and/or unintended substances in human food and animal feed, such as foodborne\npathogens, spoilage organisms, natural toxins, food allergens, genetic modifications, ruminant by-products, meat\nspeciation, drug residues, pesticide residues and general sanitation concerns. The majority of the test kits are\ndisposable, single-use, immunoassay and DNA detection products that rely on proprietary antibodies and RNA and\nDNA testing methodologies to produce rapid and accurate test results. Our expanding line of food safety products\nalso includes genomics-based diagnostic technology, and advanced software systems that help testers objectively\nanalyze and store, as well as perform analysis on, their results from multiple locations over extended periods.\nNeogen’s Animal Safety segment is engaged in the development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of\nveterinary instruments, pharmaceuticals, vaccines, topicals, parasiticides, diagnostic products, cleaners, biosecurity\nproducts and genomics testing services for the worldwide animal safety market. The majority of these consumable\nproducts are marketed through veterinarians, retailers, livestock producers and animal health product distributors.\nOur line of drug detection products is sold worldwide for the detection of abused and therapeutic drugs in animals\nand animal products, and has expanded into the workplace and human forensic markets.\nBASIS OF PRESENTATION AND CONSOLIDATION\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Neogen and its\nwholly owned subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in\nthe United States of America (generally accepted accounting principles) for interim financial information and with\nthe instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the\ninformation and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements.\nIn our opinion, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair\npresentation of the results of the interim period have been included in the accompanying unaudited condensed\nconsolidated financial statements. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in\nconsolidation. The results of operations during the three months ended August 31, 2024 are not necessarily\nindicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year ending May 31, 2025. These unaudited condensed\nconsolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements\nand the notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nSegment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable\nSegment Disclosures, which modifies the disclosure and presentation requirements of reportable segments. The\namendments in the update require the disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the\nchief operating decision maker (CODM) and included within each reported measure of segment profit and loss. The\namendments also require disclosure of all other segment items by reportable segment and a description of its\ncomposition. Additionally, the amendments require disclosure of the title and position of the CODM and an\nexplanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment\nperformance and deciding how to allocate resources. This update is effective for annual periods beginning after\nDecember 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is\npermitted. We expect to adopt this guidance for our fiscal year 2025 annual reporting and are currently finalizing our\nassessment of the impact that this standard will have on our segment disclosures.\n7\nIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax\nDisclosures, which expands disclosures in an entity’s income tax rate reconciliation table and disclosures regarding\ncash taxes paid both in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. The update will be effective for annual periods beginning\nafter December 15, 2024. This guidance becomes effective for our fiscal year 2026 annual reporting. The Company\nis currently evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on the presentation of its consolidated financial\nstatements and accompanying notes.\n2. REVENUE RECOGNITION\nThe Company derives revenue from two primary sources—product revenue and service revenue.\nProduct revenue consists of shipments of:\n Diagnostic test kits, culture media and related products used by food producers and processors to detect\nharmful natural toxins, foodborne bacteria, allergens and levels of general sanitation;\n Consumable products marketed to veterinarians, retailers, livestock producers and animal health product\ndistributors; and\n Biosecurity products to assist in the control of rodents, insects and disease in and around agricultural,\nfood production and other facilities.\nRevenues for our products are recognized and invoiced when the product is shipped to the customer.\nService revenue consists primarily of:\n Genomic identification and related interpretive bioinformatic services;\n Neogen Analytics; and\n Other commercial laboratory services.\nRevenues for Neogen’s genomics and commercial laboratory services are recognized and invoiced when the\napplicable laboratory service is performed and the results are conveyed to the customer.\nPayment terms for products and services are generally 30 to 60 days.\nContract liabilities represent deposits made by customers before the satisfaction of performance obligation(s) and\nrecognition of revenue. Upon completion of the performance obligation(s) that the Company has with the customer,\nthe liability for the customer deposit is relieved and revenue is recognized. These customer deposits are recorded\nwithin deferred revenue on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the balances relate primarily to\nsales of the Company's genomics services.\nThe following table summarizes contract liabilities by period:\nThree months ended August 31,\n2024 2023\nBeginning balance $ 4,632 $ 4,616\nAdditions 3,078 1,857\nAmounts recognized into revenue (2,075 ) (2,684)\nEnding balance $ 5,635 $ 3,789\n8\nThe following table presents disaggregated revenue by major product and service categories during the three months\nended August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023:\nThree months ended August 31,\n2024 2023\nFood Safety\nNatural Toxins & Allergens $ 20,376 $ 22,268\nBacterial & General Sanitation 39,899 45,224\nIndicator Testing, Culture Media & Other 81,703 81,886\nBiosecurity Products 11,779 11,090\nGenomics Services 5,588 5,810\n$ 159,345 $ 166,278\nAnimal Safety\nLife Sciences $ 1,733 $ 1,661\nVeterinary Instruments & Disposables 12,523 12,932\nAnimal Care & Other 6,679 8,175\nBiosecurity Products 20,806 22,686\nGenomics Services 15,878 17,255\n57,619 62,709\nTotal Revenues $ 216,964 $ 228,987\n3. NET (LOSS) INCOME PER SHARE\nBasic net (loss) income per share was computed by dividing net (loss) income by the weighted average number of\nshares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net (loss) income per share was computed using the\ntreasury stock method by dividing net (loss) income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock\noutstanding.\nThe calculation of net (loss) income per share follows:\nThree months ended August 31,\n2024 2023\nNumerator for basic and diluted net (loss) income per share:\nNet (loss) income attributable to Neogen $ (12,609) $ 1,503\nDenominator for basic net (loss) income per share:\nWeighted average shares 216,695,348 216,309,084\nEffect of dilutive stock options and RSUs — 537,022\nDenominator for diluted net (loss) income per share 216,695,348 216,846,106\nNet (loss) income per share:\nBasic $ (0.06) $ 0.01\nDiluted $ (0.06) $ 0.01\nDue to the net loss reported for the three months ended August 31, 2024, the dilutive stock options and RSUs were\nanti-dilutive. As of August 31, 2023, 45,000 shares were excluded from the calculation of diluted net income per\nshare, because the inclusion of such securities in the calculation would have been anti-dilutive.\n9\n4. SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA\nThe Company has two reportable segments: Food Safety and Animal Safety. The Food Safety segment is primarily\nengaged in the development, production and marketing of diagnostic test kits and related products used by food\nproducers and processors to detect harmful natural toxins, foodborne bacteria, allergens and levels of general\nsanitation. The Animal Safety segment is primarily engaged in the development, production and marketing of\nproducts dedicated to animal safety, including a complete line of consumable products marketed to veterinarians and\nanimal health product distributors. This segment also provides genomic identification and related interpretive\nbioinformatic services. Additionally, the Animal Safety segment produces and markets biosecurity products to assist\nin the control of rodents, insects and disease in and around agricultural, food production and other facilities.\nMany of our international operations originally focused on the Company’s food safety products, and each of these\nunits reports through the Food Safety segment. In recent years, these operations have expanded to offer the\nCompany’s complete line of products and services, including those usually associated with the Animal Safety\nsegment such as cleaners, biosecurity products, veterinary instruments and genomics services. These additional\nproducts and services are managed and directed by existing management and are reported through the Food Safety\nsegment.\nSegment information follows:\nFood Animal Corporate and\nSafety Safety Eliminations (1) Total\nAs of and during the three months ended August 31,\n2024\nProduct revenues to external customers $ 150,777 $ 41,741 $ — $ 192,518\nService revenues to external customers 8,568 15,878 — 24,446\nTotal revenues to external customers $ 159,345 $ 57,619 $ — $ 216,964\nOperating income (loss) $ 17,905 $ 2,589 $ (18,237) $ 2,257\nTotal assets $ 4,056,444 $ 342,077 $ 104,652 $ 4,503,173\nAs of and during the three months ended August 31,\n2023\nProduct revenues to external customers $ 158,947 $ 45,454 $ — $ 204,401\nService revenues to external customers 7,331 17,255 — 24,586\nTotal revenues to external customers $ 166,278 $ 62,709 $ — $ 228,987\nOperating income (loss) $ 22,241 $ 8,356 $ (11,462) $ 19,135\nTotal assets $ 3,983,553 $ 338,297 $ 239,255 $ 4,561,105\n(1) Includes corporate assets, including cash and cash equivalents, current and deferred tax accounts and overhead\nexpenses not allocated to specific business segments.

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS\nThe condensed consolidated statements of operations reflect the results of operations for business acquisitions since\nthe respective dates of purchase. All are accounted for using the acquisition method. Goodwill recognized in the\nacquisitions discussed below relates primarily to enhancing the Company’s strategic platform for the expansion of\navailable product offerings.\nFiscal 2023\nCorvium Acquisition\nIn February 2023, the Company acquired certain assets as part of an asset purchase agreement with Corvium, Inc., a\npartner and supplier within the Company's software analytics platform. This acquisition, which primarily includes\nthe software technology, advances the Company's food safety data analytics strategy. The purchase price\nconsideration was $24,067, which included $9,004 held in escrow. In the first quarter of fiscal 2024, $8,000 of the\nescrow balance was released to Corvium, Inc. In the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the remaining escrow balance was\nreleased to Corvium, Inc. This transaction is a business combination and was accounted for using the acquisition\nmethod.\nThere also is the potential for performance milestone payments of up to $8,500 based on successful implementation\nof the software service at customer sites and sale of licenses. As a result, the Company has recorded contingent\nliabilities of $930 as part of the opening balance sheet within other non-current liabilities, as shown below. In fiscal\nyear 2024, the first milestone period occurred, resulting in no performance milestone payment.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company recorded an increase to intangible assets of $100, based on\nfinalization of a third-party advisor's valuation work and fair value estimates. The goodwill recorded as part of this\ntransaction, which is fully deductible for tax purposes, includes value associated with profits earned from data\nmanagement solutions that can be offered to existing customers and the expertise and reputation of the assembled\nworkforce. These values are Level 3 fair value measurements.\nThe final purchase price allocation, based upon the fair value of these assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which\nwas determined using the income approach, is summarized in the following table:\nPrepaids and other current assets $ 66\nProperty, plant and equipment 13\nIntangible assets 10,280\nDeferred revenue (1,827)\nAdjustment of annual license prepaid (419)\nOther non-current liabilities (930)\nTotal identifiable assets and liabilities acquired 7,183\nGoodwill 16,884\nTotal purchase consideration $ 24,067\nFor each completed acquisition listed above, the revenues and net income were not considered material and were\ntherefore not disclosed.\n11\n3M Food Safety Transaction\nIn September 2022, Neogen, 3M, and Neogen Food Safety Corporation, formerly named Garden SpinCo, a\nsubsidiary created to carve out 3M’s FSD, closed on a transaction combining 3M’s FSD with Neogen in a Reverse\nMorris Trust transaction and Neogen Food Safety Corporation became a wholly owned subsidiary of Neogen (“FSD\ntransaction”). Immediately following the FSD transaction, pre-merger Neogen Food Safety Corporation\nstockholders owned, in the aggregate, approximately 50.1% of the issued and outstanding shares of Neogen\ncommon stock and pre-merger Neogen shareholders owned, in the aggregate, approximately 49.9% of the issued\nand outstanding shares of Neogen common stock. This transaction is a business combination and was accounted for\nusing the acquisition method.\nThe purchase price consideration for the 3M FSD was $3.2 billion, net of customary purchase price adjustments and\ntransaction costs, which consisted of 108,269,946 shares of Neogen common stock issued on closing with a fair\nvalue of $2.2 billion and non-cash consideration of $1 billion, funded by the additional financing obtained by\nGarden SpinCo and assumed by the Company as part of the transaction.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company recorded adjustments to goodwill and intangible assets, based on\nthird-party advisor's valuation work and fair value estimates, resulting in an increase to goodwill and a decrease to\nthe intangible assets balance. The Company also recorded adjustments to deferred tax liabilities, which increased the\nbalance, based on finalization of entity income tax provisions. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of\nthe net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets of $1.97 billion was recorded as goodwill, of which $1.92\nbillion is not deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill includes value associated with profits earned from market and\nexpansion capabilities, expected synergies from integration and streamlining operational activities, the expertise and\nreputation of the assembled workforce and other intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. These\nvalues are Level 3 fair value measurements.\nThe final purchase price allocation, based upon the fair value of these assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which\nwas determined using the income approach, is summarized in the following table:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 319\nInventories 18,403\nOther current assets 14,855\nProperty, plant and equipment 25,832\nIntangible assets 1,559,805\nRight of use asset 882\nLease liability (885)\nDeferred tax liabilities (352,636)\nOther liabilities (2,832)\nTotal identifiable assets and liabilities acquired 1,263,743\nGoodwill 1,974,870\nTotal purchase consideration $ 3,238,613\n6. INCOME TAXES\nIncome tax benefit was $3,000 during the three months ended August 31, 2024. Income tax expense was\n$160 during the three months ended August 31, 2023. The net tax benefit for the quarter is primarily related to pre-\ntax losses due to amortization expense and interest expense from the 3M FSD acquisition. The Organization for\nEconomic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) Pillar 2 global minimum tax rules, which generally provide for\na minimum effective tax rate of 15%, are intended to apply for tax years beginning in 2024. The Company is closely\nmonitoring developments and evaluating the impact these new rules will have on our tax rate, including eligibility to\nqualify for certain safe harbors. Where no safe harbor is met, The Company has included in its income tax benefit\nduring the three months ended August 31, 2024, a forecasted amount of top-up tax for its foreign subsidiaries as\nrequired under the applicable rules of the countries that have adopted the Pillar Two directives.\n12\nThe total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate as of August\n31, 2024 and May 31, 2024 were $3,288 and $2,739, respectively. Increases in unrecognized tax benefits are\nprimarily associated with the acquired 3M FSD, including positions for transfer pricing and research and\ndevelopment credits.\n7. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nThe Company is involved in environmental remediation and monitoring activities at its Randolph, Wisconsin\nmanufacturing facility and accrues for related costs, when such costs are determined to be probable and estimable.\nThe Company currently utilizes a pump and treat remediation strategy, which includes semi-annual monitoring and\nreporting, consulting, and maintenance of monitoring wells. These annual remediation costs are expensed and have\nranged from $38 to $131 per year over the past five years. The Company’s estimated remaining liability for these\ncosts is $916 as of both August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, measured on an undiscounted basis over an estimated\nperiod of 15 years. In fiscal 2019, the Company performed an updated Corrective Measures Study on the site, per a\nrequest from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (\"WDNR\"), and is currently working with the WDNR\nregarding potential alternative remediation strategies going forward. The Company believes that the current pump\nand treat strategy is appropriate for the site. In fiscal 2022, in collaboration with the WDNR, the Company initiated\nan in-situ chemical remediation pilot study, which ran over a two-year period. The results of this study were\nsubmitted to the WDNR as part of our standard annual report. If the WDNR were to require a change from the\ncurrent pump and treat remediation strategy, this change could result in an increase in future costs and, ultimately,\nan increase in the currently recorded liability, with an offsetting charge to operations in the period recorded. The\nCompany has recorded $100 as a current liability as of August 31, 2024, and the remaining $816 is recorded in other\nnon-current liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company is subject to certain legal and other proceedings in the normal course of business that, in the opinion\nof management, are not expected to have a material effect on its future results of operations or financial position.\n8. DERIVATIVES AND FAIR VALUE\nDerivatives\nThe Company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the risk that its financial condition, results of operations\nand cash flows could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest\nrates. To reduce the potential effects of foreign currency exchange rate movements on net earnings, the Company\nenters into derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange forward contracts with major\nfinancial institutions and has also entered into interest rate swap contracts as a hedge against changes in interest\nrates. The Company has established policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval, reporting and\nmonitoring of derivative financial instrument activities. On the date the derivative is established, the Company\ndesignates the derivative as either a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge or a net investment hedge in accordance\nwith its established policy. Each reporting period, derivatives are recorded at fair value in other current assets, other\nassets, accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities. The change in fair value is recorded in accumulated other\ncomprehensive loss, and amounts are reclassified into earnings on the condensed consolidated statements of\noperations when transactions are realized. Derivatives that are not determined to be effective hedges are adjusted to\n13\nfair value with a corresponding adjustment to earnings. The Company does not enter into derivative financial\ninstruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nDerivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments\nThe Company forecasts its net exposure in various receivables and payables to fluctuations in the value of various\ncurrencies, and has entered into a number of foreign currency forward contracts each month to mitigate that\nexposure. These contracts are recorded net at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets, classified as Level 2 in\nthe fair value hierarchy. Gains and losses from these contracts are recognized in other income in our condensed\nconsolidated statements of operations. The notional amount of forward contracts in place was $74,972\nand $70,315 as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, respectively, and consisted of hedges of transactions up to\nOctober 2024.\nFair Value of Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging\nInstruments Balance Sheet Location August 31, 2024 May 31, 2024\nForeign currency forward contracts, net Other current liabilities $ 580 $ 265\nThe location and amount of gains (losses) from derivatives not designated as hedging instruments in our condensed\nconsolidated statements of operations were as follows:\nThree months ended August 31,\nDerivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Location in statements of operations 2024 2023\nForeign currency forward contracts Other expense $ 634 $ 320\nDerivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments\nIn November 2022, we entered into a receive-variable, pay-fixed interest rate swap agreement with a $250,000\nnotional value, which is designated as a cash flow hedge. In accordance with the agreement, in November 2024, the\nnotional value will decrease to $200,000. This agreement fixed a portion of the variable interest due on our term\nloan facility, with an effective date of December 2, 2022 and a maturity date of June 30, 2027. Under the terms of\nthe agreement, we pay a fixed interest rate of 4.215%, plus an applicable margin ranging between 150 to 225 basis\npoints and receive a variable rate of interest based on term SOFR from the counterparty, which is reset according to\nthe duration of the SOFR term. The fair value of the interest rate swap as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024 was\na net (liability) asset of ($2,625) and $2,451, respectively. The Company expects to reclassify a $241 gain of\naccumulated other comprehensive income into earnings in the next 12 months.\nWe record the fair value of our interest rate swaps on a recurring basis using Level 2 observable market inputs for\nsimilar assets or liabilities in active markets.\nFair Value of Derivatives Designated as\nHedging Instruments Balance Sheet Location August 31, 2024 May 31, 2024\nInterest rate swap – current Other current assets $ 317 $ 2,222\nInterest rate swap – non-current Other (non-current liabilities) non-current assets $ (2,942) $ 229\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nFair value measurements are determined based upon the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to\ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants exclusive of any transaction costs. The\nCompany utilizes a fair value hierarchy based upon the observability of inputs used in valuation techniques as\nfollows:\nLevel 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;\nLevel 2: Inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop\nits own assumptions.\n14\nThe carrying amounts of the Company’s financial instruments other than cash equivalents and marketable securities,\nwhich include accounts receivable and accounts payable, approximate fair value based on either their short maturity\nor current terms for similar instruments.\n9.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe information in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\ncontains both historical financial information and forward-looking statements. Neogen does not provide forecasts of\nfuture financial performance. While management is optimistic about the Company’s long-term prospects, historical\nfinancial information may not be indicative of future financial results.\nSafe Harbor and Forward-Looking Statements\nForward-looking statements, within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and\nSection 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are made throughout this Quarterly Report on\nForm 10-Q, including statements relating to management’s expectations regarding new product introductions; the\nadequacy of our sources for certain components, raw materials and finished products; and our ability to utilize\ncertain inventory. For this purpose, any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact are\ndeemed to be forward-looking statements. Without limiting the foregoing, the words “believes,” “anticipates,”\n“plans,” “expects,” “seeks,” “estimates,” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking\nstatements. These forward-looking statements are intended to provide our current expectations or forecasts of future\nevents; are based on current estimates, projections, beliefs, and assumptions; and are not guarantees of future\nperformance. Actual events or results may differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.\nThere are a number of important factors that could cause Neogen’s results to differ materially from those indicated\nby such forward-looking statements, including many factors beyond our control. Factors that could cause actual\nresults to differ from those contained within forward-looking statements include (without limitation) the continued\nintegration of the 3M food safety business and the realization of the expected benefits from that acquisition; the\nrelationship with and performance of our transition manufacturing partner; our ability to adequately and timely\nremediate certain identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting; competition;\nrecruitment and retention of key employees; impact of weather on agriculture and food production; global business\ndisruption caused by the Russia invasion in Ukraine and related sanctions and the conflict in the Middle East;\nidentification and integration of acquisitions; research and development risks; intellectual property protection;\nincreasing and developing government regulation; and other risks detailed from time to time in the Company’s\nreports on file at the Securities and Exchange Commission, including this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nIn addition, any forward-looking statements represent management’s views only as of the date this Quarterly Report\non Form 10-Q was first filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and should not be relied upon as\nrepresenting management’s views as of any subsequent date. While management may elect to update forward-\nlooking statements at some point in the future, it specifically disclaims any obligation to do so, even if its views\nchange.\nTRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES\nIn prior years, production was negatively impacted by broad supply chain challenges and labor market disruptions.\nAdditionally, input cost inflation, including increases in certain raw materials, negatively impacted operating results.\nIn fiscal 2024, despite a slowing of inflation rates, there were economic headwinds of softening consumer demand\nand higher interest rates, coupled with ongoing geopolitical tension in certain regions.\nInterest rates have risen sharply, particularly in fiscal 2023, as a way to combat inflation. This increased our\nborrowing costs and raised the overall cost of capital. Although the federal funds rate was reduced in September and\nthere are indications of future rate cuts, the overall interest rate we pay on our Credit Facilities remains higher than\nwhen the debt was incurred in 2022, which increases interest expense on the unhedged portion of our Term Loan. In\nresponse to the historically high inflationary environment, we took pricing actions to mitigate the impacts on the\nbusiness in the prior two fiscal years. The impact of inflation continued to affect us through fiscal year 2024,\nalthough at a continually decreasing rate compared to fiscal years 2022 and 2023.\nBeginning in the first half of fiscal year 2024, we implemented a new enterprise resource planning system and exited\nour transition distribution agreements with 3M, which led to certain shipment delays and an elevated backlog of\nopen orders, specifically in the Food Safety segment. At the conclusion of fiscal year 2024, order fulfillment issues\nwere largely resolved, and order fulfillment rates had improved to meet the needs of our customers.\n16\nAlthough we have no operations in or direct exposure to Russia, Belarus or Ukraine, we have experienced\nintermittent shortages in materials and increased costs for transportation, energy and raw materials due, in part, to\nthe negative impact of the Russia-Ukraine military conflict, which began in February 2022, on the global economy.\nOur European operations and customer base have been negatively impacted by the conflict. Similarly, the military\nconflicts in the Middle East have increased overall geopolitical tensions. As the respective conflicts continue or\nworsen, they may further impact our business, financial condition or results of operations throughout fiscal year\n2025.\nWe continue to evaluate the nature and extent to which these issues impact our business, including consolidated\nresults of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We expect these issues to continue to impact us throughout\nfiscal year 2025.\nExecutive Overview\nThree months ended August 31,\n2024 2023 % Change\nTotal Revenues $ 216,964 $ 228,987 $ (12,023)\nCost of Revenues 112,038 112,226 (188)\nGross Profit 104,926 116,761 (11,835)\nOperating Expenses\nSales and marketing 45,799 45,783 16\nGeneral and administrative 51,671 45,121 6,550\nResearch and development 5,199 6,722 (1,523)\nTotal Operating Expenses 102,669 97,626 5,043\nOperating Income 2,257 19,135 (16,878)\nOther Expense\nInterest income 993 1,790 (797)\nInterest expense (18,615) (18,456) (159)\nOther, net (244) (806) 562\nTotal Other Expense (17,866) (17,472) (394)\n(Loss) Income Before Taxes (15,609) 1,663 (17,272)\nIncome Tax (Benefit) Expense (3,000) 160 (3,160)\nNet (Loss) Income $ (12,609) $ 1,503 $ (14,112)\nResults of Operations\nRevenues\nRevenue decreased $12.0 million during the three months ended August 31, 2024 compared to the three months\nended August 31, 2023. The decrease included a $9.0 million unfavorable foreign exchange rate impact and a $3.0\nmillion decline in the business. The decline in the business was driven by lower genomics volume due to a strategic\nshift to focus primarily on large production animals, lower sales of insect control and cleaners and disinfectants, and\nlower sales of sample collection products, partially offset by strength in indicator sales and rodent control products\ndue to vole outbreak in the Northwest region of the U.S.\nService Revenue\nService revenue, which consists primarily of genomics services provided to animal production and companion\nanimal markets, was $24.4 million and $24.6 million during the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. Growth in the Neogen Analytics software as a service platform and genomics sales into beef markets\nwas offset by lower genomics sales into the domestic poultry market, primarily due to a shift towards large\nproduction animals, as well as lower sales into the companion animal market.\n17\nInternational Revenue\nInternational sales were $112.6 million and $117.9 million during the three months ended August 31, 2024 and\n2023, respectively. The decrease during the three months ended August 31, 2024 was due to $9.0 million of\ncurrency headwinds, partially offset by strength in Petrifilm® indicator sales.\nGross Margin\nGross margin was 48.4% and 51.0% during the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The\ndecrease in margin was primarily due to lower volume and continued higher distribution costs. The change also\nincluded $4.2 million of transaction and integration costs during the three months ended August 31, 2024 compared\nto $1.2 million during the three months ended August 31, 2023.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses were $102.7 million and $97.6 million during the three months ended August 31, 2024 and\n2023, respectively. The increase during the three months ended August 31, 2024 was primarily the result of\nincreased compensation, as well as higher shipping and information technology costs. The costs associated with our\nenterprise resource planning system, which was implemented on September 1, 2023, were not fully reflected in the\nprior year comparable period.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses were $45.8 million during the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. We experienced higher shipping costs in the current year, as we took over distribution of FSD products\nfrom 3M during the second and third quarters of the prior fiscal year. This increase was offset by a decrease in fees\npaid to 3M for distribution services and lower royalty expense.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative were $51.7 million and $45.1 million during the three months ended August 31, 2024\nand 2023, respectively. For the Food Safety and Animal Safety segments, expenses were relatively consistent\ncompared to the prior-year period. Within Corporate, increases were driven by compensation and related expenses,\nprimarily due to additional headcount, and higher costs associated with our prior-year enterprise resource planning\nsystem implementation. Additionally, there were increases in stock compensation expense compared to the prior-\nyear comparable period, primarily driven by the timing of our annual grant in the current year and increases in\nequity-based compensation.\nGeneral and administrative expenses includes amortization expense relating to definite-lived intangible assets of\n$23.6 million and $23.7 million during the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Estimated\namortization expense for fiscal years 2025 through 2029 is expected to be in the range of approximately $91 million\nto $96 million per year.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expense was $5.2 million and $6.7 million during the three months ended August 31,\n2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease during the three months ended August 31, 2024 is primarily the result of\nlower contracted services and employee costs in the Food Safety segment, as we continue to integrate the 3M FSD\nbusiness and realize synergies in certain areas.\nOther Expense\nOther expense was $17.9 million and $17.5 million during the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. The increase in expense was due to a reduction in interest income associated with our money market\n18\nportfolio balance and an increase in foreign exchange transaction loss as a result of changes in the value of foreign\ncurrencies relative to the U.S. dollar in countries in which we operate.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nIncome tax benefit was $3.0 million during the three months ended August 31, 2024 compared to income tax\nexpense of $0.2 million during the three months ended August 31, 2023. The net tax benefit for the quarter is\nprimarily related to pre-tax losses due to amortization expense and interest expense from the 3M FSD acquisition.\nThe OECD Pillar 2 global minimum tax rules, which generally provide for a minimum effective tax rate of 15%, are\nintended to apply for tax years beginning in 2024. We have included in our income tax benefit during the three\nmonths ended August 31, 2024, a forecasted amount of top-up tax for our foreign subsidiaries as required under the\napplicable rules of the countries that have adopted the Pillar Two directives.\nThe total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate as of August\n31, 2024 and May 31, 2024 were $3.3 million and $2.7 million, respectively. Increases in unrecognized tax benefits\nare primarily associated with the acquired 3M FSD, including positions for transfer pricing and research and\ndevelopment credits.\nSegment Results of Operations\nThree months ended August 31,\n%\n2024 2023 Increase / (Decrease) Change\nFood Safety $ 159,345 $ 166,278 $ (6,933) (4)%\nAnimal Safety 57,619 62,709 (5,090) (8)%\nTotal Revenues $ 216,964 $ 228,987 $ (12,023) (5)%\nFood Safety $ 17,905 $ 22,241 $ (4,336) (19)%\nAnimal Safety 2,589 8,356 (5,767) (69)%\nSegment Operating Income $ 20,494 $ 30,597 $ (10,103) (33)%\nCorporate (18,237) (11,462) (6,775) 59%\nOperating Income $ 2,257 $ 19,135 $ (16,878) (88)%\nRevenues\nRevenue for the Food Safety segment decreased $6.9 million during the three months ended August 31, 2024\ncompared to the three months ended August 31, 2023. The decline was primarily due to $9.0 million of currency\nheadwind, partially offset by $1.8 million of growth in the business and a $0.3 million impact from discontinued\nproducts. The growth was driven by strength in the indicator testing, culture media and other product category,\npartially offset by lower sales in the bacterial and general sanitation and natural toxins and allergens product\ncategories.\nRevenue for the Animal Safety segment decreased $5.1 million during the three months ended August 31, 2024\ncompared to the three months ended August 31, 2023. The decrease included a $4.9 million decline in the business\nand a $0.2 million impact from discontinued product lines. The decline was driven primarily by lower sales in the\nbiosecurity and animal care and other product categories, as well as lower genomics volume due to a shift to focus\nprimarily on large production animals.\nOperating Income\nOperating income for the Food Safety segment decreased $4.3 million during the three months ended August 31,\n2024 compared to the three months ended August 31, 2023. The decline was due to lower gross profit and operating\nexpenses that did not decrease at the same rate as the decrease in sales.\nOperating income for the Animal Safety segment decreased $5.8 million during the three months ended August 31,\n2024 compared to the three months ended August 31, 2023. The decline was due to lower gross profit and an\nincrease in operating expenses.\n19\nThe increased Corporate expense related to headcount increases and costs associated with our new enterprise\nresource planning system, which contributed to the overall decline in operating income.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis report includes certain financial information for the Company that differs from what is reported in accordance\nwith U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures consist of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted\nEBITDA margin. These non-GAAP financial measures are included in this report because management believes that\nthey provide investors with additional useful information to measure the performance of the Company, and because\nthese non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties\nas common performance measures to compare results or estimate valuations across companies in industries the\nCompany operates in. The Company also uses Adjusted EBITDA as a performance target to establish and award\ncertain executive compensation awards, as disclosed in our proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission filed on September 13, 2024.\nEBITDA\nWe define EBITDA as net income before interest, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. We present\nEBITDA as a performance measure because it may allow for a comparison of results across periods and results\nacross companies in the industries in which Neogen operates on a consistent basis, by removing the effects on\noperating performance of (a) capital structure (such as the varying levels of interest expense and interest income),\n(b) asset base and capital investment cycle (such as depreciation and amortization) and (c) items largely outside the\ncontrol of management (such as income taxes). EBITDA also forms the basis for the measurement of Adjusted\nEBITDA (discussed below).\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, adjusted for share-based compensation and certain transaction fees and\nexpenses. We present Adjusted EBITDA because it provides an understanding of underlying business performance\nby excluding the following:\n Share-based compensation\n FX translation (gain)/loss on loan revaluation and other revaluation\n Certain transaction fees and integration costs\n Severance and other employment costs\n Contingent consideration adjustments\n ERP Expense\n Discontinued product line expense\n Other income and expense items\nAdjusted EBITDA margin\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenues. We present Adjusted\nEBITDA margin as a performance measure to analyze the level of Adjusted EBITDA generated from total revenue.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are presented for informational purposes only. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA\nand Adjusted EBITDA margin are not recognized terms under GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as\na substitute for, or superior to, net (loss) income, operating income, cash flow from operating activities or other\nmeasures of financial performance. This information does not purport to represent the results Neogen would have\nachieved had any of the transactions for which an adjustment is made occurred at the beginning of the periods\npresented or as of the dates indicated. This information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. It may not\n20\ngive an accurate or complete picture of Neogen’s financial condition or results of operations for the periods\npresented and should not be relied upon when making an investment decision.\nThe use of the terms EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA margin may not be comparable to\nsimilarly titled measures used by other companies or persons due to potential differences in the method of\ncalculation.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. For example, for EBITDA-based metrics:\n they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, Neogen’s working capital needs;\n they do not reflect Neogen’s tax expense or the cash requirements to pay taxes;\n they do not reflect the historical cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or\ncontractual commitments;\n they do not reflect any cash requirements for future replacements of assets that are being depreciated\nand amortized; and\n they may be calculated differently from other companies in Neogen’s industries limiting their usefulness\nas comparative measures.\nA reader should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on the financial statements of Neogen and\nusing these non-GAAP financial measures only as a supplement to evaluate Neogen’s performance.\nFor each of these non-GAAP financial measures below, we are providing a reconciliation of the differences between\nthe non-GAAP measure and the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\n21\nReconciliation between net (loss) income and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and between net (loss) income\nmargin % and Adjusted EBITDA margin % are as follows:\nThree months ended August 31,\n2024 2023\nNet (loss) income $ (12,609) $ 1,503\nNet (loss) income margin % -5.8% 0.7%\nIncome tax (benefit) expense (3,000) 160\nDepreciation and amortization 29,800 28,734\nInterest expense, net 17,622 16,666\nEBITDA $ 31,813 $ 47,063\nShare-based compensation 3,982 2,638\nFX transaction gain on loan and other revaluation (1) (320) (290)\nCertain transaction fees and integration costs (2) 5,122 1,951\nSeverance and other employment costs 370 559\nContingent consideration adjustments — 300\nERP expense (3) 1,835 128\nDiscontinued product line expense (4) 912 20\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 43,714 $ 52,369\nAdjusted EBITDA margin % 20.1% 22.9%\n(1) Net foreign currency transaction gain associated with the revaluation of foreign denominated\nintercompany loans established in connection with the 3M Food Safety transaction and other non-\nhedged foreign currency revaluation resulting from 3M agreements.\n(2) Includes costs associated with the 3M transaction, including various transition agreements. $4.2 million\nis included within Cost of Revenues.\n(3) Expenses related to ERP implementation.\n(4) Expenses associated with certain discontinued product lines. Amounts are recorded within Cost of\nRevenues.\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased $8.7 million during the three months ended August 31, 2024. Expressed as a\npercentage of revenue, Adjusted EBITDA was 20.1% and 22.9% during the three months ended August 31, 2024\nand 2023, respectively. The lower Adjusted EBITDA in the current year was driven primarily by lower sales and\nhigher operating expenses compared to the prior-year period.\nFinancial Condition and Liquidity\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from the operations of our business, and\navailable borrowing capacity under our revolving facility. Our principal uses of cash include working capital-related\nitems, capital expenditures, debt service, and strategic investments.\nOur future cash generation and borrowing capacity may not be sufficient to meet cash requirements to fund the\noperating business, repay debt obligations, construct new manufacturing facilities, commercialize products currently\nunder development or execute our future plans to acquire additional businesses, technology and products that fit\nwithin our strategic plan. Accordingly, we may be required, or may choose, to issue additional equity securities or\nenter into other financing arrangements for a portion of our future capital needs. However, we continuously monitor\nand forecast our liquidity situation in light of industry, customer and economic factors, and take the necessary\nactions to preserve our liquidity and evaluate other financial alternatives that may be available to us should the need\narise. As a result, we believe that our cash flows from operations, cash on hand, and borrowing capacity will enable\nus to fund the operating business, repay debt obligations, construct new manufacturing facilities, commercialize\nproducts currently under development, and execute our strategic plans.\nWe are subject to certain legal and other proceedings in the normal course of business that have not had, and, in the\nopinion of management, are not expected to have, a material effect on our results of operations or financial position.\nAs of August 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $120.5 million, and borrowings available under our\nrevolving line of credit of $150.0 million.\n22\nIn June 2022, Neogen Food Safety Corporation entered into a credit agreement consisting of a five-year senior\nsecured term loan facility (“term loan facility”) in the amount of $650 million and a five-year senior secured\nrevolving facility (“revolving facility”) in the amount of $150 million (collectively, the “Credit Facilities”). The\nterm loan facility was drawn on August 31, 2022 while the revolving facility remained undrawn and continues to be\nundrawn as of August 31, 2024. The term loan facility matures on June 30, 2027 and the revolving facility matures\nat the earlier of June 30, 2027 and the termination of the revolving commitments.\nIn July 2022, Neogen Food Safety Corporation closed on an offering of $350 million aggregate principal amount of\n8.625% senior notes due in 2030.\nThe finance lease is a building lease that is classified within property and equipment and the current portion of debt\non the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of August 31, 2024. The Company intends to elect the purchase\noption within the lease agreement prior to the end of the lease term.\nThere are no required principal payments through fiscal year 2026. Financial covenants include maintaining\nspecified levels of funded debt to EBITDA, and debt service coverage. As of August 31, 2024, the Company was in\ncompliance with all financial covenants under the Credit Facilities.\nCash Flows\nThree months ended August 31,\nIncrease /\n2024 2023 (Decrease)\nNet Cash (used for) provided by Operating Activities $ (17,914) $ 23,009 $ (40,923)\nNet Cash used for Investing Activities $ (33,662) $ (8,684) $ (24,978)\nNet Cash provided by Financing Activities $ 979 $ 1,062 $ (83)\nNet Cash (used for) provided by Operating Activities\nNet cash (used for) provided by operating activities decreased $40.9 million during the three months ended August\n31, 2024 compared to the three months ended August 31, 2023. The decrease is due to a reduction in income from\noperations and unfavorable changes in working capital. Changes in working capital are as follows:\n Unfavorable change in Accounts Receivable primarily due to a timing of sales during the three months\nended August 31, 2024 and higher days sales outstanding.\n Unfavorable change in Inventory primarily due to lower sales in the first quarter of the current fiscal\nyear and the buildup of higher-volume inventory items.\n Unfavorable change in Accounts Payable primarily due to the timing of payments and the impact of\nexiting the transition distribution agreements.\nNet Cash used for Investing Activities\nCash used for investing activities increased $25.0 million during the three months ended August 31, 2024, compared\nto the three months ended August 31, 2023. The increase was primarily the result of lower proceeds from\nmarketable securities during the three months ended August 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended August\n31, 2023 and an increase of purchases of property and equipment of $7.8 million, partially offset by proceeds from\nthe sale of certain property and equipment during the three months ended August 31, 2024.\nNet Cash provided by Financing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities was flat during the three months ended August 31, 2024 compared to the three\nmonths ended August 31, 2023.\nWe continue to make investments in our business and operating facilities. Our estimate for capital expenditures in\nfiscal 2025 is $85 million. This includes approximately $55 million in capital expenditures related to the integration\nof the acquired 3M FSD products, the most significant portion of which is related to the construction of, and\nacquisition of equipment for, our new manufacturing facility in Lansing, Michigan.\n23\nPART I – FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe continuously evaluate our exposure to currency exchange and interest rate risk. There have been no meaningful\nchanges in our exposure to risk associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates\nrelated to our variable-rate borrowings under the Credit Facilities from that discussed in our Form 10-K.\n24\nPART I – FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-\n15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) that are designed to ensure that\ninformation required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i)\nrecorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and (ii)\naccumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and\nprincipal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nAn evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of\nAugust 31, 2024 was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management,\nincluding the President & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (“the Certifying Officers”). Based on\nthe evaluation, the Certifying Officers concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not\neffective because of previously reported material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which\nwe describe in Part II, Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 31, 2024.\nMaterial Weaknesses\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting\nsuch that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be\nprevented or detected on a timely basis.\nAs disclosed in Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 31, 2024, management\nidentified the following material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting that existed as of May 31,\n2023 and continued as of May 31, 2024: (1) information technology general controls (\"ITGCs\") in the areas of user\naccess and change management over certain information technology systems that support the Company’s financial\nreporting process and the manual business process controls dependent on the affected ITGCs, and (2) ineffective\nperiod-end invoice accrual controls.\nOngoing Remediation Efforts to Address the Previously Identified Material Weaknesses\nAs previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 31, 2024, management\nconcluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of May 31, 2024. Management is\nin the process of enhancing, and will continue to enhance, the risk assessment process and design and\nimplementation of internal controls over financial reporting. The remediation measures to correct the previously\nidentified material weaknesses include enhancing the design and implementation of existing controls and creating\nnew controls as needed to address identified risks.\nAs we continue to evaluate and to improve our internal control over financial reporting, management may determine\nto take additional measures to strengthen controls or to modify the remediation plan described above. When fully\nimplemented and operational, we believe the controls we have designed or plan to design will remediate the control\ndeficiency that has led to the material weaknesses that we have identified. The previously identified material\nweaknesses will not be considered remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and\nmanagement has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively.\nChanges in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting\nOther than with respect to the remediation efforts described above in connection with the previously identified\nmaterial weaknesses, no changes in our control over financial reporting were identified as having occurred during\nthe quarter ended August 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,\ninternal control over financial reporting.\n25\nPART II – OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nFor a description of our material pending legal proceedings, see Note 7. “Commitments and Contingencies” of the\nNotes to interim condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on\nForm 10-Q, which is incorporated by reference.\nItem 1A.

In our Food Safety segment, we saw encouraging initial traction from our targeted share-gain activities and generated positive core revenue growth while continuing to navigate soft end-market conditions. In our Animal Safety segment, the end market is near what we believe are cyclical lows. However, sales of our products to end users remained supportive, with the decline in core revenue driven by a combination of mixed channel inventory movements at our distribution partners and timing impacts. Operationally, our margins in the quarter were affected by the lower total volumes, as well as some higher costs in the area of shipping and distribution. We have mitigating initiatives currently underway and will be taking additional targeted actions to protect margins.”\n\nAdent continued, “The value proposition of Neogen’s food safety solutions and expertise has never been more relevant than it is today. We provide an important and relatively inexpensive line of defense in the rapid detection of contaminants in the production and distribution of food and beverages. As evidenced by some unfortunate higher-profile incidents recently, contaminated products reaching consumers is something we all work to avoid. Beyond the obvious tragic consequences that can result, the costs of any associated recalls, litigation, brand damage or even facility closures can be tremendous. In addition to our broad portfolio of globally validated products, we have longstanding experience as a trusted partner that we’re able to leverage in structuring robust food safety testing programs to help avoid these outcomes. Our commercial teams are having an increasing amount of constructive dialogue with customers on this front and we’re looking forward to continuing to demonstrate our capabilities as a reliable, knowledgeable source of leading food safety testing solutions.”\n\n[Read the Full Press Release](/4ab206/globalassets/pdfs/quarterly-and-annual-forms/fy2025-q1-results.pdf)\n\nfacebook\n\ntwitter\n\nlinkedin\n\nCategory: Earnings\n\n[ ](# \"Scroll to Top\")\n\nBy clicking “Accept All Cookies”, you agree to the storing of cookies on your device to enhance site navigation, analyze site usage, and assist in our marketing efforts. \n\nReject All Accept All Cookies\n\nCookies Settings\n\n![Company Logo](https://cdn.cookielaw.org/logos/b7d23954-35b5-4371-a714-b05f78a4ac7c/01912e7a-5c0e-7092-bb14-f2e83affffff/32b87ff0-c25e-4424-9aee-82549c2fe2d4/Official_NEOGEN_logo_Green.jpg)\n\n## Privacy Preference Center\n\nWhen you visit any website, it may store or retrieve information on your browser, mostly in the form of cookies.

For this purpose, any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may\ndeemed to be forward-looking statements. Without limiting the foregoing, the words “believes,” “anticipates,”\n“plans,” “expects,” “seeks,” “estimates,” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking\nstatements. These forward-looking statements are intended to provide our current expectations or forecasts of future\nevents; are based on current estimates, projections, beliefs, and assumptions; and are not guarantees of future\nperformance. Actual events or results may differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.\nThere are a number of important factors, including circumstances beyond our control at our transition manufacturing\npartner, competition, recruitment, retention, dependence on key employees, impact of weather on agriculture and\nfood production, global business disruption caused by the Russia invasion in Ukraine and related sanctions and the\nconflict between Israel and Hamas, identification and integration of acquisitions, research and development risks,\nintellectual property protection, government regulation and other risks detailed in item 1A.

BUSINESS\nNeogen Corporation and its subsidiaries develop, manufacture and market a diverse line of products and services\ndedicated to food and animal safety. Our Food Safety segment consists primarily of diagnostic test kits and\ncomplementary products (e.g., culture media) sold to food producers and processors to detect dangerous and/or\nunintended substances in human food and animal feed, such as foodborne pathogens, spoilage organisms, natural\ntoxins, food allergens, ruminant by-products, meat speciation, drug residues, pesticide residues and general\nsanitation concerns; as well as food quality and nutritional components. The majority of the test kits are\nconsumables, single-use, culture, immunoassay and DNA detection products that rely on proprietary antibodies and\nRNA and DNA testing methodologies to produce rapid and accurate test results. Our expanding line of food safety\nproducts also includes genomics-based diagnostic technology, and advanced software systems that help testers\nobjectively analyze and store, as well as perform analysis on, their results from multiple locations over extended\nperiods.\nOn September 1, 2022, Neogen, 3M Company (“3M”) and Neogen Food Safety Corporation, formerly named\nGarden SpinCo, a subsidiary created to carve out 3M’s Food Safety Division (“3M FSD”, “FSD”), closed on a\ntransaction combining 3M’s FSD with Neogen in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction and Neogen Food Safety\nCorporation became a wholly owned subsidiary of Neogen (“FSD transaction”, the \"Transaction\"). Following the\nFSD transaction, pre-merger Neogen Food Safety Corporation stockholders own, in the aggregate, approximately\n50.1% of the issued and outstanding shares of Neogen common stock, and pre-merger Neogen shareholders own, in\nthe aggregate, approximately 49.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of Neogen common stock. See Note 6.\n\"Business Combinations\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. FSD products are reported\nin the Food Safety segment.\nNeogen’s Animal Safety segment is engaged in the development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of\nveterinary instruments, pharmaceuticals, vaccines, topicals, parasiticides, diagnostic products, rodent control\nproducts, cleaners, disinfectants, insect control products and genomics testing services for the worldwide animal\nsafety market. The majority of these consumable products are marketed through veterinarians, retailers, livestock\nproducers and animal health product distributors. Our line of drug detection products is sold worldwide for the\ndetection of abused and therapeutic drugs in animals and animal products, and has expanded into the workplace\ntesting and human forensic markets.\nNeogen’s products are marketed by our sales personnel and distributors throughout the world. Our mission is to be\nthe leading company in the development and marketing of solutions for food and animal safety. To meet this\nmission, a growth strategy consisting of the following elements has been developed: (i) increasing sales of existing\nproducts; (ii) introducing innovative products and services; (iii) growing international sales; and (iv) acquiring\nbusinesses and forming strategic alliances.

See the “Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements” section of this Form 10-K for financial information about our business segments and\ninternational operations.\n4\nFOOD SAFETY SEGMENT\nNeogen’s Food Safety segment is primarily engaged in the production and marketing of diagnostic test kits and\ncomplementary products marketed to food and feed producers and processors to detect dangerous and/or unintended\nsubstances in food and animal feed, such as foodborne pathogens, spoilage organisms, natural toxins, food allergens\nand general sanitation concerns. Our test kits are used to detect potential hazards or unintended substances in food\nand animal feed by testers ranging from small local grain elevators to the largest, best-known food and feed\nprocessors in the world, and numerous regulatory agencies. Along with the detection of contaminants in foods, we\nalso detect beneficial components in foods such as dietary fiber and carbohydrates. Neogen’s products include tests\nfor:\nMycotoxins. Grain producers and processors of all types and sizes use our Veratox, Reveal, Reveal Q+ and Reveal\nQ+ MAX tests to detect the presence of mycotoxins, including aflatoxin, aflatoxin M1, deoxynivalenol, fumonisin,\nochratoxin, zearalenone and T-2/HT-2 toxin, to help ensure product safety and quality in food and animal feed.\nFood allergens. The world’s largest producers of cookies, crackers, candy, ice cream and many other processed\nfoods use our Veratox, Alert, Reveal, Reveal 3-D and BioKits testing products to help protect their food-allergic\ncustomers from the inadvertent contamination of products with food allergens, including but not limited to peanut,\nmilk, egg, almond, gliadin (gluten), soy, hazelnut and coconut residues. Also included in our food allergen testing\nportfolio are Allergen Protein Rapid Kits and Allergen Protein ELISA Kits.\nFoodborne pathogens. Meat and poultry processors, seafood processors, fruit and vegetable producers and many\nother market segments are the primary users of Neogen’s ANSR and Reveal tests for foodborne bacteria, including\nE. coli O157:H7, Salmonella, Listeria and Campylobacter. Neogen’s ANSR pathogen detection system is an\nisothermal amplification reaction test method that exponentially amplifies the DNA of any bacteria present in food\nand environmental samples to detectable levels in 10 minutes. Combined with ANSR’s single enrichment step,\nNeogen’s pathogen detection method provides DNA-definitive results in a fraction of the time of other molecular\ndetection methods. The Molecular Detection System (\"MDS\"), an isothermal DNA detection and bioluminescence\ndevice, and unique Molecular Detection Assays provide a total solution for fast and accurate pathogen and serotype\ndetection. Our Listeria Right Now test detects the pathogen in less than 60 minutes without sample enrichment.\nReveal’s lateral flow device combines an immunoassay with chromatography for a rapid and accurate one-step\nresult.\nSpoilage microorganisms. Neogen’s Soleris products are used by food processors to identify the presence of\nspoilage organisms (e.g., yeast and mold) and other microbiological contamination in food. The systems measure\nmicrobial growth by monitoring biochemical reactions that generate a color change in the media as microorganisms\ngrow. The sensitivity of the system allows detection in a fraction of the time needed for traditional methods, with\nless labor and handling time. Our NeoSeek genomics services utilize a novel application of metagenomics to\ndetermine all bacteria in a sample, without introducing biases from culture media, and without the need to generate a\nbacterial isolate for each possible microbe in a sample. The Microbial Luminescence System (MLS II) is designed\nfor the rapid detection of microbial contamination in beverages, dairy and dairy-related products, utilizing adenosine\ntriphosphate (\"ATP\") bioluminescence technology.\nSanitation monitoring. Neogen manufactures and markets our AccuPoint Advanced rapid sanitation test to detect\nthe presence of ATP, a chemical found in all living cells. Also included in our ATP sanitation monitoring portfolio\nis the Clean-Trace™ hygiene monitoring system. These easy-to-use and inexpensive tests use bioluminescence to\nquickly determine if a contact surface has been completely sanitized. When ATP comes into contact with reagents\ncontained in the test device, a reaction takes place that produces light. More light is indicative of higher levels of\nATP and a need for more thorough sanitation. Our worldwide customer base for ATP sanitation testing products\nincludes food and beverage processors, the food service and healthcare industries, as well as many other users.\nSeafood contaminants. Neogen’s specialty products for the seafood market include tests for histamine, a highly\nallergenic substance that occurs when certain species of fish begin to decay; and sulfite, an effective but potentially\nallergenic shrimp preservative.\nWaterborne microorganisms. Neogen offers the food and beverage industries, including water companies, several\nplatforms for performing the microbial analysis of water. This includes Neogen’s filter tests, which are a\n5\ncombination of Neogen Filter membrane filtration and Neogen Culture Media ampouled media, and the easy-to-use\nColitag product. With Colitag, after an incubation period, the sample changes color in the presence of coliforms and\nfluoresces in the presence of E. coli.\nCulture media. Neogen Culture Media, formerly Neogen’s Acumedia and Lab M products, offers culture media\nand prepared media for varied purposes, including traditional bacterial testing and the growth of beneficial bacteria,\nsuch as cultures for sausages and beer. Also included under Neogen Culture Media is the Petrifilm solution.\nPetrifilm standard and rapid plates are all-in-one plating systems that serve as an efficient method for the detection\nand enumeration of various microorganisms. Also included in the Petrifilm product line are the Petrifilm Plate\nReader Advanced and Petrifilm Automated Feeder, which increase laboratory efficiency and productivity. Our\ncustomers for culture media include food manufacturers and processors, commercial and research laboratories and\nproducers of pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and veterinary vaccines.\nFood quality and nutritional analysis.

Neogen offers food safety analysis services in the United States (\"U.S.\") and India. These\nISO-accredited laboratories offer a variety of fee-for-service tests for the food and feed industries.\nThe majority of Neogen’s food safety test kits use immunoassay technology to rapidly detect target substances. Our\nability to produce high-quality antibodies sets our products apart from immunoassay test kits produced and sold by\nother companies. Our kits are available in microwell formats, which allow for automated and rapid processing of a\nlarge number of samples, as well as lateral flow and other similar devices that provide distinct visual results.\nTypically, test kits use antibody-coated test devices and chemical reagents to indicate a positive or negative result\nfor the presence of a target substance in a test sample. The simplicity of the tests makes them accessible to all levels\nof food producers, processors and handlers. Neogen also offers other testing methods and products to complement\nits immunoassay tests.\nOur test kits are generally based on internally developed technology, licensed technology, or technology that is\nacquired. The Food Safety segment incurs expense for royalties for licensed technology used in our products,\nprimarily for our allergen products and the pathogen product line. Generally, royalty rates are in the range of 2% to\n10% of revenues on products containing licensed technology. Some licenses involve technology that is exclusive to\nNeogen’s use, while others are non-exclusive and involve technology licensed to multiple licensees.\nRevenues from Neogen’s Food Safety segment accounted for 70.9%, 66.5%, and 49.3% of our total revenues for\nfiscal years ended May 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n6\nANIMAL SAFETY SEGMENT\nNeogen’s Animal Safety segment is primarily engaged in the development, manufacture, marketing and distribution\nof veterinary instruments, pharmaceuticals, vaccines, topicals, parasiticides, diagnostic products, a full suite of\nagricultural biosecurity products such as rodent control, cleaners, disinfectants and insect control, and genetic\nevaluation and genomic testing services.\nVeterinary instruments.

Patent and trademark registration applications are submitted whenever appropriate. From its\ninception, Neogen has acquired and been granted numerous patents and trademark registrations and has numerous\npending patents and trademark applications. Neogen’s patent portfolio includes approximately 170 U.S. patents, 457\npatents in countries outside of the U.S., and 228 pending patent applications globally. Neogen’s trademark estate\nincludes approximately 117 trademark registrations within the U.S., 550 trademark registrations in countries outside\nof the U.S, and 18 trademark registration applications globally.\nWe do not expect the near-term expiration of any single patent to have a significant effect on future results of\noperations. Our offerings are also protected by trade secrets and proprietary know-how when appropriate. For\nexample, many of our products employ unique antibodies capable of detecting microorganisms and other substances\nat minute levels. In some instances, we have chosen to keep confidential the methods and techniques used to\nmanufacture and use those antibodies when trade secret and/or proprietary know-how protections are more\nappropriate.\nManagement believes that Neogen has adequate rights to commercialize our products. However, we are aware that\nsubstantial research is conducted at universities, governmental agencies and other companies throughout the world,\nand that it always is possible that patents have been applied for and could be granted that are relevant to\ntechnologies that may be used in our products. To the extent some of our products may now, or in the future,\nembody technologies protected by patents of others, we may need to obtain licenses to use such technologies to\ncontinue to sell the products. These licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. Failure to\nobtain any such licenses could delay or prevent the sale of certain new or existing products. In addition, patent\nlitigation is not uncommon. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will continue to have adequate rights to\ncommercialize our new products or that we will avoid litigation.\nOne of the major areas affecting the success of biotechnology and pharmaceutical development involves the time,\ncost and uncertainty surrounding regulatory approvals. Neogen products requiring regulatory approval, which we\ncurrently have in place, include BotVax B, EqStim, ImmunoRegulin and Uniprim. Neogen’s rodent control,\ndisinfectant, parasiticide and insect control products are subject to registration in the United States and\ninternationally.\nNeogen utilizes third-party validations and certifications on many of our products and associated methods to provide\nour customers with confidence that our products perform to specified levels. These include validation by, among\nothers, the AOAC International, independently administered third-party, multi-laboratory collaborative studies, and\napprovals by the USDA Food Safety Inspection Service.\nPRODUCTION AND SUPPLY\nNeogen manufactures products in the U.S., the U.K., Ireland and Brazil and provides genomics services in the U.S.,\nScotland, Brazil, Australia, China and Canada. As of May 31, 2024, there were approximately 1,315 full-time\nemployees assigned to manufacturing operations and providing services in these locations, operating on multiple\nshift schedules, with occasional 24/7 production during high-demand periods. Future demand increases could be\naccommodated by adding shifts. Management believes we could increase the current output of our primary product\nlines by using the current space available. However, to do so would require investment in additional equipment.\n11\nFood safety diagnostics.

Manufacturing of rodent control products and/or cleaners\nand disinfectants takes place in the following locations: Wisconsin, Tennessee, California, England and Brazil.\nCertain cleaners and disinfectants are manufactured in Neogen facilities, while others are purchased from other\nmanufacturers for resale or toll manufactured by third parties.\nInsect control products. Neogen manufactures insect control products at its facilities in Iowa and Brazil.\nNeogen purchases component parts and raw materials from more than 1,000 suppliers. Though many of these items\nare purchased from a single source to achieve the greatest volume discounts, we believe we have identified\nacceptable alternative suppliers for most of our key components and raw materials where it is economically feasible\nto do so. There can be no assurance that we would avoid a disruption of supply in the event a supplier discontinues\nshipment of product. Shipments of higher volume products are generally accomplished within a 48-hour turnaround\ntime.\n12\nCOMPETITION\nWhile competitors differ across individual markets, we are not aware of any single competitor that is pursuing\nNeogen’s fundamental strategy of developing and marketing a broad line of products, ranging from disposable tests\nand culture media to veterinary pharmaceuticals and instruments for a large number of food safety and animal safety\nconcerns. For each of our individual products or product lines, we face intense competition from companies ranging\nfrom small businesses to divisions of large multinational companies. Some of these organizations have substantially\ngreater financial resources than Neogen. We compete primarily on the basis of ease of use, speed, accuracy and\nother performance characteristics of our products. The breadth of our product line, the effectiveness of our sales and\ncustomer service organizations, and pricing also are components in management’s competitive strategy.\nFuture competition may become even more intense and could result from the development of new technologies,\nwhich could affect the marketability and profitability of Neogen’s products. Our competitive position also depends\non our ability to continue to develop proprietary products, attract and retain qualified scientific and other personnel,\ndevelop and implement production and marketing plans and protect the intellectual property for new products.\nAdditionally, we must continue to generate or have access to adequate capital resources to execute our strategy.\nFOOD SAFETY:\nWith a large professional sales organization offering a comprehensive catalog of food safety solutions, management\nbelieves we maintain a general advantage over competitors offering only limited product lines. In most cases,\nNeogen sales and technical service personnel can offer unique insight into a customer’s numerous safety and quality\nchallenges, and offer testing and other solutions to help the customer overcome those challenges.\nCompetition for pathogen detection products includes traditional methods and antibody and genetic-based platforms;\ncompetition for natural toxins and allergen detection products includes instrumentation and antibody-based tests.\nWhile our offerings will not always compete on all platforms in all markets, the products we offer provide tests that\ncan be utilized by most customers to meet their testing needs.\nIn addition to our extensive product offerings and robust distribution network, we focus our competitive advantage\nin the areas of customer service, product performance, speed, and ease of use of our products. Additionally, by\naggressively maintaining Neogen’s ability to produce at low cost, we believe that we can be competitive with new\nmarket entrants that may choose a low pricing strategy in an attempt to gain market share.\nANIMAL SAFETY:\nNeogen’s Animal Safety segment does not encounter any single competitor across the various products and markets\nwe serve. In the life sciences and toxicology markets, we compete against several other diagnostic and reagent\ncompanies with similar product offerings.\nIn the veterinary market, Neogen markets BotVax B, the only USDA-approved vaccine for the prevention of\nbotulism Type B in horses. We compete on other key products through differentiated product performance and\nsuperior customer and technical support. With some of our products, we provide solutions as a lower cost alternative\nand also offer a private label option for our customers.\nCompetition in the rodent control market includes several companies of comparable size that offer products into\nsimilar market segments. The retail rodent control market is not dominated by a single brand. While the technical\nmaterials used by competing companies are similar, Neogen uses manufacturing and bait formula techniques, which\nwe believe may better attract rodents to the product and thereby improves overall product performance.\nWithin the insect control market, Chem-Tech products specifically focus on the area of insect control for food and\nanimal safety applications. There are several competitors offering similar products, however, we have a proprietary\nformulation chemistry that optimizes the delivery and safe application of insect control products at the customer’s\nlocation. These products are currently only sold in the U.S. through a combination of direct sales and distributors.\n13\nNumerous companies, including a number of large multinationals, compete for sales in the cleaner and disinfectant\nproduct segment. Neogen’s broad line of products is sold around the world, primarily to assist in the cleaning and\ndisinfecting of animal production facilities.\nIn addition to our extensive portfolio of animal safety products, Neogen also competes in the retail market by\nproviding solutions to common retail problems, such as stock outs, wasted floor space, and inconsistent brand\nidentity. We differentiate ourselves by offering planograms and convenient reordering systems to maximize turns\nand profitability for our retail customers.\nNeogen Genomics, a leading worldwide commercial animal genomics laboratory, employs cutting-edge technology\nin the area of genomics. The result of this technology allows the acceleration of natural selection through parentage\ntesting and selective breeding of traits such as disease resistance, yield improvement and meat quality. Competition\ncomes mainly from a number of general laboratory service providers, some significantly larger than us as well as\nseveral smaller companies offering genomics services. Neogen Genomics is not involved in cloning or the\ndevelopment of transgenic animals.\nGOVERNMENT REGULATION\nA significant portion of Neogen’s products and revenues are affected by the regulations of various domestic and\nforeign government agencies, including the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Environmental Protection\nAgency (EPA), and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Changes in these regulations could affect\nrevenues and/or costs of production and distribution.\nNeogen’s development and manufacturing processes involve the use of certain hazardous materials, chemicals and\ncompounds. Management believes that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such commodities\ncomply with the standards prescribed by federal, state and local regulations. However, changes in such regulations\nor rules could involve significant costs to us and could be materially adverse to our business.\nThe rodent control products, insect control products, cleaners, disinfectants and sanitizers manufactured and\ndistributed by Neogen are subject to EPA and various U.S. state regulations as well as other analogous agencies in\nthe markets where we sell such products. In general, any international sale of our products also must comply with\nsimilar regulatory requirements in the country of destination. Each country has its own individual regulatory\nconstruct with specific requirements. To the best of our knowledge, Neogen products are compliant with applicable\nregulations in the countries where such products are sold.\nMany food safety diagnostic products do not require direct government approval. However, we have pursued\nvoluntary approvals and certifications for a number of these products to enhance their marketability.\nNeogen’s veterinary vaccine products and some pharmaceutical products require government approval to allow for\nlawful sales. The vaccine products are approved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Center for Veterinary\nBiologics (USDA-CVB) and analogous agencies in jurisdictions where sold. The pharmaceutical products are\napproved by the FDA and analogous agencies in jurisdictions where sold. The products, and the facilities in which\nthey are manufactured, are in a position of good standing with all agencies. We have no warning letters based on any\nreview of these products or facility inspections and are not aware of any reason why we could not manufacture and\nmarket such products in the future.\nOther animal safety and food safety products generally do not require additional registrations or approvals.\nHowever, Neogen’s regulatory staff routinely monitors amendments to current regulatory requirements to ensure\ncompliance.\n14\nHUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\nOur people are a critical component in our continued success. As a team, they put Neogen’s core values into action,\nwhile executing key initiatives to maintain long-term sustainable growth. We strive to create a workplace of choice\nto attract, retain, and develop top talent to achieve our vision and deliver shareholder results. As of May 31, 2024,\nwe employed 2,917 people worldwide, with 1,603 located in the U.S. and 1,314 international. We maintain good\nrelations with both our union and non-union employees and have not experienced any work stoppages.\nThe Company is committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace that attracts and retains exceptional\ntalent. Through ongoing employee development, comprehensive compensation and benefits, and a focus on health,\nsafety and employee wellbeing, the Company strives to help its employees in all aspects of their lives so they can do\ntheir best work.\nWorkplace Culture and Employee Engagement. We have established our Neogen DNA, which guides us in\nacting with the utmost integrity as we pursue our mission and goals. Our Neogen DNA is made up of three parts:\nOur Purpose & Promise, Our Principles, and Our Values. Our Purpose & Promise, the advancement of human and\nanimal technology so we can fuel a brighter future for global food security, is our reason for coming to work and the\nimpact we can have on the world and each other. Our Principles represent our commitment to our clients and\nindustry, and Our Values represent our commitment to each other. We value responsibility, consistency, and\nintegrity. Our Code of Conduct codifies our commitment to conducting business ethically.\nEquity, Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging (EDIB). We strive to create an environment where colleagues feel\nvalued and understand the important role we play in embracing diversity to improve the quality of our innovation,\ncollaboration and relationships. Upholding our core value of “Cultivate Belonging,” we implement policies and\npractices that not only attract diverse talent, but also support an inclusive culture where everyone can truly belong\nand thrive. Our commitment extends beyond our workforce, influencing our partnerships, community engagements,\nand business practices globally.\nTalent Attraction, Development and Retention. We employ a variety of programs and platforms designed to\nattract, develop and retain our colleagues. Employee benefits and policies are designed for diverse needs. Neogen is\ncommitted to training and developing our employees so that they can deliver exceptional results to our customers\nand shareholders. We have internal programs designed to develop and retain talent, including career planning,\nleadership development, performance management and learning programs.\nCompensation and Benefits. We strive to support our colleagues’ well-being and enable them to achieve their best\nat work and at home. Our compensation and benefits programs are designed to be competitive and support colleague\nwell-being, including physical and mental health, financial wellness, and family resources.\nEmployee Health and Safety. We are committed to ensuring a safe working environment for our colleagues. Our\nsites have injury prevention programs, and we strive to build on our safety culture. Our procedures emphasize the\nneed for the cause of injuries to be investigated and for action plans to be implemented to mitigate potential\nrecurrence. Our safety programs have resulted in strong safety performance.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our securities involves a variety of risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, including, among\nothers, those discussed below. Each of the following risks should be considered carefully, together with all the other\ninformation included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and the\nrelated notes and in our other filings with the SEC. Furthermore, additional risks and uncertainty not presently\nknown to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial also could adversely affect our business. Our business,\nresults of operations, financial condition and cash flow could be materially and adversely affected by any of these\nrisks or uncertainties.\n15\nRISKS RELATING TO THE TRANSACTION WITH 3M CORPORATION\nWe may not realize the anticipated financial and other benefits, including growth opportunities, expected\nfrom the 3M Food Safety merger transaction.\nWe have realized and expect that we will continue to realize synergies, growth opportunities and other financial and\noperating benefits as a result of the Transaction. Our success in realizing these benefits, and the timing of their\nrealization, depends, among other things, on the continued successful integration of the business operations of the\n3M Food Safety business with Neogen. Even if we are able to integrate the 3M Food Safety business successfully,\nwe cannot predict with certainty if or when the balance of these synergies, growth opportunities and other benefits\nwill be realized, or the extent to which they will actually be achieved. For example, the benefits from the\nTransaction could be offset by costs incurred in integrating the 3M Food Safety business. Realization of any\nsynergies, growth opportunities or other benefits could be affected by the factors described in other risk factors and a\nnumber of factors beyond our control, including, without limitation, general economic conditions, increased\noperating costs and regulatory developments.\nThe integration of the 3M Food Safety business with Neogen presents challenges, and the failure to\nsuccessfully integrate the 3M Food Safety business could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough significant progress has been made to date in the integration of the 3M Food Safety business with Neogen,\nthere is much that remains to be accomplished, particularly in the integration of the manufacturing operations of the\n3M Food Safety business with Neogen. There is a significant degree of difficulty inherent in the process of\nintegrating the 3M Food Safety business with Neogen. The difficulties include:\n• the integration of the 3M Food Safety business with Neogen’s current businesses while carrying on the\nongoing operations of all businesses;\n• managing a significantly larger company than before the consummation of the Transaction;\n• integrating the business cultures of the 3M Food Safety business and Neogen, which could prove to be\nincompatible;\n• creating uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems and controlling the costs\nassociated with such matters;\n• the ability to ensure the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting across the combined\ncompany;\n• integrating certain manufacturing, information technology, purchasing, accounting, finance, sales, billing,\nhuman resources, payroll and regulatory compliance systems; and\n• the potential difficulty in retaining key officers and personnel of Neogen and the 3M Food Safety business.\nThe continued successful integration of the 3M Food Safety business cannot be assured. The failure to do so could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPursuant to the terms of the Transaction, Neogen and Neogen Food Safety Corporation will be restricted\nfrom taking certain actions that could adversely affect the intended tax treatment of the Transaction, and\nsuch restrictions could significantly impair Neogen’s and Neogen Food Safety Corporation’s ability to\nimplement strategic initiatives that otherwise would be beneficial.\nThe Tax Matters Agreement executed in connection with the Transaction generally restricts Neogen and its affiliates\nfrom taking certain actions that could adversely affect the intended tax treatment of the Transaction. In particular:\nFor a two-year period following the distribution date, except as described below:\n16\n• Neogen Food Safety Corporation will continue the active conduct of its trade or business and the trade or\nbusiness of certain Neogen Food Safety Corporation subsidiaries;\n• Neogen Food Safety Corporation will not voluntarily dissolve or liquidate or permit certain Neogen Food\nSafety Corporation subsidiaries to voluntarily dissolve or liquidate;\n• Neogen and Neogen Food Safety Corporation will not enter into any transaction or series of transactions (or\nany agreement, understanding or arrangement) as a result of which one or more persons would acquire\n(directly or indirectly) stock comprising 50% or more of the vote or value of Neogen Food Safety Corporation\nor Neogen (taking into account the stock acquired pursuant to the merger);\n• Neogen and Neogen Food Safety Corporation will not engage in certain mergers or consolidations;\n• Neogen Food Safety Corporation will not, and will not permit certain Neogen Food Safety Corporation\nsubsidiaries to, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of 30% or more of the gross assets of Neogen Food Safety\nCorporation such subsidiaries, the Neogen Food Safety Corporation group or the active trade or business of\nNeogen Food Safety Corporation or certain Neogen Food Safety Corporation subsidiaries, subject to certain\nexceptions;\n• Neogen and Neogen Food Safety Corporation will not, and will not permit certain Neogen Food Safety\nCorporation subsidiaries to, redeem or repurchase stock or rights to acquire stock, unless certain requirements\nare met;\n• Neogen and Neogen Food Safety Corporation will not, and will not permit certain Neogen Food Safety\nCorporation subsidiaries to, amend their certificates of incorporation (or certain other organizational\ndocuments) or take any other action affecting the voting rights of any stock or stock rights of Neogen or\nNeogen Food Safety Corporation; and\n• Neogen and Neogen Food Safety Corporation will not, and will not permit any member of the Neogen Food\nSafety Corporation group or Neogen to, take any other action that would, when combined with any other\ndirect or indirect changes in ownership of Neogen Food Safety Corporation and Neogen stock (including\npursuant to the merger), have the effect of causing one or more persons to acquire stock representing 50% or\nmore of the vote or value of Neogen Food Safety Corporation or Neogen, or otherwise jeopardize the tax-free\nstatus of the Transaction; and\n• Additionally, none of Neogen Food Safety Corporation, Neogen or any member of Neogen Food Safety\nCorporation group may:\n\u0004 take, or permit to be taken, any action that could reasonably be expected to jeopardize the\nqualification of certain Neogen Food Safety Corporation debt as a security under Section 361(a)\nof the Code (other than making any payment permitted or required by the terms of the Neogen\nFood Safety Corporation debt); or\n\u0004 permit any portion of certain nonqualified preferred stock to cease to be outstanding or modify the\nterms of such stock;\nunless, in each case, prior to taking any such action, Neogen and Neogen Food Safety Corporation shall have\nrequested that 3M obtain, or request and receive 3M’s prior written consent to obtain, an IRS ruling satisfactory to\n3M in its reasonable discretion or provide 3M with an unqualified tax opinion satisfactory to 3M in its sole and\nabsolute discretion to the effect that such action would not jeopardize the intended tax treatment of the Transaction,\nunless 3M waives such requirement. Failure to adhere to these requirements could result in tax being imposed on\n3M for which Neogen and Neogen Food Safety Corporation could bear responsibility and for which Neogen and\nNeogen Food Safety Corporation could be obligated to indemnify 3M. Any such indemnification obligation would\nlikely be substantial and would likely have a material adverse effect on Neogen. During the time period ending three\nyears after the date of the distribution, Neogen Food Safety Corporation and Neogen also will be subject to certain\nrestrictions relating to the SpinCo Business in Switzerland.\nThese restrictions could have a material adverse effect on Neogen’s liquidity and financial condition, and otherwise\ncould impair Neogen’s and Neogen Food Safety Corporation’s ability to implement strategic initiatives, Neogen\n17\nFood Safety Corporation’s and Neogen’s indemnity obligation to 3M might discourage, delay or prevent a change of\ncontrol that shareholders of Neogen may consider favorable.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY\nWe are subject to risks relating to existing international operations and expansion into new geographical\nmarkets.\nExpanding sales globally is part of our overall growth strategy, and we expect sales from outside the United States\nto continue to represent a significant portion of our revenue. In fiscal year 2024, sales to customers outside of the\nU.S. accounted for 49.7% of our total revenue, compared to 48.4% and 39.7% of our total revenues in fiscal year\n2023 and 2022, respectively. Our international operations are subject to general risks related to such operations,\nincluding:\n• political, social and economic instability and disruptions, including social unrest, geopolitical tensions,\ninflation and interest rate uncertainties;\n• government export controls, economic sanctions, embargoes or trade restrictions;\n• the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers;\n• limitations on ownership and on repatriation or dividend of earnings;\n• transportation delays and interruptions;\n• labor unrest and current and changing employment and labor regulatory environments;\n• increased compliance costs, including costs associated with disclosure requirements and related due diligence;\n• difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations;\n• limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies;\n• the ability of our current products to comply with product standards established by foreign regulatory bodies;\n• differing regulatory and legal systems and environments;\n• diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries;\n• access to or control of networks and confidential information due to local government controls and\nvulnerability of local networks to cyber risks; and\n• fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nIf we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding our global business or adequately\nmanage operational risks of our existing international operations, these risks could have a material adverse effect on\nour growth strategy into new geographical markets, reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition\nand cash flows. In addition, the impact of such risks could be outside of our control and could decrease our ability to\nsell products internationally, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and\ncash flows. For example, as a result of the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and resulting\nheightened economic sanctions from the U.S. and the international community, we have discontinued sales into\nRussia and Belarus. The U.S. and other countries have imposed significant sanctions and could impose even wider\nsanctions and take other actions should the conflict further escalate. While it is difficult to anticipate the effect the\nsanctions announced to date could have on us, any further sanctions imposed or actions taken by the U.S. or other\ncountries, including any expansion of sanctions beyond Russia and Belarus, could affect the global price and\navailability of raw materials, reduce our sales and earnings or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business and\nresults of operations.\n18\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, and if we are unable\nto improve our internal controls, our financial results may not be accurately reported.\nAs disclosed in Item 9A, “Controls and Procedures,” in fiscal year 2023, we identified material weaknesses in our\ninternal control over financial reporting related to ineffective information technology general controls, our period-\nend invoice accrual procedures, and ineffective operation of management review controls related to the accounting,\nvaluation and purchase price allocation of the Company’s acquisition and associated goodwill. The material\nweaknesses did not result in any material identified misstatements to the consolidated financial statements, and there\nwere no changes to previously issued financial results. As of May 31, 2024, management believes our remediation\nefforts have been effective and that one of our previous material weaknesses in our internal control over financial\nreporting has been remediated. Specifically, management believes the operation of management review controls\nrelated to the accounting, valuation and purchase price allocation of the Company’s acquisitions and associated\ngoodwill is effective. For the remaining material weaknesses related to ineffective information technology general\ncontrols and our period-end invoice accrual procedures, we continue to execute a remediation plan designed to\naddress the material weaknesses, however, we cannot guarantee that these steps will be sufficient or that we will not\nhave material weaknesses in the future. These material weaknesses, or difficulties encountered in implementing new\nor improved controls or remediation, could prevent us from accurately reporting our financial results, result in\nmaterial misstatements in our financial statements or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Failure to\ncomply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could negatively affect our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nOur business strategy is dependent on successfully promoting internal growth and identifying and integrating\nacquisitions.\nOur business has grown significantly over the past several years as a result of both internal growth and acquisitions\nof existing businesses and their products. Management initiatives may be attempted to augment internal growth,\nsuch as strengthening our presence in select markets, reallocating research and development funds to products with\nhigher growth potential, development of new applications for our technologies, enhancing our service offerings,\ncontinuing key customer efforts, and finding new markets for our products. Failure of these management initiatives\nmay have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nIdentifying and pursuing acquisition opportunities, integrating these acquisitions into our business and managing\ntheir growth requires a significant amount of management’s time and skill. We cannot assure that we will be\neffective in identifying, integrating or managing future acquisition targets. Our failure to successfully integrate and\nmanage a future acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to effectively manage our future growth, and if we fail to do so, our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely significantly on our information systems’ infrastructure to support our operations and a failure of\nthese systems and infrastructure and/or a security breach of our information systems could damage our\nreputation and have an adverse effect on operations and results.\nWe rely on our information systems’ infrastructure to integrate departments and functions, enhance our ability to\nservice customers, improve our control environment, and manage our cost reduction initiatives. If a security breach\nor cyberattack of our information technology (\"IT\") networks and systems occurs, our operations could be\ninterrupted. Any issues involving our critical business applications and infrastructure could adversely impact our\nability to manage our operations and the customers we serve. Although we have controls and security measures in\nplace to prevent such attacks, experienced computer hackers are increasingly organized and sophisticated. Malicious\nattack efforts operate on a large scale and sometimes offer targeted attacks as a paid-for service. In addition, the\ntechniques used to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched\nagainst a target.\n19\nWe rely on several information systems throughout our company, as well as those of our third-party business\npartners, to provide access to our web-based products and services, keep financial records, analyze results of\noperations, process customer orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers, store confidential or\nproprietary information and operate other critical functions. Although we employ system backup measures and\nengage in information system redundancy planning and processes, such measures, as well as our current disaster\nrecovery plan, may be ineffective or inadequate to address all vulnerabilities. Further, our information systems and\nour business partners’ and suppliers’ information systems may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers and other security\nbreaches, including computer viruses and malware, through the internet (including via devices and applications\nconnected to the internet), email attachments and persons with access to these information systems, such as our\nemployees or third parties with whom we do business. As information systems and the use of software and related\napplications by us, our business partners, suppliers and customers become more cloud-based, there has been an\nincrease in global cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threats, including more sophisticated and targeted cyber-related\nattacks that pose a risk to the security of our information systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability\nand integrity of data and information.\nWhile we have implemented network security and internal control measures, including for the purpose of protecting\nour connected products and services from cyberattacks, and invested in our data and IT infrastructure, there can be\nno assurance that these efforts will prevent a system disruption, attack, or security breach and, as such, the risk of\nsystem disruptions and security breaches from a cyberattack remains.\nIf our security and information systems are compromised, interrupted or destroyed, or employees fail to comply with\nthe applicable laws and regulations, or the information we maintain is obtained by unauthorized persons or used\ninappropriately, it could adversely affect our business and reputation, as well as our results of operations, and could\nresult in litigation, the imposition of regulatory sanctions or penalties, or significant expenditures to remediate any\ndamage to persons whose personal information has been compromised.\nIn fiscal year 2024, we implemented our SAP enterprise resource planning (ERP) system for our U.S. food safety\nbusiness and at a manufacturing facility in Wales. The first phase of this implementation also included upgrades to\nmany of our existing operating and financial systems. Such an implementation is a major undertaking, both\nfinancially and from a management and personnel perspective. Should the subsequent phases of implementation not\noccur successfully, or if the systems do not perform in a satisfactory manner, our business and operations could be\ndisrupted and our results of operations could be adversely affected, including our ability to report accurate and\ntimely financial results.\nPandemics or disease outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have affected and could adversely affect\nour business, operation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, and created\nsignificant volatility and disruption of financial markets.\nDuring the course of the pandemic, we modified our business practices to comply with safety measures required by\nfederal, state and local governments, as well as those we determined to be in the best interests of our employees and\ncustomers, including implementing social distancing, remote work, reducing employee travel, restricting building\naccess and more. In the event of the renewed outbreak of COVID-19 or an outbreak of a different virus or disease,\nwe could experience disruptions in our supply chain, operations, facilities and workforce which could cause delays\nin developing new products or negatively affect efficiency and productivity or our ability to market products and\nservices, and, ultimately, our stock price and financial performance.\nAdditional future impacts to us may include, but are not limited to, material adverse effects on the demand for our\nproducts and services, our supply chain and sales and distribution channels, our cost structure and profitability. An\nextended period of global supply chain and economic disruption could materially affect our business, results of\noperations and financial condition.\n20\nDisruption of our manufacturing and service operations could have an adverse effect on our financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nOur facilities and our distribution systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, terrorism or other\nnatural or man-made disasters. If any of our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our\noperations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in significant expenses to repair or replace the\nfacility and/or distribution system. If such a disruption were to occur, we could breach agreements, our reputation\ncould be harmed, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. Although we carry insurance\nfor property damage and business interruption, we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or\npotential losses arising from terrorism. Economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets could adversely\naffect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain third party insurance. If we are unable to obtain\nsufficient and cost-effective third-party insurance coverage, or to the extent we have elected to self-insure, we could\nbe at greater risk that our operations will be harmed by a catastrophic loss.\nWe rely heavily on third-party package delivery services, and a significant disruption in these services or\nsignificant increases in prices could disrupt our ability to ship products, increase our costs and lower our\nprofitability.\nWe ship a significant portion of our products to customers through independent package delivery companies, such as\nUPS, Federal Express and DHL. We also ship our products through other carriers, including national and regional\ntrucking firms, overnight carrier services and the U.S. Postal Service. If one or more of these third-party package\ndelivery providers were to experience a major work stoppage or other event that prevented our products from being\ndelivered in a timely fashion or caused us to incur additional shipping costs we could not pass on to our customers,\nour costs could increase and our relationships with some of our customers could be adversely affected. In addition, if\none or more of our third-party package delivery providers were to increase prices, and we were not able to find\ncomparable alternatives or make adjustments within our delivery network, our profitability could be adversely\naffected. Even if we are able to pass through increased shipping costs to our customers through increased pricing, it\nmay impact the demand for many of our products, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nOur dependence on suppliers could limit our ability to sell certain products or negatively affect our operating\nresults.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers to provide raw materials and other components in our products, manufacture\nproducts that we do not manufacture ourselves and perform services that we do not provide ourselves. Because these\nsuppliers are independent third parties with their own financial objectives, actions taken by them could have a\nnegative effect on our results of operations. The risks of relying on suppliers include our inability to enter into\ncontracts with third party suppliers on reasonable terms, inconsistent or inadequate quality control, relocation of\nsupplier facilities, supplier work stoppages and suppliers’ failure to comply with their contractual obligations. In\naddition, we currently purchase some raw materials and products from sole or single sources. Some of the products\nthat we purchase from these sources are proprietary and, therefore, cannot be readily or easily replaced by\nalternative sources. Problems with suppliers and the supply chain could negatively impact our ability to supply the\nmarket, substantially decrease sales, lead to higher costs and damage our reputation with our customers.\n21\nOur business sells many products through distributors, which presents risks that could negatively affect our\noperating results.\nWe sell many of our products, both within and outside of the U.S., through independent distributors. As a result, we\nare dependent on distributors to sell our products and assist us in promoting and creating demand for our products.\nOur distributors sometimes offer products from several different companies, and those distributors may carry our\ncompetitors’ products and promote our competitors’ products over our own. We have limited ability, if any, to cause\nour distributors to devote adequate resources to promoting, marketing, selling and supporting our products. We\ncannot assure that we will be successful in maintaining and strengthening our relationships with our distributors or\nestablishing relationships with new distributors who have the ability to market, sell, and support our products\neffectively. We may rely on one or more key distributors for a product or region, and the loss of one or more of\nthese distributors could reduce our revenue. Distributors could face financial difficulties, including bankruptcy,\nwhich could impact our ability to collect our accounts receivable and negatively impact our financial results. In\naddition, violations of anti-bribery and anti-corruption or similar laws by our distributors could have a material\nimpact on our business. Further, termination of a distributor relationship could result in increased competition in the\napplicable jurisdiction. Failing to manage the risks associated with our use of distributors could reduce sales,\nincrease expenses and weaken our competitive position, which could have a negative impact on our operating\nresults.\nIf we are unable to develop new products and technologies, our competitive position could be impaired, which\ncould materially and adversely affect our sales and market share.\nThe markets in which we operate are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and the frequent introduction\nof new products. As a result, our success is dependent upon our ability to develop or acquire new products and\nservices on a cost-effective basis, to introduce them into the marketplace in a timely manner and to protect and\nmaintain critical intellectual property assets related to these developments. Difficulties or delays in research,\ndevelopment or production of new products and technologies, or failure to gain market acceptance of new products\nand technologies, could significantly reduce future revenue and materially and adversely affect our competitive\nposition. While we intend to continue to commit financial resources and effort to the development of new products\nand services, we may not be able to successfully differentiate our products and services from those of our\ncompetitors. Our customers may not consider our proposed products and services to be of value to them or may not\nview them as superior to our competitors’ products and services. In addition, our competitors or customers could\ndevelop new technologies or products which reflect similar or improved solutions to our existing technologies.\nFurther, we may not be able to adapt to evolving markets and technologies, develop new products, achieve and\nmaintain technological advantages or protect technological advantages through intellectual property rights. If we do\nnot successfully compete through the development and introduction of new products and technologies, our business,\nresults of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nIf we fail to maintain a positive reputation or are unable to conduct effective sales and marketing, our\nprospects and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe believe that market awareness and recognition of our brands have contributed significantly to the success of our\nbusiness. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing these brands, especially market perceptions of the quality\nof our products, is critical to maintaining our competitive advantage. If any of our products are subject to recall or\nare proven to be, or are claimed to be, ineffective or inaccurate for their stated purpose, then this could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, because we are\ndependent on market perceptions, negative publicity associated with product quality or other adverse effects\nresulting from, or perceived to be resulting from, our products could have a material adverse impact on our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nOur sales and marketing efforts are anchored by promoting our products to potential customers. Therefore, our sales\nand marketing force, whether in-house sales representatives or third-party commercial partners, must possess an up-\nto-date understanding of industry trends and products, as well as promotion and communication skills.\n22\nWhile we will continue to promote our brands to remain competitive, we may not be successful in doing so. If we\nare unable to increase or maintain the effectiveness and efficiency of our sales and marketing activities, or if we\nincur excessive sales expenses to do so, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially\nand adversely affected.\nWe could lose customers or generate lower revenue, operating profits and cash flows if there are significant\nincreases in the cost of raw materials or if we are unable to obtain such raw materials or other components of\nour products.\nWe purchase raw materials and components for use in our products, which exposes us to volatility in prices for\ncertain raw materials and products. Prices and availability of these raw materials are subject to substantial\nfluctuations that are beyond our control due to factors such as changing economic conditions, inflation, currency and\ncommodity price fluctuations, tariffs, resource availability, transportation costs, weather conditions and natural\ndisasters, political unrest and instability, and other factors impacting supply and demand pressures. Significant price\nincreases for these supplies could adversely affect our operating profits. Current and future inflationary effects may\nbe driven by, among other things, supply chain disruptions and governmental stimulus or fiscal policies. The\nCOVID-19 pandemic, for example, resulted in raw material price inflation as well as supply chain constraints and\ndisruptions. While we will generally attempt to mitigate the impact of increased raw material prices by endeavoring\nto make strategic purchasing decisions, broadening our supplier base and passing along increased costs to customers,\nthere may be a time delay between the increased raw material prices, and our mitigation efforts. Additionally, we\nmay be unable to increase the prices of products due to a competitor’s pricing pressure or other factors, or may be\nunable to raise the price of our products in a manner that is proportional to the level of inflation in our input costs,\nwhich would materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nCertain of our food safety product lines depend on a sole or single source supplier or vendor. The ability of these\nthird parties to deliver raw materials and products may be affected by events beyond our control. In addition, public\nhealth threats, such as COVID-19, severe influenza and other highly communicable viruses or diseases could affect\nour supply of raw materials, by limiting our ability to transport raw materials from our vendors or increasing\ndemand and competition for supplies, which could adversely affect our ability to obtain necessary raw materials for\ncertain of our products. Any sustained interruption in our receipt of adequate raw materials, supply chain disruptions\nimpacting the receipt or distribution of products, or disruption to key manufacturing sites’ operations due to natural\nand other disasters or events or other legal or regulatory requirements, could result in a significant price increase in\nraw materials, or their unavailability, which could result in a loss of customers or otherwise adversely impact our\nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur reputation, ability to do business and results of operations could be impaired by improper conduct by or\ndisputes with any of our employees, agents or business partners and we have a compliance burden with\nrespect to, and risk of violations of, anti-bribery, trade control, trade sanctions, anti-corruption and similar\nlaws.\nOur operations require us to comply with a number of U.S. and international laws and regulations, including those\ngoverning payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, anti-kickbacks, false claims, unfair competition, export\nand import compliance, money laundering and data privacy, as well as the improper use of proprietary information\nor social media. In particular, our international operations are subject to the regulations imposed by the Foreign\nCorrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act 2010 as well as anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws of\nvarious jurisdictions in which we operate. While we strive to maintain high standards, we cannot provide assurance\nthat our internal controls and compliance systems always will protect us from acts committed by our employees,\nagents or business partners that would violate such U.S. or international laws or regulations or fail to protect our\nconfidential information. Any such violations of law or improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal\ninvestigations in the U.S. or other jurisdictions, result in substantial monetary and non-monetary penalties and\nshareholder lawsuits, lead to increased costs of compliance and damage our reputation, business, results of\noperations, financial condition and cash flows.\n23\nTariffs and other trade measures could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash\nflows.\nOur international operations subject us to discriminatory or conflicting tariffs and trade policies. Tariffs have\nincreased and may continue to increase our material input costs, and any further trade restrictions, retaliatory trade\nmeasures and additional tariffs could result in higher input costs to our products. We may not be able to fully\nmitigate the impact of these increased costs or pass price increases on to our customers. While tariffs and other trade\nmeasures imposed by other countries on U.S. goods have not yet had a significant impact on our business or results\nof operations, we cannot predict further developments, and such existing or future tariffs could have a material\nadverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nChanges in domestic and foreign laws, regulations, policies, and enforcement initiatives increase our costs of\ncompliance and subject us to increased risk.\nOur domestic and international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in laws, regulations\nand policies (including environmental and employment regulations, export/import laws, tax policies and other\nsimilar programs). Failure to comply with any of these laws, regulations and policies could result in civil and\ncriminal as well was monetary and non-monetary penalties, and damage to our reputation. In addition, we cannot\nprovide assurance that our costs of complying with new and evolving regulatory reporting requirements and current\nor future laws, including environmental protection, employment, data security, data privacy and health and safety\nlaws, will not exceed our estimates. While these risks and the impact of these risks are difficult to predict, any one or\nmore of them could adversely affect our business, results of operations and reputation.\nDifferences in and changes to tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate and unanticipated outcomes\nwith respect to tax audits could adversely affect our business, profitability and reputation.\nWe are subject to taxation in a number of jurisdictions. Accordingly, our effective tax rate is impacted by changes in\nthe mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates. A material change in the statutory tax rate or\ninterpretation of local law in a jurisdiction in which we have significant operations could adversely impact our\neffective tax rate and impact our financial results.\nOur tax returns are subject to audit, and taxing authorities could challenge our operating structure, taxable presence,\napplication of treaty benefits or transfer pricing policies. If changes in statutory tax rates or laws or audits result in\nassessments different from amounts estimated, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows\ncould be adversely affected. In addition, changes in tax laws could have an adverse effect on our customers,\nresulting in lower demand for our products and services.\nA deterioration in our future expected profitability or cash flows could result in an impairment of our\nrecorded goodwill and intangible assets.\nWe have significant goodwill and intangible assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. The valuation and\nclassification of these assets and the assignment of useful lives to intangible assets involve significant judgments and\nthe use of estimates. Impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets requires significant use of judgment and\nassumptions, particularly as it relates to the determination of fair market value. A decrease in the long-term\neconomic outlook and future cash flows of our business could significantly impact asset values and potentially result\nin the impairment of intangible assets, including goodwill.\nThe markets for our products are extremely competitive, and our competitors could use existing resource\nadvantages to our detriment.\nThe food and animal safety industries are subject to rapid and substantial changes in technology and are\ncharacterized by extensive research and development and intense competition. Our competitors and potential\ncompetitors may have greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, research and development and\nmanagement resources than us. These competitors could use their resources, reputations and ability to leverage\nexisting customer relationships to provide a competitive advantage over us that could impact our results of\noperations. They might also succeed in developing products that are more reliable and effective than our products,\nare less costly than our products or provide alternatives to our products. If the products of a competitor are better\nable to meet our customers' requirements, then our operating results could be adversely affected.\n24\nWe are dependent on the agricultural marketplace, which is affected by factors beyond our control.\nOur primary customers are in the agricultural and food production industries. Economic conditions affecting\nagricultural industries are cyclical and are dependent upon many factors outside of our control, including weather\nconditions, changes in consumption patterns or commodity prices. Any of these factors in the agricultural\nmarketplace could affect our sales and overall financial performance.\nRISKS RELATED TO LIQUIDITY, INDEBTEDNESS AND THE CAPITAL MARKETS\nWe have incurred substantial indebtedness and our financial condition and operations may be adversely\naffected by a violation of financial or other covenants.\nWe have incurred substantial indebtedness and related debt service obligations, which could have important\nconsequences, including:\n• reduced flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions, and increased vulnerability to\nadverse economic and industry conditions;\n• reduced flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the competitive environment and\nthe markets in which we operate, and to technological and other changes;\n• reduced access to capital and increased borrowing costs generally or for any additional indebtedness to finance\nfuture operating and capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes;\n• lowered credit ratings;\n• reduced funds available for operations, capital expenditures and other activities;\n• increased vulnerability to increases in interest rates because a substantial portion of our indebtedness bears\ninterest at floating rates; and\n• competitive disadvantages relative to other companies with lower debt levels.\nOur Term Loan, comprised of our Revolving Facility and Term Loan Facility, contains customary affirmative and\nnegative covenants, including financial covenants based on leverage and cash interest expense coverage ratios and\nlimitations on our ability to make certain investments, declare or pay dividends or distributions on capital stock,\nredeem or repurchase capital stock and certain debt obligations, incur liens, incur indebtedness, or merge, make\ncertain acquisitions or sales of assets.\nOur outstanding Senior Notes also include customary events of default. A violation of any of these credit-related\ncovenants or agreements could result in a default under one or more of these agreements, which could permit the\nlenders or note holders, as applicable, to accelerate repayment of any borrowings or notes outstanding at that time,\nlevy on any collateral securing such indebtedness, and/or taking other actions designed to protect our ability to repay\nour indebtedness. Any such event would materially and adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our\nresults of operations and financial condition.\nThe available capacity under our Revolving Facility could be limited by our covenant ratios under certain\nconditions. An increase in the applicable leverage ratio, as a result of decreased earnings or otherwise, could result\nin reduced access to capital under our Revolving Facility, which is a significant component of our total available\nliquidity.\n25\nOur quarterly and annual operating results are subject to significant fluctuations.\nWe have experienced, and may experience in the future, significant fluctuations in our quarterly and annual\noperating results. The mix of products sold and the acceptance of new products, in addition to other factors such as\ncost increases, could contribute to this variability. We have few long-term customer contracts and operate primarily\nwith purchase orders. In addition, our expense levels are based, in part, on our expectation of future revenue levels.\nTherefore, a shortfall in expected revenue could result in a disproportionate reduction in our net income.\nThe market price of our common stock could be highly volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock could be volatile. Securities markets worldwide experience significant price\nand volume fluctuations. This market volatility, as well as other general economic, market or political conditions,\ncould reduce the market price of our common stock rapidly and unexpectedly, despite our operating performance.\nFactors that could impact the market price of our common stock include the factors described in this “Risk Factors”\nsection and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as:\n• Public announcements (including the timing of these announcements) regarding our business, financial\nperformance, acquisitions and prospects or new products or services, product enhancements or technological\nadvances by our competitors or us;\n• Trading activity in our stock, including transactions by us, our executive officers and directors, and significant\nshareholders; trading activity that results from the ordinary course rebalancing of stock indices in which we\nmay be included, such as the S&P Mid-Cap 400 Index; trading activity related to our inclusion in, or removal\nfrom, any stock indices; and short-interest in our common stock, which could be significant from time to time;\n• Investor perception of us and the industry and markets in which we operate; changes in earnings estimates or\nbuy/sell recommendations by securities analysts; and whether or not we meet earnings estimates of securities\nanalysts who follow us; and\n• General financial, domestic, international, economic and market conditions, including overall fluctuations in\nthe U.S. equity markets, which may experience extreme volatility that, in some cases, is unrelated or\ndisproportionate to our operating performance.\nOur business could be adversely affected by fluctuations in the global capital markets.\nOur business and financial results are affected by fluctuations in the global financial markets, including interest rates\nand currency exchange rates. The exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms.\nInternational revenues and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our\nreported revenues and profitability when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. These\nfluctuations could also adversely affect the demand for products and services provided by us. Failure to respond\ntimely to these fluctuations, or failure to effectively hedge these risks when possible, could lead to a material\nadverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have no current plans to start paying dividends in the near-term.\nDividend payments to our shareholders depend upon a number of factors, including our results of operations, cash\nflows and financial position, contractual restrictions and other factors considered relevant by our Board of Directors.\nWe have not historically paid dividends to our shareholders, and there is no assurance that we will declare and pay,\nor have the ability to declare and pay, any dividends on our common stock in the future.\n26\nOTHER RISK FACTORS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to obtain protection for the intellectual property used in our\nproducts.\nOur success and ability to compete depends, in part, on our ability to protect, in the U.S. and other countries, our\nproducts by establishing and maintaining intellectual property rights capable of protecting our technology and\nproducts. Patent applications filed by us may not result in the issuance of patents or, if granted, may not be granted\nin a form that will be commercially advantageous to us. Even if granted, patents can be challenged, narrowed,\ninvalidated, or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing similar products or\nlimit the length of time we have patent protection for our products. We also cannot assure that our nondisclosure\nagreements, together with trade secrets and other common law rights, will provide meaningful protection for our\ntrade secrets and other proprietary information. Moreover, the laws of some foreign jurisdictions may not protect\nintellectual property rights to the same extent as in the U.S., and many companies have encountered significant\ndifficulties in protecting and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions. If we encounter such difficulties or we\nare otherwise precluded from effectively protecting our intellectual property rights domestically or in foreign\njurisdictions, we could incur substantial costs and our business, including our business prospects, could be\nsubstantially harmed.\nCertain of our products could be the subject of patent infringement challenges.\nFrom time to time, we have received notices alleging that our products infringe third-party proprietary rights.\nWhether the manufacture, sale, or use of current products, or whether any products under development would, upon\ncommercialization, infringe any patent claim cannot be known with certainty unless and until a court interprets a\npatent claim and its validity in the context of litigation. The outcome of infringement litigation is subject to\nsubstantial uncertainties, and also the testimony of experts as to technical facts upon which experts may reasonably\ndisagree. Our defense of an infringement litigation lawsuit could result in significant expense. Regardless of the\noutcome, infringement litigation could significantly disrupt our marketing, development and commercialization\nefforts, divert management’s attention and consume our financial resources. In the event that we are found to\ninfringe any valid claim in a patent held by a third party, we could, among other things, be required to:\n• Pay damages, including up to treble damages and the other party’s attorneys’ fees, which may be substantial;\n• Cease the development, manufacture, importation, use and sale of products that infringe the patent rights of\nothers, through a court-imposed injunction;\n• Expend significant resources to redesign our technology so that it does not infringe others’ patent rights, or\ndevelop or acquire non-infringing intellectual property, which may not be possible;\n• Discontinue manufacturing or other processes incorporating infringing technology; and/or\n• Obtain licenses to the infringed intellectual property, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or\nat all.\nAny development or acquisition of non-infringing products, technology or licenses could require the expenditure of\nsubstantial time and other resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. If\nwe are required to, but cannot, obtain a license to valid patent rights held by a third party, we would likely be\nprevented from commercializing the relevant product, or from further manufacture, sale or use of the relevant\nproduct.\n27\nThe industries in which we operate are subject to substantial governmental regulation.\nA portion of our products and facilities are regulated by various domestic and foreign government agencies\nincluding the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental\nProtection Agency. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from products used to monitor and detect the\npresence of substances that are regulated by various government agencies. Furthermore, our growth could result in\nsubstantial liability to us and be adversely affected by the implementation of new regulations. The costs of\ncompliance or failure to comply with any obligations related to these laws or regulations could adversely impact our\nbusiness, including suspension or cessation of our operations, restrictions on our ability to expand at our present\nlocations or requirements that we make significant capital expenditures or incur other significant expenses.\nFailure to attract, retain and develop personnel, including for key management positions, could have an\nadverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur growth, profitability and effectiveness in conducting our operations and executing our strategic plans depend in\npart on our ability to attract, retain and develop qualified personnel and align them with appropriate opportunities for\nkey management positions and support for strategic initiatives. Our loss of any of our key employees could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on us. We compete with employers in various industries for sales, manufacturing, technical\nservices and other personnel, and this competition to hire may increase and the availability of qualified personnel\nmay be reduced. If we are unsuccessful in our efforts to attract and retain qualified personnel, our business, results\nof operations, financial condition, cash flows and competitive position could be adversely affected. Additionally, we\ncould miss opportunities for growth and efficiencies. We cannot assure that we will be able to retain our existing\npersonnel or attract additional qualified persons when required and on acceptable terms.\nOur business may be subject to product or service liability claims.\nThe manufacturing and distribution of our products and the performance of our services involves an inherent risk of\nliability claims being asserted against us. Regardless of whether we are ultimately determined to be liable or our\nproducts are determined to be defective, we could incur significant legal expenses not covered by insurance. In\naddition, product or service liability litigation could damage our reputation and impair our ability to market our\nproducts and services, regardless of the outcome. Litigation also could impair our ability to retain product liability\ninsurance or make our insurance more expensive. Although we currently maintain liability insurance, we cannot\nassure that we will be able to continue to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms, or that such insurance will\nprovide adequate coverage against all potential claims. If we are subject to an uninsured or inadequately insured\nproduct or services liability claim, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely\naffected.\nChanging political conditions could adversely impact our business and financial results.\nChanges in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture, sell or distribute our products are difficult\nto predict and could affect our business and financial results adversely. In addition, results of elections, referendums\nor other political processes in certain markets in which our products are manufactured, sold, or distributed could\ncreate uncertainty regarding how existing governmental policies, laws and regulations may change, including with\nrespect to sanctions, taxes, the movement of goods, services, capital and people between countries and other matters.\nThe potential implications of such uncertainty, which include, among others, exchange rate fluctuations, trade\nbarriers and market contraction, could adversely affect our business and financial results.\n28\nClimate change, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change could materially\nadversely affect our financial condition and business operations.\nClimate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the\natmosphere could present risks to our future operations from natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such\nas hurricanes, tropical storms, blizzards, tornadoes, earthquakes, wildfires or flooding. Such extreme weather\nconditions could pose physical risks to our facilities and disrupt our operations and impair our critical systems, and\nmay impact raw material sourcing, manufacturing operations, the distribution of our products and our operational\ncosts. Damage or destruction of our facilities may result in losses that exceed our insurance coverage. The impacts\nof climate change on global water resources may result in water scarcity, which could impact our ability to access\nsufficient quantities of water in certain locations and result in increased costs. Concern over climate change could\nresult in new legal or regulatory requirements designed to mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment.\nIf such laws or regulations are more stringent than current legal or regulatory requirements, we may experience\nincreased compliance burdens and costs to meet the regulatory obligations.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by an inability to meet the expectations of our stakeholders related\nto environmental, social and governance (ESG) objectives.\nVarious stakeholders, including customers, suppliers, providers of debt and equity capital, regulators, and those in\nthe workforce, are increasing their expectations of companies to do their part to combat global climate change and\nits impact and to conduct their operations in an environmentally sustainable and socially responsible manner with\nappropriate oversight by senior leadership. We have made certain public commitments to reduce emissions,\nconserve resources at our various facilities and further develop a diverse, equitable and inclusive culture. A failure to\nrespond to the expectations and initiatives of our stakeholders or to achieve the commitments we have made, could\nresult in damage to our reputation and relationships with various stakeholders, as well as adversely impact our\nfinancial condition due to volatility in the cost or availability of capital, difficultly obtaining new business, or\nentering into new supplier relationships, a possible loss of market share on our current product portfolio, or\ndifficulty attracting and retaining a skilled workforce.\nTax legislation could materially adversely affect our financial results and tax liabilities.\nOur business is subject to tax-related external conditions, such as tax rates, tax laws, and regulations, changing\npolitical environments in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions that impact tax examination, assessment and enforcement\napproaches. In addition, changes in tax laws including further regulatory developments arising from U.S. tax reform\nlegislation and/or regulations around the world could result in a tax expense or benefit recorded to our consolidated\nstatement of earnings. In connection with guidance such as the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Integrated\nFramework provided by Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), determination of\nmulti-jurisdictional taxation rights and the rate of tax applicable to certain types of income may be subject to\npotential change. Due to uncertainty of the regulation changes and other tax-related factors stated above, it is\ncurrently not possible to assess the ultimate impact of these actions on our financial statements.\nAlthough we believe that our historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws, regulations and\nexisting precedent, there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities\nor that we would be successful in any such challenge. Income tax audits associated with the allocation of income\nand other complex issues could result in significant income tax adjustments that could negatively impact our future\noperating results.\n29\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS – NONE\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\nWe rely on several information systems throughout our company, as well as those of our third-party business\npartners, to provide access to our web-based products and services, keep financial records, analyze results of\noperations, process customer orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers, store confidential or\nproprietary information, and operate other critical functions. Our information systems and our business partners’ and\nsuppliers’ information systems may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers and other security breaches, including\ncomputer viruses and malware, through the internet, email attachments, and persons with access to these information\nsystems, such as our employees or third parties with whom we do business. These risks have increased as\ninformation systems and the use of software and related applications become more cloud-based. We have\nimplemented various programs, processes, and systems designed to mitigate these risks.\nRisk Management and Strategy\nWe have a comprehensive cybersecurity risk assessment program designed to assess, identify, and manage material\nrisks associated with cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities and to mitigate the potential impact of any\ncybersecurity incidents on our operations and financial condition. We routinely review, modify, and update this\nprogram as necessary to address emerging risks. Our process for addressing risk is based on industry best practices\noutlined in CIS Critical Security Controls. Although this program is integrated within the Company's overall risk\nmanagement system, the implementation of this program requires a unique and specialized level of expertise and\nexperience, which has led us to create a cybersecurity team and various processes designed to address these specific\nrisks, as discussed more below.\nWe regularly engage consultants, auditors, and other third parties to assist in developing, maintaining, and\nenhancing our cybersecurity risk assessment program. These third-party engagements supplement our internal\ncapabilities and help ensure the robustness of our program. Examples of these engagements include penetration\ntesting of our customer facing domains, quarterly cybersecurity briefings with outside counsel, and an annual\nassessment of our overall cybersecurity program. We maintain policies and procedures to identify and monitor\ncybersecurity risks associated with these third-party service providers, particularly those with access to customer,\nemployee, or other sensitive data. Our selection and oversight of these providers includes diligence reviews,\ncontractual protections, and other measures to mitigate these risks over the entire lifecycle of the relationship,\nincluding through implementation of the CIS Critical Security Controls.\nIn addition to these prevention measures, we work proactively to detect and minimize the impact of cybersecurity\nincidents. We have a written incident response plan designed to ensure the appropriate internal and, if necessary,\nexternal resources are employed to promptly and effectively respond to potential breaches, minimize any related\ndamage, and avoid disruption to our operations. We routinely test our incident response process through simulated\nincidents. No risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, have\nmaterially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company, including its business strategy, results\nof operations, or financial condition. While we have not experienced any cybersecurity incidents or threats that have\nmaterially impacted us or our business, we have encountered incidents in the past, which we have used to improve\nour program and defenses. Since it is possible we could experience a material cybersecurity incident in the future,\nwe remain diligent in maintaining and continuously improving our program in an effort to prevent such incidents\nand, if one was to occur, to manage it effectively.\nGovernance\nBoard of Directors Oversight\nThe Governance and Sustainability Committee of our Board of Directors (the \"Governance Committee\") is\nresponsible for providing oversight and policy direction on our risk management policies and programs, including\nthose relating to cybersecurity. The Charter of the Governance Committee specifically requires the committee to\nperiodically review the Company's enterprise cybersecurity strategy and framework, including the Company's\nassessment and management of cybersecurity threats and risks, data security programs, applicable laws and\nregulations, and the Company's management and mitigation of cybersecurity and information technology risks and\npotential breach incidents, including our incident response plan. The Governance Committee is also tasked with\nreviewing any significant cybersecurity incident that occurs.\n30\nThe Governance Committee is required by its Charter to consist of not fewer than three independent directors, and\nthe committee currently consists of five independent directors. The Governance Committee typically meets on a\nquarterly basis. At each meeting, a written cybersecurity brief from IT leadership is provided. These reports include\na review of emerging cybersecurity risks and developments and updates to our cybersecurity risk assessment\nprogram. The Governance Committee provides regular reports to the full Board of Directors on its oversight of the\nCompany's cybersecurity risks and risk management system.\nManagement's Role\nOur management team is primarily responsible for assessing and managing material risks to the Company from\ncybersecurity threats. We have a cross-functional cybersecurity team led by our cybersecurity manager and\ncomprised of personnel from our information technology group, including the head of IT, and senior leadership. We\nhave established a robust framework for preventing, identifying, evaluating, and mitigating cybersecurity risks.\nOur cybersecurity manager is designated as the senior executive responsible for cybersecurity and reports directly to\nthe head of IT. Our cybersecurity manager has a comprehensive information technology background and over ten\nyears of service in managing or assisting in managing cybersecurity risks.\nTo support the head of IT and cybersecurity manager in managing cybersecurity risks, we established a cross-\nfunctional cybersecurity team that includes experts in various aspects of information security. Combined, this team\nof employees includes individuals with over 30 years of prior work experience in cybersecurity and data protection.\nThese individuals are responsible for the day-to-day implementation of our cybersecurity program.\nWe employ a comprehensive set of processes to monitor the prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of\ncybersecurity incidents. These processes include:\n• Continuous monitoring of network traffic and information technology systems for signs of potential threats;\n• Regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing to identify and address weaknesses;\n• Implementation of cybersecurity measures, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and data encryption;\n• Employee training and awareness programs to educate all staff about cybersecurity risks and prevention\nmeasures; and\n• Incident response plans to ensure swift, effective, and adequate disclosure of cybersecurity incidents to the\nappropriate individuals within the Company.\nThese processes are regularly reviewed and updated to adapt to evolving cybersecurity threats and any changes in\nour systems or business operations.\nOur head of IT, cybersecurity manager, and other members of our cybersecurity team provide quarterly updates and\nreports to the Governance Committee of our Board of Directors on cybersecurity risks and our risk management\nsystems. Our cybersecurity team is also required to provide senior management and the Governance Committee with\nmore frequent updates on major developments regarding cybersecurity matters or as otherwise appropriate. As noted\nabove, the Governance Committee provides regular updates to the Board on these matters so that the Board remains\nadequately informed about this important aspect of the Company's overall risk management.\nITEM 2.

These properties are in good condition, well-maintained,\n31\nand generally suitable and adequate to support our business. For leased properties, we do not anticipate difficulty in\nrenewing existing leases or in finding alternative facilities.\nITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nWe are routinely involved in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business. In the\nopinion of our management, the outcome of such proceedings and litigation currently pending will not materially\naffect our consolidated operations, cash flows, or financial condition. However, the litigation process is subject to\nmany uncertainties, and the outcome of individual matters is not predictable with assurance. See “Risk Factors” in\nItem 1A above for a description of certain related risks. See Note 10. “Commitments and Contingencies” to the\nconsolidated financial statements included in Item 15. “Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules” of this Report\nfor discussion of loss contingencies.\nITEM 4.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in\nconjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report\non Form 10-K.\nIn addition, any forward-looking statements represent management’s views only as of the day this Form 10-K was\nfirst filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and should not be relied upon as representing\nmanagement’s views as of any subsequent date. While we may elect to update forward-looking statements at some\npoint in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so, even if our views change.\nCOMPANY OVERVIEW\nNeogen Corporation and subsidiaries develop, manufacture and market a diverse line of products and services\ndedicated to food and animal safety. Our Food Safety segment consists primarily of diagnostic test kits and\ncomplementary products (e.g., culture media) sold to food producers and processors to detect dangerous and/or\nunintended substances in human food and animal feed, such as foodborne pathogens, spoilage organisms, natural\ntoxins, food allergens, ruminant by-products, meat speciation, drug residues, pesticide residues and general\nsanitation concerns. The majority of the diagnostic test kits are disposable, single-use, immunoassay and DNA\ndetection products that rely on proprietary antibodies and RNA and DNA testing methodologies to produce rapid\nand accurate test results. Our expanding line of food safety products also includes genomics-based diagnostic\ntechnology, and advanced software systems that help testers to objectively analyze and store their results and\nperform analysis on the results from multiple locations over extended periods.\nNeogen’s Animal Safety segment is engaged in the development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of\nveterinary instruments, pharmaceuticals, vaccines, topicals, parasiticides, diagnostic products, rodent control\nproducts, cleaners, disinfectants, insect control products and genomics testing services for the worldwide animal\nsafety market. The majority of these consumable products are marketed through veterinarians, retailers, livestock\nproducers and animal health product distributors.\nTRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES\nIn prior years, production was negatively impacted by broad supply chain challenges and labor market disruptions.\nAdditionally, input cost inflation, including increases in certain raw materials, negatively impacted operating results.\nIn fiscal 2023, these negative impacts steadily improved throughout the year. In fiscal 2024, despite a slowing of\ninflation rates, there remains economic headwinds of softening consumer demand and higher interest rates, coupled\nwith ongoing geopolitical tension in certain regions.\nInterest rates have risen sharply, particularly in fiscal 2023, as a way to combat inflation. This, subsequently,\nincreased our borrowing costs and raised the overall cost of capital. While the frequent increases have largely\nsubsided, the overall interest rate is significantly higher than in recent years, which increases interest expense on the\nunhedged portion of our Term Loan. In response to the historically high inflationary environment, we took pricing\nactions to mitigate the impacts on the business in the prior two fiscal years. The impact of inflation continued to\naffect us throughout fiscal year 2024, although at a continually decreasing rate compared to fiscal years 2022 and\n2023.\nBeginning in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, we implemented a new enterprise resource planning system and\nbegan the exit of our transition distribution agreements with 3M, which led to certain shipment delays and an\nelevated backlog of open orders, specifically in the Food Safety segment. As of the end of fiscal year 2024, order\nfulfillment issues have largely been resolved, and order fulfillment rates have improved to meet the needs of our\ncustomers in this improving end-market environment.\nAlthough we have no operations in or direct exposure to Russia, Belarus or Ukraine, we have experienced\nintermittent shortages in materials and increased costs for transportation, energy and raw materials due, in part, to\nthe negative impact of the Russia-Ukraine military conflict, which began in February 2022, on the global economy.\nOur European operations and customer base have been negatively impacted by the conflict. Similarly, the military\n34\nconflict between Israel and Hamas has increased overall geopolitical tensions. As the respective conflicts continue\nor worsen, they may further impact our business, financial condition or results of operations in fiscal year 2025.\nWe continue to evaluate the nature and extent to which these issues impact our business, including consolidated\nresults of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We expect these issues to continue to impact us into fiscal\nyear 2025.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nHistorical Periods\nRefer to Part II - Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nin our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2023 for discussion of the Results of Operations, Segment\nResults of Operations, and Financial Condition and Liquidity for the year ended May 31, 2023 compared to the year\nended May 31, 2022, which is incorporated by reference herein.\nExecutive Overview\nYear Ended May 31,\nIncrease /\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 (Decrease)\nTotal Revenues $ 924,222 $ 822,447 $ 101,775\nCost of Revenues 460,322 416,492 43,830\nGross Profit 463,900 405,955 57,945\nOperating Expenses\nSales and marketing 182,872 141,222 41,650\nGeneral and administrative 199,889 201,179 (1,290)\nResearch and development 22,476 26,039 (3,563)\nTotal Operating Expenses 405,237 368,440 36,797\nOperating Income 58,663 37,515 21,148\nOther (Expense) Income\nInterest income 6,362 3,166 3,196\nInterest expense (73,394) (55,961) (17,433)\nOther, net (5,936) (6,762) 826\nTotal Other Expense (72,968) (59,557) (13,411)\nLoss Before Taxes (14,305) (22,042) 7,737\nIncome Tax (Benefit) Expense (4,884) 828 (5,712)\nNet Loss $ (9,421) $ (22,870) $ 13,449\n35\nREVENUE\nYear Ended May 31,\nIncrease /\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 (Decrease) % Change\nFood Safety:\nNatural Toxins & Allergens $ 82,240 $ 82,567 $ (327) (0)%\nBacterial & General Sanitation 171,217 134,934 36,283 27%\nIndicator Testing, Culture Media & Other 334,636 267,178 67,458 25%\nRodent Control, Insect Control & Disinfectants 42,965 39,655 3,310 8%\nGenomics Services 24,283 22,463 1,820 8%\n655,341 546,797 108,544 20%\nAnimal Safety:\nLife Sciences 6,515 6,254 261 4%\nVeterinary Instruments & Disposables 65,848 63,843 2,005 3%\nAnimal Care & Other 36,978 39,068 (2,090) (5)%\nRodent Control, Insect Control & Disinfectants 88,732 87,423 1,309 1%\nGenomics Services 70,808 79,062 (8,254) (10)%\n268,881 275,650 (6,769) (2)%\nTotal Revenue, net $ 924,222 $ 822,447 $ 101,775 12%\nYear Ended May 31, 2024 Compared to Year Ended May 31, 2023\nFood Safety:\nRevenue for the Food Safety segment increased $108.5 million in fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023.\nThe increase included a $98.6 million benefit from acquisitions, a $10.1 million adverse impact due to currency, and\n$20.0 million of growth in the business.\nNatural Toxins & Allergens – Revenues in this category were relatively unchanged in fiscal 2024. Excluding first\nquarter revenue of the acquired allergen product line from 3M FSD, revenue in this category decreased 3% due to a\ndecline in sales of natural toxin test kits, caused by product availability issues and prior year sales of discontinued\ndairy drug residue test kits. These declines were partially offset by growth in our line of allergen test kits.\nBacterial & General Sanitation – Revenue in this category increased 27% in fiscal 2024 compared to the prior\nfiscal year. Excluding the first quarter contribution of the Clean-Trace line of general sanitation products and the\npathogen test kit product line, both acquired in the FSD transaction, revenue in this category increased 2% for the\nfull year. This increase was driven by growth of the acquired product lines for the remainder of the year.\nIndicator Testing, Culture Media & Other – Revenue in this category increased 25% in fiscal 2024 compared to\nthe prior fiscal year, driven primarily from revenues resulting from FSD transaction. Excluding first quarter revenue\nof acquired Petrifilm® and sample handling product lines, revenue rose 2% for the year. Continued growth of the\nacquired product lines for the remainder of the year combined with higher sales of the Neogen Analytics software\nproduct more than offset a large non-recurring sale of culture media in fiscal year 2023.\nRodent Control, Insect Control & Disinfectants – Revenue of products in this category sold through our Food\nSafety operations increased 8% in fiscal 2024 compared to the prior fiscal year. Increased Cleaner & Disinfectants\nsales in Europe and a government tender for insect control products in Brazil contributed to the overall growth.\nGenomics Services – Revenue of genomics services sold through our Food Safety operations increased 8% in fiscal\n2024 compared to the prior fiscal year. Increased revenue to existing customers in Europe as well as new business in\nBrazil and China added to the overall growth during the year.\n36\nAnimal Safety:\nRevenue for the Animal Safety segment decreased $6.8 million in fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023.\nThe decrease included $0.7 million due to discontinued product lines, a $0.6 million adverse impact due to currency,\nand a $5.5 million decline in the business.\nLife Sciences – Revenue in this category increased 4% in fiscal 2024 compared to the prior fiscal year, driven by\nhigher demand of substrate products from manufacturers of diagnostic tests.\nVeterinary Instruments & Disposables – Revenue in this category increased 3% in fiscal 2024 compared to the\nprior fiscal year driven by higher sales of detectable needles and disposable syringes.\nAnimal Care & Other – Revenue of these products decreased 5% in fiscal 2024 compared to the prior fiscal year\ndriven primarily by lower sales of small animal supplements and wound care products, due to supply constraints,\nand the discontinued Thyrokare product line. Higher sales of vitamin injectables products partially offset the decline.\nRodent Control, Insect Control & Disinfectants – Revenue in this category increased 1% in fiscal 2024,\ncompared to the prior fiscal year, driven with higher sales of insect control products, partially offset by flat sales of\nrodent control products and cleaners and disinfectants.\nGenomics Services – Revenue in this category decreased 10% in fiscal 2024 compared to the prior fiscal year. The\ndecrease in this category was attributed to customer attrition in the poultry and porcine markets associated with a\nstrategic shift in the business to focus primarily on large production animals.\nService Revenue\nService revenue, which consists primarily of genomics services provided to animal production and companion\nanimal markets, was $102.4 million in fiscal 2024, a decrease of 5% over prior fiscal year revenue of $107.4\nmillion. The decrease was primarily driven by customer attrition in the poultry market and a decrease in revenue in\ndomestic porcine genomics testing, partially offset by strength in genomics testing in the U.K. and Australia, and\nnew business gained with our Neogen Analytics software as a service.\nInternational Revenue\nNeogen’s international revenues were $459.0 million in fiscal year 2024, compared to $398.4 million in fiscal 2023,\nan increase of 15%. The increase was primarily due to $63.8 million of international revenue from 3M FSD during\nthe first quarter of fiscal 2024. Excluding the first quarter of revenue from the FSD transaction, which did not occur\nin the prior year comparable period, international revenue slightly decreased, primarily driven by the adverse impact\nof currency.\n37\nGROSS MARGIN\nGross margin, expressed as a percentage of revenue, was 50.2% during fiscal year 2024 compared to 49.4% during\nthe prior fiscal year. The margin expansion was primarily due to a full year of higher-margin FSD sales in our Food\nSafety segment, which generated gross margin higher than the legacy company average gross margin. The increase\nwas partially offset by a lower gross margin, expressed as a percentage of revenue, in our Animal Safety segment.\nThe decline was primarily driven by our domestic genomics lab, where fixed costs were unable to decrease at the\nsame proportion as the reduction in revenue due to customer attrition.\nWithin each reporting segment, increased raw material costs continue to pressure gross margins in certain product\nlines. However, while inflation continues to impact the business, the rate of raw material price and freight cost\nincreases have significantly declined throughout both the current and prior year comparative periods. Pricing actions\ntaken during these periods also mitigated the impact of cost increases.\nOPERATING EXPENSES\nYear Ended May 31,\nIncrease /\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 (Decrease) % Change\nFood Safety $ 136,837 $ 98,926 $ 37,911 38%\nAnimal Safety 46,035 42,296 3,739 9%\nTotal Sales and Marketing $ 182,872 $ 141,222 $ 41,650 29%\nFood Safety 116,573 108,821 7,752 7%\nAnimal Safety 20,213 26,127 (5,914) (23)%\nCorporate and eliminations 63,103 66,231 (3,128) (5)%\nTotal General and Administrative $ 199,889 $ 201,179 $ (1,290) (1)%\nFood Safety 17,851 20,981 (3,130) (15)%\nAnimal Safety 4,625 5,058 (433) (9)%\nTotal Research and Development $ 22,476 $ 26,039 $ (3,563) (14)%\nTotal Operating Expense $ 405,237 $ 368,440 $ 36,797 10%\nOperating expenses were $405.2 million during fiscal year 2024, compared to $368.4 million during the prior fiscal\nyear. The increase during the year was primarily the result of costs added to accommodate the increased size and\ncomplexity of the Company following the FSD transaction, which was included for only nine months in the prior\nyear comparable period.\nSales and Marketing:\nSales and marketing expenses were $182.9 million during fiscal year 2024, compared to $141.2 million during the\nprior fiscal year. For the Food Safety segment, the increase was primarily driven by incremental costs resulting from\nthe FSD transaction, including compensation and related expenses for the acquired sales and marketing teams and\nhigher costs related to inefficiencies as we took over distribution from 3M. For the Animal Safety segment, the\nincrease was primarily driven by employee costs resulting from headcount increases.\n38\nGeneral and Administrative:\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $199.9 million during fiscal year 2024, compared to $201.2 million\nduring the prior fiscal year. For the Food Safety segment, an increase in these expenses was primarily the result of\nincremental intangible asset amortization and additional personnel hired to accommodate the increased size and\ncomplexity of the organization. These increases were partially offset by lower transaction fees and integration\nexpenses compared to the prior year comparable period. For the Animal Safety segment, the decrease was driven by\nlower impairment expenses associated with discontinued product lines.\nResearch and Development:\nResearch and development expense was $22.5 million in fiscal year 2024, compared to $26.0 million during the\nprior fiscal year. The decrease during the year was primarily the result of lower contracted services and employee\ncosts in the Food Safety segment, as we continue to integrate the 3M FSD business and realize synergies in certain\nareas.\nOTHER (EXPENSE) INCOME\nThe net interest expense recorded during fiscal year 2024 was the result of debt incurred to fund the FSD\ntransaction. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company had no debt outstanding. Interest income relates to\nearnings on our marketable securities and money market account portfolio. Higher balances in money market\nportfolios with higher yields drove the increase in interest income during fiscal year 2024. Other expense resulting\nfrom foreign currency transactions was the result of changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S.\ndollar in countries in which we operate.\nPROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES\nIncome tax benefit during fiscal year 2024 was $4.9 million, compared to income tax expense of $0.8 million in the\nprior fiscal year. The net tax benefit in the current fiscal year was primarily related to pre-tax losses due to\namortization expense and interest expense resulting from the FSD transaction. In the prior fiscal year, pre-tax loss\ndue to the FSD transaction was offset primarily by nondeductible transaction costs.\nThe total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate as of May 31,\n2024 and May 31, 2023 are $2.7 million and $1.1 million, respectively. Increases in unrecognized tax benefits are\nprimarily associated with transfer pricing, IRC Section 861 expense apportionment, and research and development\ncredits.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThis report includes certain financial information for the Company that differs from what is reported in accordance\nwith U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures consist of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted\nEBITDA margin. These non-GAAP financial measures are included in this report because management believes that\nthey provide investors with additional useful information to measure the performance of the Company, and because\nthese non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties\nas common performance measures to compare results or estimate valuations across companies in industries the\nCompany operates in.\nEBITDA\nWe define EBITDA as net income before interest, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. We present\nEBITDA as a performance measure because it may allow for a comparison of results across periods and results\nacross companies in the industries in which Neogen operates on a consistent basis, by removing the effects on\noperating performance of (a) capital structure (such as the varying levels of interest expense and interest income),\n(b) asset base and capital investment cycle (such as depreciation and amortization) and (c) items largely outside the\ncontrol of management (such as income taxes). EBITDA also forms the basis for the measurement of Adjusted\nEBITDA (discussed below).\n39\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, adjusted for share-based compensation and certain transaction fees and\nexpenses. We present Adjusted EBITDA because it provides an understanding of underlying business performance\nby excluding the following:\n• Share-based compensation\n• FX translation (gain)/loss on loan revaluation and other revaluation\n• Certain transaction fees and integration costs\n• Restructuring\n• Contingent consideration adjustments\n• ERP Expense\n• Other income and expense items\nAdjusted EBITDA margin\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenues. We present Adjusted\nEBITDA margin as a performance measure to analyze the level of Adjusted EBITDA generated from total revenue.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are presented for informational purposes only. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA\nand Adjusted EBITDA margin are not recognized terms under GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as\na substitute for, or superior to, net (loss) income, operating income, cash flow from operating activities or other\nmeasures of financial performance. This information does not purport to represent the results Neogen would have\nachieved had any of the transactions for which an adjustment is made occurred at the beginning of the periods\npresented or as of the dates indicated. This information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. It may not\ngive an accurate or complete picture of Neogen’s financial condition or results of operations for the periods\npresented and should not be relied upon when making an investment decision.\nThe use of the terms EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA margin may not be comparable to\nsimilarly titled measures used by other companies or persons due to potential differences in the method of\ncalculation.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. For example, for EBITDA-based metrics:\n• they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, Neogen’s working capital needs;\n• they do not reflect Neogen’s tax expense or the cash requirements to pay taxes;\n• they do not reflect the historical cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or\ncontractual commitments;\n• they do not reflect any cash requirements for future replacements of assets that are being depreciated and\namortized; and\n• they may be calculated differently from other companies in Neogen’s industries limiting their usefulness as\ncomparative measures.\nA reader should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on the financial statements of Neogen and\nusing these non-GAAP financial measures only as a supplement to evaluate Neogen’s performance.\nFor each of these non-GAAP financial measures below, we are providing a reconciliation of the differences between\nthe non-GAAP measure and the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\n40\nReconciliation between net (loss) income and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is as follows:\nYear Ended May 31,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2022\nNet (Loss) Income $ (9,421) $ (22,870) $ 48,307\nNet (loss) income margin % (1.0)% (2.8)% 9.2%\nIncome tax (benefit) expense (4,884) 828 11,900\nDepreciation and amortization 116,717 88,377 23,694\nInterest expense (income), net 67,032 52,795 (1,267)\nEBITDA 169,444 119,130 82,634\nShare-based compensation 13,768 10,177 7,154\nFX transaction loss on loan revaluation (1) 2,082 5,226 —\nCertain transaction fees and integration costs (2) 15,521 59,812 25,581\nRestructuring (3) 3,513 475 —\nContingent consideration adjustments 300 (300) —\nERP Expense (4) 7,467 — —\nDiscontinued product line expense (5) 994 5,639 —\n(Recovery) loss on sale of minority interest (103) 1,516 —\nLoss on investment — 500 —\nInventory step-up charge — 3,245 —\nOther 178 — —\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 213,164 $ 205,420 $ 115,369\nAdjusted EBITDA margin % 23.1% 25.0% 21.9%\n(1) Net foreign currency transaction loss associated with the revaluation of non-functional currency intercompany\nloans established in connection with the 3M Food Safety transaction and other non-hedged foreign currency\nrevaluation resulting from 3M agreements.\n(2) Includes costs associated with the 3M transaction, including various transition agreements.\n(3) Includes costs associated with consolidation of U.S. genomics labs.\n(4) Expenses related to ERP implementation.\n(5) Expenses associated with intangible asset impairments and inventory scrap amounts related to certain\ndiscontinued product lines.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $7.7 million in fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023, primarily due to earnings\ngenerated from the 3M FSD business, which combined with Neogen on September 1, 2022. Expressed as a\npercentage of revenue, adjusted EBITDA was 23.1% in fiscal year 2024 compared to 25.0% in fiscal year 2023. The\nlower Adjusted EBITDA margin was driven primarily by higher operating expenses compared to the prior-year\nperiods, reflecting additions to accommodate the integration of the 3M FSD.\n41\nFUTURE OPERATING RESULTS\nNeogen Corporation’s future operating results involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual events or results\nmay differ materially from those discussed in this report. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences\ninclude, but are not limited to, the factors discussed below as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report.\nManagement’s ability to grow the business and its profitability in the future depends upon our ability to successfully\nimplement various strategies, including:\n• developing, manufacturing and marketing new products with new features and capabilities, and having those\nnew products successfully accepted in the marketplace;\n• expanding our markets by fostering increased use of our products by customers;\n• maintaining or increasing gross and net operating margins in changing cost environments;\n• strengthening operations and sales and marketing activities in geographies outside of the U.S.;\n• developing and implementing new technology development strategies; and\n• identifying and completing acquisitions that enhance existing product categories or creating new products or\nservices, and successfully integrating completed acquisitions, including the FSD transaction.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY\nOverview\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from the operations of our business, and\navailable borrowing capacity under our Credit Facilities. Our principal uses of cash include working capital-related\nitems, capital expenditures, debt service, and strategic investments.\nOur future cash generation and borrowing capacity may not be sufficient to meet cash requirements to fund the\noperating business, repay debt obligations, construct new manufacturing facilities, commercialize products currently\nunder development or execute our future plans to acquire additional businesses, technology and products that fit\nwithin our strategic plan. Accordingly, we may be required, or may choose, to issue additional equity securities or\nenter into other financing arrangements for a portion of our future capital needs. However, we continuously monitor\nand forecast our liquidity situation in light of industry, customer and economic factors, and take the necessary\nactions to preserve our liquidity and evaluate other financial alternatives that may be available to us should the need\narise. As a result, we believe that our cash flows from operations, cash on hand, and borrowing capacity will enable\nus to fund the operating business, repay debt obligations, construct new manufacturing facilities, commercialize\nproducts currently under development, and execute our strategic plans.\nWe are subject to certain legal and other proceedings in the normal course of business that have not had, and, in the\nopinion of management, are not expected to have, a material effect on our results of operations or financial position.\nAs of May 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $170.9 million, and borrowings\navailable under our revolving line of credit of $150.0 million.\nCash Flows\nYear Ended May 31,\n2024 2023 Increase / (Decrease)\nNet Cash provided by Operating Activities 35,264 41,028 (5,764)\nNet Cash (used for) provided by Investing Activities (29,309) 201,039 (230,348)\nNet Cash provided by (used for) Financing Activities 1,918 (118,081) 119,999\n42\nComparing fiscal year 2024 to fiscal 2023, the lower inflow in cash from operating activities was primarily the result\nof working capital items, specifically a large outflow for inventory during fiscal year 2024 as we exited distribution\nagreements with 3M. This resulted in large purchases of inventory, as we are now stocking 3M FSD products.\nIn fiscal year 2024, the outflow in cash for investing activities was primarily the result of purchases of property,\nequipment and non-current intangible assets of $111.4 million. This was partially offset by the sale of marketable\nsecurities of $82.0 million. In fiscal year 2023, there were purchases of property, equipment and non-current\nintangible assets of $65.8 million and the maturity of marketable securities of $266.8 million, resulting in an inflow\nfrom investing activities.\nComparing fiscal year 2024 to fiscal 2023, the net inflow in cash from financing activities was primarily the result\nof the Company paying down $100 million of the $1 billion in debt incurred in connection with the FSD transaction\nin fiscal year 2023.\nNet accounts receivable balances were $173.0 million as of May 31, 2024 compared to $153.3 million as of May 31,\n2023. Days’ sales outstanding, a measurement of the time it takes to collect receivables, for the business was 61\ndays as of May 31, 2024, compared to 57 days for the legacy business as of May 31, 2023.\nAs part of transition services agreements between the Company and 3M, related to the merger of the Food Safety\nbusiness, 3M invoiced our customers for products that 3M manufactured and shipped on our behalf through\nDecember 2023. We have completed the exit of distribution and back office-related service contracts and currently\nonly have a contract manufacturing agreement in place with 3M for certain products.\nNet inventory was $189.3 million as of May 31, 2024, an increase of $55.5 million, compared to $133.8 million as\nof May 31, 2023. The higher inventory levels are primarily the result of the Company now stocking 3M FSD\nproducts.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS As of May 31, 2024, we have the following contractual obligations due by\nperiod:\nLess than More than\n(dollars in thousands) Total 1 year 1-3 years 4-5 years 5 years\nDebt $ 902,350 $ 2,350 $ 34,063 $ 515,937 $ 350,000\nInterest obligations 302,941 72,233 133,321 63,091 34,296\nOperating Leases 18,022 5,263 8,238 3,515 1,006\nPurchase Obligations (1) 112,641 110,341 2,300 — —\n$ 1,335,954 $ 190,187 $ 177,922 $ 582,543 $ 385,302\n(1) Purchase obligations are primarily purchase orders for future inventory and capital equipment purchases.\nWe continue to make investments in our business and operating facilities. Our estimate for capital expenditures in\nfiscal 2025 is $85 million. This includes approximately $55 million in capital expenditures related to the integration\nof the acquired 3M FSD products, the most significant portion of which is related to the construction of and\nequipment for our new manufacturing facility in Lansing, Michigan\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on the consolidated\nfinancial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States. The preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates and\njudgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of\ncontingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates the estimates, including but not limited\nto, those related to receivable allowances, inventories and intangible assets. These estimates are based on historical\nexperience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results\nof which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily\napparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or\nconditions.\n43\nThe following critical accounting estimates reflect management’s more significant judgments used in the preparation\nof the consolidated financial statements.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and\nliabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities\nand for tax credit carryforwards and are measured using the enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the\ndifferences are expected to reverse. Deferred income tax expense represents the change in net deferred income tax\nassets and liabilities during the year. The determination of income subject to income tax in each tax paying\njurisdiction requires us to apply transfer pricing guidelines for certain intercompany transactions.\nOur tax rate is subject to adjustment over the balance of the year due to, among other things, income tax rate\nchanges by governments; the jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed; changes in the\nvaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to our interpretation of transfer pricing standards;\nchanges in available tax credits or other incentives; changes in stock-based compensation expense; changes in tax\nlaws or the interpretation of such tax laws; and changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nAlthough we believe our tax estimates are reasonable and we prepare our tax filings in accordance with all\napplicable tax laws, the final determination with respect to any audit, and any related litigation, could be materially\ndifferent from our estimates or from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or\nlitigation could have a material effect on operating results and/or cash flows in the periods for which that\ndetermination is made. In addition, future period earnings may be adversely impacted by litigation costs,\nsettlements, penalties, and/or interest assessments.\nGoodwill\nWe record goodwill when the purchase price of acquired businesses exceeds the value of their identifiable net\ntangible and intangible assets acquired. We review our goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter\nof our fiscal year. In addition, we review goodwill for impairment whenever adverse events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate a possible impairment. We may elect to assess qualitative factors as a basis for determining\nwhether it is necessary to perform quantitative impairment testing. If management’s assessment and conclusion of\nthese qualitative factors indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is more than\nits carrying value, then no further testing is required. Otherwise, the reporting unit is quantitatively tested for\nimpairment.\nOur business is organized into two reporting units: Food Safety and Animal Safety. The determination of our\nreporting units and impairment indicators also require us to make significant judgments.\nIn performing goodwill impairment testing, we utilize a third-party valuation specialist to assist management in\ndetermining the fair value of our reporting units. Fair value of the reporting unit is estimated based on a combination\nof an income-based approach consisting of a discounted cash flows analysis and the use of a market-based approach\nconsisting of pricing multiples derived from an analysis of comparable public companies multiplied against\nhistorical and/or anticipated financial metrics of the reporting unit. The discounted cash flows approach is based on\nthe reporting unit’s forecasted future cash flows, including forecasted revenue growth rates and gross margin\nassumptions, that are discounted to present value using the reporting unit’s weighted average cost of capital\n(WACC) as the discount rate. For the market-based approach, management uses the guideline public company\nmethod. The guideline public company method analyzes market multiples of revenues and earnings before interest,\ntaxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) for a group of comparable public companies. Valuation multiples\nare calculated utilizing actual transaction prices and revenue/EBITDA data from target companies deemed similar to\nthe reporting unit. Management typically assigns more weight to the income-based valuation method. Management\nalso evaluates the fair value estimates of the reporting units in the context of the Company’s total enterprise market\nvalue.\nBased on the estimated fair value developed from the income and market-based methods, we determine the\nestimated fair value of the reporting unit. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value,\nthe goodwill is not impaired and no analysis is required. However, if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is\nless than its carrying value, the impairment loss is calculated as the difference between the carrying value of the\nreporting unit and the estimated fair value, limited to the amount of the goodwill assigned to the reporting unit.\n44\nWe develop our estimates based on information available as of the date of our assessment, using assumptions we\nbelieve market participants would use in performing an independent valuation of the business. Although we believe\nthe estimates and assumptions used in the impairment assessment are reasonable and appropriate, it is possible that\nthe assumptions and conclusions regarding the impairment of goodwill of the reporting unit could change in future\nperiods. There can be no assurance the estimates and assumptions, in particular our long-term financial projections,\nthat are based on information that are known or knowable by us at the time of our goodwill impairment assessment\nwill prove to be accurate predictions of the future, if, for example, (i) the reporting unit does not perform as\nprojected, (ii) overall economic conditions in future years vary from current assumptions (including a change in the\ndiscount rate), (iii) business conditions or strategies change from current assumptions, including loss of major\ncustomers or channels, (iv) investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace, or (v)\nenterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies, or actual sales transactions of comparable companies,\nwere to decline, resulting in lower multiples of revenues and EBITDA.\nWe conducted the impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 and concluded that the fair value of\nour reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values, resulting in no impairment in fiscal year 2024.\nCertain assumptions used by us in our impairment assessment for the food safety reporting unit are sensitive in\nnature. For example, an adverse 50 basis point change in the revenue growth rate or discount rate would result in an\nestimated fair value of the reporting unit that no longer exceeds the carrying value. As a result, a goodwill\nimpairment charge would be recorded.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nSee discussion of any New Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 to consolidated financial statements.\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS\nWe have interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk exposure. Our primary interest rate risk is due to potential\nfluctuations of interest rates for our variable rate borrowings.\nForeign exchange risk exposure arises because we market and sell our products throughout the world. Revenues in\ncertain foreign countries as well as certain expenses related to those revenues are transacted in currencies other than\nthe U.S. dollar. As such, our operating results are exposed to changes in exchange rates. When the U.S. dollar\nweakens against foreign currencies, the dollar value of revenues denominated in foreign currencies increases. When\nthe U.S. dollar strengthens, the opposite situation occurs. Additionally, previously invoiced amounts can be\npositively or negatively affected by changes in exchange rates in the course of collection. We use derivative\nfinancial instruments to help manage the economic impact of fluctuations in certain currency exchange rates. These\ncontracts are adjusted to fair value through earnings.\nNeogen has assets, liabilities and operations outside of the U.S. Our investments in foreign subsidiaries are\nconsidered long-term. As discussed in ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, our financial condition and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected by currency fluctuations.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk. We use forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce the effect of\nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates on the remeasurement of foreign currency denominated receivables and\npayables.\nInterest Rate Risk. The Company utilizes an interest rate swap contract to create fixed interest payments on portions\nof its variable rate debt instrument in order to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. As of May 31, 2024\nand when including our interest rate swap, approximately 33.3% of our total debt was at variable interest rates.\n45\nThe following table sets forth the potential loss in future earnings or fair values, resulting from hypothetical changes\nin relevant market rates or prices:\nRisk Category Hypothetical Change May 31, 2024 Impact\n(dollars in thousands)\nForeign Currency — Revenue 10% depreciation in exchange rates relative to USD $ (45,898) Revenue\nForeign Currency — Hedges 10% depreciation in exchange rates relative to USD 5,076 Earnings\nInterest Income 75 basis point decrease in interest rates (728) Earnings\nInterest Expense 75 basis point increase in interest rates (2,250) Earnings\nThese estimates assume a parallel shift in all currency exchange rates and, as a result, may overstate the potential\nimpact to earnings because currency exchange rates do not typically move all in the same direction.\nIn addition to transactional exposures, our operating results are impacted by the translation of our foreign operating\nincome into U.S. dollars. In fiscal year 2024, international revenues accounted for 49.7% of our consolidated net\nrevenues.\nITEM 8.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND\nFINANCIAL DISCLOSURE—NONE\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAn evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the\nChief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our\ndisclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 (e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of\nMay 31, 2024. Disclosure controls and procedures refer to controls and other procedures designed to ensure that\ninformation required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the\n“Exchange Act”) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the rules and\nforms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation,\ncontrols and procedures designed to ensure the information required to be disclosed in the reports that are filed or\nsubmitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nBased on management’s evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, our Chief Executive Officer and\nChief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of May 31,\n2024, because of the material weaknesses described below.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as\nsuch term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13-a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is\ndesigned to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP and includes those policies and procedures\nthat: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions\nand the dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to\npermit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our\nreceipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our\nassets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\n46\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.\nProjections of any evaluation of effectiveness for future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become\ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\nUnder the supervision of and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and\nChief Financial Officer, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31,\n2024, using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission\n(COSO) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013). A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination\nof deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material\nmisstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nManagement’s assessment of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting identified the following\nmaterial weakness that existed as of May 31, 2023. As of May 31, 2024, management believes our remediation\nefforts have been effective with respect to this material weakness and that the associated control is now effective as\nof May 31, 2024:\n• A material weakness in internal control related to ineffective operation of management review controls\nrelated to the accounting, valuation and purchase price allocation of the Company’s acquisitions and\nassociated goodwill. Specifically, we did not maintain adequate documentation supporting the precision\nof the operating effectiveness of certain associated management review controls.\nManagement’s assessment of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting identified the following\nmaterial weaknesses that existed as of May 31, 2024. These material weaknesses also existed as of May 31, 2023.\n• We identified a material weakness in internal control related to ineffective information technology\ngeneral controls (ITGCs) in the areas of user access and change management over certain information\ntechnology (IT) systems that support the Company’s financial reporting processes. Specifically, we did\nnot design and maintain: (i) sufficient logical access controls to ensure appropriate segregation of duties\nand adequately restrict user and privileged access to financial applications, programs and data to\nappropriate Company personnel; (ii) program change management controls to ensure that information\ntechnology program and data changes affecting financial information technology applications and\nunderlying accounting records are identified, tested, authorized and implemented appropriately. As a\nresult, manual business process controls that are dependent on the affected ITGCs were also deemed\nineffective, because they could have been adversely impacted to the extent that they rely upon\ninformation and configurations from the affected IT systems.\n• We identified a material weakness in internal control related to ineffective period-end invoice accrual\ncontrols that are designed to ensure the completeness and accuracy of accrued expenses and accrued\ncapital assets.\nThese control deficiencies create a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement to the consolidated financial\nstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis, and therefore, we concluded that the deficiencies\nrepresent material weaknesses. As a result of these material weaknesses, management has concluded that our\ninternal control over financial reporting was not effective as of May 31, 2024.\nFollowing identification of these material weaknesses and prior to filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we\ncompleted additional procedures and concluded that our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-\nK have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and fairly present, in all material respects, the financial\ncondition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company as of, and for, the periods presented in this Form 10-\nK.\nThe Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, BDO USA, P.C., which has audited and reported on\nour consolidated financial statements, issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of May 31, 2024, which is included in this annual report below.\n47\nPlan of Remediation\nManagement has been implementing and continues to implement measures designed to ensure that control\ndeficiencies contributing to these material weaknesses are remediated, such that these controls are designed,\nimplemented, and operating effectively.\nWhen fully implemented and operational, we believe that these actions will remediate the underlying causes of the\nmaterial weaknesses and strengthen our internal control over financial reporting. The material weaknesses will not\nbe considered remediated, however, until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and\nmanagement has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively.\nAs we implement these remediation efforts, we may determine that additional steps may be necessary to remediate\nthe material weaknesses. We cannot provide assurance that these remediation efforts will be successful or that our\ninternal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time. We\nwill continue to assess the effectiveness of our remediation efforts in connection with our evaluations of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOther than the material weaknesses and related remediation efforts described above, no changes in our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting were identified as having occurred during the quarter ended May 31, 2024 that have\nmaterially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting.\n48\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nShareholders and Board of Directors\nNeogen Corporation\nLansing, Michigan\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Neogen Corporation’s (the “Company’s”) internal control over financial reporting as of May 31,\n2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the “COSO criteria”). In our opinion, the Company did not\nmaintain, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2024, based on the\nCOSO criteria. We do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on management’s statements referring\nto any corrective actions taken by the Company after the date of management’s assessment.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of May 31, 2024 and 2023, the related\nconsolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each\nof the three years in the period ended May 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as “the financial\nstatements”) and our report dated July 30, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and\nfor its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying\nItem 9A, Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting\nfirm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with\nU.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.\nThose standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective\ninternal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit\nalso included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that\nour audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,\nsuch that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial\nstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Material weaknesses were identified regarding\nmanagement’s failure to design and maintain controls (i) over information technology general controls in the areas\nof user access and change management over certain information technology systems that support the Company’s\nfinancial reporting processes and (ii) period-end invoice accrual controls as described in management’s assessment.\nThese material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in\nour audit of the 2024 financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated July 30, 2024 on those\nfinancial statements.\n49\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable\nassurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance\nwith generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made\nonly in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable\nassurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s\nassets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.\nAlso, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become\ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\n/s/ BDO USA, P.C.\nGrand Rapids, Michigan\nJuly 30, 2024\n50\nITEM 9B.

F-9\nF-1\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nShareholders and Board of Directors\nNeogen Corporation\nLansing, Michigan\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Neogen Corporation (the “Company”) as of May 31,\n2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, stockholders’ equity, and\ncash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the\n“consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material\nrespects, the financial position of the Company at May 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash\nflows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2024, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (“COSO”) and our report dated July 30, 2024 expressed an adverse opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to\nexpress an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting\nfirm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the\nU.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the\nPCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the consolidated financial statements.\nOur audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well\nas evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a\nreasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial\nstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts\nor disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,\nsubjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on\nthe consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below,\nproviding a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nGoodwill Impairment Assessment – Food Safety Reporting Unit\nAs described in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s goodwill balance was $2.135 billion\nat May 31, 2024, of which $2.054 billion is allocated to the Company’s Food Safety reporting unit and $0.081 billion to the\nAnimal Safety reporting unit. Management reviews the carrying amounts of goodwill annually at the reporting unit level, or\nwhen indications of impairment exist, to determine if goodwill may be impaired. Goodwill is tested for impairment\nannually in the fourth quarter of the Company’s fiscal year. The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units\nusing a combination of discounted cash flows and market-based approaches. As disclosed by management, the discounted\ncash flows approach is based on the reporting unit’s forecasted cash flows, including forecasted revenue growth rates and\ngross margins assumptions, that are discounted to present value using the reporting unit’s weighted average cost of capital\n(“WACC”) as the discount rate. The Company recognized no impairment during the year ended May 31, 2024.\nWe identified the Goodwill Impairment Assessment related to the Food Safety reporting unit as a critical audit matter.\nSpecifically, the determination of fair value of goodwill requires management to make assumptions used in the discounted\ncash flows approach including the assumptions of forecasted revenue growth rates, gross margins, and the discount rate.\nAuditing management’s assumptions used in calculation of the fair value of goodwill involved especially challenging and\nsubjective auditor judgment, including the extent of specialized knowledge or skill needed.\nF-2\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:\n• Evaluating the reasonableness of the forecasted revenue growth rates used by management by: (i) obtaining an\nunderstanding of the estimation process and data used by management, (ii) comparing the forecasted revenue growth rates\nto historical operating performance and (iii) evaluating the forecasted revenue growth rates for consistency with external\npeer company financial data and other industry information.\n• Evaluating the reasonableness of the gross margins by comparing to historical operating performance.\n• Utilizing personnel with specialized knowledge and skill in valuation to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of\nthe discount rate.\n/s/ BDO USA, P.C.\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2014.\nGrand Rapids, Michigan\nJuly 30, 2024\nF-3\nNeogen Corporation\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(in thousands, except shares)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nMay 31\n2024 2023\nAssets\nCurrent Assets\nCash and cash equivalents $ 170,611 $ 163,240\nMarketable securities, amortized cost of $325 and $83,549 325 82,329\nAccounts receivable, net 173,005 153,253\nInventory, net 189,267 133,812\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 56,025 53,297\nTotal Current Assets 589,233 585,931\nProperty and Equipment\nLand and improvements 10,497 10,209\nBuilding and improvements 108,298 96,794\nMachinery and equipment 176,369 152,547\nFurniture and fixtures 8,260 7,080\nConstruction in progress 113,968 52,237\n417,392 318,867\nLess accumulated depreciation (140,288) (120,118)\nProperty and Equipment, net 277,104 198,749\nOther Assets\nRight of use assets (note 4) 14,785 11,933\nGoodwill (note 5) 2,135,632 2,137,496\nOther non-amortizable intangible assets (note 5) — 14,316\nAmortizable intangible assets, net (note 5) 1,511,653 1,590,787\nOther non-current assets 20,426 15,220\nTotal Other Assets 3,682,496 3,769,752\nTotal Assets $ 4,548,833 $ 4,554,432\nLiabilities and Stockholders’ Equity\nCurrent Liabilities\nCurrent portion of finance lease $ 2,447 $ —\nAccounts payable 83,061 76,669\nAccrued compensation 19,949 25,153\nIncome tax payable (note 9) 10,449 6,951\nAccrued interest 10,985 11,149\nDeferred revenue 4,632 4,616\nOther current liabilities 22,800 20,934\nTotal Current Liabilities 154,323 145,472\nDeferred Income Tax Liability (note 9) 326,718 353,427\nNon-Current Debt (note 7) 888,391 885,439\nOther Non-Current Liabilities 35,259 35,877\nTotal Liabilities 1,404,691 1,420,215\nCommitments and Contingencies (note 10)\nStockholders’ Equity\nPreferred stock, $1.00 par value — shares authorized 100,000;

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nOrganization\nNeogen Corporation and subsidiaries (\"Neogen,\" \"we,\" \"our,\" or the \"Company\") develop, manufacture and market a\ndiverse line of products and services dedicated to food and animal safety. Our Food Safety segment consists primarily of\ndiagnostic test kits and complementary products (e.g., culture media) sold to food producers and processors to detect\ndangerous and/or unintended substances in human food and animal feed. Our Animal Safety segment is engaged in the\ndevelopment, manufacture, marketing and distribution of veterinary instruments, pharmaceuticals, vaccines, topicals,\nparasiticides, diagnostic products, rodent control products, cleaners, disinfectants, insect control products and genomics\ntesting services for the worldwide animal safety market.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Neogen Corporation and its subsidiaries, all of which are\nwholly-owned as of May 31, 2024.\nAll intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nShare and per share amounts reflect the June 4, 2021 2-for-1 stock split as if it took place at the beginning of the periods\npresented.\nFunctional Currency\nOur functional currency is the U.S. dollar. We translate our non-U.S. operations’ assets and liabilities denominated in\nforeign currencies into U.S. dollars at current rates of exchange as of the balance sheet date and income and expense items\nat the average exchange rate for the reporting period. Translation adjustments resulting from exchange rate fluctuations are\nrecorded in other comprehensive (loss) income. As of May 31, 2024 and 2023, the amounts recorded within accumulated\nother comprehensive loss were foreign currency translation adjustment losses of $31,885 and $30,285, respectively. Gains\nor losses from foreign currency transactions are included in other (expense) income on our consolidated statements of\noperations. During fiscal year 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company incurred $5,184, $5,322 and $40 of foreign currency\nlosses.\nF-9\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nSegment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment\nDisclosures, which modifies the disclosure and presentation requirements of reportable segments. The amendments in the\nupdate require the disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision\nmaker (CODM) and included within each reported measure of segment profit and loss. The amendments also require\ndisclosure of all other segment items by reportable segment and a description of its composition. Additionally, the\namendments require disclosure of the title and position of the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the\nreported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources.\nThis update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on the\npresentation of its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.\nIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures,\nwhich expands disclosures in an entity’s income tax rate reconciliation table and disclosures regarding cash taxes paid both\nin the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions. The update will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024.\nThe Company is currently evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on the presentation of its consolidated\nfinancial statements and accompanying notes.\nAccounting Policies\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents consist of bank demand accounts, savings deposits, certificates of deposit and commercial paper\nwith original maturities of 90 days or less. Cash and cash equivalents are maintained at financial institutions and, at times,\nbalances may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced losses related to these balances and\nbelieves it is not exposed to significant credit risk regarding its cash and cash equivalents. The carrying value of these assets\napproximates fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments and is classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.\nCash held by foreign subsidiaries was $68,276 and $36,288 at May 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nMarketable Securities\nThe Company has marketable securities held by banks or broker-dealers consisting of commercial paper and corporate\nbonds rated at least A-1/P-1 (short-term) and A/A2 (long-term) with original maturities between 91 days and two years.\nThese securities are classified as available for sale. Changes in fair value are monitored and recorded on a monthly basis\nand are recorded in other comprehensive (loss) income. In the event of a downgrade in credit quality subsequent to\npurchase, the marketable securities investment is evaluated to determine the appropriate action to take to minimize the\noverall risk to our marketable securities portfolio. If fair value is less than its amortized cost basis, then the Company\nevaluates whether the decline is the result of a credit loss, in which case an impairment is recorded through an allowance\nfor credit losses. As of May 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no recorded allowance for credit losses related to the marketable\nsecurities. This evaluation included a review of the credit quality of the issuers, the financial health of the underlying\nsecurities, and the economic environment. The unrealized losses on our marketable securities are primarily related to\nmarket fluctuations in the interest rates. As of May 31, 2023, the expected duration of all unrealized losses was less than 12\nmonths. Where there is an intention or a requirement to sell an impaired available-for-sale debt security, the entire\nimpairment is recognized in earnings with a corresponding adjustment to the amortized cost basis of the security. Short-\nterm investments are not entered into for trading or speculative purposes. These securities are recorded at fair value based\non recent trades or pricing models and therefore meet the Level 2 criteria. Interest income on these investments is recorded\nwithin other (expense) income on the consolidated statements of operations.\nF-10\nMarketable Securities as of May 31, 2024 and 2023 are listed below by classification and remaining maturities.\nYear Ended May 31,\nMaturity 2024 2023\nCommercial Paper & Corporate Bonds 0 - 90 days $ 325 $ 22,552\n91 -180 days — 35,692\n181 days -1 year — 23,768\n1 - 2 years — 317\nTotal Marketable Securities $ 325 $ 82,329\nThe components of marketable securities as of May 31, 2024 are as follows:\nAmortized Unrealized Unrealized\nCost Gains Losses Fair Value\nCommercial Paper & Corporate Bonds $ 325 $ — $ — $ 325\nThe components of marketable securities as of May 31, 2023 are as follows:\nAmortized Unrealized Unrealized\nCost Gains Losses Fair Value\nCommercial Paper & Corporate Bonds $ 83,549 $ — $ (1,220) $ 82,329\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the risk that its financial condition, results of operations and cash\nflows could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. To reduce\nthe potential effects of foreign currency exchange rate movements on net earnings, the Company enters into derivative\nfinancial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange forward contracts with a major financial institution and has\nalso entered into interest rate swap contracts as a hedge against increases in interest rates. Management settles its foreign\ncurrency forward contracts monthly with its one counterparty. There are no collateral or margin requirements as part of\nthese forward contracts. The Company has established policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval,\nreporting and monitoring of derivative financial instrument activities. For the Company's interest rate swap derivative, the\nCompany designated it as a cash flow hedge in accordance with its established policy. Each reporting period, derivatives\nare recorded at fair value in other current assets, other assets, accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities. The change\nin fair value is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, and amounts are reclassified into interest\nexpense on the consolidated statements of operations when transactions are realized. Derivatives that are not designated as\nhedges are adjusted to fair value with a corresponding adjustment to other (expense) income. The Company does not enter\ninto derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and\njudgments that affect amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements. Considerable judgment is often involved in\nmaking such estimates, and the use of different assumptions could result in different conclusions. The most significant\nestimates include our evaluation of goodwill impairment, deferred taxes, intangible assets acquired, and fair value\nmeasurements. Management believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate. However, actual results\ncould differ from those estimates.\nAccounts Receivable and Concentrations of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments which potentially subject Neogen to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of accounts\nreceivable. Management attempts to minimize credit risk by reviewing customers’ credit histories before extending credit\nand by monitoring credit exposure on a regular basis. Collateral or other security is generally not required for accounts\nreceivable. As of May 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, accounts receivable, net was $173,005, $153,253 and $99,674,\nrespectively, on the consolidated balance sheets. We maintain an allowance for customer accounts that reduces receivables\nto amounts that are expected to be collected. In estimating the allowance for credit losses, management considers relevant\ninformation about past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of\nfinancial assets. Once a receivable balance has been determined to be uncollectible, generally after all collection efforts\nhave been exhausted, that amount is charged against the allowance for credit losses. The provision is recorded within\nF-11\noperating expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. No customer accounted for more than 10% of accounts\nreceivable as of May 31, 2024 or 2023, respectively. The activity in the allowance for credit losses was as follows:\nYear Ended May 31,\n2024 2023 2022\nBeginning Balance $ 2,827 $ 1,650 $ 1,400\nProvision 1,720 1,460 332\nRecoveries (191) 46 98\nWrite-offs (216) (329) (180)\nEnding Balance $ 4,140 $ 2,827 $ 1,650\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, determined on the first-in, first-out method. The\ncomponents of inventories were as follows:\nYear Ended May 31,\n2024 2023\nRaw Materials $ 78,799 $ 66,617\nWork-in-process 10,990 5,366\nFinished goods 111,839 68,099\nInventory reserve (12,361) (6,270)\nInventory, net $ 189,267 $ 133,812\nThe Company’s inventories are analyzed for slow moving, expired and obsolete items on a quarterly basis and the\ninventory reserve is adjusted as required within cost of revenues.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost. Expenditures for major improvements are capitalized while repairs and\nmaintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation is provided on the straight line method over the estimated\nuseful lives of the respective assets, which are generally seven to 39 years for buildings and improvements, and three to 10\nyears for furniture, fixtures, computers and machinery and equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the\nexpected life of the asset or term of the lease, whichever is shorter. Depreciation expense was $21,771, $17,292 and\n$14,094 in fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nDuring the quarter ended May 31, 2024, the Company reclassified $13,684 of capitalized cloud computing software costs\nfrom property and equipment. $13,140 of this total was reclassified to prepaid expenses and other current assets, with the\nremaining $544 recognized as incremental amortization within general and administrative expense in the consolidated\nstatements of operations.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of tangible net assets of acquired businesses after amounts\nare allocated to other identifiable intangible assets. The Company's business is organized into two operating segments:\nFood Safety and Animal Safety. Under the goodwill guidance, management determined that each of its segments represents\na reporting unit. Other intangible assets include customer relationships, trademarks, licenses, trade names, developed\ntechnology, covenants not-to-compete and patents. Customer relationships intangibles are amortized on either an\naccelerated or straight line basis, reflecting the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed, while all other\namortizable intangibles are amortized on a straight line basis. Intangibles are amortized over 2 to 25 years.\nManagement reviews the carrying amounts of goodwill annually at the reporting unit level, or when indications of\nimpairment exist, to determine if goodwill may be impaired. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles are tested for\nimpairment annually in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. During management's annual test or when there are indicators\nof impairment, if the carrying amounts of these assets are deemed to be less than fair value based upon a discounted cash\nflow analysis and comparison to comparable EBITDA multiples of peer companies, such assets are reduced to their\nestimated fair value and a charge is recorded to operations.\nF-12\nAmortizable other intangible assets are tested for impairment when indications of impairment exist. If the carrying amounts\nof these assets are deemed to be less than fair value based upon a discounted cash flow analysis, such assets are reduced to\ntheir estimated fair value and a charge is recorded to operations.\nLong-lived Assets\nManagement reviews the carrying values of its long-lived assets to be held and used, including definite-lived intangible\nassets, for possible impairment whenever events or changes in business conditions warrant such a review. The carrying\nvalue of a long-lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated separately identifiable undiscounted cash flows over\nthe remaining useful life of the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset. In such an event, fair value is determined\nusing undiscounted cash flows, and if lower than the carrying value, impairment is recognized through a charge to\noperations.\nEquity Compensation Plans\nAt May 31, 2024, the Company had stock award plans which are described more fully in Note 8 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nWe measure stock-based compensation at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and recognize the\ncost as compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period and reverse compensation expense\ndue to forfeitures as they occur. Our stock-based compensation expense is reflected in general and administrative expense\nin our consolidated statements of operations.\nResearch and Development Costs\nResearch and development costs, which consist primarily of compensation costs, administrative expenses and new product\ndevelopment, among other items, are expensed as incurred.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed within sales and marketing as incurred and totaled $3,301, $2,548 and $2,018 in fiscal years\n2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nLeases\nThe Company recognizes, in the consolidated balance sheets, a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a\nright-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. We recognized all leases with terms\ngreater than 12 months in duration on our consolidated balance sheets as right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Right-of-\nuse assets are recorded in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. Current and non-current lease liabilities are\nrecorded in other accruals within current liabilities and other non-current liabilities, respectively, on our consolidated\nbalance sheets.\nWe evaluate our contracts to determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception and classify it as a finance or operating\nlease. Leased assets and corresponding liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the lease payments over the\nlease term. Our lease terms may include options to extend when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.\nWe have made certain assumptions and judgments when accounting for leases, the most significant of which are:\n• We did not elect to use hindsight when considering judgments and estimates such as assessments of lessee\noptions to extend or terminate a lease or purchase the underlying asset.\n• For all asset classes, we elected to not recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability for short-term leases (i.e.\nleases with a term of 12 months or less).\n• For all asset classes, we elected to not separate non-lease components from lease components to which they\nrelate and have accounted for the combined lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.\n• The determination of the discount rate used in a lease is our incremental borrowing rate that is based on our\nestimate of what we would normally pay to borrow on a fully collateralized and amortized basis over a similar\nterm an amount equal to the lease payments.\nF-13\nRevenue Recognition\nWe determine the amount of revenue to be recognized through application of the following steps:\n• Identification of the contract with a customer;\n• Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n• Determination of the transaction price;\n• Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n• Recognition of revenue when or as the Company satisfies the performance obligations.\nNeogen’s revenue is generated through contracts with its customers. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to\ntransfer a product or service to a customer. We generally recognize revenue at a point in time when all of our performance\nobligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied. Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products\nor services in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. The\ncollectability of consideration on the contract is reasonably assured before revenue is recognized. To the extent that\ncustomer payment has been received before all recognition criteria are met, these revenues are initially deferred in current\nliabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and the revenue is recognized in the period that all recognition criteria have\nbeen met.\nCertain agreements with customers include discounts or rebates on the sale of products and services applied retrospectively,\nsuch as volume rebates achieved by purchasing a specified threshold of goods and services. We account for these discounts\nas variable consideration and estimate the likelihood of a customer meeting the threshold in order to determine the\ntransaction price using the most predictive approach. We typically use the most-likely-amount method, for incentives that\nare offered to individual customers, and the expected-value method, for programs that are offered to a broad group of\ncustomers. Variable consideration reduces the amount of revenue that is recognized. Rebate obligations related to customer\nincentive programs are recorded in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The rebate estimates are\nadjusted at the end of each applicable measurement period based on information currently available.\nThe performance obligations in Neogen’s contracts are generally satisfied well within one year of contract inception. In\nsuch cases, management has elected the practical expedient to not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the\neffects of a significant financing component. Management has elected to utilize the practical expedient to recognize the\nincremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when incurred because the amortization period for the prepaid costs\nthat would otherwise have been deferred and amortized is one year or less. We account for shipping and handling for\nproducts as a fulfillment activity when goods are shipped. Shipping and handling costs that are charged to and reimbursed\nby the customer are recognized as revenues, while the related expenses incurred by Neogen are recorded in sales and\nmarketing expense. These expenses totaled $25,290, $18,513, and $17,482 in fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. Revenue is recognized net of any tax collected from customers. The taxes are subsequently remitted to\ngovernmental authorities. Our terms and conditions of sale generally do not provide for returns of product or reperformance\nof service except in the case of quality or warranty issues. While these situations are infrequent, due to immateriality of the\namount, warranty claims are recorded in the period incurred.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company utilizes the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. This method requires, among other\nthings, that results of operations of acquired companies are included in the Company's results of operations beginning on\nthe respective acquisition dates and that assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at fair value as of the\nacquisition date. Valuation specialists are used to develop and evaluate the appropriateness of the fair value estimates, often\nutilizing cash flow projections and other related valuation techniques. The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed in certain cases may be subject to revision based on the final determination of fair value during a period of time\nnot to exceed 12 months from the acquisition date. Legal costs, due diligence costs, business valuation costs and all other\nbusiness acquisition costs are expensed when incurred.\nLoss Contingencies\nVarious legal actions, proceedings, and claims (generally, “matters”) are pending or may be instituted or asserted against\nthe Company. The Company accrues for matters when losses are deemed probable and reasonably estimable. However, the\nultimate resolutions of these matters are inherently unpredictable and could require payment substantially in excess of the\namounts that have been accrued or disclosed. Any resulting adjustments, which could be material, are recorded in the\nperiod the adjustments are identified.\nF-14\n2. Revenue Recognition\nThe Company derives revenue from two primary sources — product revenue and service revenue.\nProduct revenue consists primarily of shipments of:\n• Diagnostic test kits, culture media and related products used by food producers and processors to detect\nharmful natural toxins, foodborne bacteria, allergens and levels of general sanitation;\n• Consumable products marketed to veterinarians, retailers, livestock producers and animal health product\ndistributors; and\n• Rodent control products, disinfectants and insect control products to assist in the control of rodents, insects and\ndisease in and around agricultural, food production and other facilities.\nRevenues for Neogen’s products are recognized and invoiced when the product is shipped to the customer.\nService revenue consists primarily of:\n• Genomic identification and related interpretive bioinformatic services; and\n• Other commercial laboratory services.\nRevenues for Neogen’s genomics and commercial laboratory services are recognized and invoiced when the applicable\nlaboratory service is performed and the results are conveyed to the customer.\nPayment terms for products and services are generally 30 to 60 days.\nContract liabilities represent deposits made by customers before the satisfaction of performance obligation(s) and\nrecognition of revenue. Upon completion of the performance obligation(s) that the Company has with the customer, the\nliability for the customer deposit is relieved and revenue is recognized. These customer deposits are listed as Deferred\nrevenue on the consolidated balance sheets. As of May 31, 2022, deferred revenue was $5,460 within the consolidated\nbalance sheets. During fiscal year 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded additions of $13,267 and $11,046 to deferred\nrevenue, respectively. During fiscal year 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized $13,251 and $11,890, respectively, of\ndeferred revenue amounts into revenue. Changes in the balances relate primarily to sales of the Company's genomics\nservices.\nOn September 1, 2022, Neogen closed on a Reverse Morris Trust transaction to combine with 3M’s Food Safety business.\nSimilar to Neogen, 3M’s former Food Safety business sells diagnostic test kits, dehydrated culture media and related\nproducts used by food producers and processors to detect foodborne bacteria, allergens and levels of general sanitation.\nRevenues for these products are recognized and invoiced when the product is shipped to the customer. These products were\nmanufactured, invoiced and distributed by 3M on behalf of, and as directed by, Neogen to its customers under a number of\ntransition service contracts. The Company has completed the exit of distribution and back office-related service contracts\nand currently only has a contract manufacturing agreement in place with 3M for certain products.\nF-15\nThe following table presents disaggregated revenue by major product and service categories for the years ended May 31,\n2024, 2023 and 2022:\nYear Ended May 31,\n2024 2023 2022\nFood Safety:\nNatural Toxins & Allergens $ 82,240 $ 82,567 $ 79,395\nBacterial & General Sanitation 171,217 134,934 47,282\nIndicator Testing, Culture Media & Other 334,636 267,178 75,278\nRodent Control, Insect Control & Disinfectants 42,965 39,655 35,691\nGenomics Services 24,283 22,463 22,333\n$ 655,341 $ 546,797 $ 259,979\nAnimal Safety:\nLife Sciences 6,515 6,254 5,685\nVeterinary Instruments & Disposables 65,848 63,843 63,938\nAnimal Care & Other 36,978 39,068 39,805\nRodent Control, Insect Control & Disinfectants 88,732 87,423 83,610\nGenomics Services 70,808 79,062 74,142\n$ 268,881 $ 275,650 $ 267,180\nTotal Revenue $ 924,222 $ 822,447 $ 527,159\n3. Net (Loss) Income Per Share\nBasic net (loss) income per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each year.\nDiluted (loss) earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive potential\ncommon shares outstanding. Our dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the years result from dilutive stock\noptions and restricted stock units (\"RSUs\"). The following table presents the net (loss) income per share calculations:\nYear Ended May 31,\n2024 2023 2022\nNumerator for basic and diluted net (loss) income per share — Net\n(Loss) Income $ (9,421) $ (22,870) $ 48,307\nDenominator for basic net (loss) income per share — Weighted\naverage shares 216,481,878 188,880,836 107,684,000\nEffect of dilutive stock options and restricted stock units - - 336,000\nDenominator for diluted net (loss) income per share 216,481,878 188,880,836 108,020,000\nNet (loss) income attributable per share\nBasic $ (0.04) $ (0.12) $ 0.45\nDiluted $ (0.04) $ (0.12) $ 0.45\nDue to the net loss in fiscal 2024 and 2023, the stock options and RSUs are anti-dilutive. At May 31, 2024 and May 31,\n2023, approximately 332,025 and 147,671 shares, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted net (loss)\nincome per share, because the inclusion of such securities in the calculation would have been anti-dilutive.\n4. Leases\nWe lease various manufacturing, laboratory, warehousing and distribution facilities, administrative and sales offices,\nequipment and vehicles under operating and finance leases.\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to operating and finance leases was as follows:\nYear Ended May 31,\n2024 2023\nRights of use - non-current assets $ 14,785 $ 11,933\nLease liabilities - other current liabilities $ 5,101 $ 3,277\nLease liabilities - non-current liabilities $ 10,300 $ 8,812\nProperty and equipment $ 2,423 —\nCurrent portion of finance lease $ 2,447 —\nF-16\nThe weighted average remaining lease term and weighted average discount rate were as follows:\nYear Ended May 31,\n2024 2023\nOperating Leases\nWeighted average remaining lease term 3.9 years 4.7 years\nWeighted average discount rate 5.6% 4.7%\nFinancing Lease\nWeighted average remaining lease term 0.3 years —\nWeighted average discount rate 6.1% —\nOperating lease expenses are classified as cost of revenues or operating expenses on the consolidated statements of\noperations.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill\nManagement completed the annual impairment analysis of goodwill using a third-party quantitative and qualitative\nassessment as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024. The Animal Safety reporting unit was tested by\nutilizing a qualitative assessment. The fair value of the Food Safety reporting unit was determined and compared to the\ncarrying value. The inputs to the fair value are defined in the fair value hierarchy as Level 3 inputs. If the carrying value\nhad exceeded the fair value, an impairment charge would have been recorded based on that difference. The annual\nimpairment analysis resulted in no impairment for 2024 and 2023.\nUnder the quantitative approach, fair value of the reporting unit is estimated based on a combination of an income-based\napproach consisting of a discounted cash flows analysis and the use of a market-based approach consisting of pricing\nmultiples derived from an analysis of comparable public companies multiplied against historical and/or anticipated\nfinancial metrics of the reporting unit. Management develops its discounted cash flows analysis based on information\navailable as of the date of our assessment, using assumptions such as forecasted revenue growth rates and gross margin\nassumptions that are discounted to present value. Management typically assigns more weight to the income-based valuation\nmethod. Management also evaluates the fair value estimates of the reporting units in the context of the Company’s total\nenterprise market value.\nThe following table summarizes goodwill by reportable segment:\nFood Safety Animal Safety Total\nBalance, May 31, 2022 $ 67,558 $ 75,146 $ 142,704\nAcquisitions 1,985,476 6,783 1,992,259\nForeign currency translation and other 3,127 (594) 2,533\nBalance, May 31, 2023 $ 2,056,161 $ 81,335 $ 2,137,496\nAcquisitions 250 — 250\nForeign currency translation and other (2,206) 92 (2,114)\nBalance, May 31, 2024 $ 2,054,205 $ 81,427 $ 2,135,632\nIntangible Assets\nDefinite-lived intangible assets consisted of the following and are included in amortizable intangible assets within the\nconsolidated balance sheets:\nGross Less Net\nCarrying Accumulated Carrying\nAmount Amortization Amount\nLicenses $ 14,407 $ 7,214 $ 7,193\nCovenants not to compete 487 425 62\nPatents 7,692 3,770 3,922\nCustomer relationships intangibles 1,244,790 140,963 1,103,827\nTrade names and trademarks 124,328 11,407 112,921\nDeveloped technology 307,560 41,150 266,410\nOther product and service-related intangibles 23,947 6,629 17,318\nBalance, May 31, 2024 $1,723,211 $ 211,558 $1,511,653\nLicenses $ 16,010 $ 6,763 $ 9,247\nCovenants not to compete 488 384 104\nPatents 8,499 4,865 3,634\nCustomer relationships intangibles 1,244,635 81,577 1,163,058\nTrade names and trademarks 111,172 3,583 107,589\nDeveloped technology 309,609 20,175 289,434\nOther product and service-related intangibles 23,628 5,907 17,721\nBalance, May 31, 2023 $1,714,041 $ 123,254 $1,590,787\nF-18\nAmortization expense for intangibles totaled $94,946, $71,085, and $9,600 in fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022,\nrespectively. During fiscal year 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded an impairment of $556 and $2,109, respectively, to\nits amortizable licenses related to discontinued product lines.\nEstimated approximate amortization expense for the next five fiscal years and thereafter is as follows: 2025—$96,000,\n2026—$96,000, 2027—$95,000, 2028—$95,000, 2029—$91,000 and thereafter—$1,039,000.\nIf actual market conditions or the Company’s performance are less favorable than those projected by management, or if\nevents occur or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of the Company’s goodwill or intangible assets\nbelow the amount reflected in the balance sheet, the Company may be required to conduct an interim test and possibly\nrecognize impairment charges on its goodwill or intangible assets, which could be material, in future periods.\nThe amortizable intangible assets' useful lives are as follows:\nUseful Lives Range\nLicenses 2 - 20 years\nCovenants not to compete 3 - 10 years\nPatents 5 - 25 years\nCustomer relationships intangibles 9 - 20 years\nTrade names and trademarks 10 - 25 years\nDeveloped technology 10 - 20 years\nOther product and service-related intangibles 5 - 15 years\nAll definite-lived intangibles are amortized on a straight line basis with the exception of definite-lived customer\nrelationships intangibles and product and service-related intangibles, which are amortized on either a straight line or an\naccelerated basis.\nAs of May 31, 2023, non-amortizable intangible assets included licenses of $569, trademarks of $12,522 and other\nintangibles of $1,224. During fiscal year 2023, the Company recorded an impairment of $1,000 to its non-amortizable\ntrademarks related to discontinued product lines. This impairment was recorded in the Company's Food Safety segment\nwithin operating expenses.\nManagement completed the annual impairment analysis of intangible assets with indefinite lives using a qualitative\nassessment for fiscal year 2023. Other than the impairment in fiscal year 2023 related to the discrete trademarks discussed\nabove, management determined that other recorded amounts were not impaired and that no additional impairment charges\nwere necessary. In fiscal year 2024, the non-amortizable intangible assets were reclassified to definite-lived intangible\nassets. In conjunction with the reclassification, management completed an impairment analysis of the intangible assets\nusing a qualitative assessment and determined that recorded amounts were not impaired.\n6. Business Combinations\nThe consolidated statements of operations reflect the results of operations for business acquisitions since the respective\ndates of purchase. All are accounted for using the acquisition method. Goodwill recognized in the acquisitions described\nbelow relates primarily to enhancing the Company’s strategic platform for the expansion of available product offerings.\nFiscal 2022\nCAPInnoVet, Inc.\nIn September 2021, the Company acquired all of the stock of CAPInnoVet, Inc., a companion animal health business that\nprovides pet medications to the veterinary market. This acquisition provided entry into the retail parasiticide market and\nenhanced the Company’s presence in companion animal markets. Consideration for the purchase was net cash of $17,900\npaid at closing. There also is the potential for performance milestone payments to the former owners of up to $6,500 and\nthe Company could incur up to $14,500 in future royalty payments. The final purchase allocation, based upon the fair value\nof these assets and liabilities determined using the income approach, included accounts receivable of $308, inventory of\n$531, prepayments of $296, accounts payable of $120, other current liabilities of $84, non-current liabilities of $6,500,\nintangible assets of $19,200 and the remainder to goodwill (deductible for tax purposes). Upon revaluation of the\ncontingent liability throughout fiscal year 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized a loss of $300 and a gain of $300,\nrespectively, on the performance milestone liability, recorded within other expense. The business is operated from our\nlocation in Lexington, KY, reporting within the Animal Safety segment.\nF-19\nDelf Ltd.\nIn November 2021, the Company acquired all of the stock of Delf (U.K.) Ltd., a United Kingdom-based manufacturer and\nsupplier of animal hygiene and industrial cleaning products, and Abbott Analytical Ltd., a related service provider.\nConsideration for the purchase was net cash of $9,500 paid at closing. The final purchase price allocation, based upon the\nfair value of these assets and liabilities determined using the income approach, included accounts receivable of $1,059,\ninventory of $972, net property, plant and equipment of $152, prepayments of $31, accounts payable of $497, other current\nliabilities of $378, non-current deferred tax liabilities of $780, intangible assets of $3,100 and the remainder to goodwill\n(non-deductible for tax purposes). The companies continue to operate from their current location in Liverpool, England,\nreporting within the Food Safety segment and are managed through Neogen’s Scotland operation.\nGenetic Veterinary Sciences, Inc.\nIn December 2021, the Company acquired all of the stock of Genetic Veterinary Sciences, Inc., a companion animal genetic\ntesting business providing genetic information for dogs, cats and birds to animal owners, breeders and veterinarians. This\nacquisition further expanded the Company’s presence in the companion animal market. Consideration for the purchase was\n$11,300 in net cash. The final purchase price allocation, based upon the fair value of these assets and liabilities determined\nusing the income approach, included accounts receivable of $38, net inventory of $292, net property, plant and equipment\nof $399, prepayments of $54, accounts payable of $325, unearned revenue of $1,900, other current liabilities of $321,\nintangible assets of $5,500 and the remainder to goodwill (deductible for tax purposes). The business is operated from the\nCompany's location in Lincoln, Nebraska, reporting within the Animal Safety segment. Since completion of initial\nestimates in the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, the Company has recorded insignificant measurement period\nadjustments, which resulted in a decrease to the base purchase price.\nFiscal 2023\nThai-Neo Biotech Co., Ltd. Acquisition\nOn July 1, 2022, the Company acquired all of the stock of Thai-Neo Biotech Co., Ltd., a longstanding distributor of\nNeogen’s food safety products to Thailand and Southeast Asia. This acquisition gives Neogen a direct sales presence in\nThailand. Consideration for the purchase was $1,581 in net cash, with $1,310 paid at closing, $37 paid on November 29,\n2022 as a working capital adjustment and $234 paid on October 1, 2023. The final purchase price allocation, based upon the\nfair value of these assets and liabilities determined using the income approach, included intangible assets of $620 (with an\nestimated life of 10 years). The business continues to operate in Bangkok, Thailand, reporting within the Food Safety\nsegment.\nCorvium Acquisition\nOn February 10, 2023, the Company acquired certain assets as part of an asset purchase agreement with Corvium, Inc., a\npartner and supplier within the Company's software analytics platform. This acquisition, which primarily includes the\nsoftware technology, advances the Company's food safety data analytics strategy. The purchase price consideration was\n$24,067, which included $9,004 held in escrow. In the first quarter of fiscal 2024, $8,000 of the escrow balance was\nreleased to Corvium, Inc. In the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the remaining escrow balance was released to Corvium, Inc.\nThis transaction is a business combination and was accounted for using the acquisition method.\nThere also is the potential for performance milestone payments of up to $8,500 based on successful implementation of the\nsoftware service at customer sites and sale of licenses. As a result, the Company has recorded contingent liabilities of $930\nas part of the opening balance sheet within other non-current liabilities, as shown below. In fiscal year 2024, the first\nmilestone period occurred, resulting in no performance milestone payment.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company recorded an increase to intangible assets of $100, based on finalization of a\nthird-party advisor's valuation work and fair value estimates. Goodwill, which is fully deductible for tax purposes, includes\nvalue associated with profits earned from data management solutions that can be offered to existing customers and the\nexpertise and reputation of the assembled workforce. These values are Level 3 fair value measurements.\nThe final purchase price allocation, based upon the fair value of these assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which was\ndetermined using the income approach, is summarized in the following table:\nF-20\nPrepaids and other current assets $ 66\nProperty, plant and equipment 13\nIntangible assets 10,280\nDeferred revenue (1,827)\nAdjustment of annual license prepaid (419)\nOther non-current liabilities (930)\nTotal identifiable assets and liabilities acquired 7,183\nGoodwill 16,884\nTotal purchase consideration $ 24,067\nFor each completed acquisition listed above, the revenues and net income were not considered material and were therefore\nnot disclosed.\nF-21\n3M Food Safety Transaction\nOn September 1, 2022, Neogen, 3M and Neogen Food Safety Corporation, formerly named Garden SpinCo, a subsidiary\ncreated to carve out 3M’s FSD, closed on a transaction combining 3M’s FSD with Neogen in a Reverse Morris Trust\ntransaction and Neogen Food Safety Corporation became a wholly owned subsidiary of Neogen (“FSD transaction”).\nImmediately following the FSD transaction, pre-merger Neogen Food Safety Corporation stockholders owned, in the\naggregate, approximately 50.1% of the issued and outstanding shares of Neogen common stock and pre-merger Neogen\nshareholders owned, in the aggregate, approximately 49.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of Neogen common stock.\nThis transaction is a business combination and was accounted for using the acquisition method.\nThe acquired business is a leading provider of food safety testing solutions. It offers a broad range of food safety testing\nproducts that support multiple industries within food and beverage, helping producers to prevent and protect consumers\nfrom foodborne illnesses.\nThe purchase price consideration for the 3M FSD was $3.2 billion, net of customary purchase price adjustments and\ntransaction costs, which consisted of 108,269,946 shares of Neogen common stock issued on closing with a fair value of\n$2.2 billion and non-cash consideration of $1 billion, funded by the additional financing obtained by Garden SpinCo and\nassumed by the Company as part of the transaction. See Note 7. \"Long-Term Debt\" for further detail on the debt incurred.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company recorded adjustments to goodwill and intangible assets, based on third-party\nadvisor's valuation work and fair value estimates, resulting in an increase to goodwill and a decrease to the intangible assets\nbalance. The Company also recorded adjustments to deferred tax liabilities, which increased the balance, based on\nfinalization of entity income tax provisions. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible assets\nand identifiable intangible assets of $1.97 billion was recorded as goodwill, of which $1.92 billion is not deductible for tax\npurposes. Goodwill includes value associated with profits earned from market and expansion capabilities, expected\nsynergies from integration and streamlining operational activities, the expertise and reputation of the assembled workforce\nand other intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. These values are Level 3 fair value measurements.\nThe final purchase price allocation, based upon the fair value of these assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which was\ndetermined using the income approach, is summarized in the following table:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 319\nInventories 18,403\nOther current assets 14,855\nProperty, plant and equipment 25,832\nIntangible assets 1,559,805\nRight of use asset 882\nLease liability (885)\nDeferred tax liabilities (352,636)\nOther liabilities (2,832)\nTotal identifiable assets and liabilities acquired 1,263,743\nGoodwill 1,974,870\nTotal purchase consideration $ 3,238,613\nThe following table summarizes the intangible assets acquired and the useful life of these assets.\nFair Value Useful Life in Years\nTrade Names and Trademarks $ 108,434 25\nDeveloped Technology 277,650 15\nCustomer Relationships 1,173,721 20\nTotal intangible assets acquired $ 1,559,805\nF-22\nThe Company determined the fair value of the acquired customer relationships intangible assets by applying the multi-\nperiod excess earnings method, which involved the use of significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasted\nrevenue growth rate and customer attrition rate. Valuation specialists were used to develop and evaluate the appropriateness\nof the multi-period excess earnings method, the Company's discount rates, attrition rate and fair value estimates using its\ncash flow projections.\nThe following table presents unaudited pro forma information as if the merger with the 3M FSD business had occurred on\nJune 1, 2021 and had been combined with the results reported in our consolidated statements of operations for all periods\npresented:\nYear Ended May 31,\n2023 2022\nNet revenue $ 919,959 $ 910,978\nOperating income $ 44,373 $ 42,258\nThe unaudited pro forma information is presented for informational purposes only and is not indicative of the results that\nwould have been achieved if the merger had taken place at such time. The unaudited pro forma information presented\nabove includes adjustments primarily for amortization charges for acquired intangible assets and certain acquisition-related\nexpenses for legal and professional fees.\nIn connection with the acquisition of the 3M FSD, the Company and 3M entered into several transition service agreements,\nincluding manufacturing, distribution and certain back-office support, that have been accounted for separately from the\nacquisition of assets and assumption of liabilities in the business combination. The Company has completed the exit of\ndistribution and back office-related service contracts and currently only has a contract manufacturing agreement in place for\nPetrifilm® products; the initial term of which expires in September 2026.\n7. Long-Term Debt\nThe Company’s long-term debt consists of the following:\nMay 31, 2024 May 31, 2023\nTerm Loan $ 550,000 $ 550,000\nSenior Notes 350,000 350,000\nFinance Lease 2,447 —\nTotal debt and finance lease 902,447 900,000\nLess: Current portion (2,447) —\nTotal non-current debt 900,000 900,000\nLess: Unamortized debt issuance costs (11,609) (14,561)\nTotal non-current debt, net $ 888,391 $ 885,439\nThe Company had a financing agreement with a bank providing for a $15,000 unsecured revolving line of credit, which\noriginally expired on November 30, 2023, but was replaced by the five-year senior secured revolving facility as part of the\nCredit Facilities described below. There were no advances against the line of credit during fiscal 2023 before the line of\ncredit was extinguished. Interest on any borrowings under that agreement was at LIBOR plus 100 basis points. Financial\ncovenants included maintaining specified levels of tangible net worth, debt service coverage, and funded debt to EBITDA,\neach of which the Company was in compliance with during the period the line of credit was available.\nCredit Facilities\nOn June 30, 2022, Neogen Food Safety Corporation entered into a credit agreement consisting of a five-year senior secured\nterm loan facility (“term loan facility”) in the amount of $650,000 and a five-year senior secured revolving facility\n(“revolving facility”) in the amount of $150,000 (collectively, the “Credit Facilities”) to fund the FSD transaction. The term\nloan facility was drawn on August 31, 2022, to fund the closing of the FSD transaction on September 1, 2022 while the\nrevolving facility was undrawn and continues to be undrawn as of May 31, 2024.\nThe Credit Facilities bear interest based on term SOFR plus an applicable margin which ranges between 150 to 225 basis\npoints, determined for each interest period and paid monthly. During the twelve months ended May 31, 2024, the interest\nrates ranged from 7.42% to 7.68% per annum. The term loan facility matures on June 30, 2027 and the revolving facility\nF-23\nmatures at the earlier of June 30, 2027 or the termination of the revolving commitments. In accordance with the prepayment\nfeature, the Company paid $100,000 of the term loan facility’s principal in fiscal year 2023.\nThe term loan facility contains an optional prepayment feature at the discretion of the Company. The Company determined\nthat the prepayment feature did not meet the definition of an embedded derivative and does not require bifurcation from the\nhost liability and, accordingly, has accounted for the entire instrument at amortized cost.\nThe Company has a $150,000 revolving credit facility with any amount outstanding to be repaid on or before the\ntermination date of the revolving commitments. In fiscal year 2023, debt issuance costs of $2,361 were incurred related to\nthe revolving facility. These costs are being amortized as interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations over\nthe contractual life of the revolving facility using the straight line method. Amortization of the deferred debt issuance costs\nfor the revolving facility was $489 and $366 during the twelve months ended May 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of\nMay 31, 2024 and May 31, 2023, the Company had $1,506 and $1,995, respectively, of unamortized debt issuance costs.\nThe Company must pay an annual commitment fee ranging from 0.20% and 0.35% on the unused portion of the revolving\nfacility, paid quarterly. As of May 31, 2024, the commitment fee was 0.35%. During the twelve months ended May 31,\n2024 and 2023, $501 and $473 was recorded as interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\nThere was no accrued interest payable on the term loan as of May 31, 2024. In fiscal year 2023, the Company incurred\n$10,232 in total debt issuance costs on the term loan which is recorded as an offset to the term loan facility and amortized\nover the contractual life of the loan to interest expense using the straight line method. The amortization of deferred debt\nissuance costs of $2,117 and interest expense of $42,152 (excluding swap credit of $3,002) for the term loan was included\nin the consolidated statements of operations during the twelve months ended May 31, 2024. The amortization of deferred\ndebt issuance costs of $1,588 and interest expense of $27,254 (excluding swap credit of $577) for the term loan was\nincluded in the consolidated statements of operations during the twelve months ended May 31, 2023. As of May 31, 2024\nand May 31, 2023, the Company had $6,527 and $8,644, respectively, of unamortized debt issuance costs.\nFinancial covenants include maintaining specified levels of funded debt to EBITDA, and debt service coverage. As of May\n31, 2024, the Company was in compliance with its debt covenants.\nSenior Notes\nOn July 20, 2022, Neogen Food Safety Corporation closed on an offering of $350,000 aggregate principal amount of\n8.625% senior notes due 2030 (the “Notes”) in a private placement at par. The Notes were initially issued by Neogen Food\nSafety Corporation to 3M and were transferred and delivered by 3M to the selling securityholder in the offering, in\nsatisfaction of certain of 3M’s existing debt. Upon closing of the FSD transaction on September 1, 2022, the Notes became\nguaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company and certain wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries of the Company.\nThe Company determined that the redemption features of the Notes did not meet the definition of a derivative and thus does\nnot require bifurcation from the host liability and accordingly has accounted for the entire instrument at amortized cost.\nTotal accrued interest on the Notes was $10,985 as of May 31, 2024 based on the stated interest rate of 8.625%. This\namount was included in current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. In fiscal year 2023, the Company incurred\ntotal debt issuance costs of $6,683, which is recorded as an offset to the Notes and amortized over the contractual life of the\nNotes to interest expense using the straight line method. The amortization of deferred debt issuance costs of $835 and\ninterest expense of $30,188 for the Notes was included in the consolidated statements of operations during the twelve\nmonths ended May 31, 2024. The amortization of deferred debt issuance costs of $766 and interest expense of $26,079 for\nthe Notes was included in the consolidated statements of operations during the twelve months ended May 31, 2023. As of\nMay 31, 2024 and May 31, 2023, the Company had $5,082 and $5,917, respectively, of unamortized debt issuance costs.\nThere are no required principal payments on the term loan facility or the Notes through fiscal year 2026, due to $100,000 in\nprepayments made on the term loan facility in fiscal 2023. The weighted average interest rate on the Company's long-term\nF-24\ndebt was 7.71% as of May 31, 2024. The expected maturities associated with the Company’s outstanding debt as of May\n31, 2024, were as follows:\nAmount\nFiscal Year\n2025 $ 2,350\n2026 —\n2027 34,063\n2028 515,937\n2029 —\nThereafter 350,000\nTotal $ 902,350\nFinance Lease\nThe finance lease is a building lease that is classified within property and equipment and the current portion of debt on the\nconsolidated balance sheets as of May 31, 2024. The Company intends to elect the purchase option within the lease\nagreement prior to the end of the lease term.\n8. Equity Compensation Plans and Other Incentive Compensation\nThe Company’s long-term incentive plans allow for the grant of various types of share-based awards to officers, directors\nand other key employees of the Company. Incentive and non-qualified options to purchase shares of common stock have\nbeen granted under the terms of the 2018 and 2023 Omnibus Incentive Plans. These options are granted at an exercise price\nequal to the closing price of the common stock on the date of grant. Options vest ratably over three and five year periods\nand the contractual terms are generally five, seven or ten years. The fair value of the options was estimated at the date of the\ngrant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company granted restricted stock units (RSUs) under the terms of\nthe 2018 and 2023 Omnibus Incentive Plans, which vest ratably over three and five year periods. The fair value of the\nRSUs is determined based on the closing price of the common stock on the date of grant.\nRemaining shares available for grant under share-based compensation plans were 16,778,458 at May 31, 2024, 2,871,000 at\nMay 31, 2023, and 5,386,000 at May 31, 2022. Compensation expense related to share-based awards was $13,768,\n$10,177, and $7,154 in fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nOptions\nWeighted-\nWeighted- Average Grant\nAverage Date Fair\n(option amounts in thousands) Options Exercise Price Value\nOutstanding at May 31, 2021 (643 exercisable) 2,957 $ 27.98 $ 6.98\nGranted 615 36.42 8.49\nExercised (281) 22.79 6.29\nForfeited (47) 33.93 8.02\nOutstanding at May 31, 2022 (1,191 exercisable) 3,244 32.13 7.66\nGranted 1,704 14.68 4.61\nExercised (22) 14.78 4.23\nForfeited (704) 29.81 7.26\nOutstanding at May 31, 2023 (1,401 exercisable) 4,222 25.56 6.51\nGranted 1,949 15.43 5.98\nExercised (11) 13.61 4.44\nForfeited (1,224) 30.27 7.26\nOutstanding at May 31, 2024 (1,518 exercisable) 4,936 20.41 6.12\nF-25\nThe following is a summary of stock options outstanding at May 31, 2024:\nOptions Outstanding Options Exercisable\nAverage\nWeighted-\n(option amounts in thousands) Contractual Life Weighted-Average Average\nRange of Exercise Price Number (in years) Exercise Price Number Exercise Price\n$12.20 - $20.00 3,399 5.9 $ 14.64 515 $ 13.73\n$20.01 - $28.00 96 5.0 24.23 83 23.74\n$28.01 - $36.00 1,140 1.3 31.89 795 32.03\n$36.01 - $42.15 301 2.4 40.94 125 41.00\n4,936 4.6 $ 20.41 1,518 $ 26.11\nThe weighted average exercise price of shares subject to options that were exercisable at May 31, 2023 and 2022 was\n$31.54 and $30.24, respectively.\nRemaining compensation cost to be expensed in future periods for non-vested options was $14,427 at May 31, 2024, with a\nweighted average expense recognition period of 2.0 years.\nYear Ended May 31,\n2024 2023 2022\nAggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding $ 55 $ 6,154 $ 850\nAggregate intrinsic value of options exercisable $ 5 $ 42 $ 817\nAggregate intrinsic value of options exercised $ 37 $ 73 $ 5,507\nThe fair value of stock options granted was estimated using the following weighted-average assumptions:\nYear Ended May 31,\n2024 2023 2022\nRisk-free interest rate 4.7% 3.3% 0.4%\nExpected dividend yield 0.0% 0.0% 0.0%\nExpected stock volatility 37.3% 34.0% 32.8%\nExpected option life 4.5 years 4.5 years 3.12 years\nThe risk-free interest rate for periods within the expected life of options granted is based on the United States Treasury\nyield curve in effect at the time of grant. Expected stock price volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company’s\nstock. The expected option life, representing the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding, is based\non historical option exercise and employee termination data. We include recent historical experience in estimating our\nforfeitures. As employees terminate, grant tranches expire or as forfeitures are known, estimated expense is adjusted to\nactual. For options granted in fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded charges in general and\nadministrative expense based on the fair value of stock options using the straight line method over the vesting period of\nthree to five years.\nF-26\nRestricted Stock Units\nThe remaining weighted-average period for the Company's outstanding RSUs is 2.1 years. On May 31, 2024, there was\n$12,292 in unamortized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs. The fair value of restricted stock units vested\nduring fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $3,835, $820 and $1,032, respectively.\nWeighted\nAverage Grant\n(RSU amounts in thousands) RSUs Date Fair Value\nOutstanding at May 31, 2022 257 $ 36.14\nGranted 596 13.83\nReleased (60) 35.14\nForfeited (27) 22.81\nOutstanding at May 31, 2023 766 19.30\nGranted 574 15.55\nReleased (230) 18.53\nForfeited (149) 19.98\nOutstanding at May 31, 2024 961 17.17\nThe weighted average grant date fair value of the fiscal year 2022 awards was $37.28.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nThe Company offers eligible employees the option to purchase common stock at a 5% discount to the lower of the market\nvalue of the stock at the beginning or end of each participation period under the terms of the 2021 Employee Stock\nPurchase Plan. The discount is recorded in general and administrative expense. Total individual purchases in any year are\nlimited to 10% of compensation. Shares purchased by employees through this program were 134,810 in fiscal 2024, 94,604\nin fiscal 2023, and 43,456 in fiscal 2022. As of May 31, 2024, common stock totaling 746,513 of the 1,000,000 authorized\nshares remained reserved for issuance under the plan.\nDefined Contribution Benefit Plan and Bonus Compensation\nThe Company maintains a defined contribution 401(k) benefit plan covering substantially all domestic employees.\nEmployees are permitted to defer compensation up to IRS limits, with Neogen matching 100% of the first 3% of deferred\ncompensation and 50% of the next 2% of deferred compensation. Neogen’s expense under this plan was $3,368, $2,439,\nand $1,834 in fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe Company also offers an annual bonus opportunity to certain employees, as an additional component of their\ncompensation. Amounts are determined based on company performance and employee performance. The bonus amounts\nearned during fiscal year 2024 will be paid to employees in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. As of May 31, 2024 and 2023,\nthe Company had an accrued bonus of $8,056 and $8,734, respectively, recorded within accrued compensation on the\nconsolidated balance sheets.\n9.

The Company’s research and development credits were $615,\n$1,385, and $780 in fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nF-28\nDeferred income taxes reflect the tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities\nfor financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of our deferred\nincome tax liabilities and assets are as follows:\nYear Ended May 31,\n2024 2023\nDeferred income tax liabilities\nIndefinite and long-lived assets $ (356,971) $ (369,500)\nRight of use asset (3,673) (1,834)\nPrepaid expenses (1,401) (1,480)\n(362,045) (372,814)\nDeferred income tax assets\nInterest expense not currently deductible 13,994 5,782\nResearch and experimentation capitalization 7,230 5,868\nStock options 2,228 2,192\nInventories and accounts receivable 5,597 3,219\nTax loss carryforwards 5,580 3,909\nLease liability 3,841 1,899\nAccrued expenses and other 2,171 1,981\n40,641 24,850\nValuation allowance (1,526) (2,110)\nNet deferred income tax liabilities $ (322,930) $ (350,074)\nNet deferred income tax assets (jurisdictional) - other\nnon-current assets $ 3,788 $ 3,353\nNet deferred income tax liabilities (jurisdictional) (326,718) (353,427)\nNet deferred income tax liabilities $ (322,930) $ (350,074)\nThe Company has the following net operating loss carryforwards:\nAs of May 31, 2024 Expiry\nU.S. $ 155 2038\nForeign 18,068 2025 to Indefinite\n$ 18,223\nValuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets are established based on management’s determination of a more\nlikely than not standard that the tax benefits will not be realized. Management evaluates all available evidence, both\npositive and negative, when determining the need for a valuation allowance. Valuation allowances related to net operating\nlosses are primarily evaluated based on evidence (or lack thereof) of historical and future earnings. Valuation allowances\nrelated to long-lived assets primarily are evaluated based on management’s tax planning and intentions for underlying\nassets.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and in numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is\nrequired in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of\nbusiness, there are transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We establish reserves\nfor tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These\nreserves are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return\npositions are fully supportable. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome\nof tax audits. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are\nconsidered appropriate. The Company’s policy is to recognize both accrued interest expense and penalties related to\nunrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. The amount of interest and penalties included in the unrecognized tax\nbenefits reserve was $246 at May 31, 2024, $145 at May 31, 2023, and $69 at May 31, 2022. Of the total unrecognized tax\nbenefits at May 31, 2024 and 2023, $2,739 and $1,087, respectively, comprise unrecognized tax positions that would, if\nrecognized, affect our effective tax rate.\nF-29\nThe reconciliation of our unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\nYear Ended May 31,\n2024 2023 2022\nBeginning balance $ 946 $ 741 $ 764\nIncrease/(decrease) related to prior periods (47) 2 (75)\nIncrease related to current period 2,004 479 147\nLapses of applicable statute of limitations (164) (276) (95)\nEnding balance $ 2,739 $ 946 $ 741\nThe Company is no longer subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service for fiscal year 2020 and preceding years.\nAs of May 31, 2024, the Company has approximately $221,707 of undistributed earnings in its foreign subsidiaries.\nApproximately $88,746 of these earnings are no longer considered permanently reinvested. The incremental tax cost to\nrepatriate these earnings to the US is insignificant. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on approximately\n$132,961 of undistributed earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries as of May 31, 2024 which are indefinitely reinvested in\noperations. Based on historical experience, as well as management’s future plans, earnings from these subsidiaries will\ncontinue to be re-invested indefinitely for future expansion and working capital needs. On an annual basis, we evaluate the\ncurrent business environment and whether any new events or other external changes might require future evaluation of the\ndecision to indefinitely re-invest these foreign earnings. It is not practical to determine the income tax liability that would\nbe payable if such earnings were not reinvested indefinitely.\n10. Commitments and Contingencies\nThe Company is involved in environmental remediation and monitoring activities at its Randolph, Wisconsin\nmanufacturing facility and accrues for related costs, including legal costs, when such costs are determined to be probable\nand estimable. The Company currently utilizes a pump and treat remediation strategy, which includes semi-annual\nmonitoring and reporting, consulting, and maintenance of monitoring wells. We expense these annual costs of remediation,\nwhich have ranged from approximately $60 to $130 per year over the past five years. The Company’s estimated remaining\nliability for these costs was $916 at both May 31, 2024 and 2023, measured on an undiscounted basis over an estimated\nperiod of 15 years. In fiscal 2019, the Company performed an updated Corrective Measures Study on the site, per a request\nfrom the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (\"WDNR\"), and is currently working with the WDNR regarding\npotential alternative remediation strategies going forward. The Company believes that the current pump and treat strategy is\nappropriate for the site. In fiscal 2022, in collaboration with the WDNR, the Company initiated an in-situ chemical\nremediation pilot study, which ran over a two-year period. The results of this study were submitted to the WDNR as part of\nour standard annual report. If the WDNR were to require a change from the current pump and treat remediation strategy,\nthis change could result in an increase in future costs and, ultimately, an increase in the currently recorded liability, with an\noffsetting charge to operations in the period recorded. The Company has recorded $100 in other current liabilities, and the\nremaining $816 is recorded in other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of May 31, 2024 and 2023.\nIn the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, the Company received $1,265 of business interruption insurance proceeds relating to\nfire damage that occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023 at one of our Animal Safety lab facilities. The proceeds\nwere recorded within Cost of Revenues in the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe Company previously disclosed an ongoing investigation by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets\nControl (OFAC) regarding activities or transactions involving parties located in Iran. In fiscal year 2020, the Company\nrecorded a charge to other (expense) income and recorded a reserve of $600 to provide for potential fines or penalties on\nthis matter. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, the Company received a Cautionary Letter from OFAC concluding its\ninvestigation without civil monetary penalty or other enforcement action. As the investigation is effectively resolved, the\nCompany reversed a $600 accrual in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nF-30\nThe Company has agreements with unrelated third parties that provide for the payment of royalties on the sale of certain\nproducts. Royalty expense, recorded in sales and marketing, under the terms of these agreements was $3,250, $3,392 and\n$1,999 for fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Some of these agreements provide for guaranteed minimum\nroyalty payments to be paid each fiscal year by the Company for certain technologies. Future minimum royalty payments\nare as follows: 2025—$294, 2026—$329, 2027—$354, 2028—$562, and 2029—$60.\nThe Company is subject to certain legal and other proceedings in the normal course of business that, in the opinion of\nmanagement, are not expected to have a material effect on its future results of operations or financial position.\n11. Fair Value and Derivatives\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nFair value measurements are determined based upon the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer\na liability in an orderly transaction between market participants exclusive of any transaction costs. The Company utilizes a\nfair value hierarchy based upon the observability of inputs used in valuation techniques as follows:\nLevel 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;\nLevel 2: Inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its\nown assumptions.\nThe carrying amounts of the Company’s financial instruments other than cash equivalents and marketable securities, which\ninclude accounts receivable and accounts payable, approximate fair value based on either their short maturity or current\nterms for similar instruments.\nItems Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nThe Company has marketable securities held by banks or broker-dealers consisting of commercial paper and corporate\nbonds. These securities are recorded at fair value based on recent trades or pricing models and therefore meet the Level 2\ncriteria. For further information, refer to Note 1. \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\".\nThe Company forecasts its net exposure in various receivables and payables to fluctuations in the value of various\ncurrencies, and has entered into a number of foreign currency forward contracts each month to mitigate that exposure.\nThese contracts are recorded net at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets, classified as Level 2 in the fair value\nhierarchy.\nGains and losses from these foreign currency forward contracts are recognized in other (expense) income in our\nconsolidated statements of operations. The notional amount of forward contracts in place was $70,315 and $15,500 as of\nMay 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and consisted of foreign currency hedges of transactions up to July 2024.\nFair Value of Derivatives Not\nDesignated as Hedging Instruments Balance Sheet Location May 31, 2024 May 31, 2023\nForeign currency forward Prepaid expenses and other current assets $ (265) $ 140\ncontracts, net (Other current liabilities)\nWe record the fair value of our interest rate swaps on a recurring basis using Level 2 observable market inputs for similar\nassets or liabilities in active markets.\nFair Value of Derivatives Designated as Hedging\nInstruments Balance Sheet Location May 31, 2024 May 31, 2023\nInterest rate swaps – current Other current assets $ 2,222 $ 2,087\nInterest rate swaps – non-current Other non-current assets (liabilities) 229 (4,770)\nF-31\nItems Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\nIn addition to items that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company measures certain assets and liabilities\nat fair value on a nonrecurring basis, which are not included in the table above. As these nonrecurring fair value\nmeasurements are generally determined using unobservable inputs, these fair value measurements are classified within\nLevel 3 of the fair value hierarchy. For further information see Note 5. \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\" and Note 6\n“Business Combinations”.\nItems Not Carried at Fair Value\nFair values of the Company’s Term Loan and Senior Notes were as follows:\nMay 31, 2024\nAggregate fair value 923,170\nAggregate carrying value (1) 900,000\n(1) Excludes unamortized debt issuance costs.\nFair values were based on available market information and other observable data and are classified within Level 2 of the\nfair value hierarchy.\nDerivatives\nDerivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments\nThe location and amount of gains from derivatives not designated as hedging instruments in our consolidated statements of\noperations were as follows:\nLocation in statements Year Ended May 31,\nMay 31,\nDerivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments of (loss) income May 31, 2024 May 31, 2023 2022\nForeign currency forward contracts Other (expense) income $ 88 $ (10,092) $ 1,218\nDerivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments\nIn November 2022, we entered into a receive-variable, pay-fixed interest rate swap agreement with a $250,000 notional\nvalue, which is designated as a cash flow hedge. This agreement fixed a portion of the variable interest due on our term\nloan facility, with an effective date of December 2, 2022 and a maturity date of June 30, 2027. Under the terms of the\nagreement, we pay a fixed interest rate of 4.215% plus an applicable margin ranging between 150 to 225 basis points and\nreceive a variable rate of interest based on term SOFR from the counterparty, which is reset according to the duration of the\nSOFR term. The fair value of the interest rate swap as of May 31, 2024 was a net asset of $2,452. The Company expects to\nreclassify a $1,689 gain of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income into earnings in the next 12 months. As of May\n31, 2024 and 2023, the amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income were $1,864 and ($2,039),\nrespectively.\nThe following table summarizes the other comprehensive (loss) income before reclassifications of derivative gains and\nlosses:\nOther Comprehensive Income (Loss) Before Reclassifications\nYear Ended May 31,\nDerivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments 2024 2023 2022\nInterest rate swaps $ 6,184 $ (1,599) $ —\nThe following table summarizes the reclassification of derivative gains and losses into net (loss) income from accumulated\nother comprehensive (loss) income:\nGain (Loss) Reclassified\nLocation of Gain Year Ended May 31,\nDerivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments Reclassified 2024 2023 2022\nInterest rate swaps Interest expense $ 2,281 $ 440 $ —\nF-32\n12. Segment Information\nThe Company has two reportable segments: Food Safety and Animal Safety. The Food Safety segment is primarily engaged\nin the development, production and marketing of diagnostic test kits and related products used by food producers and\nprocessors to detect harmful natural toxins, foodborne bacteria, allergens and levels of general sanitation. The Animal\nSafety segment is primarily engaged in the development, production and marketing of products dedicated to animal safety,\nincluding a complete line of consumable products marketed to veterinarians and animal health product distributors. This\nsegment also provides genomic identification and related interpretive bioinformatic services. Additionally, the Animal\nSafety segment produces and markets rodent control products, disinfectants and insect control products to assist in the\ncontrol of rodents, insects and disease in and around agricultural, food production and other facilities.\nMany of our international operations originally focused on the Company’s food safety products, and each of these units\nreports through the Food Safety segment. In recent years, these operations have expanded to offer the Company’s complete\nline of products and services, including those usually associated with the Animal Safety segment such as cleaners,\ndisinfectants, rodent control products, insect control products, veterinary instruments and genomics services. These\nadditional products and services are managed and directed by existing management and are reported through the Food\nSafety segment.\nNeogen’s operation in Australia originally focused on providing genomics services and sales of animal safety products and\nreports through the Animal Safety segment. With the acquisition of Cell BioSciences in February 2020, this operation\nexpanded to offer our complete line of products and services, including those usually associated with the Food Safety\nsegment. These additional products are managed and directed by existing management at Neogen Australasia and reports\nthrough the Animal Safety segment. While Neogen was operating under a distribution services agreement with 3M, all\nrevenue of 3M FSD products were reported through the Food Safety segment. Since the review of 3M FSD revenue occurs\non a global scale, revenue of these products occurring in Australia and New Zealand will continue to report through the\nFood Safety segment, despite now occurring at Neogen Australasia.\nThe accounting policies of each of the segments are the same as those described in Note 1. \"Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies\".\nF-33\nSegment information is as follows:\nCorporate and\nFood Safety Animal Safety Eliminations (1) Total\nFiscal 2024\nTotal revenues to external customers $ 655,341 $ 268,881 — $ 924,222\nOperating income (loss) 82,446 39,320 (63,103) 58,663\nDepreciation and amortization 102,328 14,389 — 116,717\nInterest expense — — 73,394 73,394\nTotal assets 4,035,257 342,640 170,936 4,548,833\nExpenditures for long-lived assets 93,036 18,385 — 111,421\nFiscal 2023\nTotal revenues to external customers $ 546,797 $ 275,650 — $ 822,447\nOperating income (loss) 60,414 43,332 (66,231) 37,515\nDepreciation and amortization 76,841 11,536 — 88,377\nInterest expense — — 55,961 55,961\nTotal assets 3,970,356 338,507 245,569 4,554,432\nExpenditures for long-lived assets 52,169 13,588 — 65,757\nFiscal 2022\nTotal revenues to external customers $ 259,979 $ 267,180 — $ 527,159\nOperating income (loss) 38,581 52,546 (32,509) 58,618\nDepreciation and amortization 13,386 10,308 — 23,694\nInterest expense — — 72 72\nTotal assets 304,461 307,417 381,051 992,929\nExpenditures for long-lived assets 7,842 16,939 — 24,781\n(1) Includes corporate assets, including cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, current and deferred tax\naccounts, and overhead expenses not allocated to specific business segments.

We also saw improvement in our order fulfillment rates throughout the quarter, which have subsequently improved to the point where they are no longer a constraint.\"\n\nAdent continued, “End-market conditions remained soft, but stable compared to the third quarter. With respect to Food Safety specifically, where food production volumes were still mostly down on a year-over-year basis, we are expecting a trend of slow, gradual improvement over the course of the fiscal year. The progress we’ve made on resolving our shipping challenges has allowed our commercial teams to focus on what they do best – demand generation – leveraging the broadest product portfolio in the industry and Neogen’s reputation for consultative customer service, along with the expected improvement in the end-market backdrop. While we still have work ahead of us, the peak capital expenditure and working capital outflows related to the integration are behind us. As a result of our significant integration progress, we’re able to focus on driving improvements in the combined operations and are looking forward to leveraging the full capabilities of our business in what we expect to be an unconstrained operating environment in fiscal 2025.”\n\n## Financial and Business Highlights\n\nRevenues for the fourth quarter were $236.8 million, a decrease of 2.1% compared to $241.8 million in the prior year. Core revenue, which excludes the impacts of foreign currency translation, as well as acquisitions completed and product lines discontinued in the last 12 months, was 2.0%. Acquisitions and discontinued product lines contributed 0.1%, while foreign currency had a negative impact of 4.2%.\n\nRevenues for the full year were $924.2 million, an increase of 12.4% compared to $822.4 million in the prior year. Core revenue growth was 1.8%. Acquisitions and discontinued product lines contributed 11.9%, while foreign currency was a headwind of 1.3%.\n\nNet loss for the fourth quarter was $5.4 million, or $(0.02) per diluted share, compared to net income of $5.6 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, in the prior-year period. Adjusted Net Income was $22.4 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, compared to $30.2 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, in the prior-year period, with the decline driven primarily by lower Adjusted EBITDA.\n\nNet loss for the full year was $9.4 million, or $(0.04) per diluted share, compared to net loss of $22.9 million, or $(0.12) per diluted share, in the prior year. Adjusted Net Income for the full year was $97.4 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, compared to $105.7 million, or $0.56 per diluted share, in the prior year.\n\nGross margin, expressed as a percentage of sales, was 47.9% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. This compares to a gross margin of 50.9% in the same quarter a year ago, with the decrease primarily due to costs incurred related to the exit of the transition service agreements, including a higher level of inventory adjustments.\n\nGross margin for the full year was 50.2% compared to a gross margin of 49.4% in the prior year.\n\nFourth-quarter Adjusted EBITDA was $53.0 million, representing an Adjusted EBITDA Margin of 22.4%, compared to $63.1 million and a margin of 26.1% in the prior-year period. The lower Adjusted EBITDA Margin was primarily the result of the decline in gross margin.\n\nFull-year Adjusted EBITDA was $213.2 million, representing an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 23.1% compared to $205.4 million and a margin of 25.0% in the prior year.\n\n## Food Safety Segment\n\nRevenues for the Food Safety segment were $166.9 million in the fourth quarter, a decrease of 1.4% compared to $169.3 million in the prior year, consisting of 4.3% core growth, a 0.2% contribution from acquisitions and discontinued product lines and a negative foreign currency impact of 5.9%. The core revenue growth was led by the Indicator Testing, Culture Media & Other product category, which benefited from strong growth in Petrifilm, as well as in culture media and food quality and nutritional analysis products. In the Company’s Bacterial & General Sanitation product category, growth in pathogen detection and general sanitation products was partially offset by a decline in sales of microbiological products, largely the result of higher equipment sales in the prior-year quarter. Within the Natural Toxins & Allergens product category, modest growth in allergens was offset by a decline in sales of natural toxin test kits, due largely to product availability issues.\n\nFor the full year, revenues for the Food Safety segment were $655.3 million, an increase of 19.9% compared to $546.8 million in the prior year, consisting of core growth of 3.7%, 18.0% from acquisitions and a foreign currency headwind of 1.8%.\n\n## Animal Safety Segment\n\nRevenues for the Animal Safety segment were $69.9 million in the fourth quarter, a decrease of 3.7% compared to $72.5 million in the prior year, consisting of a 3.3% core revenue decline, a 0.3% headwind from discontinued product lines and negative foreign currency impact of 0.1%. In the Veterinary Instruments & Disposables product category, solid growth in veterinary instruments from increased demand for detectable needles and syringes was partially offset by a compare-driven decline in other animal safety products. Growth in the Company’s Animal Care & Other product category was driven by higher sales of vitamin injectables and biologics products. In the Company’s portfolio of biosecurity products, strong growth in insect control products was offset by declines in cleaners and disinfectants and rodent control products due largely to strong growth in the prior-year quarter and the timing of shipments.\n\nOn a global basis, the Company’s Genomics business experienced a core revenue decline in the mid-single-digit range. Increased sales in international beef markets were offset by the impact of customer attrition in the U.S., a result of the shift in strategic focus towards larger production animals.\n\nFor the full year, revenues for the Animal Safety segment were $268.9 million, a decrease of 2.5% compared to $275.7 million in the prior year, consisting of a core revenue decline of 2.0%, a 0.2% headwind from discontinued product lines and negative foreign currency impact of 0.3%.\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nAs of May 31, 2024, the Company had total cash and investments of $170.9 million and total outstanding non-current debt of $900.0 million, as well as committed borrowing headroom of $150.0 million.\n\n## Fiscal Year 2025 Outlook\n\nThe Company is initiating its full-year outlook for fiscal year 2025. Revenue is expected to be $925 million to $955 million, reflecting core revenue growth in the mid-single-digit range, offset primarily by an anticipated foreign currency headwind. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be $215 million to $235 million, while capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $85 million, including approximately $55 million related specifically to the integration of the former 3M Food Safety Division.\n\n## Conference Call and Webcast\n\nNeogen Corporation will host a conference call today at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss the Company’s financial results.
