(NASDAQ:GIPR) (\"GIPR\" or the \"Company\") today announced its three and nine month financial and operating results for the period ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Quarterly Highlights**\n\n(For the 3 months ended September 30, 2024)\n\n  * Generated net loss attributable to GIP common shareholders of $2.1 million, or ($0.55) per basic and diluted share.\n\n  * Generated Core FFO of ($146 thousand), or ($0.03) per basic and diluted share.\n\n  * Generated Core AFFO of $100 thousand, or $0.02 per basic and diluted share.\n\n\n\n\nFFO and related measures are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures used in the real estate industry to measure and compare the operating performance of real estate companies. A complete reconciliation containing adjustments from GAAP net income to Core FFO and Core AFFO is included at the end of this release.\n\n**Portfolio**\n\n  * Approximately 60% of our portfolio's annualized base rent (\"ABR\") as of September 30, 2024 was derived from tenants that have (or whose parent company has) an investment grade credit rating from a recognized credit rating agency of \"BBB-\" or better. Our largest tenants are the General Service Administration, Dollar General, EXP Services, Kohl's Corporation, PRA Holdings, and The City of San Antonio which collectively contributed approximately 69% of our portfolio's annualized base rent.\n\n  * Our portfolio is 89% leased and occupied and tenants are 100% rent paying.\n\n  * Approximately 92% of the leases in our current portfolio (based on ABR as of September 30, 2024) provide for increases in contractual base rent during future years of the current term or during the lease extension periods.\n\n  * Average effective annual rental per square foot is $14.75.\n\n\n\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\n  * $1.58 million in total cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024.\n\n  * Total mortgage loans, net was $59.7 million as of June 30, 2024.\n\n\n\n\n**Financial Results**\n\n  * During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, total revenue from operations were $2.4 million and $7.09 million respectively, as compared to $1.8 million and $4.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The overall revenue increase was driven by the integration of the 13-property portfolio acquired from Modiv in August 2023.\n\n  * Operating expenses, including G&A, for the same periods in the current year were $3.8 million and $11.1 million, respectively, due to increases in depreciation and amortization and interest expense from recent acquisitions.\n\n  * Net operating income (\"NOI\") for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was $1.7 million and $1.4 million for the same period last year, which is a direct result of the acquisition of properties.\n\n  * Net loss attributable to GIPR for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was $8.3 million as compared to $4 million for the same period last year.\n\n\n\n\n**Commenting on the quarter, a letter from CEO David Sobelman:**\n\nTo the Shareholders and my colleagues at Generation Income Properties, Inc.,\n\nThe third quarter of this year presented challenges for our stock price, which reached an all-time low despite the significant transitional events we've achieved to position the company for long-term growth and sustainability. I recognize that some shareholders have expressed concerns, indicating that the company's recent dividend suspension holds more weight for them than our long-term outlook. It's clear that many of our shareholders view their investment primarily for the monthly dividend and the regular income it provides, rather than the intrinsic value of our growing assets. I understand this perspective, especially given that \"income\" is part of our company name. REITs are fundamentally structured to provide dividends, a practice established since their inception in the 1950s and 1960s, offering a transparent way for investors to engage in real estate markets that might otherwise be inaccessible.\n\nI recently finished reading \"Watch That Rat Hole: And Witness the REIT Revolution\" by Kenneth D. Campbell, one of the early analysts in the REIT industry. The book discusses how REITs were created to fund single-family home developers, providing the necessary short-term debt for their projects in the post-WWII era. This initiative arose from a pressing need in the United States, as developers struggled to secure funding from traditional banks for their short-term projects. Over time, the REIT structure evolved to include funding not only for debt but also for a variety of property types.\n\nThis historical context highlights that, since the industry's inception, many investments have focused on short-term returns. Campbell's book also notes that economic changes can impact these short-term strategies. When conditions shift - such as interest rate increases or changes in consumer behavior - companies may face significant adjustments, sometimes leading to drastic decisions like asset sales or restructuring.\n\nAt GIPR, we have always maintained a long-term, generational outlook to avoid succumbing to short-term market pressures. We believe that our approach has proven effective over the years in the industry generally, and we remain committed to making decisions that prioritize sustainable growth for the future.\n\nI recognize that long-term thinking can be challenging for many investors, and I share a sense of impatience regarding various aspects of my life, including the growth of GIPR. However, it's important to reflect on our progress. Approximately this time last year, we were half our current size, and we've made substantial strides since then. I also understand that many of our shareholders may not thoroughly review our public filings, so I'd like to highlight some key events from the previous quarter:\n\n  * **July 2, 2024** - We successfully raised $2.5 million in new capital through preferred units from a new investor.\n\n  * **July 3, 2024** - We made the difficult but strategic decision to suspend our dividend in order to focus on growth, with plans to prioritize reinstating the dividend when feasible.\n\n  * **July 19, 2024** - Due to our ongoing growth and increased complexities, we engaged Cohn Reznick, a top 20 accounting firm, as our independent auditor.\n\n  * **July 24, 2024** - We extended the redemption date for one of our unit holders from February 8, 2025, to February 8, 2027.\n\n  * **August 23, 2024** - We acquired an investment-grade tenanted building (Best Buy, NYSE: BBY, S&P: BBB) at an effective cap rate of 8.1%, set to begin in January 2025.\n\n  * **August 29, 2024** - We extended the maturity date of a loan set to expire in October 2024 to August 30, 2029, with no cash outlay required from the company.\n\n\n\n\nImportantly, we accomplished all this while maintaining the integrity of our current portfolio, with 100% rent collection from our tenants.\n\nI don't intend to paint this as solely good news. You have the responsibility to assess your investment wisely, and we aim to provide you with transparent information to aid in that decision. This level of transparency is a distinct advantage over private companies, where reporting would be considerably less frequent or detailed. Your access to our updates allows you to make informed decisions based on clarity regarding our activities.\n\n**Why Temporarily Suspend the Dividend**\n\nLet me start with this; our company is stable, our balance sheet is strong, and our tenants are paying rent as planned. However, our priority is growth, and we constantly require new assets and new capital to achieve that. Without growth, our stock price may experience temporary pressure before it increases in value. Currently, raising public capital would be costly and could dilute existing shareholders, providing better deals to new investors than to current ones. By conserving our cash for new asset acquisitions and debt reduction, we aim to enhance the company's long-term value.\n\nAdditionally, while I take the daily news with a grain of salt, it's evident that the economy remains uncertain. Recent reports indicate that bankruptcies in 2024 are expected to surpass those in 2023. Therefore, we are adopting a conservative approach to cash management, ensuring we can sustain this unpredictable period while positioning the company for future growth without making decisions based solely on fleeting market sentiments.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that the information you receive from us may not always convey the broader context. Sometimes, we report on specific events without detailing their potential impact on other initiatives. Due to stringent regulations, we strive to provide you with all the information necessary to evaluate your investment in our company and to answer any questions about our decisions.\n\nOur choices are made with the long-term benefit of all shareholders in mind as we navigate this complex real estate market early in our public journey.\n\nIn the past, I've noted that analysts typically do not value companies based solely on dividends. Instead, they understand that dividends attract investor interest, which can drive stock prices.\n\nDividend = positive\n\nNo dividend = requires more analysis\n\nWhile the formulaic approach is standard in securities analysis, ultimately, market sentiment dictates stock prices. Therefore, I cannot predict exactly when our stock price will recover, but it often happens when investors recognize the undervaluation and begin purchasing shares.\n\nRegarding the reinstatement of the dividend, this is another item where I can't give you the exact date that will occur. However, I can assure you that when we made the decision to suspend the dividend, we were already strategizing on how to reverse that decision for the benefit of all shareholders. This process has involved thorough discussions on why the suspension was necessary, what actions we would take during this period, and how we could eventually reinstate the dividend.\n\n**How Do We Grow GIPR**\n\nWhile it may seem there's bad news this quarter due to our stock price decline, it's essential to acknowledge our journey. As one of GIPR's top five shareholders, I, too, prefer to see positive returns on investment. Warren Buffett famously stated in a 2008 op-ed, \"Bad news is an investor's best friend. It lets you buy a slice of America's future at a marked-down price.\" Over the past three years, shareholders have seen our portfolio grow from eight properties to twenty-seven. We've successfully utilized our shares and operating partnership equity as currency for acquisitions and secured financing when many lenders were hesitant. We started with zero properties, went through our IPO with eight properties and have successfully grown the portfolio to 27 properties with only one public capital raise.\n\nWe plan to leverage our resources to acquire properties with partners, as we have done in the past, and we will continue to accept assets through our UPREIT program, requiring minimal cash outlay. Our focus on these growth strategies not only benefits the company but also aligns us with investors who understand our long-term vision.\n\n**Subsequent Events and Values**\n\nGIPR has no debt obligations due until 2028 and no cash redemptions due until 2026. These changes have been carefully planned and executed in recent months. Our Director of Capital Markets, Emily Hewland, has proactively managed our timelines, ensuring we face no imminent deadlines that limit our options. We adhere to Charlie Munger's principle of \"Inversion Thinking\", identifying potential pitfalls and proactively preventing them.\n\nGIPR's culture and core values are fundamental to our identity, akin to long-standing companies like Apple and Patagonia. Based in Tampa, FL, we have recently faced significant challenges, including hurricanes that impacted our community.\n\nWhile our team remained safe, many friends and family experienced devastating losses. Witnessing their struggles has been emotionally difficult. During this time, our Asset Manager, Bobby Rohrlack, led efforts to reach out to tenants who could help those affected in North Carolina and Florida. Leveraging our relationships with major corporations, we coordinated support for those in need.\n\nThe outcomes of Bobby's initiatives include:\n\n  * Walgreens: We connected their VP of Public Affairs with the ASYMCA to coordinate donations of household items.\n\n  * ASYMCA: We established communication with ASYMCA's Executive Director in Fayetteville, NC, to address urgent supply needs.\n\n  * Dollar General: Engaged with their VP of Real Estate to forward our outreach to their Community Giving Department.\n\n  * Dollar Tree - Connected with their Corporate Marketing Director, who is coordinating internal relief efforts and financial grants for impacted areas.\n\n  * PRA Group: Engaged their Facilities & Real Estate VP, who expressed interest in partnering with us.\n\n  * Starbucks: Met with local management to explore potential community collaboration.\n\n\n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn delivering this message, my aim is to be honest and transparent while outlining our plans moving forward. I understand that the topics of stock price and dividends weigh heavily on your minds, as they do on mine.\n\nWe still have a considerable journey ahead before we can claim the stature of some of our larger peers. However, as we navigate the capital and real estate markets, we are committed to seizing growth opportunities. I believe that the current market could present a favorable buying opportunity for both our shares and the assets we pursue.\n\nAs we continue this journey, rest assured that our portfolio remains stable, our tenants are fulfilling their obligations, and our balance sheet is solid.\n\nSincerely,\n\n![](https://www.accesswire.com/imagelibrary/e94c80b5-b324-4d26-808f-3ee48981967a/942275/image.png)\n\nDavid Sobelman\n\n**About Generation Income Properties**\n\nGeneration Income Properties, Inc., located in Tampa, Florida, is an internally managed real estate investment trust formed to acquire and own, directly and jointly, real estate investments focused on retail, office, and industrial net lease properties in densely populated submarkets.

Words such as \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" and \"project\" and other similar words and expressions are intended to signify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future results and conditions but rather are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Such statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. Investors are cautioned that there can be no assurance actual results or business conditions will not differ materially from those projected or suggested in such forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. Please refer to the risks detailed from time to time in the reports we file with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on April 8, 2024, as well as other filings on Form 10-Q and periodic filings on Form 8-K, for additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated or implied by such forward-looking statements. We disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, unless required by law._\n\n**Notice Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nIn addition to our reported results and net earnings per diluted share, which are financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP, this press release contains and may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including Funds from Operations (\"FFO\"), Core Funds From Operations (\"Core FFO\"), Adjusted Funds from Operations (\"AFFO\"), Core Adjusted Funds from Operations (\"Core AFFO\"), and Net Operating Income (\"NOI\"). We believe the use of Core FFO, Core AFFO and NOIare useful to investors because they are widely accepted industry measures used by analysts and investors to compare the operating performance of REITs. FFO and related measures, including NOI, should not be considered alternatives to net income as a performance measure or to cash flows from operations, as reported on our statement of cash flows, or as a liquidity measure, and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures. You should not consider our Core FFO, Core AFFO, or NOI as an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP. Our reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and statements of why management believes these measures are useful to investors are included below.\n\n**Consolidated Balance Sheets**\n\n**As of September 30,** |  **As of December 31,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** |  **2023**  \n**(unaudited)**  \n**_Assets_**  \n**Investment in real estate**  \nLand |  $ |  23,268,037 |  $ |  21,996,902  \nBuilding and site improvements |  67,618,615 |  71,621,499  \nAcquired tenant improvements |  2,380,920 |  2,072,205  \nAcquired lease intangible assets |  10,501,756 |  10,571,331  \nLess: accumulated depreciation and amortization |  (11,070,036 |  ) |  (8,855,332 |  )  \nNet real estate investments |  92,699,292 |  97,406,605  \nCash and cash equivalents |  1,547,110 |  3,117,446  \nRestricted cash |  34,500 |  34,500  \nDeferred rent asset |  435,767 |  1,106,191  \nPrepaid expenses |  270,626 |  139,941  \nAccounts receivable |  164,549 |  241,166  \nEscrow deposits and other assets |  982,637 |  493,393  \nHeld for sale assets |  5,750,250 |  -  \nRight of use asset, net |  6,088,025 |  6,152,174  \n**Total Assets** |  **$** |  **107,972,756** |  **$** |  **108,691,416**  \n**_Liabilities and Equity_**  \n**Liabilities**  \nAccounts payable |  $ |  79,297 |  $ |  406,772  \nAccrued expenses |  1,383,743 |  688,146  \nAccrued expense - related party |  683,347 |  683,347  \nAcquired lease intangible liabilities, net |  1,026,681 |  1,016,260  \nInsurance payable |  150,450 |  34,966  \nDeferred rent liability |  155,968 |  260,942  \nLease liability, net |  6,452,484 |  6,415,041  \nOther payable - related party |  452,460 |  1,809,840  \nLoan payable - related party |  5,500,000 |  5,500,000  \nMortgage loans, net of unamortized debt discount of $1,156,620 and $1,326,362 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and debt issuance costs |  58,551,152 |  56,817,310  \nDerivative liabilities |  809,339 |  537,424  \nTotal liabilities |  75,244,921 |  74,170,048  \n**Redeemable Non-Controlling Interests** |  26,135,796 |  18,812,423  \n**Preferred Stock - Series A Redeemable Preferred stock, net,**  \n$0.01 par value, 2,400,000 shares authorized, no shares issued or outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and 2,400,000 shares issued and outstanding at December 31, 2023 with liquidation preferences of $5 per share |  - |  11,637,616  \n**Stockholders' Equity**  \nCommon stock, $0.01 par value, 100,000,000 shares authorized; 5,419,855 and 2,620,707 shares issued and outstanding at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively |  54,232 |  26,207  \nAdditional paid-in capital |  29,129,543 |  18,472,049  \nAccumulated deficit |  (22,984,596 |  ) |  (14,833,058 |  )  \nTotal Generation Income Properties, Inc.

Basic & Diluted** |  **5,433,833** |  **2,618,077** |  **5,083,640** |  **2,591,956**  \n  \nThe table above presents FFO in accordance with the most current available NAREIT guidance and in alignment with current industry standards. Presentations of FFO in our prior filings and announcements did not include Loss on held for sale asset valuation as an add-back in calculating FFO, but the data for three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 set forth above has been revised to include Loss on held for sale asset valuation as an add-back.\n\nOur reported results are presented in accordance with GAAP. We also disclose funds from operations (\"FFO\"), adjusted funds from operations (\"AFFO\"), core funds from operations (\"Core FFO\") and core adjusted funds of operations (\"Core AFFO\") all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they are widely accepted industry measures used by analysts and investors to compare the operating performance of REITs.\n\nFFO and related measures do not represent cash generated from operating activities and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements; accordingly, they should not be considered alternatives to net income or loss as a performance measure or cash flows from operations as reported on our statement of cash flows as a liquidity measure and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures.\n\nWe compute FFO in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\"). NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude extraordinary items (as defined by GAAP), net gains from sales of depreciable real estate assets, impairment write-downs associated with depreciable real estate assets, and real estate related depreciation and amortization, including the pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries. We then adjust FFO for non-cash revenues and expenses such as amortization of deferred financing costs, above and below market lease intangible amortization, straight line rent adjustment where the Company is both the lessor and lessee, and non-cash stock compensation to calculate Core AFFO.\n\nFFO is used by management, investors, and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers primarily because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions. We believe that AFFO is an additional useful supplemental measure for investors to consider because it will help them to better assess our operating performance without the distortions created by other non-cash revenues or expenses. FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. We believe that Core FFO and Core AFFO are useful measures for management and investors because they further remove the effect of non-cash expenses and certain other expenses that are not directly related to real estate operations. We use each as measures of our performance when we formulate corporate goals.\n\nAs FFO excludes depreciation and amortization, gains and losses from property dispositions that are available for distribution to stockholders and extraordinary items, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses and interest costs, providing a perspective not immediately apparent from net income or loss. However, FFO should not be viewed as an alternative measure of our operating performance since it does not reflect either depreciation and amortization costs or the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties which could be significant economic costs and could materially impact our results from operations. Additionally, FFO does not reflect distributions paid to redeemable non-controlling interests.\n\n**_Investor Contacts_**\n\nInvestor Relationsir@gipreit.com\n\n**SOURCE:** Generation Income Properties\n\nView the original [press release](https://www.accesswire.com/942275/generation-income-properties-announces-third-quarter-2024-financial-and-operating-results) on accesswire.com \n\nReleased November 15, 2024\n\n  * [Email Alerts](/news-events/email-alerts)\n  * [Company Profile](/company-information)\n  * [Contacts](/company-information/contacts)\n  * [RSS News Feed](https://ir.gipreit.com/news-events/press-releases/rss \"Opens in a new window\")\n\n\n\n#### We keep a **generational** outlook in mind.

(NASDAQ:GIPR) (\"GIP\" or the \"Company\") announced the strategic acquisition of a 30,465 square foot retail building located in Ames, Iowa. The purchase price for the asset was $5.5 million, excluding transaction costs. The building is currently occupied by Best Buy, a reputable tenant with an investment-grade credit rating of BBB+ by Standard & Poor's. The existing lease agreement has approximately 6 years remaining, providing stable long-term income. The tenant has the option to extend the lease for two consecutive periods of 5 years each, ensuring potential for continued revenue generation. The annualized base rent from the lease stands at approximately $405,470, contributing to GIPR's rental income stream.\n\nGIPR financed the acquisition using a combination of approximately 55% cash and 45% debt, demonstrating a balanced approach to capital allocation. This strategic acquisition aligns with GIPR's objective to expand its portfolio with high-quality, income-generating assets. The addition of another investment-grade asset underscores GIPR's disciplined approach to identifying, underwriting, and executing acquisitions for the benefit of its shareholders.\n\nDavid Sobelman, President and Chief Executive Officer of GIPR, commented on the significance of the acquisition: \"In today's challenging market environment, we are pleased to have successfully acquired another investment-grade asset. This transaction exemplifies GIPR's commitment to disciplined investment strategies and our unwavering focus on shareholder value creation.\"\n\n**About Generation Income Properties**\n\nGeneration Income Properties, Inc., located in Tampa, Florida, is an internally managed real estate investment trust formed to acquire and own, directly and jointly, real estate investments focused on retail, office and industrial net lease properties located primarily in densely populated submarkets throughout the United States.

(NASDAQ:GIPR) (\"GIPR\" or the \"Company\") today announced its three and six month financial and operating results for the period ended June 30, 2024.\n\n**Quarterly Highlights**\n\n(For the 3 months ended June 30, 2024)\n\n  * Generated net loss attributable to GIP common shareholders of $2.3 million, or ($0.42) per basic and diluted share.\n\n  * Generated Core FFO of ($41 thousand), or ($0.01) per basic and diluted share.\n\n  * Generated Core AFFO of $162 thousand, or $0.03 per basic and diluted share.\n\n\n\n\nFFO and related measures are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures used in the real estate industry to measure and compare the operating performance of real estate companies. A complete reconciliation containing adjustments from GAAP net income to Core FFO and Core AFFO is included at the end of this release.\n\n**Portfolio**\n\n  * Approximately 60% of our portfolio's annualized base rent (\"ABR\") as of June 30, 2024 was derived from tenants that have (or whose parent company has) an investment grade credit rating from a recognized credit rating agency of \"BBB-\" or better. Our largest tenants are the General Service Administration, Dollar General, EXP Services, and Kohl's Corporation, PRA Holdings, and City of San Antonio and contributed approximately 69% of our portfolio's annualized base rent.\n\n  * Our portfolio is 89% leased and occupied and tenants are 100% rent paying.\n\n  * Approximately 92% of the leases in our current portfolio (based on ABR as of June 30, 2024) provide for increases in contractual base rent during future years of the current term or during the lease extension periods.\n\n  * Average effective annual rental per square foot is $14.75.\n\n\n\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\n  * $2.59 million in total cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2024.\n\n  * Total mortgage loans, net was $56.3 million as of June 30, 2024.\n\n\n\n\n**Financial Results**\n\n  * During the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, total revenue from operations were $2.3 million and $4.7 million respectively, as compared to $1.3 million and $2.7 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively. The overall revenue increase was driven by the integration of the 13 property portfolio acquired from Modiv in August 2023.\n\n  * Operating expenses, including G&A, for the same periods were $3.7 million and $7.4 million, respectively, due to increases in depreciation and amortization and interest expense from recent acquisitions.\n\n  * Net operating income (\"NOI\") for the three months ended June 30, 2024 was $1.6 million and $1 million for the same period last year, which is a direct result of the acquisition of properties.\n\n  * Net loss attributable to GIPR for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was $1.5 million as compared to $752 thousand for the same period last year.\n\n\n\n\n**Commenting on the quarter, a letter from CEO David Sobelman:**\n\nTo the Shareholders of Generation Income Properties, Inc.:\n\nIt has only been 5 weeks since we last communicated with you, but as we release another earnings report and close out the second quarter of the year, we want to ensure we are keeping you apprised on the important events happening within your company. We think generationally, not day to day, week to week, quarter by quarter or even year to year. That has always been the premise of our company and continues to be today, as our culture and primary investment objectives are expected to remain static throughout any market cycle or influence.\n\nAchievements\n\nSince our last communication, we've:\n\n  1. Signed a lease with Auburn University (S&P: AA) at an industrial building in Huntsville, AL.\n\n  2. Received $2.5 million in cash contributed to our Limited Partnership from a new investor.\n\n  3. Entered into an agreement with a holder of common units of our operating partnership whereby we exchanged their common units for Series B-1 preferred units of our operating partnership having a redemption value of $7.15/unit and extended the redemption date on the units to July 2026 from January 2025.\n\n  4. Extended the redemption date for membership interests of our equity partner in two of our Norfolk, Virginia properties to February 2027 from February 2025.\n\n  5. Management has received indicative terms that are favorable to the Company, for both maturing Bayport loans for our Norfolk, Virginia properties, and expects to close by the end of August 2024.\n\n  6. Announced the hiring of CohnReznick as our company's independent registered accounting firm, a replacement for Malone Bailey who served us well up until this point of our growth.\n\n\n\n\nWith these recent accomplishments, we can now claim the following:\n\n  * We currently have 100% rent collection from our leased properties.\n\n  * Our company's net operating income (NOI) is derived from approximately 68% investment grade tenants.\n\n  * Occupancy has increased to 93%. \n\n\n\n\nDespite any of the economic headwinds that we've been receiving, we need to emphatically tell you that we believe our portfolio is strong, performing as planned, rent is being collected and our company is stable. You can see that we continue to accomplish a lot as it relates to our current portfolio but where do we go from here?\n\nPost Dividend Suspension\n\nAs I have said in the past , you're going to get honest and frank information from me; the good and the bad. In July, our Board of Directors made the decision to suspend our dividend to conserve cash during what we continue to expect will be a tumultuous economic period, as evidenced by the August 5, 2024, market crash. The economic \"pull-back\" that we're witnessing, and which seems to be increasing, has only reassured me that our proactive course of action will put our company in a position to take advantage of growth opportunities that present themselves.\n\nHowever, since suspending our dividend, our company's stock price has drastically declined to an all-time low, which I believe is severely below its intrinsic value. We suspended our dividend because we believe it is the right strategy for long-term value creation and sustainability. It should also be noted that we're not the only REIT suspending or reducing dividends in this market. But if the dividend is the sole reason someone has invested in GIPR, then I understand their dissatisfaction during this temporary period. Don't get me wrong, I too like when a company is able to pay a sustainable dividend, but I have a much different view of our company than immediate income. I continue to choose to invest in GIPR because I believe our company is one of the few public net lease REITs that can provide meaningful growth in a fairly stable industry.\n\nMy goal is to build a company that is not simply stable but that can be transformative for long-term growth. Stability is not growth. Stability is not implementing ingenuities. We have to think differently than our much larger peers. That is why we target short-term, investment grade tenanted net lease assets in strong markets around the country. We purchase assets that most other investors don't and then we spend a tremendous amount of time and relational capital to increase the lease term, renew leases, re-tenant properties at higher rents and create value that is normally not prevalent with the net lease industry. I hope you look at some of our case studies to see how we've repeatedly done this for several of our assets.\n\nThere are many other companies that can provide you with a stable dividend, but I expect that most analysts would argue that growth in those institutions is much more challenging than the possibility that GIPR gives shareholders.\n\nHowever, you're probably wondering when we can reverse our dividend decision. That discussion includes the necessary steps to reinstating our dividend when the time comes. I wish I could give you a specific time that will occur, but I can't because I do not know. However, I can assure you that the decision will be based on an amalgamation of economic policy decisions, portfolio growth, cost of capital congruent with a fully covered dividend and other factors that go into the discussion of increasing the health of our organization.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nOur goal remains the same, to provide long-term growth for our investors and be able to pay a 100% covered dividend. Our commitment to you is that we will strive to make decisions that show a clear tie to making those goals a reality in as short a time frame as possible. We're closely monitoring this dislocated market, and I am happy to announce that pricing for the assets we target is finally falling into our favor which is a benefit to everyone involved in our company.\n\nWe will continue to communicate with you, continue to be patient when the market calls for patience, continue to take calculated risks for the benefit of our shareholders and endeavor to grow GIPR for your generations.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDavid Sobelman\n\n**About Generation Income Properties**\n\nGeneration Income Properties, Inc., located in Tampa, Florida, is an internally managed real estate investment trust formed to acquire and own, directly and jointly, real estate investments focused on retail, office, and industrial net lease properties in densely populated submarkets.

Words such as \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" and \"project\" and other similar words and expressions are intended to signify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future results and conditions but rather are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Such statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. Investors are cautioned that there can be no assurance actual results or business conditions will not differ materially from those projected or suggested in such forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. Please refer to the risks detailed from time to time in the reports we file with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on April 8, 2024, as well as other filings on Form 10-Q and periodic filings on Form 8-K, for additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated or implied by such forward-looking statements. We disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, unless required by law._\n\n**Notice Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nIn addition to our reported results and net earnings per diluted share, which are financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP, this press release contains and may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including Funds from Operations (\"FFO\"), Core Funds From Operations (\"Core FFO\"), Adjusted Funds from Operations (\"AFFO\"), Core Adjusted Funds from Operations (\"Core AFFO\"), and Net Operating Income (\"NOI\"). We believe the use of Core FFO, Core AFFO and NOI are useful to investors because they are widely accepted industry measures used by analysts and investors to compare the operating performance of REITs. FFO and related measures, including NOI, should not be considered alternatives to net income as a performance measure or to cash flows from operations, as reported on our statement of cash flows, or as a liquidity measure, and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures. You should not consider our Core FFO, Core AFFO, or NOI as an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP. Our reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and statements of why management believes these measures are useful to investors are included below.\n\n**Consolidated Balance Sheets** **(Unaudited)**\n\n**As of June 30,** |  **As of December 31,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** |  **2023**  \n**_Assets_**  \n**Investment in real estate**  \nLand |  $ |  21,236,021 |  $ |  21,996,902  \nBuilding and site improvements |  64,800,757 |  71,621,499  \nAcquired tenant improvements |  2,072,205 |  2,072,205  \nAcquired lease intangible assets |  9,927,046 |  10,571,331  \nLess: accumulated depreciation and amortization |  (9,900,184 |  ) |  (8,855,332 |  )  \nNet real estate investments |  88,135,845 |  97,406,605  \nCash and cash equivalents |  2,553,234 |  3,117,446  \nRestricted cash |  34,500 |  34,500  \nDeferred rent asset |  392,795 |  1,106,191  \nPrepaid expenses |  367,331 |  139,941  \nPrepaid guaranty fees - related party |  96,360 |  -  \nAccounts receivable |  266,834 |  241,166  \nEscrow deposits and other assets |  775,351 |  493,393  \nHeld for sale assets |  5,750,250 |  -  \nRight of use asset, net |  6,121,340 |  6,152,174  \n**Total Assets** |  **$** |  **104,493,840** |  **$** |  **108,691,416**  \n**_Liabilities and Equity_**  \n**Liabilities**  \nAccounts payable |  $ |  328,725 |  $ |  406,772  \nAccrued expenses |  862,986 |  688,146  \nAccrued expense - related party |  683,347 |  683,347  \nAcquired lease intangible liabilities, net |  948,290 |  1,016,260  \nInsurance payable |  260,182 |  34,966  \nDeferred rent liability |  180,168 |  260,942  \nLease liability, net |  6,439,175 |  6,415,041  \nOther payable - related party |  904,920 |  1,809,840  \nLoan payable - related party |  5,500,000 |  5,500,000  \nMortgage loans, net of unamortized debt discount of $1,230,802 and $1,326,362 at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and debt issuance costs |  56,273,271 |  56,817,310  \nDerivative liabilities |  119,029 |  537,424  \nTotal liabilities |  72,500,093 |  74,170,048  \n**Redeemable Non-Controlling Interests** |  22,527,046 |  18,812,423  \n**Preferred Stock - Series A Redeemable Preferred stock, net,**  \n$0.01 par value, 2,400,000 shares authorized, issued, and outstanding at December 31, 2023 with liquidation preferences of $5 per share and no shares authorized or issued in 2022 |  - |  11,637,616  \n**Stockholders' Equity**  \nCommon stock, $0.01 par value, 100,000,000 shares authorized; 5,419,855 and 2,620,707 shares issued and outstanding at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively |  54,232 |  26,207  \nAdditional paid-in capital |  29,034,608 |  18,472,049  \nAccumulated deficit |  (20,015,000 |  ) |  (14,833,058 |  )  \nTotal Generation Income Properties, Inc.

Basic & Diluted** |  **5,433,833** |  **2,615,471** |  **4,923,004** |  **2,578,678**  \n  \nOur reported results are presented in accordance with GAAP. We also disclose funds from operations (\"FFO\"), adjusted funds from operations (\"AFFO\"), core funds from operations (\"Core FFO\") and core adjusted funds of operations (\"Core AFFO\") all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they are widely accepted industry measures used by analysts and investors to compare the operating performance of REITs.\n\nFFO and related measures do not represent cash generated from operating activities and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements; accordingly, they should not be considered alternatives to net income or loss as a performance measure or cash flows from operations as reported on our statement of cash flows as a liquidity measure and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures.\n\nWe compute FFO in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\"). NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude extraordinary items (as defined by GAAP), net gains from sales of depreciable real estate assets, impairment write-downs associated with depreciable real estate assets, and real estate related depreciation and amortization, including the pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries. We then adjust FFO for non-cash revenues and expenses such as amortization of deferred financing costs, above and below market lease intangible amortization, straight line rent adjustment where the Company is both the lessor and lessee, and non-cash stock compensation to calculate Core AFFO.\n\nFFO is used by management, investors, and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers primarily because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions. We believe that AFFO is an additional useful supplemental measure for investors to consider because it will help them to better assess our operating performance without the distortions created by other non-cash revenues or expenses. FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. We believe that Core FFO and Core AFFO are useful measures for management and investors because they further remove the effect of non-cash expenses and certain other expenses that are not directly related to real estate operations. We use each as measures of our performance when we formulate corporate goals.\n\nAs FFO excludes depreciation and amortization, gains and losses from property dispositions that are available for distribution to stockholders and extraordinary items, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses and interest costs, providing a perspective not immediately apparent from net income or loss. However, FFO should not be viewed as an alternative measure of our operating performance since it does not reflect either depreciation and amortization costs or the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties which could be significant economic costs and could materially impact our results from operations. Additionally, FFO does not reflect distributions paid to redeemable non-controlling interests.\n\n**_Investor Contacts_**\n\nInvestor Relationsir@gipreit.com\n\n**SOURCE:** Generation Income Properties\n\nView the original [press release](https://www.accesswire.com/901936/generation-income-properties-announces-second-quarter-2024-financial-and-operating-results) on accesswire.com \n\nReleased August 15, 2024\n\n  * [Email Alerts](/news-events/email-alerts)\n  * [Company Profile](/company-information)\n  * [Contacts](/company-information/contacts)\n  * [RSS News Feed](https://ir.gipreit.com/news-events/press-releases/rss \"Opens in a new window\")\n\n\n\n#### We keep a **generational** outlook in mind.

It's easy to convey a good-news message to anyone at any time, but it's better stewardship to be able to provide accountability and service when delivering the more challenging news.\n\nI have made a concerted effort to develop and foster peer-to-peer relationships with my net lease REIT CEO counterparts and to communicate regularly with industry insiders to \"trade notes\" on what is happening in today's markets. To be frank, we're all experiencing the same thing; high interest rates, smaller spreads between the interest rates and acquisition cap rates, push-back from the capital markets, raising less or no new capital and not seeing an end to the dislocation between buyers and sellers. Overall, it's just a tough market.\n\nDespite our collective challenges, our company's portfolio is performing as planned, rent collection is at 100%, and we continue to maintain direct communication with our tenants to gain intelligence on their companies as well as their performance at our locations. We have signed new leases with credit-worthy tenants, and we have extended leases with incumbent companies who are performing well at our locations.\n\nAdditionally, we remain comfortable with our in-place leverage at lower loan-to-value ratios (LTVs) and fixed interest rates, and we have been maintaining and growing our lender relationships with the understanding that our platform is one that is conservative and has a large growth potential. However, with national economic pressures usually comes challenging market conditions and we believe we should proactively prepare for bumpy roads ahead.\n\nDividend\n\nWe're closely monitoring the economic data and we are witnessing fallout in various forms within our industry and our economy. The subsequent consequences are that many of our colleagues within our industry are either leaving their long-held roles or involuntarily being laid off, which is a dynamic that we're paying particularly close attention to. Additionally, some retailers have announced major store closings for large portions of their operating locations, as they are disclosing that their financial pressures are too much to bear. Thankfully, we believe that GIPR is well-positioned to weather these challenging markets in light of our efficient use of human capital resources and our management team's focus on positioning our company for substantial growth.\n\nHowever, out of an abundance of caution, our Board of Directors, has determined that it is in the best interest of our company and its shareholders to temporarily suspend the company's dividend in order to employ the capital to sustain our company's growth trajectory during this challenging economic market environment.\n\nConserving our cash, which we estimate will equate to roughly $2.54 million annualized, will afford us the opportunity to make strategic acquisitions that can positively impact our long-term growth. We have always made growth and profitability a priority for you and with the challenging capital markets, we believe that we can weather this period better by taking these near-term steps. While it is not anticipated that any dividend distributions will be required this year in order to maintain our status as a REIT, if any such dividends are required, we expect to make the required distributions in a timely manner in order to maintain REIT status.\n\nYour Company's Intrinsic Value\n\nYou should know that REITs are traditionally valued, on a per share basis, differently than more common non-real estate companies. The calculation of our net asset value per share (NAV/share) is a measure that is used to determine value regardless of what we pay out in the form of a dividend. Personally, while I understand the dividend is important to most investors, I put more emphasis on the underlying value of our company's assets, which I believe is a better indicator of the true valuation of our company. To put it simply, we are a company that owns and operates real estate. At March 31, 2024, our company's portfolio was conservatively encumbered by debt at approximately 60% of book value, preferred equity at approximately 16% of book value, and your equity ownership of the portfolio at approximately 24% of book value.\n\nBased on the foregoing and a portfolio book value of approximately $105 million at the company's quarter ended March 31, 2023, GIPRs common shareholder equity was approximately $25 million as of such date. With 5,422,155 shares outstanding as of March 31, 2024, our NAV per share was $4.63. Our thesis is based on purchasing undervalued real estate assets at a discount and realizing the inherent value in those assets by increasing the weighted average lease term (WALT) through renewals and effective management of the assets, which we continually prove that we are accomplishing.\n\nFor example, we purchased a Dollar Tree (Nasdaq: DLTR, S&P: BBB) in Morrow, GA last year with two years remaining on the lease for a going in cap rate of 7.55% (annualized base rent ($103,607)/purchase price ($1,372,278)). Upon taking ownership, we worked with Dollar Tree's corporate real estate team to execute an early lease extension, which gave us a now 6-year remaining lease term. This decreased the cap rate of the asset to approximately 6.5%, from 7.55%, based on current market comparables and therefore has added inherent value to the portfolio that is not reflected in our cost basis. In essence, we estimate that we increased the value of that asset by about $300,000 or roughly 25%.\n\nTherefore, as the above demonstrates, we have continued to extend and renew leases in our portfolio, recognize rental rate increases, and effectively manage both the properties and leases under our ownership, which we believe has led to an appreciation in value for our portfolio that is not reflected in the current book value reported on our company's balance sheet. So, while you may be able to extrapolate an NAV/share value from the company's financial statements based on historical cost, we believe there is inherent value being built day to day in the portfolio that far exceeds that NAV/share price, which will continue to grow as we effectively manage the portfolio and market conditions stabilize.\n\nAn Emphasis on \"WHY\"\n\nAll of this to say, while the dividend may for many of you be the driving motivation behind your investment in GIPR, you should know that we believe the inherent value of the real estate portfolio underlying your investment far exceeds what is reflected in the current share price and such value is not impacted by dividend policies nor daily public market fluctuations. In essence, the dividend does not impact the calculation of the intrinsic value of GIPR's real estate assets.\n\nThese are tough decisions that we have contemplated for some time, but we had to evaluate all our options and while we have enough cash on hand to pay a dividend through the end of fiscal 2024, I expect that the impetus behind investing in GIPR was not to have your investment used to simply pay cash back to you. Building a portfolio that produces stable income and having that cash flow translate to a stable dividend that can grow over time has been, and remains, the focus for our entire team. We have taken the decision to focus on long-term growth for our company, your equity and ultimately the dividend rather than paying out an inflated return that, to be frank, is not currently sustainable over the long-term or financially responsible.\n\nWhat We're Doing in the Meantime\n\nWe are not \"sitting on our hands\" to wait for the markets to be more in our favor…quite the contrary. We are actively growing, repositioning different aspects of capital and operations and preparing to go \"all-in\" when appropriate. Below is an outline of some of the work we've done in the second quarter and in the near-term:\n\n  * Capital Infusion\n\n  \n---  \nWe signed an agreement and successfully funded a capital contribution to the company of $2.5 million. This money is currently in our operating account and will allow us to build on our cash balance as well as continue to structure acquisitions for future growth.  \n  \n  * Debt extension\n\n  \nWe have some debt coming due at the end of 2024 and we are in active conversations with the lender to extend the debt to be commensurate with our current lease durations at the properties securing the debt, which have over 4 years remaining.  \n  \n  * Acquisitions\n\n  \nWe are in active conversations on several acquisition opportunities of various sizes and structures that we hope to be able to share with the market in the near term to not only give you a look behind the curtain on our day-to-day work in the company but to show the opportunities we are continuing to be able to uncover in this challenging market.  \n  \n  * Industry Outreach\n\n  \nGIPR was invited by the New York Stock Exchange to attend a meeting that they hosted focused on the issues pertaining to REITs in today's current market environment. Additionally, while in NY, we attended the National Association for Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) conference where we were able to sit down with six different investment banks and lenders to discuss growth opportunities for our company.  \n  \nOur Plan Going Forward\n\nGIPR is currently in various stages of conversations with landlords, tenants, capital providers, lenders, and investment banks that are part of the different aspects of the growth of GIPR. While we are always open to adding to our portfolio, even at one property at a time, it is clear our time is better spent working on larger portfolio transactions, as we did in 2023, to add scale to the portfolio as well as garner better pricing due to economies of scale.\n\nMethods of growth that we plan to use during this period where markets are challenging are:\n\n  * Portfolio Acquisitions\n\n  * Portfolio Contributions (UPREITs)\n\n  * Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nIf you can imagine an endurance athlete in an athletic event, they've probably experienced a level of struggle that made them have a talk with themself to decide whether they could go beyond what is comfortable. That \"dark place\" where their brain is sending the signals that there is physiological pain being inflicted is ultimately forcing them into a choice. The decision comes down to them and they must contemplate some semblance of, \"will you choose to continue to endure the pain for an indeterminant amount of time? And if so, can you withstand that pain long enough to suddenly look up and realize that you've reached the finish line?\"\n\nFor GIPR, there is no \"finish line\" but I drive the culture to express to our team that I hope we are consistently in an uncomfortable place. The mindset that \"when things get challenging, you embrace the challenge!\" This is where we are today. This will get us through this period.\n\nOur service to you, our shareholders, is to find every avenue to make this company as successful as possible. With our mission \"To improve the lives of all stakeholders for generations\" at the forefront of our efforts, we are looking forward to getting beyond this period, but embracing the challenges until that day comes.\n\nThank you,\n\n![](https://www.accesswire.com/imagelibrary/cec55988-3f11-4a9b-be2b-4114ab70e435/885000/picture1.png)\n\nDave\n\n**About Generation Income Properties**\n\nGeneration Income Properties, Inc., located in Tampa, Florida, is an internally managed real estate investment trust formed to acquire and own, directly and jointly, real estate investments focused on retail, office and industrial net lease properties located primarily in densely populated submarkets throughout the United States.

Per Northmarq there is an approximate 75\n03\nbasis point discount between net lease assets with 5 years or less remaining in lease term\nversus 10 years or more remaining\nGIPR looks to take advantage of both market opportunity and basis point spread by\n04\nacquiring shorter term leased assets at a discount and renewing and extending leases to\nlead to effectively 10 year plus lease terms\n07\nC U R R E N T B U Y I N G O P P O R T U N I T I E S\nGIPR anticipates that market dynamics in 2025 and 2026 will create more favorable\n01 buying opportunities. The following data highlights three critical factors influencing the\ntransaction market: transaction volume, trends in cap rates, and trends in interest rates.\nTraditionally, transaction volumes have remained high, cap rates have stayed low,\nindicating that net lease properties have been trading at a premium, and interest rates\n02 have reached historic lows. However, due to Federal Reserve policies, interest rates rose\nsharply between 2022 and 2024, resulting in a slowdown in transaction volumes and a\ngradual increase in cap rates.\nThe latest data suggests that the market is beginning to recalibrate toward a more\nfavorable buying environment, with cap rates stabilizing at higher levels and interest rates\n03\ndecreasing. This shift may lead to a positive basis point spread between cap rates and the\ncost of capital, signaling promising investment opportunities ahead.\nSee the graph on the following page for illustration\n04\n08\nC U R R E N T B U Y I N G O P P O R T U N I T I E S\n2021 2022-2024 2025\nHigh transaction volume Decreasing transaction volume Low transaction volume\nLow cap rates Slowly increasing cap rates Sustained high cap rates\nLow cost of capital Rapidly increasing cost of capital Decreasing cost of capital\nBuying opportunity for GIPR Patient and disciplined GIPR investing Greater buying opportunity for GIPR\n09\nG I P R T H E S I S V A L I D A T E D - E X A M P L E S O F 2 0 2 4\nFresenius Medical Care Dollar Tree Armed Services YMCA\nChicago, IL Morrow, GA Norfolk, VA\nAcquisition Details: Acquisition Details: Acquisition Details:\nPurchase Price: $3,100,000 Purchase Price: $1,372,278 Purchase Price: $11,800,000\n7.24% cap rate 7.55% cap rate Annual Gross Rent: $1,237,111\n2 LYR Leased by two Investment Grade Credit\nExtension Details: $103,607 NOI Tenants:\nSeven-Year Extension United States General Service Admin., &\nExtension Details: Maersk Line Limited\nFive-Year Extension\nNew Value: New Value: New Tenant/ Lease Details:\nThe lease extension brought the total Lease extension brought the total remaining GIPR overcame MAERSK Line Limited vacating\nremaining lease term for this Fresenius lease term for this Dollar Tree property to the property (approximately 35,000 SF) to re-\nproperty to nine (9) years.
