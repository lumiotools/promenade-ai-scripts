Through nine months, we have experienced less than 0.01% annualized net charge offs, demonstrating strong performance in asset quality. With 7.2% annualized revenue growth within the quarter and 2.5% annualized expense growth, annualized operating leverage for the third quarter was 4.7%, demonstrating the benefit of an ongoing restraint on expenses. \n\nMost importantly, we have seen a 10.7% improvement in tangible book value year over year and 6.9% growth since the end of 2023. \n\nWith another solid quarter now behind us, we are also pleased to announce that the Board has authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share of common stock, which was declared at its meeting on October 23, 2024, payable on November 25, 2024, to shareholders of record as of November 8, 2024.\" \n\nNet Interest Income\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income was $40.2 million compared to net interest income of $38.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, and $37.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The tax-equivalent net interest margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.13% compared to 3.12% and 3.16% for the second quarter of 2024 and third quarter of 2023, respectively, representing a 1 basis point (\"bp\") increase from the second quarter of 2024, and a 3 bp decrease compared to the same period in 2023. \n\nThe yield on interest-earning assets increased to 5.73% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, from 5.69% for the three months ended June 30, 2024, and 5.35% for the three months ended September 30, 2023. These increases were due to assets continuing to reprice at higher rates during the third quarter of 2024, continued discipline on new loan pricing, and an increase in the average balance of Fed Funds Sold. \n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income increased 4.9% to $115.4 million compared to net interest income of $110.0 million for the same period of 2023. The increase was primarily due to a $40.7 million increase in interest income on loans, offset by a $32.0 million increase in interest expense on deposits compared to the same period of 2023. \n\nAverage Balances\n\nAverage loans increased $52.6 million to $4.4 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $4.4 billion for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and $4.1 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. \n\nAverage deposits were $4.6 billion for the third quarter of 2024, reflecting an increase of $146.0 million, or 3.3%, compared to total average deposits of $4.5 billion in the second quarter of 2024, and an increase of $236.6 million, or 5.4%, compared to total average deposits of $4.4 billion for the third quarter of 2023. Average balances were impacted by the acquisition of Brunswick Bancorp in the second quarter of 2023. The average cost of deposits was 2.66% for the third quarter of 2024, representing a 12 bp increase and a 48 bp increase from the second quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023, respectively. The Bank continues to face headwinds with respect to deposit pricing, given increased interest rates and competition for deposits across all product types. Our primary focus with respect to deposit strategy is stability, ensuring that our rates are competitive, and our product mix satisfies the needs of our customers. Additionally, the Bank also maintains interest rate swaps to hedge the cash flows associated with existing brokered CDs to mitigate the impact of rising deposit costs. Cost of funds increased to 2.77%, compared to 2.74% for the second quarter of 2024, as the Bank continued to experience strong deposit growth. \n\nTotal deposits increased $209.8 million to $4.7 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, or 18.6% (annualized), compared to $4.5 billion and $4.4 billion at June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase during the third quarter of 2024 was primarily related to a $93.8 million increase in interest bearing deposits, and an increase of $90.0 million in time deposits. Time deposits represented 34.2% of total deposits at June 30, 2024, compared to 34.5% at September 30, 2024. The balance of non-interest-bearing deposits increased $26.0 million from the second quarter of 2024, representing approximately 16.8% of total deposits at September 30, 2024, compared to 17.0% at June 30, 2024, and 18.3% at September 30, 2023. The average duration of the non-hedged time deposit portfolio was 12 months at September 30, 2024. \n\nAsset Quality\n\nThe total provision for credit losses, including provision for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures, was $516 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of $1.1 million compared to the provision for credit losses of $1.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, and a $1.6 million decrease compared to the provision for credit losses of $2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was driven by a combination of a decreased reserve on individually evaluated loans and decreases in loss rates across multiple segments of the portfolio. Net charge-offs for the three months ended September 30, 2024, were $347 thousand or less than 0.008% of total loans. \n\nThe provision for credit losses on loans was $1.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of $1.3 million compared to the provision for credit losses of $3.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, is primarily due to a decrease in loss factors across all portfolios. The benefit for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures was $601 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net charge-offs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were $409 thousand or 0.009% of total loans. \n\nAllowance for credit losses - loans was 0.80% of loans, net of unearned income at September 30, 2024, compared to 0.81% and 0.82% at June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. \n\nTotal nonperforming assets were $17.7 million at September 30, 2024, compared to nonperforming assets of $10.4 million and $14.4 million at June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase during the third quarter of 2024 primarily related to the addition of one commercial property with a balance of $7.7 million, being placed on nonaccrual in the third quarter of 2024. Delinquency, measured as loans past due 30 days or more, as a percentage of total loans was 0.61% at September 30, 2024, compared to .57% and .46% as of June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. \n\nCapital\n\nShareholders’ equity increased $30.7 million, or 5.7%, from $542.4 million as of December 31, 2023 to $573.1 million as of September 30, 2024. Retained earnings increased $9.0 million, or 5.5%, from $163.3 million as of June 30, 2024 to $172.2 million as of September 30, 2024. Regulatory capital ratios for both Mid Penn and the Bank indicate regulatory capital levels in excess of both the regulatory minimums and the levels necessary for the Bank to be considered \"well capitalized\" at September 30, 2024. Additionally, Mid Penn declared $3.3 million in dividends during the third quarter of 2024. \n\nOn April 24, 2024, Mid Penn’s Board of Directors reauthorized its treasury stock repurchase program (\"Program\") effective through April 24, 2025. The Program authorizes the repurchase of up to $15.0 million of Mid Penn’s outstanding common stock. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Mid Penn repurchased 15,500 shares of common stock at an average price of $20.81. As of September 30, 2024, Mid Penn repurchased a total of 440,722 shares of common stock at an average price of $22.78 per share under the Program. The Program had approximately $5.0 million remaining available for repurchase as of September 30, 2024. \n\nNoninterest Income\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, noninterest income totaled $5.2 million, a decrease of $151 thousand, or 2.8%, compared to noninterest income of $5.3 million for the second quarter of 2024. The decrease is primarily due to a $416 thousand decrease in other miscellaneous noninterest income, driven by a $482 thousand decrease in Bank owned life insurance benefits received, partially offset by a $140 thousand increase in mortgage banking income, a $76 thousand increase in the gain on sales of SBA loans, and a $74 thousand increase in income from Fiduciary activities. \n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, noninterest income totaled $16.3 million, an increase of $1.5 million, or 9.8%, compared to noninterest income of $14.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in noninterest income is primarily driven by a $1.0 million increase in other miscellaneous noninterest income, driven by increases in Bank owned life insurance benefits received, and a $767 thousand increase in Mortgage Banking income. \n\nNoninterest Expense\n\nTotal noninterest expense increased $1.7 million to $30.0 million in the third quarter of 2024 from $28.2 million in the second quarter of 2024. The increase was driven by a $924 thousand increase in legal and professional fees, a $700 thousand increase in shares tax, and a $623 thousand increase in salaries and employee benefits, partially offset by a $624 thousand decrease in other miscellaneous noninterest expense. \n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, noninterest expense totaled $86.7 million, a decrease of $3.5 million, or 3.9%, compared to noninterest expense of $90.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by $7.9 million of Brunswick acquisition costs in 2023, partially offset by a $3.0 million increase in salaries and benefits expense, and a $1.0 million increase in legal and professional fees. \n\nThe efficiency ratio (1) was 64.9% in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 63.7% in the second quarter of 2024, and 66.3% in the third quarter of 2023. The change in the efficiency ratio during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024 was the result of higher net interest income and slightly higher noninterest expense, partially offset by lower noninterest income driven by a decrease in Bank owned life insurance benefits received . Mid Penn continues to evaluate levels of noninterest expense for opportunities to reduce operating costs throughout the organization. \n\nSubsequent Events\n\nManagement considers subsequent events occurring after the balance sheet date for matters which may require adjustment to, or disclosure in, the consolidated financial statements.

determined by methods other than in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"). Mid Penn’s management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in their analysis of Mid Penn’s performance. For tangible book value, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is book value. We believe that this measure is important to many investors in the marketplace who are interested in changes from period to period in book value per common share exclusive of changes in intangible assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets have the effect of increasing total book value while not increasing tangible book value. Income tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments are calculated using the applicable statutory tax rate for the jurisdictions in which the charges (benefits) are incurred, while taking into consideration any valuation allowances or non-deductible portions of the non-GAAP adjustments. Adjusted earnings per common share excludes from income available to common shareholders certain expenses related to significant non-core activities, including merger-related expenses, net of income taxes. For return on average tangible common equity, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is return on average equity. The efficiency ratio is often used by management to measure its noninterest expense as a percentage of its revenue. This non-GAAP disclosure has limitations as an analytical tool, should not be viewed as a substitute for financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of Mid Penn’s results and financial condition as reported under GAAP, nor is it necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies.

Reports Second Quarter Earnings Beat and Declares 55th Consecutive Quarterly Dividend\n\nCompany Release - 7/24/2024 5:16 PM ET\n\nDownload this Press Release PDF Format (opens in new window)\n\nHARRISBURG, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Mid Penn Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ: MPB) (\"Mid Penn\"), the parent company of Mid Penn Bank (the \"Bank\") and MPB Financial Services, LLC, today reported net income available to common shareholders (\"earnings\") for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, of $11.8 million, or $0.71 per diluted common share, compared to net income of $4.8 million, or $0.29 per diluted common share, for the second quarter of 2023 and consensus estimate of $0.60 per diluted common share. \n\n**_Key Highlights of the Second Quarter of 2024:_**\n\n  * Net income available to common shareholders increased 143.4% to $11.8 million, or $0.71 per diluted common share, for the second quarter of 2024, compared to net income of $4.8 million, or $0.29 per diluted common share, for the second quarter of 2023. Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2024, increased 48.82% to $23.9 million, or $1.44 per diluted common share, compared to $16.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, or $1.00 per diluted common share. \n\n\n  * Loan growth for the second quarter of 2024 was $47.1 million, or 4.4% (annualized), as the Bank continued to execute on its restrained growth strategy in 2024. Total loans increased $330.1 million, or 8.18%, compared to the second quarter of 2023. \n\n\n  * Deposits increased $122.6 million, or 11.3% (annualized), during the second quarter of 2024, compared to $32.9 million, or 3.0% (annualized), during the first quarter of 2024. The increase was driven by a $112.1 million increase in interest bearing accounts, and a $47.7 million increase in time deposits. \n\n\n  * Net interest margin increased to 3.12% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to 2.97% for the first quarter of 2024. Cost of funds held steady at 2.74%, compared to 2.71% for the first quarter of 2024, as the Bank continued to experience strong core deposit growth. \n\n\n  * Book value per common share improved to $33.76 for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to $33.26 and $31.74 for the periods ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively. Tangible book value per common share improved to $25.75 for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to $25.23 and $23.62 for the periods ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively. (1)\n\n\n  * Nonperforming assets decreased $5.1 million, or 33%, compared to the first quarter of 2024. The decrease was primarily due to the sale of one foreclosed property, which resulted in a loss on sale of approximately $26 thousand. \n\n\n  * The Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.20 per common share, payable August 26, 2024, to shareholders of record as of August 9, 2024. \n\n\n\n(1) Non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to the calculation on the section titled “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures” at the end of this document. \n\n“We are pleased to announce the results of our second quarter, detailed within this earnings release, as they are virtually in lockstep with what we have been signaling over the last nine months. That signal has included restrained loan growth, a focus on core deposit growth and a restraint on noninterest expenses,” Chair, President and CEO Rory G. Ritrievi said. “Within this second quarter, our organic loan growth annualized to 4.4%, which is substantially less than the typical double-digit organic loan growth we have experienced in most of our 15+ years together. Through the first six months of 2024, the organic loan growth rate is just over 5% annualized, which falls right at the level we had signaled coming into the year.” \n\nRitrievi continued, “In organic deposit growth, the second quarter exceeded expectations. Within the quarter, we grew deposits on an annualized basis of over 11%, which puts us at over 7% annualized growth through the first six months of the year. Again, this is right in line with our plan. Core deposit growth has always been a calling card of Mid Penn over our 15 years together and it is great to see that back on track after a challenging 2023. The combination of restrained loan growth and significant core deposit growth helped us to not only stabilize but also grow our net interest margin within the quarter. That is the first such quarterly growth in that metric since rates began to escalate and the interest rate curve became inverted in 2022.” \n\n“From a noninterest expense standpoint, we decreased our level of expenses within the second quarter at a rate of approximately 4% annualized. Our second quarter 2024 expense run rate was lower than it was in each of the previous four quarters, a great sign for efficiency ratio improvement,\" Ritrievi added. \"The best part of the quarter, however, was our continued strength in asset (loan) quality. Non performing assets decreased 33% within the quarter while our net charge off ratio improved to 0.002% and the coverage ratio improved to 353%. All great signs heading into the last six months of the year.” \n\nRitrievi concluded, \"With all of that in mind, the Board has authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share of common stock, which was declared at its meeting on July 24, 2024, payable on August 26, 2024, to shareholders of record as of August 9, 2024, which we feel allows us to meaningfully share our success while retaining enough profitability to bolster capital ratios and continue to navigate this difficult operating environment.\" \n\nNet Interest Income\n\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2024, net interest income was $38.8 million compared to net interest income of $36.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and $36.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The tax-equivalent net interest margin for the three months ended June 30, 2024 was 3.12% compared to 2.98% and 3.31% for the first quarter of 2024, and second quarter of 2023, respectively, representing a 15 basis point (\"bp\") increase to the first quarter of 2024, and a 17 bp decrease compared to the same period in 2023. \n\nThe yield on interest-earning assets increased to 5.69% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, from 5.51% for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and 5.08% for the three months ended June 30, 2023. These increases were due to assets continuing to reprice at higher rates during the second quarter of 2024, continued discipline on new loan pricing, and an increase in Fed funds sold. \n\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, net interest income increased 3.8% to $75.2 million compared to net interest income for the same period of 2023. \n\nAverage Balances\n\nAverage loans increased $59.5 million to $4.4 billion for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to $4.3 billion for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, and $3.8 billion for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. Loan growth for the second quarter of 2024 was $47.1 million, or 4.4% (annualized) as the Bank continued to execute on its restrained growth strategy in 2024. \n\nAverage deposits were $4.5 billion for the second quarter of 2024, reflecting an increase of $139.6 million, or 3.2%, compared to total average deposits of $4.3 billion in the first quarter of 2024, and an increase of $394.1 million, or 9.7%, compared to total average deposits of $4.1 billion for the second quarter of 2023. Average balances were impacted by the acquisition of Brunswick Bancorp in the second quarter of 2023. The average cost of deposits was 2.57% for the second quarter of 2024, representing a 12 bp increase and an 79 bp increase from the first quarter of 2024 and the second quarter of 2023, respectively. The Bank continues to face headwinds with respect to deposit pricing, given increased interest rates and competition for deposits across all product types. Our primary focus with respect to deposit strategy is stability, ensuring that our rates are competitive, and our product mix satisfies the needs of our customers. Additionally, Mid Penn also maintains interest rate swaps to hedge the cash flows associated with existing brokered CDs to mitigate the impact of rising deposit costs. Cost of funds held steady at 2.74%, compared to 2.71% for the first quarter of 2024, as the Bank continued to experience strong deposit growth. \n\nDeposits increased $122.6 million, or 11.3% (annualized) to $4.5 billion as of June 30, 2024, compared to $4.4 billion and $4.3 billion at March 31, 2024, and June 30, 2023, respectively. The increase during the second quarter of 2024 was primarily related to a $112.1 million increase in interest bearing deposits, and an increase of $47.7 million in time deposits. Time deposits represented 34.0% of total deposits at March 31, 2024, compared to 34.1% at June 30, 2024. The mix of non-interest-bearing deposits decreased $30.6 million from the first quarter of 2024, representing approximately 17.1% of total deposits at June 30, 2024, compared to 18.4% at March 31, 2024, and 19.2% at June 30, 2023. The average duration of the non-hedged time deposit portfolio was 12 months at June 30, 2024. \n\nAsset Quality\n\nThe total provision for credit losses, including provision for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures, was $1.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, an increase of $2.5 million compared to the benefit for credit losses of $(937) thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and a $46 thousand increase compared to the provision for credit losses of $1.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. This increase in provision was driven by a combination of loan growth over the quarter and forecast-driven increases in loss rates across multiple segments of the portfolio. Net charge-offs for the three months ended June 30, 2024, were $18 thousand or less than .001% of total loans. \n\nThe provision for credit losses on loans was $1.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, a decrease of $484 thousand compared to the provision for credit losses of $1.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease in provision for the six months ended June 30, 2024, is primarily due to a decrease in loss factors across all portfolios. The benefit for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures was $497 thousand for the six months ended June 30, 2024. Net charge-offs for the six months ended June 30, 2024, were $62 thousand or 0.001% of total loans. \n\nAllowance for credit losses - loans was 0.81% of loans, net of unearned interest at June 30, 2024, compared to 0.78% and 0.81% at March 31, 2024, and June 30, 2023, respectively. \n\nTotal nonperforming assets were $10.4 million at June 30, 2024, compared to nonperforming assets of $15.5 million and $16.3 million at March 31, 2024, and June 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease during the second quarter of 2024 primarily related to the sale of one large property placed in OREO in the first quarter of 2024. Delinquency as a percentage of total loans was 0.57% at June 30, 2024. \n\nCapital\n\nShareholders’ equity increased $17.3 million, or 3.2%, from $542.4 million as of December 31, 2023 to $559.7 million as of June 30, 2024. Retained earnings increased $17.3 million, or 11.8%, from $154.8 million as of March 31, 2024, to $163.3 million as of June 30, 2024. Regulatory capital ratios for both Mid Penn and its banking subsidiary indicate regulatory capital levels in excess of both the regulatory minimums and the levels necessary for the Bank to be considered \"well capitalized\" at June 30, 2024. Additionally, Mid Penn declared $3.3 million in dividends during the second quarter of 2024. \n\nOn April 24, 2024, Mid Penn’s Board of Directors reauthorized its treasury stock repurchase program (\"Program\") effective through April 24, 2025. The Program authorizes the repurchase of up to $15.0 million of Mid Penn’s outstanding common stock. During the six months ended June 30, 2024, Mid Penn has repurchased 15,500 shares of common stock at an average price of $20.81. As of June 30, 2024, Mid Penn repurchased 440,722 shares of common stock at an average price of $22.78 per share under the Program. The Program had approximately $5.0 million remaining available for repurchase as of June 30, 2024. \n\nNoninterest Income\n\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2024, noninterest income totaled $5.3 million, a decrease of $508 thousand, or 8.7%, compared to noninterest income of $5.8 million for the first quarter of 2024. The decrease is primarily due to a $751 thousand decrease in other miscellaneous noninterest income, driven by a decrease in Bank owned life insurance benefits received, partially offset by a $204 thousand increase in mortgage banking income. \n\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, noninterest income totaled $11.2 million, an increase of $1.6 million, or 17.0%, compared to noninterest income of $9.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The increase in noninterest income is primarily due to a $1.5 million increase in other miscellaneous noninterest income. \n\nNoninterest Expense\n\nTotal noninterest expense decreased $296 thousand to $28.2 million in the second quarter of 2024 from $28.5 million in the first quarter of 2024. The decrease was driven by a $873 thousand decrease in shares tax, and a $309 thousand decrease in legal and professional fees, partially offset by a $287 thousand increase in FDIC assessments and $481 thousand increase in other miscellaneous noninterest expense. \n\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, noninterest expense totaled $56.7 million, a decrease of $6.9 million, or 19.7%, compared to noninterest expense of $61.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to $7.9 million of Brunswick acquisition costs in 2023, partially offset by a $506 thousand increase in salaries and benefits expense, also driven by the Brunswick acquisition, and a $548 thousand increase in FDIC charges due to increased assessment rates. \n\nThe efficiency ratio(1) was 63.7% in the second quarter of 2024, compared to 68.8% in the first quarter of 2024, and 64.4% in the second quarter of 2023. The improvement in the efficiency ratio during the second quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2024 was the result of higher net interest income, and lower noninterest expenses. The change from the second quarter of 2023 was driven by the reduction in noninterest expense from the Brunswick acquisition in 2023. Mid Penn continues to evaluate levels of noninterest expense for opportunities to reduce operating costs throughout the organization. \n\nSubsequent Events\n\nManagement considers subsequent events occurring after the balance sheet date for matters which may require adjustment to, or disclosure in, the consolidated financial statements. The review period for subsequent events extends up to and including the filing date of a public company’s consolidated financial statements when filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"). Accordingly, the financial information in this announcement is subject to change. The statements are valid only as of the date hereof and Mid Penn disclaims any obligation to update this information. \n\n(1) Non-GAAP financial measure.

Actual results may differ materially from such forward-looking statements, and no reliance should be placed on any forward-looking statement. Factors that may cause results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, changes in interest rates, spreads on earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and interest rate sensitivity; prepayment speeds, loan originations, credit losses and market values on loans, collateral securing loans, and other assets; sources of liquidity; common shares outstanding; common stock price volatility; fair value of and number of stock-based compensation awards to be issued in future periods; the impact of changes in market values on securities held in Mid Penn’s portfolio; legislation affecting the financial services industry as a whole, and Mid Penn and Mid Penn Bank individually or collectively, including tax legislation; results of the regulatory examination and supervision process and oversight, including changes in monetary policy and capital requirements; changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or regulatory agencies; increasing price and product/service competition by competitors, including new entrants; rapid technological developments and changes; the ability to continue to introduce competitive new products and services on a timely, cost-effective basis; the mix of products/services; containing costs and expenses; governmental and public policy changes; protection and validity of intellectual property rights; reliance on large customers; technological, implementation and cost/financial risks in large, multi-year contracts; the outcome of future litigation and governmental proceedings, including tax-related examinations and other matters; continued availability of financing; the availability of financial resources in the amounts, at the times and on the terms required to support Mid Penn and Mid Penn Bank’s future businesses; material differences in the actual financial results of merger, acquisition and investment activities compared with Mid Penn’s initial expectations, including the full realization of anticipated cost savings and revenue enhancements; the possibility that the anticipated benefits of a transaction are not realized when expected or at all, including as a result of the impact of, or problems arising from, the integration of the two companies or as a result of the strength of the economy and competitive factors in legacy Mid Penn and target markets; diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business operations and opportunities; potential adverse reactions or changes to business or employee relationships, including those resulting from the announcement or completion of a transaction; the ability to complete the integration of Mid Penn and its target successfully; the dilution caused by Mid Penn’s issuance of additional shares of its capital stock in connection with a transaction; and other factors that may affect the future results of Mid Penn. \n\nFor a more detailed description of these and other factors which would affect our results, please see Mid Penn’s filings with the SEC, including those risk factors identified in the \"Risk Factors\" section and elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and subsequent filings with the SEC.

NON-GAAP MEASURES (Unaudited)**\n\nExplanatory note: This press release contains financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"). Mid Penn’s management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in their analysis of Mid Penn’s performance. For tangible book value, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is book value. We believe that this measure is important to many investors in the marketplace who are interested in changes from period to period in book value per common share exclusive of changes in intangible assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets have the effect of increasing total book value while not increasing tangible book value. Income tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments are calculated using the applicable statutory tax rate for the jurisdictions in which the charges (benefits) are incurred, while taking into consideration any valuation allowances or non-deductible portions of the non-GAAP adjustments. Adjusted earnings per common share excludes from income available to common shareholders certain expenses related to significant non-core activities, including merger-related expenses, net of income taxes. For return on average tangible common equity, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is return on average equity. The efficiency ratio is often used by management to measure its noninterest expense as a percentage of its revenue. This non-GAAP disclosure has limitations as an analytical tool, should not be viewed as a substitute for financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of Mid Penn’s results and financial condition as reported under GAAP, nor is it necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. Management believes that this non-GAAP supplemental information will be helpful in understanding Mid Penn’s ongoing operating results. This supplemental presentation should not be construed as an inference that Mid Penn’s future results will be unaffected by similar adjustments to be determined in accordance with GAAP.

Reports First Quarter Earnings Beat and Declares 54th Consecutive Quarterly Dividend\n\nCompany Release - 4/24/2024 4:27 PM ET\n\nDownload this Press Release PDF Format (opens in new window)\n\nHARRISBURG, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Mid Penn Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ: MPB) (\"Mid Penn\"), the parent company of Mid Penn Bank (the \"Bank\") and MPB Financial Services, LLC, today reported net income available to common shareholders (\"earnings\") for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, of $12.1 million, or $0.73 per diluted common share, versus analyst consensus of $0.61 per share. \n\n**_Key Highlights of the First Quarter of 2024:_**\n\n  * Loan growth for the first quarter of 2024 was $64.7 million, or 6.1% (annualized). Total loans increased $706.1 million compared to the first quarter of 2023. Excluding the Brunswick loans of $324.5 million acquired in 2023, organic loan growth for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, from the quarter ended March 31, 2023 was $381.6 million or 10.6%. \n\n\n  * Deposits increased $32.9 million, or 3.0% (annualized), for the first quarter of 2024. Organic deposits increased $219.6 million, or 5.7% (excluding Brunswick acquisition deposits in 2023 of $281.4 million) for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2023. \n\n\n  * Net income available to common shareholders increased 0.3% to $12.1 million, or $0.73 per diluted common share, for the first quarter of 2024, compared to net income of $12.1 million, or $0.73 per diluted common share for the fourth quarter of 2023. Net income available to common shareholders increased 8.07% to $12.1 million, or $0.73 per diluted common share, for the first quarter of 2024, compared to net income of $11.2 million, or $0.71 per diluted common share, for the first quarter of 2023. \n\n\n  * Tangible book value per common share increased to $25.23 for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, compared to $24.67 and $24.52 for the periods ended December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023, respectively. \n\n\n  * Return on average assets was 0.92% and return on average equity was 8.94% for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, compared to return on average assets of 0.92% and return on average equity of 8.93% in the fourth quarter of 2023. \n\n\n  * The Board declared a cash dividend of $0.20 per share, payable May 27, 2024, to shareholders of record as of May 10, 2024. \n\n\n\n“With the continuation of the inverted yield curve, persistent escalation in funding costs and additional regional bank asset quality issues, we entered the first quarter expecting a daily fight simply to meet analyst expectations. The team at Mid Penn once again delivered with $0.73 in quarterly EPS, which is almost 20% over consensus estimates. We feel good about those results,” Chair, President and CEO Rory G. Ritrievi said. “In my 4Q23 message, I signaled that we would be cutting operating costs while also significantly slowing down balance sheet growth until the operating environment improved. In reviewing these results, you will see that we accomplished that while also continuing a solid trend in asset quality.” \n\nRitrievi continued, “At the time I am writing this, however, we are already almost a full month into another challenging quarter. While inflation persists, interest rate reductions - which could help normalize the interest rate curve - have been delayed. Now over 500 days inverted, the shape of the interest rate curve is a real concern for positive economic activity. It certainly has an impact on a community bank like Mid Penn, in that our net interest margin remains under considerable pressure. Adding to that concern are significant geopolitical tensions with conflicts in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and beyond, which have a negative economic impact here and abroad.” \n\n“Throughout the current quarter and the rest of the year, Mid Penn will continue to execute the specific strategic plan I outlined three months ago. We will continue our focus on restrained growth while also restraining operating expenses,\" Ritrievi added. \"Our laser focus on asset quality preservation never changes. It is a core tenet of how we do business. Even in the face of significant external trade winds, we are cautiously optimistic that we will continue to build on our first quarter success and ultimately deliver a 2024 performance in line with analysts' expectations.” \n\nFor the first quarter of 2024, the Board is pleased to announce a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share of common stock, which was declared at its meeting on April 24, 2024, payable on May 27, 2024, to shareholders of record as of May 10, 2024. \n\nNet Interest Income\n\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024, net interest income was $36.5 million compared to net interest income of $37.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, and $36.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The tax-equivalent net interest margin for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was 2.97% compared to 3.02% for the fourth quarter of 2023, and 3.49% for the first quarter of 2023, representing a 1 basis point (\"bp\") decrease compared to the prior quarter, and a 53 bp decrease compared to the same period in 2023, primarily driven by higher interest rates resulting from persistent inflation. \n\nThe yield on interest-earning assets increased to 5.51% for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, from 5.35% for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, and 4.86% for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. These increases were due to assets continuing to reprice at higher rates during the first quarter of 2024. Increased yields on interest-earning assets were more than offset by increases in funding costs for the first quarter of 2024, with the overall cost of interest-bearing liabilities increasing to 3.24% during the first quarter of 2024, compared to 3.02% for the three months ended December 31, 2023, and 1.81% for the three months ended March 31, 2023. \n\nAverage Balances\n\nAverage loans increased $92.7 million to $4.3 billion for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, compared to $4.2 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, and $3.6 billion for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. Average deposits were $4.3 billion for the first quarter of 2024, reflecting a decrease of $90.5 million, or 2.1%, compared to total average deposits of $4.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023, and an increase of $529.1 million, or 14.0%, compared to total average deposits of $3.8 billion for the first quarter of 2023. Average balances were impacted by the acquisition of Brunswick Bancorp in the second quarter of 2023. The average cost of deposits was 2.46% for the first quarter of 2024, representing a 13 bp increase and a 117 bp increase from the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2023, respectively. The Bank continues to face headwinds with respect to deposit pricing, given increased interest rates and competition for deposits across all product types. Our primary focus with respect to deposit strategy is stability, ensuring that our rates are competitive and our product mix satisfies the needs of our customers. Additionally, Mid Penn also maintains interest rate swaps to hedge the cash flows associated with existing brokered CDs to mitigate the impact of rising deposit costs. \n\nDeposits were $4.4 billion as of March 31, 2024, compared to $4.3 billion and $3.9 billion at December 31, 2023, and March 31, 2023, respectively. The increase during the first quarter of 2024 was primarily related to a $29.9 million increase in time deposits. Time deposits represented 33.6% of total deposits at December 31, 2023, and increased to 34.0% at March 31, 2024. The mix of non-interest-bearing deposits increased $6.5 million from the fourth quarter of 2023, representing approximately 18.4% of total deposits at March 31, 2024, compared to 18.4% at December 31, 2023, 18.3% at September 30, 2023, and 19.2% at June 30, 2023. The average duration of the non-hedged time deposit portfolio was 12 months at March 31, 2024. \n\nAsset Quality\n\nThe total provision for credit losses, including provision for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures, was $(937) thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2024, a decrease of $273 thousand and $1.7 million compared to the provision for credit losses of $(664) thousand and $719 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and the three months ended March 31, 2023, respectively. \n\nThe provision for credit losses on loans was $(619) thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2024, a decrease of $1.1 million compared to the provision for credit losses of $490 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease in provision for the three months ended March 31, 2024, is primarily due to a decrease in loss factors across all portfolios. The provision for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures was $(318) thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2024. Net charge-offs for the three months ended March 31, 2024, were $44 thousand or 0.001% of total loans. \n\nTotal nonperforming assets were $15.5 million at March 31, 2024, compared to nonperforming assets of $14.5 million and $14.2 million at December 31, 2023, and March 31, 2023, respectively. The increase during the first quarter of 2024 primarily related to loans totaling $1.1 million attributable to one relationship placed on non-accrual. Delinquency as a percentage of total loans was 0.38% at March 31, 2024. \n\nCapital\n\nShareholders’ equity increased $8.6 million, or 1.59%, from $542.4 million as of December 31, 2023 to $551.0 million as of March 31, 2024. Retained earnings increased $8.8 million, or 6.04%, from $146.0 million as of December 31, 2023, to $154.8 million as of March 31, 2024. Regulatory capital ratios for both Mid Penn and its banking subsidiary indicate regulatory capital levels in excess of both the regulatory minimums and the levels necessary for the Bank to be considered \"well capitalized\" at March 31, 2024. Additionally, Mid Penn declared $3.3 million in dividends during the first quarter of 2024. \n\nOn April 24, 2024, Mid Penn’s Board of Directors reauthorized its treasury stock repurchase program (\"Program\") effective through April 24, 2025. The Program authorizes the repurchase of up to $15.0 million of Mid Penn’s outstanding common stock. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, Mid Penn has repurchased 15,500 shares of common stock at an average price of $20.81. As of March 31, 2024, Mid Penn repurchased 440,722 shares of common stock at an average price of $22.78 per share under the Program. The Program had approximately $5.0 million remaining available for repurchase as of March 31, 2024. \n\nNoninterest Income\n\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024, noninterest income totaled $5.8 million, an increase of $720 thousand, or 14.1%, compared to noninterest income of $5.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. The increase is primarily due to a $1.2 million increase in other miscellaneous noninterest income, offset by decreases in gains on sales of SBA loans, fiduciary and wealth management, and mortgage hedging income. \n\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024, noninterest income totaled $5.8 million, an increase of $1.5 million, or 34.96%, compared to noninterest income of $4.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase in noninterest income is primarily due to a $1.5 million increase in other miscellaneous noninterest income. \n\nNoninterest Expense\n\nTotal noninterest expense increased $131 thousand to $28.5 million in the first quarter of 2024 from $28.4 million in the prior quarter, driven by a $742 thousand increase in shares tax on stock repurchases, which is due to credits that were received in the fourth quarter of 2023, lowering the expense. Additionally, there was a $345 thousand increase in legal and professional fees, and a $247 thousand increase in salaries and benefits expense, which typically run higher in the first quarter due to payroll taxes and other payroll benefits resetting, offset by expected decreases in other noninterest expenses, due to corporate efforts to reduce operating costs. \n\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024, noninterest expense totaled $28.5 million, an increase of $2.7 million, or 10.4%, compared to noninterest expense of $25.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase was primarily the result of a $1.6 million increase in salaries and benefits expense, driven by the Brunswick acquisition, and a $605 thousand increase in FDIC charges due to increased assessment rates. \n\nThe efficiency ratio(1) was 68.8% in the first quarter of 2024, compared to 66.2% in the fourth quarter of 2023, and 62.6% in the first quarter of 2023. The change in the efficiency ratio during the first quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 was the result of higher noninterest income and slightly higher noninterest expenses, partially offset by lower net interest income, driven by the current interest rate environment. The change compared to the first quarter of 2023 was driven by growth in noninterest expense outpacing growth in net interest income, again due to the current rate environment. Mid Penn continues to evaluate levels of noninterest expense for opportunities to reduce operating costs throughout the organization. \n\nSubsequent Events\n\nManagement considers subsequent events occurring after the balance sheet date for matters which may require adjustment to, or disclosure in, the consolidated financial statements. The review period for subsequent events extends up to and including the filing date of a public company’s consolidated financial statements when filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"). Accordingly, the financial information in this announcement is subject to change. The statements are valid only as of the date hereof and Mid Penn disclaims any obligation to update this information. \n\n(1) |  Non-GAAP financial measure.

determined by methods other than in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"). Mid Penn’s management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in their analysis of Mid Penn’s performance. For tangible book value, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is book value. We believe that this measure is important to many investors in the marketplace who are interested in changes from period to period in book value per common share exclusive of changes in intangible assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets have the effect of increasing total book value while not increasing tangible book value. Income tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments are calculated using the applicable statutory tax rate for the jurisdictions in which the charges (benefits) are incurred, while taking into consideration any valuation allowances or non-deductible portions of the non-GAAP adjustments. Adjusted earnings per common share excludes from income available to common shareholders certain expenses related to significant non-core activities, including merger-related expenses, net of income taxes. For return on average tangible common equity, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is return on average equity. The efficiency ratio is often used by management to measure its noninterest expense as a percentage of its revenue. This non-GAAP disclosure has limitations as an analytical tool, should not be viewed as a substitute for financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of Mid Penn’s results and financial condition as reported under GAAP, nor is it necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. Management believes that this non-GAAP supplemental information will be helpful in understanding Mid Penn’s ongoing operating results. This supplemental presentation should not be construed as an inference that Mid Penn’s future results will be unaffected by similar adjustments to be determined in accordance with GAAP. The reconciliation of the non-GAAP to comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the tables below. \n\n**Tangible Book Value Per Share**\n\n_(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)_ |  Mar. 31, 2024  |  Dec. 31, 2023  |  Sep. 30, 2023  |  Jun. 30, 2023  |  Mar. 31, 2023   \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nShareholders' Equity  |  $  |  550,968  |  $  |  542,350  |  $  |  528,711  |  $  |  525,888  |  $  |  510,793   \nLess: Goodwill  |  127,031  |  127,031  |  127,031  |  127,031  |  114,231   \nLess: Core Deposit and Other Intangibles  |  6,051  |  6,479  |  6,970  |  7,453  |  6,916   \nTangible Equity  |  $  |  417,886  |  $  |  408,840  |  $  |  394,710  |  $  |  391,404  |  $  |  389,646   \nCommon Shares Outstanding  |  16,565,637  |  16,573,707  |  16,580,347  |  16,567,578  |  15,890,011   \nTangible Book Value per Share  |  $  |  25.23  |  $  |  24.67  |  $  |  23.81  |  $  |  23.62  |  $  |  24.52   \n  \n**Adjusted Earnings Per Common Share Excluding Non-Recurring Income and Expenses**\n\nThree Months Ended   \n---  \n_(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)_ |  Mar. 31, 2024  |  Dec. 31, 2023  |  Sep. 30, 2023  |  Jun. 30, 2023  |  Mar. 31, 2023   \nNet Income Available to Common Shareholders  |  $  |  12,133  |  $  |  12,098  |  $  |  9,236  |  $  |  4,836  |  $  |  11,227   \nLess: BOLI Death Benefit Income  |  1,460  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  —   \nPlus: Merger and Acquisition Expenses  |  —  |  —  |  352  |  7,944  |  224   \nLess: Tax Effect of Merger and Acquisition Expenses  |  —  |  —  |  74  |  1,668  |  47   \nNet Income Excluding Non-Recurring Income and Expenses  |  $  |  10,673  |  $  |  12,098  |  $  |  9,514  |  $  |  11,112  |  $  |  11,404   \nWeighted Average Shares Outstanding  |  16,567,902  |  16,574,199  |  16,571,825  |  16,235,106  |  15,886,186   \nAdjusted Earnings Per Common Share Excluding Non-Recurring Income and Expenses  |  $  |  0.64  |  $  |  0.73  |  $  |  0.57  |  $  |  0.68  |  $  |  0.72   \n  \n**Return on Average Tangible Common Equity**\n\nThree Months Ended   \n---  \n_(Dollars in thousands)_ |  Mar. 31, 2024  |  Dec. 31, 2023  |  Sep. 30, 2023  |  Jun. 30, 2023  |  Mar. 31, 2023   \nNet income available to common shareholders  |  $  |  12,133  |  $  |  12,098  |  $  |  9,236  |  $  |  4,836  |  $  |  11,227   \nPlus: Intangible amortization, net of tax  |  338  |  388  |  382  |  364  |  272   \n$  |  12,471  |  $  |  12,486  |  $  |  9,618  |  $  |  5,200  |  $  |  11,499   \nAverage shareholders' equity  |  $  |  546,001  |  $  |  537,219  |  $  |  529,067  |  $  |  504,535  |  $  |  510,857   \nLess: Average goodwill  |  127,031  |  127,031  |  127,031  |  120,631  |  114,231   \nLess: Average core deposit and other intangibles  |  6,259  |  6,716  |  7,210  |  7,016  |  7,129   \nAverage tangible shareholders' equity  |  $  |  412,711  |  $  |  403,472  |  $  |  394,826  |  $  |  376,888  |  $  |  389,497   \nReturn on average tangible common equity  |  12.15  |  %  |  12.31  |  %  |  9.69  |  %  |  5.55  |  %  |  12.01  |  %   \n  \n**Efficiency Ratio**\n\nThree Months Ended   \n---  \n_(Dollars in thousands)_ |  Mar. 31, 2024  |  Dec. 31, 2023  |  Sep. 30, 2023  |  Jun. 30, 2023  |  Mar. 31, 2023   \nNoninterest expense  |  $  |  28,520  |  $  |  28,389  |  $  |  29,229  |  $  |  35,128  |  $  |  25,841   \nLess: Merger and acquisition expenses  |  —  |  —  |  352  |  7,944  |  224   \nLess: Intangible amortization  |  428  |  491  |  484  |  461  |  344   \nLess: (Gain) loss on sale or write-down of foreclosed assets, net  |  —  |  —  |  (18  |  )  |  (126  |  )  |  —   \nEfficiency ratio numerator  |  $  |  28,092  |  $  |  27,898  |  $  |  28,411  |  $  |  26,849  |  $  |  25,273   \nNet interest income  |  36,456  |  37,000  |  37,480  |  36,444  |  36,049   \nNoninterest income  |  5,837  |  5,117  |  5,346  |  5,220  |  4,325   \nLess: BOLI Death Benefit  |  1,460  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  —   \nEfficiency ratio denominator  |  $  |  40,833  |  $  |  42,117  |  $  |  42,826  |  $  |  41,664  |  $  |  40,374   \nEfficiency ratio  |  68.80  |  %  |  66.24  |  %  |  66.34  |  %  |  64.44  |  %  |  62.60  |  %   \n  \n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20240424315804r1&sid=acqr8&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\nView source version on [businesswire.com](http://businesswire.com): <https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240424315804/en/>\n\nMid Penn Bancorp, Inc. 1-866-642-7736 Rory G.

Reports Fourth Quarter Earnings and Declares Quarterly Dividend\n\nCompany Release - 1/26/2024 9:28 AM ET\n\nDownload this Press Release PDF Format (opens in new window)\n\nHARRISBURG, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--  Mid Penn Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ: MPB) (\"Mid Penn\"), the parent company of Mid Penn Bank (the \"Bank\") and MPB Financial Services, LLC, today reported net income available to common shareholders (\"earnings\") for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, of $12.1 million, or $0.73 per diluted common share. \n\n**_Key Highlights of the Fourth Quarter of 2023:_ **\n\n  * Net income available to common shareholders increased 31.0% to $12.1 million, or $0.73 per diluted common share for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to net income of $9.2 million, or $0.56 per diluted common share for the third quarter of 2023. \n  * Return on average assets was 0.92% and return on average equity was 8.93% for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to return on average assets of 0.72% and return on average equity of 6.93% in the third quarter of 2023. \n  * Loan growth for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $107.1 million, or 10.5% (annualized), from the third quarter of 2023. Total loans increased $738.7 million compared to the prior year. Organic loan growth for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $423.6 million or 10.8% (excluding Brunswick acquisition loans of $324.5 million). \n  * Total interest income increased 4.26% to $66.1 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, driven by an increase in interest income on loans of $2.5 million from the third quarter of 2023. \n  * Deposits decreased $35.4 million, or 3.2% (annualized), for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, from the third quarter of 2023, primarily driven by a decrease in interest bearing transaction accounts partially offset by an increase in time deposits. Organic deposits increased $285.3 million or 7.5% (excluding Brunswick acquisition deposits) for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the prior year. \n  * Total interest expense increased 12.26% to $29.1 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, driven by an increase in the cost of deposits of $2.2 million from the third quarter of 2023. \n  * Total noninterest income decreased $229.0 thousand to $5.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 from $5.3 million in the prior quarter. \n  * Total noninterest expense decreased $2.4 million to $27.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 from $29.9 million in the prior quarter. \n  * The Board declared a cash dividend of $0.20 per share, payable February 20, 2024, to shareholders of record as of February 9, 2024. \n\n\n\n“Our performance in the fourth quarter of 2023, while an improvement over the linked third quarter of 2023, was still heavily impacted by the continuation of an inverted yield curve and the rigorous competition for core deposits,\" Chair, President, and CEO Rory G. Ritrievi said. \"The measures we implemented in the third quarter, such as slowing down organic loan growth and cutting operating expenses, helped shape the fourth quarter improvement while positioning our strategy for fiscal year 2024.\" \n\nRitrievi continued, \"We expect 2024 to be another difficult operating environment for financial institutions, particularly ones with a heavy reliance on the spread business. Accordingly, our measured approach to growth and expense control will persist throughout the year.\" \n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2023, the Board is pleased to announce a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share of common stock, which was declared at its meeting on January 24, 2024, payable on February 20, 2024, to shareholders of record as of February 9, 2024. \n\nNet Interest Income\n\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2023, net interest income was $37.0 million compared to net interest income of $37.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and $38.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. The tax-equivalent net interest margin for the three months ended December 31, 2023, was 3.02% compared to 3.16% for the third quarter of 2023, and 3.80% for the fourth quarter of 2022, representing a 14 basis point (\"bp\") decrease compared to the prior quarter, and a 78 bp decrease compared to the same period in 2022, primarily driven by rising interest rates and persistent inflation. \n\nThe yield on interest-earning assets increased to 5.39% for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, from 5.35% for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, and 4.58% for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. These increases were due to assets continuing to reprice at higher rates during the fourth quarter of 2023. Increased yields on interest-earning assets were more than offset by increases in funding costs for the fourth quarter of 2023, with overall cost of interest-bearing liabilities increasing to 3.02% during the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to 2.79% for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and 1.08% for the three months ended December 31, 2022. \n\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, net interest income decreased $860.0 thousand to $147.0 million compared to net interest income of $147.8 million for the same period of 2022. \n\nAverage Balances\n\nAverage loans increased $147.6 million to $4.2 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to $4.1 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, and $3.4 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. Average deposits were $4.4 billion for the fourth quarter of 2023, reflecting an increase of $41.5 million, or 1.0%, compared to total average deposits in the third quarter of 2023, and $675.3 million, or 18.1%, compared to total average deposits of $3.7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2022. The average cost of deposits was 2.33% for the fourth quarter of 2023, representing an 18 bp increase and a 158 bp increase from the third quarter of 2023 and the fourth quarter of 2022, respectively. We continue to face headwinds with respect to deposit pricing, given rising interest rates and competition for deposits across all product types. Our primary focus with respect to deposit strategy is stability, ensuring that our rates are competitive and our product mix satisfies the needs of our customers. Additionally, Mid Penn also maintains interest rate swaps to hedge the cash flows associated with existing brokered CDs to mitigate the impact of rising deposit costs. \n\nThe mix of deposits continues to shift as customers move funds from non-interest-bearing accounts to time deposits given prevailing thought that current rates are at highs. Time deposits represented 31.0% of total deposits at September 30, 2023, and increased to 33.6% at December 31, 2023. The mix of non-interest-bearing deposits remained flat during the quarter, representing approximately 18.4% of total deposits at December 31, 2023, compared to 18.4% at September 30, 2023, 19.4% at June 30, 2023, and 20.6% at March 31, 2023. The average duration of the non-hedged time deposit portfolio is 12 months at December 31, 2023. \n\nAsset Quality\n\nOn January 1, 2023, Mid Penn adopted ASU 2016-13, _Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (ASC Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments_ , which replaces the incurred loss methodology and is referred to as CECL. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2023, are presented under CECL, while prior period results are reported in accordance with the previously applicable incurred loss methodology. \n\nThe provision for credit losses on loans was $221.0 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of $1.2 million compared to the provision for credit losses of $1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The provision for credit losses on loans was $3.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of $1.0 million compared to the provision for credit losses of $4.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in provision for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, is primarily due to a decrease in nonperforming individually-evaluated loans. Net chargeoffs for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, were $332.0 thousand or less than 1% of total loans. \n\nTotal nonperforming assets were $14.5 million at December 31, 2023, compared to nonperforming assets of $14.4 million and $8.6 million at September 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively. The increase during the fourth quarter of 2023 primarily related to payoffs on nonaccrual loans. Delinquency as a percentage of total loans was 0.49% at December 31, 2023. \n\nCapital\n\nShareholders’ equity increased $31.5 million, or 6.15%, from $512.1 million as of December 31, 2022, to $543.6 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Brunswick Bancorp in the second quarter of 2023. Retained earnings increased $12.9 million or 9.67% from $133.1 million as of December 31, 2022, to $146.0 million as of December 31, 2023. Regulatory capital ratios for both Mid Penn and its banking subsidiary indicate regulatory capital levels in excess of both the regulatory minimums and the levels necessary for the Bank to be considered \"well capitalized\" at December 31, 2023. Additionally, Mid Penn declared $3.3 million in dividends during the fourth quarter of 2023. \n\nOn May 11, 2023, Mid Penn’s Board of Directors reauthorized its treasury stock repurchase program (\"Program\") effective through May 11, 2024. The Program authorizes the repurchase of up to $15.0 million of Mid Penn’s outstanding common stock. There were 12,500 share repurchases during the three months ended December 31, 2023. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, Mid Penn repurchased 216,879 shares of common stock at an average price of $22.31. As of December 31, 2023, Mid Penn repurchased 425,222 shares of common stock at an average price of $22.86 per share under the Program. The Program had $5.3 million remaining available for repurchase as of December 31, 2023. \n\nNoninterest Income\n\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2023, noninterest income totaled $5.1 million, which was relatively consistent with noninterest income of $5.3 million for the third quarter of 2023. \n\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, noninterest income totaled $20.0 million, a decrease of $3.6 million, compared to noninterest income of $23.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in noninterest income is primarily due to a $1.2 million decrease in residential mortgage business, and a $1.8 million decrease in other miscellaneous income. Given the rising interest rate environment and overall lower demand for mortgages, that industry continues to be a drag on all other earnings. \n\nNoninterest Expense\n\nNoninterest expense totaled $27.5 million, a decrease of $2.4 million, or 8.0%, for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to noninterest expense of $29.9 million for the third quarter of 2023. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, noninterest expense totaled $119.0 million, an increase of $19.1 million, or 19.2%, compared to noninterest expense of $99.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. The increase in noninterest expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, is driven by $8.5 million of merger-related expenses, a $6.7 million increase in salaries and benefits expense, and a $1.9 million increase in FDIC charges due to special assessments levied to recover the losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund resulting from the bank failures in 2023. \n\nThe efficiency ratio(1) was 64.1% in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to 67.9% in the third quarter of 2023, and 54.6% in the fourth quarter of 2022. Mid Penn continues to evaluate levels of noninterest expense for opportunities to reduce operating costs throughout the organization. \n\nSubsequent Events\n\nManagement considers subsequent events occurring after the balance sheet date for matters which may require adjustment to, or disclosure in, the consolidated financial statements. The review period for subsequent events extends up to and including the filing date of a public company’s consolidated financial statements when filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\").

methods other than in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"). Mid Penn’s management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in their analysis of Mid Penn’s performance. For tangible book value, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is book value. We believe that this measure is important to many investors in the marketplace who are interested in changes from period to period in book value per common share exclusive of changes in intangible assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets have the effect of increasing total book value while not increasing tangible book value. Income tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments are calculated using the applicable statutory tax rate for the jurisdictions in which the charges (benefits) are incurred, while taking into consideration any valuation allowances or non-deductible portions of the non-GAAP adjustments. Non-PPP core banking loans are meaningful to investors as they are indicative of portfolio loans and related growth from traditional bank activities and excludes short-term or nonrecurring loans from special programs like the PPP. Adjusted earnings per common share excludes from income available to common shareholders certain expenses related to significant non-core activities, including merger-related expenses, net of income taxes. For return on average tangible common equity, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is return on average equity. The efficiency ratio is often used by management to measure its noninterest expense as a percentage of its revenue. This non-GAAP disclosure has limitations as an analytical tool, should not be viewed as a substitute for financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of Mid Penn’s results and financial condition as reported under GAAP, nor is it necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. Management believes that this non-GAAP supplemental information will be helpful in understanding Mid Penn’s ongoing operating results. This supplemental presentation should not be construed as an inference that Mid Penn’s future results will be unaffected by similar adjustments to be determined in accordance with GAAP. The reconciliation of the non-GAAP to comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the tables below. \n\n** Tangible Book Value Per Share **\n\n_(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)_ |  Dec. 31, 2023  |  Sep. 30, 2023  |  Jun. 30, 2023  |  Mar. 31, 2023  |  Dec. 31, 2022   \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nShareholders' Equity  |  $  |  543,611  |  $  |  528,711  |  $  |  525,888  |  $  |  510,793  |  $  |  512,099   \nLess: Goodwill  |  127,054  |  129,752  |  129,403  |  114,231  |  114,231   \nLess: Core Deposit and Other Intangibles  |  6,479  |  6,970  |  7,453  |  6,916  |  7,260   \nTangible Equity  |  $  |  410,078  |  $  |  391,989  |  $  |  389,032  |  $  |  389,646  |  $  |  390,608   \nCommon Shares Outstanding  |  16,573,707  |  16,580,347  |  16,567,578  |  15,890,011  |  15,886,143   \nTangible Book Value per Share  |  $  |  24.74  |  $  |  23.64  |  $  |  23.48  |  $  |  24.52  |  $  |  24.59   \n  \n** Non-PPP Core Banking Loans **\n\n_(Dollars in thousands)_ |  Dec. 31, 2023  |  Sep. 30, 2023  |  Jun. 30, 2023  |  Mar. 31, 2023  |  Dec. 31, 2022   \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nLoans, net of unearned interest  |  $  |  4,252,792  |  $  |  4,145,657  |  $  |  4,034,510  |  $  |  3,611,347  |  $  |  3,514,119   \nLess: PPP loans, net of deferred fees  |  1,426  |  1,547  |  1,633  |  1,752  |  2,600   \nNon-PPP core banking loans  |  $  |  4,251,366  |  $  |  4,144,110  |  $  |  4,032,877  |  $  |  3,609,595  |  $  |  3,511,519   \n  \n** Adjusted Earnings Per Common Share Excluding Non-Recurring Expenses **\n\nThree Months Ended   \n---  \n_(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)_ |  Dec. 31, 2023  |  Sep. 30, 2023  |  Jun. 30, 2023  |  Mar. 31, 2023  |  Dec. 31, 2022   \nNet Income Available to Common Shareholders  |  $  |  12,098  |  $  |  9,236  |  $  |  4,836  |  $  |  11,227  |  $  |  15,719   \nPlus: Merger and Acquisition Expenses  |  —  |  352  |  7,944  |  224  |  294   \nLess: Tax Effect of Merger and Acquisition Expenses  |  —  |  74  |  1,668  |  47  |  62   \nNet Income Excluding Non-Recurring Expenses  |  $  |  12,098  |  $  |  9,514  |  $  |  11,112  |  $  |  11,404  |  $  |  15,951   \nWeighted Average Shares Outstanding  |  16,574,199  |  16,571,825  |  16,235,106  |  15,886,186  |  15,883,003   \nAdjusted Earnings Per Common Share Excluding Non-Recurring Expenses  |  $  |  0.73  |  $  |  0.57  |  $  |  0.68  |  $  |  0.72  |  $  |  0.99   \n  \n** Return on Average Tangible Common Equity **\n\nThree Months Ended   \n---  \n_(Dollars in thousands)_ |  Dec. 31, 2023  |  Sep. 30, 2023  |  Jun. 30, 2023  |  Mar. 31, 2023  |  Dec. 31, 2022   \nNet income available to common shareholders  |  $  |  12,098  |  $  |  9,236  |  $  |  4,836  |  $  |  11,227  |  $  |  15,719   \nPlus: Intangible amortization, net of tax  |  388  |  382  |  364  |  272  |  392   \n$  |  12,486  |  $  |  9,618  |  $  |  5,200  |  $  |  11,499  |  $  |  16,111   \nAverage shareholders' equity  |  $  |  537,219  |  $  |  529,067  |  $  |  504,535  |  $  |  510,857  |  $  |  505,769   \nLess: Average goodwill  |  129,869  |  129,428  |  120,284  |  114,231  |  113,879   \nLess: Average core deposit and other intangibles  |  6,716  |  7,210  |  7,016  |  7,129  |  6,966   \nAverage tangible shareholders' equity  |  $  |  400,634  |  $  |  392,429  |  $  |  377,235  |  $  |  389,497  |  $  |  384,924   \nReturn on average tangible common equity  |  12.36  |  %  |  9.72  |  %  |  5.53  |  %  |  11.97  |  %  |  16.61  |  %   \n  \n** Efficiency Ratio **\n\nThree Months Ended   \n---  \n_(Dollars in thousands)_ |  Dec. 31, 2023  |  Sep. 30, 2023  |  Jun. 30, 2023  |  Mar. 31, 2023  |  Dec. 31, 2022   \nNoninterest expense  |  $  |  27,504  |  $  |  29,889  |  $  |  35,529  |  $  |  26,070  |  $  |  25,468   \nLess: Merger and acquisition expenses  |  —  |  352  |  7,944  |  224  |  294   \nLess: Intangible amortization  |  491  |  484  |  461  |  344  |  496   \nLess: (Gain) loss on sale or write-down of foreclosed assets, net  |  —  |  (18  |  )  |  (126  |  )  |  —  |  (45  |  )   \nEfficiency ratio numerator  |  $  |  27,013  |  $  |  29,071  |  $  |  27,250  |  $  |  25,502  |  $  |  24,723   \nNet interest income  |  37,000  |  37,480  |  36,444  |  36,049  |  38,577   \nNoninterest income  |  5,117  |  5,346  |  5,220  |  4,325  |  6,714   \nEfficiency ratio denominator  |  $  |  42,117  |  $  |  42,826  |  $  |  41,664  |  $  |  40,374  |  $  |  45,291   \nEfficiency ratio  |  64.14  |  %  |  67.88  |  %  |  65.40  |  %  |  63.16  |  %  |  54.59  |  %   \n  \n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20240125029097r1&sid=q4-prod&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\nMid Penn Bancorp, Inc. 1-866-642-7736 Rory G.
