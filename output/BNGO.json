Q3 2024 revenue represents a 35% decrease from Q3 2023\n  * Total installed base of 368 optical genome mapping (OGM) systems as of Q3 2024, which represents a 22% increase over Q3 2023\n  * Sold 7,835 nanochannel array flowcells in Q3 2024, which represents a 27% increase from the number of flowcells sold in Q3 2023\n  * Conference call today, November 13, 2024 at 4:30 PM ET\n\n\n\nSAN DIEGO, Nov. 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bionano Genomics, Inc. (Nasdaq: BNGO) today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\nOur results in the third quarter reflect improving momentum for OGM utilization and sales of flowcells, despite overall revenues coming in below our expectations, again driven by a small number of system orders taking longer than expected to come through. Importantly, cash burn for the quarter was significantly lower than the prior year period, which has been a consistent trend now for several quarters due to our reorganization plan to decrease expenses and is a key element in our shift toward securing revenue and growth from our installed base of customers using OGM and VIA software and away from aggressively growing the installed base, which proved to be costly in the constrained environment for capital expenditures in the market. As a result of the restructuring, we have taken a number of charges, which elevated operating expense, but a substantial amount of that comprises one-time non-cash charges we don’t expect to see to the same degree going forward,” commented Erik Holmlin, PhD, president and chief executive officer of Bionano. “Indeed, our disciplined and systematic approach to mitigating operational expenses and cash burn has been painful at times, but we believe it is necessary. I am proud of the team’s execution to reduce the overall cash needs of the business as we prepare for new opportunities in the future.\" \n\n**Q3 2024 Company Highlights**\n\n  * **CPT code implementation and pricing announcement on schedule following the category 1 CPT code approval by the American Medical Association (AMA) in May 2024. **The new CPT Code is for the use of OGM in cytogenomic genome-wide analysis to detect structural and copy number variations related to hematological malignancies. The final Clinical Lab Fee Schedule (CLFS) for 2025 is expected to publish before year end.\n  * **Announced a registered direct offering and concurrent private placement of clinical milestone-linked Series A and Series B warrants:**\n    * **Upfront gross proceeds to the Company of approximately****$10.0 million** , before deducting the placement agent’s fees and other offering expenses payable by the Company; funds will be used for general corporate purposes.\n    * **Potential additional gross proceeds of up to $20.0 million upon the cash exercise (at an exercise price of $0.571 per share and subject to stockholder approval) in full of the Series A and Series B warrants** to purchase an aggregate of 35,026,272 shares. \n  * **Adjournment of Special Shareholder Meeting due to lack of Quorum**\n    * The Special Meeting will reconvene at 10 a.m. (PT) on November 27, 2024 in hopes of reaching the quorum requirements for a meeting. As of October 30th, approximately 2.2 million additional votes were needed to reach a quorum.\n  * **Announced Publication of First Multi-Site Study to Analyze the Utility of OGM in Multiple Myeloma**\n    * The study conducted by researchers at University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and The Johns Hopkins Hospital, researchers concurrently analyzed 45 PCN samples using karyotype (KT), fluorescence  _in situ_ hybridization (FISH), OGM and next-generation sequencing (NGS).\n    * OGM uniquely identified complex genomic rearrangements that are associated with cancer proliferation and progression, resulting in a change in prognostication beyond that indicated by traditional cytogenetic analysis in 18% of cases. In at least five cases (11%), OGM’s unique findings provided precise information to predict response to target therapies like BCMA monoclonal antibody, CAR-T, or GPRC5D targeted therapies, which may have therapeutic implications.\n    * The study results highlight OGM’s ability to provide researchers with a highly sensitive, accurate genome-wide analysis that can lead to a more comprehensive understanding of genetic subtypes in PCN when compared with FISH and KT.\n  * **Installed base of OGM systems totaled 368 at the end of the third quarter of 2024** , which represents a 22% increase over the 301 installed systems reported at the end of the third quarter of 2023.\n  * **7,835 nanochannel array flowcells sold during the third quarter of 2024** , which represents a 27% increase over the 6,176 flowcells sold during the third quarter of 2023.\n\n\n\n**Q3 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * **Total revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was $6.1 million**, a decrease of 35% compared to the third quarter of 2023. Revenues included $6.6 million in sales of core products and software offset by a $0.5 million write-down of aged receivables from Bionano Laboratories clinical service offerings, which were discontinued in March of 2024. The write-down was treated as a reversal of revenue.\n  * **GAAP gross margin for the third quarter of 2024 was**(139)%, compared to 30% for the third quarter of 2023. Third quarter 2024 non-GAAP gross margin was 26%, compared to 32% for the third quarter of 2023. Third quarter 2024 non-GAAP gross margin excludes $82,000 in stock-based compensation, $139,000 of restructuring expense, and $9.8 million of impairment and disposal of reagent rentals and inventory. Third quarter 2023 GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation can be found in the reconciliation table accompanying this press release.\n  * **Third quarter 2024 GAAP operating expense was $35.5 million,** **and $16.1 million on a non-GAAP basis, **which is a decrease of 69% and 49%, respectively, from the third quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP operating expense in the third quarter of 2024 excludes restructuring costs, stock-based compensation, and other adjustments as detailed in the reconciliation table accompanying this press release. Third quarter 2023 GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation can be found in the same table in this release.\n  * **Cash, cash equivalents, available-for-sale securities, and restricted cash were $23.4 million as of September 30, 2024**. As of September 30, 2024, $11.4 million was subject to certain restrictions.\n  * As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate principal amount of senior secured convertible debentures outstanding was $17.0 million.\n  * Bionano raised net proceeds of approximately $0.1million from ATM sales during the third quarter. An additional $1.2 million was raised in net proceeds from ATM sales subsequent to the end of the third quarter 2024.\n\n\n\n**Recent Highlights**\n\n  * **Announced closing of an additional $3.0 million registered direct offering **\n    * **Upfront gross proceeds to the Company of approximately $3.0 million** , before deducting the placement agent’s fees and other offering expenses payable by the Company; funds will be used for general corporate purposes.\n    * Potential additional gross proceeds of up to $6.0 million upon the cash exercise (at an exercise price of $0.3039 per share and subject to stockholder approval) in full of the Series C and Series D warrants to purchase an aggregate of 19,762,226 shares.\n  * **Recent Peer-reviewed highlighted applications of OGM in blood cancers**\n    * Publication in  _Blood Cancer Journal_ by a group of researchers at the Korea College of Medicine in South Korea showing that optical genome mapping (OGM) can resolve rearrangements in the  _MYC_ gene in multiple myeloma (MM), which represent highly actionable biomarkers in cancer.\n    * Data demonstrated the potential for wider adoption and use of OGM across all blood cancers as an alternative to traditional methods like KT and FISH.\n\n\n\n**Conference Call & Webcast Details**\n\nDate: | Wednesday, November 13th, 2024  \n---|---  \nTime: | 4:30 p.m. ET  \nParticipant Link: | Registration - [Click Here](https://register.vevent.com/register/BIbfce85d5e8e041349340a4c429304de9)  \nWebcast Link: | [https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/dmabxin9](https://protect.checkpoint.com/v2/r01/___https:/edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/dmabxin9___.YzJ1OmdpbG1hcnRpbmdyb3VwOmM6bzphNzM1MmUzMWM4MWQ2NTZmMTA4MDg1MGY3ZjViOTgwYjo3OjljYWQ6M2FkMjgyZDZkY2I5MDZlNTE2ZjEwNmY2ZGJmOWZiODE2MTdkNmI1ZjQ5ODU5MGM5ODgwNDExNzBhNTQyYWVmODpoOlQ6Rg)  \n  \nParticipants may access a live webcast of the call on the Investors page of the Bionano website.

Non-GAAP operating expense excludes from GAAP reported operating expense the following components as detailed in the reconciliation table accompanying this press release: costs directly attributable to the company restructuring, stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, change in fair value of contingent consideration and certain deal-related costs. Non-GAAP gross margin excludes from GAAP reported gross margin stock-based compensation and certain restructuring expense as detailed in the reconciliation table accompanying this press release.\n\nBionano believes that non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating expense are useful to investors and analysts as a supplement to its financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP for analyzing operating performance and identifying operating trends in its business. Bionano uses non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating expense internally to facilitate period-to-period comparisons and analysis of its operating performance in order to understand, manage and evaluate its business and to make operating decisions. Accordingly, Bionano believes these measures allow for greater transparency with respect to key financial metrics it uses in assessing its own operating performance and making operating decisions.\n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures; should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP; have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP; and are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. In addition, from time to time in the future, there may be other items that the Company may exclude for purposes of its non-GAAP financial measures; and the Company may in the future cease to exclude items that it has historically excluded for purposes of its non-GAAP financial measures. Likewise, the Company may determine to modify the nature of its adjustments to arrive at its non-GAAP financial measures. Because of the non-standardized definitions of non-GAAP financial measures, the non-GAAP financial measures as used by Bionano in this press release and the accompanying reconciliation table have limits in its usefulness to investors and may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n\nFor a reconciliation of non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating expense to gross margin and operating expense reported in accordance with GAAP, please refer to the financial tables accompanying this release.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements of Bionano Genomics**\n\nThis press release and accompanying conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

(Nasdaq: BNGO) today announced the closing of its previously announced registered direct offering priced at-the-marker under Nasdaq rules for the purchase and sale of an aggregate of 9,881,113 shares of its common stock and Series C warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 9,881,113 shares of common stock and short-term Series D warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 9,881,113 shares of common stock (collectively, the “Warrants”) at a combined offering price of $0.3039 per share of common stock and accompanying Warrants. The Warrants have an exercise price of $0.3039 per share and will be exercisable beginning on the effective date of stockholder approval of the issuance of the shares of common stock upon exercise of the Warrants (the “Stockholder Approval”). The Series C warrants expire five years following the date of the Stockholder Approval and the short-term Series D warrants expire eighteen months following the date of Stockholder Approval.\n\nH.C. Wainwright & Co. acted as the exclusive placement agent for the offering.\n\nThe aggregate gross proceeds to the Company from the offering were approximately $3 million, before deducting the placement agent’s fees and other offering expenses payable by the Company. The potential additional gross proceeds to the Company from the Warrants, if fully exercised on a cash basis, will be approximately $6 million. No assurance can be given that the Stockholder Approval will be achieved or that any of the Warrants will be exercised. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with its existing cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities, for general corporate purposes, including working capital, research and development expenses, repayment or redemption of existing indebtedness and capital expenditures.\n\nThe securities described above were offered and sold by the Company in a registered direct offering pursuant to a “shelf” registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-270459) that was originally filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on March 10, 2023, and became effective on May 10, 2023. The offering of the securities in the registered direct offering was made only by means of a base prospectus and prospectus supplement that forms a part of the effective registration statement. A final prospectus supplement and the accompanying base prospectus relating to the registered direct offering has been filed with the SEC and is available on the SEC’s website at [www.sec.gov](http://www.sec.gov). Electronic copies of the final prospectus supplement and the accompanying base prospectus may also be obtained from H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC at 430 Park Avenue, 3rd Floor, New York, NY 10022, by phone at (212) 856-5711 or e-mail at placements@hcwco.com.\n\nThis press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any of the securities described herein, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or other jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or other jurisdiction.\n\n**About Bionano**\n\nBionano is a provider of genome analysis solutions that can enable researchers and clinicians to reveal answers to challenging questions in biology and medicine.

Words such as “believe,” “can,” “could,” “may,” “potential” and similar expressions (as well as other words or expressions referencing future events, conditions or circumstances and the negatives thereof) convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes and are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include statements regarding our intentions, beliefs, projections, outlook, analyses or current expectations concerning, among other things, the use of proceeds from the offering, the exercise of the Warrants in cash prior to their expiration, and the receipt of the Stockholder Approval. Each of these forward-looking statements involves risks and uncertainties.\n\nActual results or developments may differ materially from those projected or implied in these forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such a difference include adjustments to our preliminary measures of financial performance resulting from, among other things, the completion of our end-of-period review and reporting processes; the impact of adverse geopolitical and macroeconomic events, such as recent and future bank failures, the ongoing Ukraine-Russia conflict, related sanctions and any global pandemics, on our business and the global economy; challenges inherent in developing, manufacturing and commercializing products; our ability to further deploy new products and applications and expand the markets for our technology platforms; our expectations and beliefs regarding future growth of the business and the markets in which we operate; changes in our strategic and commercial plans; our ability to continue as a going concern, which requires us to manage costs and obtain significant additional financing to fund our strategic plans and commercialization efforts; our ability to cure any deficiencies in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rules that could adversely affect our ability to raise capital and our financial condition and business; our ability to consummate any strategic alternatives; the risk that if we fail to obtain additional financing we may seek relief under applicable insolvency laws; and other risks and uncertainties including those described in our filings with the SEC, including, without limitation, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and in other filings subsequently made by us with the SEC. All forward-looking statements contained in this press release speak only as of the date on which they were made and are based on management’s assumptions and estimates as of such date. We are under no duty to update any of these forward-looking statements after the date they are made to conform these statements to actual results or revised expectations, except as required by law. You should, therefore, not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to the date the statements are made. Moreover, except as required by law, neither we nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of the forward-looking statements contained in this press release.\n\n**CONTACTS****Company Contact:** Erik Holmlin, CEOBionano Genomics, Inc.+1 (858) 888-7610eholmlin@bionano.com\n\n**Investor Relations:** David R.

(Nasdaq: BNGO) announced today that it adjourned its reconvened Special Meeting of Stockholders originally held on October 2, 2024 and subsequently adjourned to October 30, 2024 (the “Special Meeting”) because a quorum was not present at the time of the reconvened meeting. Based on preliminary reports as of October 30, 2024, approximately 30.7% of total shares outstanding as of the record date have submitted their votes, whereas 33.3% of total shares outstanding as of the record date are necessary to satisfy the quorum requirements for a meeting. Based on the preliminary reports from the votes submitted as of October 30, 2024, approximately 76.3% of votes represented in person or by proxy at the Special Meeting were voted “For” the proposal.\n\nThe Special Meeting will reconvene at 10 a.m. Pacific Time on November 27, 2024. Voting polls will remain open until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on November 26, 2024. Proxies previously submitted in respect of the Special Meeting will be voted at the reconvened Special Meeting unless properly revoked, and stockholders who have previously submitted a proxy or otherwise voted need not take any action.\n\nStockholders of record may vote their shares by calling Toll-Free at 1-800-690-6903. Further information on the company’s proxy proposal soliciting stockholder approval for the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of warrants may be found in the company’s definitive proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 21, 2024 and available at: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1411690/000114036124038087/ny20032632x2_def14a.htm](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=DvVJhcwbGXOgQndUiOxCQBryFZjAHf3sBUV7tCMbcrgGTZrfu9JWiMy0TnC50DJtEEUy-dL5n6SEnMDTCAc0h2-imvGIpxAnSiq4PhQ7-aSw0tNsUEGljd4CyJ3LXMA9cWJ_iBDlIe1GjQlCduSZibIwU95iz4l_Q2b--1JRcNYr3F5LFF7nj5LG_FP8skoO-81fxXb4pyF_XdrQwV6tvQjMGjRC4Q8311_lNgqb9n1hk2B13AGqDad-G6WRi3jZsxLbKC44OY_bwS9fgsD8nQ==)\n\nBefore making any voting decisions stockholders are urged to read the company’s definitive proxy statement because it contains important information about the proposal and the Special Meeting. No changes have been made to the proposal to be voted on by stockholders at the Special Meeting.\n\nErik Holmlin, PhD, CEO of Bionano commented, “We are extremely grateful to our stockholders who made their voices heard through the voting process and are pleased with the voting that has occurred in the past four weeks. However, we are still short of reaching the quorum requirements for a meeting with approximately 30.7% of our shares voted, and needing approximately 2.2 million additional votes to reach a quorum. We have adjourned the meeting to allow time for increased stockholder participation.\n\n“For this reason, we ask that you vote ‘For’ the proposal. If you have not yet voted your shares, we encourage you to vote ‘For’ the proposal. If you have voted against this proposal, you can change your vote, and we ask that you consider doing so. The failure of our stockholders to approve the proposal may materially adversely affect the Company’s future ability to raise equity or debt capital from third parties on attractive terms, if at all, and also risks significantly impairing the operations, assets and ongoing viability of the Company. As always, we are grateful to all the stockholders for their participation.”\n\n**About Bionano**\n\nBionano is a provider of genome analysis solutions that can enable researchers and clinicians to reveal answers to challenging questions in biology and medicine.

Words such as “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “may,” “plan,” “will” and similar expressions (as well as other words or expressions referencing future events, conditions or circumstances) convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes and are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include statements regarding our intentions, beliefs, projections, outlook, analyses or current expectations concerning, among other things: the date for the reconvened meeting, and the potential negative impacts to the company if stockholders do not approve the issuance of common stock upon exercise of the warrants. Actual results or developments may differ materially from those projected or implied in these forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such a difference include the risks and uncertainties associated with: the impact of approving the issuance of common stock upon exercise of the warrants; the impact of adverse geopolitical and macroeconomic events, such as recent and future bank failures, the ongoing Ukraine-Russia conflict, related sanctions and any global pandemics, on our business and the global economy; challenges inherent in developing, manufacturing and commercializing products; our ability to further deploy new products and applications and expand the markets for our technology platforms; our expectations and beliefs regarding future growth of the business and the markets in which we operate; changes in our strategic and commercial plans; our ability to continue as a going concern, which requires us to manage costs and obtain significant additional financing to fund our strategic plans and commercialization efforts; our ability to cure any deficiencies in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rules that could adversely affect our ability to raise capital and our financial condition and business; our ability to consummate any strategic alternatives; the risk that if we fail to obtain additional financing we may seek relief under applicable insolvency laws; and other risks and uncertainties described in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, without limitation, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and in other filings subsequently made by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All forward-looking statements contained in this press release speak only as of the date on which they were made and are based on management’s assumptions and estimates as of such date. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of the receipt of new information, the occurrence of future events or otherwise.\n\n**CONTACTS**\n\n**Company Contact:**\n\nErik Holmlin, CEOBionano Genomics, Inc.+1 (858) 888-7610eholmlin@bionano.com\n\n**Investor Relations:**\n\nDavid HolmesGilmartin Group+1 (858) 888-7625IR@bionano.com\n\n![](https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=OTI2NTEwOCM2NTU4NTYxIzIwODQzNzE=)![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/N2Y3YmUzZjgtZWY5ZS00MDEyLWJmYjctZjJjNWE3MzY2NGFhLTEwOTU5NDI=/tiny/Bionano-Genomics-Inc-.png)\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/5ba4072e-6e59-46e7-847c-6aaf7755bbbf/small/bionano-rgb-png.png)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/5ba4072e-6e59-46e7-847c-6aaf7755bbbf)\n\nSource: Bionano Genomics\n\n  * [Print Page]()\n  * [Email Alerts](/investor-resources/email-alerts)\n  * [RSS Feeds](/investor-resources/rss-feeds)\n\n\n\nRequest Email Alerts\n\n[](#)\n"
