The independent auditor is responsible for auditing the Company’s financial\nstatements and, if applicable, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, and for\nreviewing the Company’s unaudited interim financial statements.\nThe Committee is not responsible, however, for planning or conducting audits, or\ndetermining whether the Company’s financial statements are complete and accurate or in\naccordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), as issued by the\nInternational Accounting Standards Board. If the Company at a subsequent date determines to\nreport its formal statements under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“US GAAP”),\nall references to IFRS shall thereafter be deemed to relate to US GAAP. The following\nresponsibilities are set forth as a guide for fulfilling the Committee’s purposes in such manner as\nthe Committee determines is appropriate.\n3\nA Oversight of the Independent Auditor\n(i) Independent Auditor Retention.

The Committee shall engage in an\nactive dialogue with the independent auditor concerning any disclosed\nrelationships or services that may impact the objectivity and independence\nof the auditor and take, or recommend that the Board take, appropriate\naction to oversee and ensure the independence of the auditor.\n(iii) Quality and Performance.

The evaluation will include obtaining a written report from the\nindependent auditor describing the firm’s internal quality control\nprocedures, any material issues raised by the most recent internal quality\ncontrol review, PCAOB inspection, or other PCAOB review of the firm, by\na peer review of the firm or by any inquiry or investigation by governmental\nor professional authorities within the past five years, concerning an\nindependent audit or audits carried out by the firm, and any steps taken to\naddress any such issues.\n(iv) General Oversight. The independent auditor reports directly to the\nCommittee. The Committee is responsible for oversight of the work of the\nindependent auditor, including resolution of disagreements between\nmanagement and the independent auditor regarding financial reporting.

The Committee shall establish with the independent\nauditor an understanding of the terms of the audit engagement, the role of\nthe auditor with respect to the Company’s financial statements and\ncoordination of audit efforts to ensure completeness of coverage, reduction\nof redundant efforts, the effective use of audit resources, and the use of\naccounting firms other than the appointed auditors of the Company. The\nCommittee shall review the scope of the annual audit or interim review\n(including the level of involvement with unaudited quarterly or other\ninterim-period information), and discuss the results, including, without\nlimitation, the independent auditor’s report and all matters required to be\ncommunicated to the Committee by the independent auditor in accordance\nwith applicable auditing standards.\nThe Committee shall discuss with the independent auditor, before the\nissuance of the audit report, the overall audit strategy, including the timing\nof the audit, significant risks the auditor identified and significant changes\nto the planned audit strategy or identified risks. The Committee shall review\nwith the independent auditor any audit problems or difficulties encountered\nduring the course of the audit work and management’s response, including\nany restrictions on the scope of the independent auditor’s activities or access\nto required records, data and information, any difficult or contentious\nmatters for which the auditor consulted outside the engagement team (for\nexample, the audit firm’s national office), any significant disagreements\nwith management, and any other matters arising from the audit that are\nsignificant to the oversight of the Company’s financial reporting process.\n(vi) Auditor Rotation. The Committee shall consider whether, in addition to\nassuring the regular rotation of the lead audit partner as required by law, in\nthe interest of assuring continuing independence of an independent auditor,\nthe Company should regularly rotate the firm appointed as the Company’s\nindependent auditor.\n(vii) Pre-Approval of Auditor Services. The Committee is exclusively\nauthorized and directed to consider and, in its discretion, approve in advance\nall audit and non-audit services (including the fees and material terms\nthereof), proposed to be carried out for the Company by the independent\nauditor or by any other firm proposed to be engaged by the Company as its\nindependent auditor, if applicable, in accordance with the Company’s Audit\nand Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval Policy (the “Pre-Approval Policy”),\nwhich is attached hereto as Exhibit A.

(the “Company”) is\nresponsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of the independent\nregistered public accounting firm that audits the consolidated financial statements of the Company\nand its consolidated subsidiaries (the “Independent Auditor”). As part of this responsibility, the\nAudit Committee is required to pre-approve the audit and non-audit services performed by the\nIndependent Auditor to ensure that the performance of those services does not impair the\nIndependent Auditor’s independence. Accordingly, the Audit Committee has adopted, and the\nBoard of Directors has ratified, this Audit and Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval Policy (the\n“Policy”), which sets forth the procedures and conditions whereby permissible services proposed\nto be performed by the Independent Auditor will be pre-approved.\nBefore the Company or any of its subsidiaries may engage the Independent Auditor to\nrender any service, the engagement must be (1) pre-approved by the Audit Committee without\nconsideration of specific case-by-case services by the Audit Committee (“general pre-approval”);\nor (2) specifically pre-approved on a case-by-case basis by the Audit Committee (“specific Pre-\napproval”). The Audit Committee believes that the combination of these two approaches in this\nPolicy will result in an effective and efficient procedure to pre-approve services to be performed\nby the Independent Auditor. Under either approach, the Audit Committee will approve the\nmaximum aggregate amount of the costs that may be incurred in connection with the service(s).\nUnless a type of service has received general pre-approval, it will require specific preapproval by\nthe Audit Committee if it is to be provided by the Independent Auditor.\nIn evaluating the scope of the engagement of the Independent Auditor, the Audit\nCommittee will consider whether it believes the proposed services are consistent with the federal\nlaws, as well as the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)\nand Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the “PCAOB”) on auditor independence, and\nwill not otherwise impair the Independent Auditor’s independence from the Company.\nThis Policy describes the particular audit, audit-related, tax and all other services that are\nsubject to general pre-approval of the Audit Committee. The term of any general pre-approval\napplies to the Company’s financial year, unless the Audit Committee specifically provides for a\ndifferent period. Thus, audit fees for the financial year may include work performed after the close\nof the calendar year. Unused pre-approval amounts will not be carried forward to the next year.\nPre-approvals will be made by category of service and cannot be transferred between categories.\nThe Audit Committee will periodically revise the list of pre-approved services that may be\nprovided by the Independent Auditor without obtaining specific pre-approval from the Audit\nCommittee.\n11\nDelegation\nThe Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to one or more of its members.\nThe member to whom such authority is delegated must report, for informational purposes only,\nany pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at or before its next scheduled meeting. Neither\nthe Audit Committee nor the person to whom pre-approval authority is delegated may delegate its\nresponsibilities to pre-approve services performed by the Independent Auditor to the Company’s\nmanagement.\nAudit Services\nThe Audit Committee must specifically pre-approve the terms of the annual audit services\nengagement. The Audit Committee will monitor the audit services engagement as necessary and\nwill consider whether any changes in terms, conditions and fees resulting from changes in audit\nscope, the Company’s corporate structure or other items are necessary or appropriate. Audit\nservices include the annual consolidated financial statement audit (including required reviews of\nthe quarterly consolidated financial statements of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries),\naudits of the Company’s subsidiaries, equity investment audits and other procedures required to\nbe performed by the Independent Auditor to be able to form an opinion on the Company’s\nconsolidated financial statements. These other procedures include information systems and\nprocedural reviews and testing performed in order to understand and place reliance on the systems\nof internal control, and consultations relating to the audit or quarterly reviews. Audit services also\ninclude the engagement for the Independent Auditor’s report on the Company’s internal controls\nfor financial reporting.\nIn addition to the annual audit services engagement approved by the Audit Committee, the\nAudit Committee may grant general pre-approval for other audit services, which are those services\nthat only the Independent Auditor reasonably can provide. Other audit services for which the Audit\nCommittee may grant general pre-approval include (1) statutory audits or financial audits for\nsubsidiaries or affiliates of the Company, and (2) services associated with SEC registration\nstatements, periodic reports and other documents filed with the SEC or other documents issued in\nconnection with securities offerings, such as comfort letters and consents, and assistance in\nresponding to SEC comment letters. All other audit services not listed above must be specifically\npre-approved by the Audit Committee.\nAudit-related Services\nAudit-related services, including internal control-related services, are assurance and related\nservices that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of the Company’s\nfinancial statements or the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and that are\ntraditionally performed by the Independent Auditor. The Audit Committee believes that the\nprovision of audit-related services does not impair the independence of the auditor. Other audit-\nrelated services for which the Audit Committee may grant general pre-approval include (1) due\ndiligence services pertaining to potential business acquisitions or dispositions, (2) employee\nbenefit plan audits, (3) agreed-upon or expanded audit procedures related to accounting and/or\nother records required to respond to or comply with financial, accounting or regulatory reporting\nmatters, (4) consultations by management with the Independent Auditor as to the accounting and\n12\ndisclosure treatment of transactions or events and/or the actual or potential impact of final or\nproposed rules, standards or interpretations of the SEC, PCAOB or any other regulatory or\nstandard-setting bodies, (5) internal control reviews, and (6) attestation services not required by\nstatute or regulation. All audit-related services not listed above must be specifically pre-approved\nby the Audit Committee.\nTax Services\nThe Audit Committee believes that the Independent Auditor can provide tax services to the\nCompany, such as tax compliance, tax planning, without impairing the auditor’s independence.\nTax services for which the Audit Committee may grant general pre-approval include (1) tax\nplanning and compliance, and (2) review of income, franchise and other tax returns. All tax\nservices not listed above must be specifically pre-approved by the Audit Committee. In addition,\nall tax services involving large and complex transactions must be specifically pre-approved by the\nAudit Committee. The Audit Committee will consult with the Company’s Chief Financial Officer\nor outside counsel to determine that the tax planning and reporting positions are consistent with\nthis Policy.\nAll Other Services\nThe Audit Committee may pre-approve permissible non-audit services classified as other\nnon-audit services to be provided by the Independent Au as it believes that the provision of services\nwould not impair the independence of the auditor. Due to the nature of these services, all such\nservices must be specifically pre-approved by the Audit Committee.\nProhibited Services\nThe Audit Committee may not engage the Company’s Independent Auditor to provide any\nservice that is prohibited by law or regulation to be provided to an audit client by an independent\nauditor. A list of prohibited non-audit services is attached to this Policy as Exhibit 1. The Audit\nCommittee should consult with the Company’s outside counsel if any question arises as to the\nnature or scope of any prohibited non-audit services, including the applicability of any exceptions.\nPre-Approval Fee Levels or Budgeted Amounts\nThe Audit Committee may consider the amount or range of estimated fees as a factor in\ndetermining whether a proposed service would impair the Independent Auditor’s independence.\nPre-approval fee levels or budgeted amounts for each category of generally pre-approved services\nor specifically pre-approved services to be provided by the Independent Auditor will be established\nannually by the Audit Committee, subject to periodic review of such amounts by the Audit\nCommittee. Any proposed services for which the cost to the Company will materially exceed these\nlevels or amounts will require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee.\nProcedures\nAll requests or applications for services to be provided by the Independent Auditor that do\nnot require specific approval by the Audit Committee will be submitted to the Chief Financial\nOfficer of the Company and must include a detailed description of the services to be rendered. The\n13\nChief Financial Officer will determine, upon consultation with the chairman of the Audit\nCommittee, whether such services are included within the list of services that have received the\ngeneral pre-approval of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee will be informed on a timely\nbasis of any such services rendered by the Independent Auditor.\nRequests or applications to provide services that require specific approval by the Audit\nCommittee will be submitted to the Audit Committee by both the Independent Auditor and the\nChief Financial Officer, and must include a joint statement as to whether, in their view, the request\nor application is consistent with the SEC’s and PCAOB’s rules on auditor independence.\nThe Audit Committee has designated the Chief Financial Officer to assist it in monitoring\nall services provided by the Independent Auditor and determining whether such services are being\nprovided in compliance with this Policy. The Chief Financial Officer will report to the Audit\nCommittee on a periodic basis on the results of its monitoring. Management of the Company will\nimmediately report to the chairman of the Audit Committee any breach of this Policy that comes\nto their attention.\nAdditional Requirements\nThe Audit Committee will take additional measures on an annual basis to meet its\nresponsibility to oversee the work of the Independent Auditor and to assure the Independent\nAuditor’s independence from the Company, such as reviewing a formal written statement from the\nIndependent Auditor delineating all relationships between the Independent Auditor and the\nCompany, and discussing with the Independent Auditor its methods and procedures for ensuring\nindependence.\n[End of Policy]\n14\nEXHIBIT 1\nProhibited Non-Audit Services\n• Preparation of the Company’s consolidated or other financial statements\n• Bookkeeping or other services related to the Company’s accounting records or financial\nstatements\n• Financial information systems design and implementation\n• Appraisal or valuation services, fairness opinions or contribution-in-kind reports\n• Actuarial services\n• Internal audit outsourcing services\n• Management functions\n• Human resources\n• Broker-dealer, investment adviser or investment banking services\n• Legal services\n• Expert services unrelated to the audit\n• Any service involving, directly or indirectly, the payment of any contingent fee or commission\n• Tax services to an officer of the Company whose role is in a financial reporting oversight\ncapacity (regardless of whether the Company or the officer pays the fee for the services)\n• Planning or opining on the tax consequences of a “listed” transaction under U.S. Department\nof Treasury regulations (i.e. tax avoidance transaction)\n• Planning or opining on the tax consequences of a “confidential” transaction under U.S.\nDepartment of Treasury regulations (i.e. tax advice is given under restriction of confidentiality)\n• Planning or opining on a transaction that is based on an “aggressive interpretation” of tax laws\nand regulations, if the transaction was recommended directly or indirectly by the Independent\nAuditor and a significant purpose of the transaction is tax avoidance, unless the proposed tax\ntreatment of the transaction is at least more likely than not to be allowed under current tax laws\n• Any other services prohibited by the PCAOB or the Audit Committee\n15"

          "content": "ANGHAMI INC.\nCorporate Governance Guidelines\nEffective February 03, 2022\nIntroduction; Role of the Board\nThe board of directors (the “Board”) of Anghami Inc. (the “Company”) has adopted these policies as a\ngeneral framework to assist the Board in carrying out its responsibility for the business and affairs of the\nCompany and its subsidiaries to be managed by or under the direction of the Board. The Company will\nreview and amend these guidelines as it deems necessary and appropriate.\nIn addition to other Board or committee responsibilities outlined below, the responsibilities of the Board\ninclude:\nx reviewing, monitoring and approving the overall operating, financial and strategic plans, operating\ngoals and performance of the Company; x selecting, evaluating and retaining the Company’s Chief\nExecutive Officer;\nx reviewing the job performance of elected corporate officers and other senior executives on an annual\nbasis; x reviewing the outside activities of senior executives; x overseeing appropriate policies of\ncorporate conduct and compliance with laws;\nx periodically assessing the effectiveness of policies to facilitate communication between the\nCompany’s shareholders and directors;\nx reviewing the major risks facing the Company and helping develop strategies to address these risks;\nx implementing and overseeing the operation of reasonable information and reporting systems or\ncontrols designed to inform the Board of material risks;\nx reviewing the process by which financial and non-financial information about the Company is\nprovided to management, the Board and the Company’s shareholders; and\nx establishing policies designed to maintain the financial, legal and ethical integrity of the Company.\nThe Company’s senior leaders, under the direction of the Chief Executive Officer, are responsible for the\noperations of the Company; implementation of the strategic, financial, and management policies of the\nCompany; identification, assessment and management of risk and risk mitigation strategies; and preparation\nof financial statements and other reports that accurately reflect requisite information about the Company\nand timely reports which inform the Board about the foregoing matters.\nThese policies are not intended as binding legal obligations or inflexible requirements, and are not intended\nto interpret applicable laws and regulations or modify the Company’s memorandum or articles.\nBoard Composition\nSize of the Board. The Board will periodically review the appropriate size of the Board and may adjust the\nsize of the Board in accordance with the Company’s memorandum and articles.\nMajority of Independent Directors. A majority of the members of the Board must be determined to be\nindependent under the listing rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”), as may be amended from\ntime to time (the “Listing Standards”), as well as other factors not inconsistent with the Listing Standards\nthat the Board considers appropriate for effective oversight and decision-making by the Board. The Board\nalso expects to have one or more management directors, including the Chief Executive Officer.\nAffirmative Determination of Independence. The Board will affirmatively determine annually and at other\ntimes required by the Listing Standards that the directors designated as independent have no material\nrelationships with the Company (either directly or with an organization in which the director is a partner,\nshareholder or officer, or is financially interested) that may interfere with the exercise of their independence\nfrom management and the Company.\nEach independent director is expected to disclose promptly to the Board any existing or proposed\nrelationships with the Company or any of its subsidiaries (other than service as a Board member or on Board\ncommittees) which could affect the independence of the director under the Listing Standards or any\nadditional standards as may be established by the Board from time to time, including direct relationships\nbetween the Company or any of its subsidiaries and the director and his or her family members, and indirect\nrelationships between the Company or any of its subsidiaries and any business, nonprofit or other\norganization in which the director is a general partner or manager, officer, or significant shareholder, or has\na material financial interest.\nDirector Qualifications. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board is responsible\nfor reviewing, on an annual basis, the requisite skills and characteristics required for new Board members\nas well as the composition of the Board as a whole. This assessment will include a review of (i) the criteria\ndeveloped by the committee in accordance with the charter of the Nominating and Corporate Governance\nCommittee of the Board; (ii) qualifications, qualities, skills, and other expertise of a potential candidate’s\nexperience, areas of expertise and other factors relative to the overall composition of the Board and (iii) the\nperiodic review of the Board’s leadership structure and appropriateness of Board membership due to a\nchange in the responsibility individual directors held when they were elected to the Board or for other\nreasons. Nominees for directors will be recommended by the Nominating and Corporate Governance\nCommittee for approval by the full Board.\nTerm Limits. The Board does not believe it should establish term limits. While term limits could help\nensure that there are fresh ideas and viewpoints available to the Board, term limits involve the disadvantage\nof losing the contribution of directors who have been able to develop, over a period of time, increasing\ninsight into the Company or any of its subsidiaries and its operations and, therefore, provide an increasing\ncontribution to the Board as a whole.\nBoard Leadership\nChairman of the Board. The Board will periodically appoint a Chairman of the Board. The Board has no\npolicy with respect to the separation of the offices of Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer, but rather\nbelieves that it is in the best interests of the Company for the Board to make such a determination from time\nto time, including when it elects a Chief Executive Officer.\n2\nDirector Responsibilities\nGeneral Responsibilities. The Board is elected by the shareholders to oversee the long-term health and the\noverall success of the business and its financial strength. The Board serves as the ultimate decisionmaking\nbody of the Company, except for those matters reserved to or shared with the shareholders, and of the\nCompany’s subsidiaries. The Board selects and oversees the members of senior management, who are\ncharged by the Board with conducting the business of the Company and its subsidiaries.\nThe basic responsibility of the directors is to exercise their business judgment to act in what they reasonably\nbelieve to be in the best interests of the Company or any of its subsidiaries and its shareholders. In\ndischarging this obligation, directors should be entitled to rely on the honesty and integrity of the\nCompany’s or any of its subsidiaries’ senior executives and its outside advisors and auditors as to matters\nthe directors reasonably believe to be within such other person’s professional or expert competence and,\nwith respect to outside advisors and auditors, who have been selected with reasonable care by or on behalf\nof the Company or any of its subsidiaries. The directors will also be entitled to be covered by reasonable\ndirectors’ and officers’ liability insurance purchased by the Company or any of its subsidiaries on their\nbehalf; to the benefits of indemnification to the fullest extent permitted by law and by the Company’s\nmemorandum, articles, and any indemnification agreements; and to exculpation as provided by applicable\nlaw and the Company’s memorandum or articles.\nAttendance. Directors are expected to attend, in person or by other means by which all participants can hear\neach other, Board meetings and meetings of Board committees on which they serve; to spend the time\nneeded to discharge their Board duties in a reasonable manner; and to meet as frequently as necessary to\nproperly discharge their responsibilities.\nRecusal from Interested Votes. Directors must disclose to other directors any potential conflicts of interest\nthey may have with respect to any matter under discussion and, if appropriate, refrain from voting on a\nmatter in which they may have a conflict.\nReporting and Compliance Systems. Based on information available to the director, each director should\nbe satisfied that the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ management maintain an effective system for timely\nreporting to the Board or appropriate Board committees on the following: (i) the Company’s and its\nsubsidiaries’ financial and business plans, strategies and objectives; (ii) the recent financial results and\ncondition of the Company and its subsidiaries and their respective business segments; (iii) significant\naccounting, regulatory, competitive, litigation and other external issues affecting the Company or any of its\nsubsidiaries; and (iv) systems of control which promote accurate and timely reporting of financial\ninformation to shareholders and compliance with laws and corporate policies. Based on the information\nfurnished by management or otherwise available to the Board, each director is expected to have a basic\nunderstanding of the foregoing matters.\nBoard Meetings\nAgenda. The Chairman will establish a meeting schedule and the agenda for each Board meeting, with\ndirect input from the Chief Executive Officer (if the Chairman is not the Chief Executive Officer) and other\ndirectors. Meeting lengths will vary as business and discussion dictate. Each director also may raise at any\nregular Board meeting subjects that are not on the agenda for that meeting. The Board will review the\nCompany’s long-term strategic plans and the principal issues that the Company will face in the future during\nat least one Board meeting each year.\n3\nDistribution of Materials. All information relevant to the Board’s understanding of matters to be discussed\nat an upcoming Board meeting should be distributed in writing or electronically to all members in advance,\nwhenever feasible and appropriate. Each director is expected to review this information in advance of the\nmeeting to facilitate the efficient use of meeting time. In preparing this information, management should\nensure that the materials distributed are as concise as possible, yet give directors sufficient information to\nmake informed decisions, and distributed in a timely manner to allow for meaningful review. Particularly\nsensitive matters may be discussed at the meeting without advance distribution of written materials.\nMeetings of Independent Directors. To ensure free and open communication among the independent\ndirectors of the Board, each fiscal year the independent directors will hold one or more regularly scheduled\nexecutive sessions without non-independent directors or management present, at such times and for such\npurposes as the independent directors consider to be appropriate. For the convenience of the directors, these\nmeetings may, but need not, be scheduled to coincide with the dates of regular Board meetings. The\nindependent directors may invite the Company’s independent auditors, legal counsel, other consultants or\nadvisors, finance staff and other employees to attend portions of these meetings.\nBoard Committees\nCommittees. The Board will have an Audit Committee, a Nominating and Corporate Governance\nCommittee, and a Compensation Committee. The Board may, from time to time, establish additional\ncommittees or, subject to compliance with applicable law and the Listing Standards, dissolve or otherwise\nreconfigure existing committees.\nCommittee Member Selection. Committee members will be appointed by the Board, endeavoring to match\nthe committee’s function and needs for expertise with individual skills and experience of appointees to the\ncommittee. Each member of the Audit Committee, Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee,\nand Compensation Committee will be independent as defined in the Listing Standards, laws and regulations,\nsubject to exemptions regarding director independence under U.S. securities laws and rules applicable to\nforeign private issuers and compliance with the reporting obligations to Nasdaq with respect to non-\nindependent directors.\nCommittee Functions. Each of the Audit Committee, Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee,\nand Compensation Committee will have a written charter approved by the Board in compliance with\napplicable Listing Standards, laws and regulations. The Chairman of each committee, in consultation with\nthe committee members, will determine the frequency and length of the committee meetings consistent with\nany requirements set forth in the committee’s charter. The Chairman of each committee, in consultation\nwith the members of the committee and management, will develop the committee’s agenda. At the\nbeginning of each fiscal year, each committee will establish a schedule of agenda subjects to be discussed\nduring the year, to the degree these can be foreseen. The schedule for each committee will be furnished to\nall directors. The Company will afford access to the Company’s employees, professional advisers and other\nresources, if needed, to enable committee members to carry out their responsibilities.\nIndependent Advisors. The Board and each committee have the power to hire independent legal, financial,\nor other advisors as they may deem necessary, without consulting with or obtaining the approval of any\nofficer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries in advance.\nAudit Committee Financial Expert/Financial Literacy. The Audit Committee must have one member that\nqualifies as an “audit committee financial expert” as defined by applicable rules of the Securities and\nExchange Commission under Section 407 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and all members should be\n4\n“financially literate” in accordance with the Listing Standards. The Board shall be responsible for\ndetermining the qualification of an individual to serve on the Audit Committee as a designated “audit\ncommittee financial expert” and whether such person is “financially literate.” In light of this responsibility\nof the Board, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee shall coordinate closely with the Board\nin screening any new candidate and in evaluating whether to re-nominate any existing director who may\nserve in this capacity.\nDirector Access to Leadership, Employees and Independent Advisors\nDirectors have full and free access to officers, employees and books and records of the Company as well as\nto the Company’s outside auditors, legal counsel and other professional advisors, for any purpose\nreasonably related to the Board’s responsibilities. Any meetings or contacts that a director wishes to initiate\nmay be arranged through the Chief Executive Officer or the Secretary or directly by the director. The\ndirectors will use their judgment to ensure that any such contact is not disruptive to the business operations\nof the Company or any of its subsidiaries and will, to the extent not inappropriate, copy the Chief Executive\nOfficer on any written communications between a director and an officer or employee of the Company or\nany of its subsidiaries.\nThe Board, as appropriate in its judgment, will invite senior leaders of the Company or any of its subsidiaries\nto attend Board meetings. If the Chief Executive Officer wishes to have personnel of the Company or any\nof its subsidiaries attend meetings on a regular or periodic basis, this suggestion should be brought to the\nBoard for approval. The Chairman of the Board should extend these invitations.\nThe main responsibility for providing assistance to the Board rests with the Company or any of its\nsubsidiaries. The Board and its committees may seek legal or other expert advice from a source independent\nof management and will be provided with resources for such purposes. Generally, this would be with the\nknowledge of the Chief Executive Officer, but this is not a condition to retaining such advisors.\nDirector Orientation and Continuing Education\nThe Board believes that director education is important to enable the Board to most effectively perform its\nrole in the oversight of management and the affairs of the Company and its subsidiaries. At such time as a\ndirector joins the Board, the Board and the Chief Executive Officer will coordinate to provide appropriate\norientation for the director, including arrangement of meetings with management. Director orientation will\nbe designed to familiarize new directors with the Company’s business and strategic plans, its significant\nfinancial, accounting and risk management issues, its compliance programs, its Code of Business Conduct\nand Ethics, its principal officers, and its internal and external auditors. The Board also considers it desirable\nthat directors participate in continuing education opportunities and will reimburse directors for reasonable\nexpenses as appropriate. The development and oversight of an effective continuing education program for\nthe Board will be delegated to the Company’s Chairman of the Board, who will solicit input from the\nCompany’s management.\nManagement Succession\nThe Board will consider succession planning, including addressing the policies and principles for selecting\na successor to the Chief Executive Officer, both in an emergency situation or retirement and in the ordinary\ncourse of business. The succession plan should include an assessment of the experience, performance,\nskills and planned career paths for possible successors to the Chief Executive Officer. As appropriate, the\nentire Board will work with the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to nominate and\n5\nevaluate potential successors to the Chief Executive Officer. The Chief Executive Officer should at all\ntimes make available his or her recommendations and evaluations of potential successors, along with a\nreview of any development plans recommended for such individuals. The Board will also consider and\nreview succession plans for other senior leaders and will consult with the Chief Executive Officer in\nfulfilling this role.\nManagement Responsibility\nFinancial Reporting and Legal Compliance. The Board’s governance and oversight functions do not relieve\nthe primary responsibilities of the Company’s management to (i) make and keep books, records and\naccounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the\nassets of the Company; (ii) devise and maintain an effective system of internal accounting controls; (iii)\ndevise and maintain internal controls over financial reporting; (iv) prepare financial statements that are\naccurate and complete and fairly present the financial condition, results of operation and cash flows of the\nCompany; and (v) devise and maintain systems, procedures and corporate culture which promote\ncompliance with legal and regulatory requirements and the ethical conduct of the Company’s business.\nCorporate Communications. Management also has the primary responsibility to establish policies\nconcerning the Company’s communications with investors, shareholders, the press, customers, suppliers\nand employees. The Chief Executive Officer and designated management speak for the Company and its\nsubsidiaries, and all inquiries received from the press or others by the Board, any officer or any employee\nshould be referred to the Chief Executive Officer for response.\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics\nThe Company has a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which sets forth the Company’s commitment to\nintegrity and ethical behavior in all aspects of its business activity. These standards are applicable to all\ndirectors, officers and employees, who are required to periodically verify their awareness of, and\ncompliance with, the standards. The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics addresses several areas,\nincluding compliance with law, conflicts of interest, confidentiality of information, protection and proper\nuse of corporate assets and the reporting of any illegal or unethical behavior. Each director, officer and\nemployee is expected to be familiar with and follow the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.\nTransactions Affecting Director Independence\nWithout the prior approval of a majority of disinterested members of the full Board, neither the Company\nnor any of its subsidiaries will make significant charitable contributions to organizations in which a director\nor a family member of the director is affiliated, enter into consulting contracts with (or otherwise provide\nindirect forms of compensation to) a director, or enter into any relationships or transactions (other than\nservice as a director and Board committee member) between the Company or any of its subsidiaries and the\ndirector (or any business or nonprofit entity or organization in which the director is a general partner,\ncontrolling shareholder, officer, manager, or trustee, or has a material financial interest). In addition, the\nCompany and its subsidiaries will at all times comply with all laws and regulations applicable to the\nCompany or any such subsidiaries related to transactions between the Company or any of its subsidiaries\nand related parties, including directors, officers and other affiliated entities.\nAmendment, Modification and Waiver\nThese guidelines may be amended, modified or waived by the Board.\n6\nDisclosure of Guidelines\nThese guidelines will be made available in accordance with applicable rules and regulations.\nAdopted by Resolution of the Board of Directors\nFebruary __, 2022\n7"
