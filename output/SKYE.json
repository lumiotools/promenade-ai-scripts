(Nasdaq: SKYE) (“Skye”), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on unlocking new therapeutic pathways for metabolic health, today announced that it has achieved more than 50% of targeted patient enrollment for its CBeyond™ Phase 2 clinical trial assessing nimacimab, a differentiated CB1 inhibitor, in patients with overweight or obesity. Skye expects to report interim data for the CBeyond™ Phase 2 clinical trial in Q2 2025 after this initial set of enrolled patients has completed the 26-week treatment period.\n\n“We are grateful for the amazing motivation and responsiveness shown by our study participants and clinical investigators in the assessment of this first-in-class drug candidate for weight loss. The current pace of patient enrollment may also shorten our timeline to topline data next year. We will provide a further update after reaching full enrollment,” said Puneet Arora, MD, Skye’s Chief Medical Officer. “This is a rigorous clinical trial evaluating multiple important parameters. We look forward to advancing nimacimab through this program and getting this Phase 2 data next year.”\n\n“CB1 inhibition has been shown in preclinical and clinical studies to have attributes with the potential to play a distinct role in achieving the goal of healthier, more sustainable anti-obesity drug regimens,” said Punit Dhillon, President & Chief Executive Officer. “Within the class, our monoclonal antibody, nimacimab, is the most peripherally restricted CB1 inhibitor, even compared to the most peripherally restricted small molecules. Importantly, our recently [announced](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=oMHunWI3MZGqbH63tWqTHXeU5cweMtnSyx8sQ3U0IKnchzIxLBWWYsnKV8f22Jiqwkb1H_hw0eP06H6phCtEibhGfzokj2a3zEfJMetdcadeTdPH0E4o_lFejfVM9cw_xSn09T5DHUR6iOgLhJXrw1CyU6v87ZVAEZvNCuTxBZQt-hO4p1mUmGkQPD9U7wSnjlzOlrregL07scRQgIBZnw==) preclinical diet-induced obesity model data provides evidence for sufficiency of CB1 inhibition outside the brain to drive meaningful weight loss. We believe the effects of nimacimab in the periphery cause metabolic gains and directly cause fat loss, while modulating hunger and increasing satiety without the need to inhibit CB1 receptors in the brain.\n\nMr. Dhillon added: “With virtually undetectable accumulation in the brain, we believe nimacimab has the best safety profile among CB1 inhibitors. In Phase 1 and preclinical studies of nimacimab, there were no observations of neuropsychiatric adverse events, a risk and outcome that plagues small-molecule CB1 inhibitors with their to-date unavoidable engagement with CB1 in the brain. Notably, nimacimab’s gastrointestinal tolerability far exceeds GLP-1 receptor agonists, and CB1 inhibition has displayed favorable outcomes with respect to lean mass preservation. With these attributes, we believe nimacimab is well-positioned to play a breakthrough role in realizing the therapeutic benefits of CB1 inhibition as an important non-incretin alternative.”\n\n**CBeyond™****Phase 2 Clinical Trial Design**\n\nThis clinical trial is a randomized, double-blind study designed to enroll 120 patients across four treatment groups. The primary endpoint will evaluate the difference in weight loss of nimacimab compared to placebo. An exploratory endpoint will assess a combination of nimacimab and Wegovy® compared to placebo and Wegovy®.\n\nSecondary and other exploratory endpoints will assess safety and tolerability; neuropsychiatric and cognitive outcomes; change in body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA); metabolic parameters; and improvement in sleep.\n\n**About Skye Bioscience**\n\nSkye is focused on unlocking new therapeutic pathways for metabolic health through the development of next-generation molecules that modulate G-protein coupled receptors.

(NASDAQ: SKYE) (“Skye” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on unlocking new therapeutic pathways for metabolic health, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and highlighted recent corporate achievements.\n\n“The third quarter marked an important transition for Skye as a metabolic-focused company with the launch of our Phase 2 obesity clinical trial for nimacimab. We believe our truly peripherally-restricted CB1 inhibitor has the differentiated attributes necessary to realize the unique benefits of this class of drug within the overall obesity landscape,” said Punit Dhillon, CEO of Skye. “We also recently announced new preclinical data from a diet-induced obesity (DIO) model in mice. Nimacimab achieved significant dose-dependent weight loss of up to 16% compared to vehicle, highlighting the prominent role of peripherally-driven CB1 inhibition to induce weight loss and other metabolic benefits without relying on central CB1 inhibition and its risk of neuropsychiatric adverse events.\n\n“In the first half of the year we built on the foundation of the company in terms of people, capital, systems and preparation. Now we are focused on executing our development and clinical milestones in 2025, including interim Phase 2 data in Q2 of 2025.”\n\n**Key Corporate and Clinical Program Highlights**\n\n**_CBeyond Phase 2 Obesity Trial for Peripheral CB1 Inhibitor Advancing_**\n\nSkye started enrolling patients in its Phase 2 study of nimacimab in August 2024. Nimacimab, a first-in-class CB1-inhibiting monoclonal antibody, is a negative allosteric modulator that acts as both an inverse agonist and antagonist. Study design:\n\n  * Randomized, doubled-blind, placebo-controlled\n  * Primary endpoint: designed to demonstrate an 8% difference in mean weight loss of nimacimab versus placebo at 26 weeks, with 13 weeks of follow-up\n  * Secondary and exploratory endpoints will evaluate safety, tolerability, neuropsychiatric and cognitive outcomes, and change in body composition by DEXA, and is also assessing synergistic outcomes when nimacimab is combined with semaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist\n  * Interim data targeted for Q2 2025: 50% enrollment of planned 120 patients after 26 weeks of treatment\n  * Topline data targeted for Q4 2025 after full enrollment. \n\n\n\n**_New Preclinical Data Provides Insight into Mechanism of CB1 Inhibition and Nimacimab_**\n\nTo evaluate and provide more insight into the mechanisms of CB1 inhibition and the unique elements of its differentiated CB1 inhibitor, Skye developed a novel diet-induced obesity (DIO) model. Results:\n\n  * DIO model uses a transgenic mouse expressing the human CB1 receptor (hCB1R)\n  * Dose-dependent weight loss with nimacimab of 4.5%, 11.4% and 16.0% compared to vehicle\n  * Significant fat mass loss with lean mass preservation\n  * Dose-dependent improvement in glucose tolerance\n  * Preliminary results provide first direct evidence supporting hypothesis that peripheral CB1 inhibition is the primary driver of weight loss whereas central CB1 inhibition contributes minimally to efficacy yet promotes neuropsychiatric adverse events. Further data will be forthcoming. A recording of this presentation, conducted as a satellite event at ObesityWeek 2024, is available [here](https://ir.skyebioscience.com/obesityweek-2024-satelite-event-presentation). \n\n\n\n**_Corporate Highlights_**\n\n  * Skye appointed Dr. Puneet Arora as its Chief Medical Officer. Dr. Arora is an endocrinologist with extensive metabolic experience.\n  * Skye recently announced the appointment of Paul Grayson as its new Chairman of the Board.\n  * Subsequent to quarter end, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth District vacated the judgment with respect to an outstanding litigation matter. As a result, the Company will be able to recover the $9 million restriction on its cash related to the appeal bond, which is expected to be released before year-end. \n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights:**\n\n**Cash Position:** Cash and cash equivalents totaled $76.5 million, including restricted cash of $9.1 million on September 30, 2024. The Company expects its current capital to fund projected operations through Q3 2027.\n\n**R &D Expenses:** Research and development (R&D) expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $4.9 million, as compared to $1.3 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to contracted clinical and manufacturing costs associated with our Phase 2 clinical trial for nimacimab in obesity. The remainder of the increase resulted from increases in employee benefits, travel, and consulting fees driven by increases in headcount.\n\n**G &A Expenses: **General and administrative (G&A) expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $4.6 million, as compared to $2.2 million for the same period in 2023. The increases were primarily related to non-cash incentive stock-based compensation, professional services and fees for tax, audit, and legal services related to our required regulatory filings, financial advisory services, and patent prosecution for the nimacimab IP. These costs were offset by a period over period decrease in litigation related legal fees.\n\n**Net Loss:** Net loss for the third quarter of 2024 totaled $3.9 million, with non-cash share-based compensation expense of $1.9 million, compared to $24.9 million for the third quarter of 2023, with non-cash share-based compensation expense of $0.2 million. The primary reason for the significant decrease related to the acquisition of the nimacimab in-process research and development asset, for $21.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023, all of which was expensed upon acquisition. In addition, we recognized $1 million in interest income and $4.6 million in income from the partial derecognition of liabilities and the recovery of losses related to our legal proceedings.\n\n**Conference Call Details**\n\nSkye will host a conference call to discuss its results at 1:30 p.m. PT/4:30 p.m. ET today, November 7th. The live webcast of the call can be accessed at the Skye [Investor Relations](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=UduX0p0o4KKmyMWXSnJmNDdd04CtvlWrc6S8O4ngq3FB4-JLfNs99HK8peigmAay0c9d2Nn_OCkZ_gAwZxxHpBenVF3kYcDySGEkwMEy_OavKNziL3dgYCN_GHFyxy6T) website, along with the company's earnings press release, financial tables, and investor presentation.

(NASDAQ: SKYE) (“Skye” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on unlocking new therapeutic pathways for metabolic health, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and highlighted recent corporate achievements.\n\n“The third quarter marked an important transition for Skye as a metabolic-focused company with the launch of our Phase 2 obesity clinical trial for nimacimab. We believe our truly peripherally-restricted CB1 inhibitor has the differentiated attributes necessary to realize the unique benefits of this class of drug within the overall obesity landscape,” said Punit Dhillon, CEO of Skye. “We also recently announced new preclinical data from a diet-induced obesity (DIO) model in mice. Nimacimab achieved significant dose-dependent weight loss of up to 16% compared to vehicle, highlighting the prominent role of peripherally-driven CB1 inhibition to induce weight loss and other metabolic benefits without relying on central CB1 inhibition and its risk of neuropsychiatric adverse events.\n\n“In the first half of the year we built on the foundation of the company in terms of people, capital, systems and preparation. Now we are focused on executing our development and clinical milestones in 2025, including interim Phase 2 data in Q2 of 2025.”\n\n**Key Corporate and Clinical Program Highlights**\n\n**_CBeyond Phase 2 Obesity Trial for Peripheral CB1 Inhibitor Advancing_**\n\nSkye started enrolling patients in its Phase 2 study of nimacimab in August 2024. Nimacimab, a first-in-class CB1-inhibiting monoclonal antibody, is a negative allosteric modulator that acts as both an inverse agonist and antagonist. Study design:\n\n  * Randomized, doubled-blind, placebo-controlled\n  * Primary endpoint: designed to demonstrate an 8% difference in mean weight loss of nimacimab versus placebo at 26 weeks, with 13 weeks of follow-up\n  * Secondary and exploratory endpoints will evaluate safety, tolerability, neuropsychiatric and cognitive outcomes, and change in body composition by DEXA, and is also assessing synergistic outcomes when nimacimab is combined with semaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist\n  * Interim data targeted for Q2 2025: 50% enrollment of planned 120 patients after 26 weeks of treatment\n  * Topline data targeted for Q4 2025 after full enrollment. \n\n\n\n**_New Preclinical Data Provides Insight into Mechanism of CB1 Inhibition and Nimacimab_**\n\nTo evaluate and provide more insight into the mechanisms of CB1 inhibition and the unique elements of its differentiated CB1 inhibitor, Skye developed a novel diet-induced obesity (DIO) model. Results:\n\n  * DIO model uses a transgenic mouse expressing the human CB1 receptor (hCB1R)\n  * Dose-dependent weight loss with nimacimab of 4.5%, 11.4% and 16.0% compared to vehicle\n  * Significant fat mass loss with lean mass preservation\n  * Dose-dependent improvement in glucose tolerance\n  * Preliminary results provide first direct evidence supporting hypothesis that peripheral CB1 inhibition is the primary driver of weight loss whereas central CB1 inhibition contributes minimally to efficacy yet promotes neuropsychiatric adverse events. Further data will be forthcoming. A recording of this presentation, conducted as a satellite event at ObesityWeek 2024, is available [here](https://ir.skyebioscience.com/obesityweek-2024-satelite-event-presentation). \n\n\n\n**_Corporate Highlights_**\n\n  * Skye appointed Dr. Puneet Arora as its Chief Medical Officer. Dr. Arora is an endocrinologist with extensive metabolic experience.\n  * Skye recently announced the appointment of Paul Grayson as its new Chairman of the Board.\n  * Subsequent to quarter end, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth District vacated the judgment with respect to an outstanding litigation matter. As a result, the Company will be able to recover the $9 million restriction on its cash related to the appeal bond, which is expected to be released before year-end. \n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights:**\n\n**Cash Position:** Cash and cash equivalents totaled $76.5 million, including restricted cash of $9.1 million on September 30, 2024. The Company expects its current capital to fund projected operations through Q3 2027.\n\n**R &D Expenses:** Research and development (R&D) expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $4.9 million, as compared to $1.3 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to contracted clinical and manufacturing costs associated with our Phase 2 clinical trial for nimacimab in obesity. The remainder of the increase resulted from increases in employee benefits, travel, and consulting fees driven by increases in headcount.\n\n**G &A Expenses: **General and administrative (G&A) expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $4.6 million, as compared to $2.2 million for the same period in 2023. The increases were primarily related to non-cash incentive stock-based compensation, professional services and fees for tax, audit, and legal services related to our required regulatory filings, financial advisory services, and patent prosecution for the nimacimab IP. These costs were offset by a period over period decrease in litigation related legal fees.\n\n**Net Loss:** Net loss for the third quarter of 2024 totaled $3.9 million, with non-cash share-based compensation expense of $1.9 million, compared to $24.9 million for the third quarter of 2023, with non-cash share-based compensation expense of $0.2 million. The primary reason for the significant decrease related to the acquisition of the nimacimab in-process research and development asset, for $21.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023, all of which was expensed upon acquisition. In addition, we recognized $1 million in interest income and $4.6 million in income from the partial derecognition of liabilities and the recovery of losses related to our legal proceedings.\n\n**Conference Call Details**\n\nSkye will host a conference call to discuss its results at 1:30 p.m. PT/4:30 p.m. ET today, November 7th. The live webcast of the call can be accessed at the Skye [Investor Relations](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=UduX0p0o4KKmyMWXSnJmNDdd04CtvlWrc6S8O4ngq3FB4-JLfNs99HK8peigmAay0c9d2Nn_OCkZ_gAwZxxHpBenVF3kYcDySGEkwMEy_OavKNziL3dgYCN_GHFyxy6T) website, along with the company's earnings press release, financial tables, and investor presentation.

          "content": "November 7, 2024\nSkye Bioscience Reports Third Quarter\n2024 Financial Results and Recent\nHighlights\nSAN DIEGO, Nov. 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Skye Bioscience, Inc. (NASDAQ:\nSKYE) (“Skye” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on\nunlocking new therapeutic pathways for metabolic health, today reported financial results for\nthe third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and highlighted recent corporate\nachievements.\n“The third quarter marked an important transition for Skye as a metabolic-focused company\nwith the launch of our Phase 2 obesity clinical trial for nimacimab. We believe our truly\nperipherally-restricted CB1 inhibitor has the differentiated attributes necessary to realize the\nunique benefits of this class of drug within the overall obesity landscape,” said Punit Dhillon,\nCEO of Skye. “We also recently announced new preclinical data from a diet-induced obesity\n(DIO) model in mice. Nimacimab achieved significant dose-dependent weight loss of up to\n16% compared to vehicle, highlighting the prominent role of peripherally-driven CB1\ninhibition to induce weight loss and other metabolic benefits without relying on central CB1\ninhibition and its risk of neuropsychiatric adverse events.\n“In the first half of the year we built on the foundation of the company in terms of people,\ncapital, systems and preparation. Now we are focused on executing our development and\nclinical milestones in 2025, including interim Phase 2 data in Q2 of 2025.”\nKey Corporate and Clinical Program Highlights\nCBeyond Phase 2 Obesity Trial for Peripheral CB1 Inhibitor Advancing\nSkye started enrolling patients in its Phase 2 study of nimacimab in August 2024.\nNimacimab, a first-in-class CB1-inhibiting monoclonal antibody, is a negative allosteric\nmodulator that acts as both an inverse agonist and antagonist. Study design:\nRandomized, doubled-blind, placebo-controlled\nPrimary endpoint: designed to demonstrate an 8% difference in mean weight loss of\nnimacimab versus placebo at 26 weeks, with 13 weeks of follow-up\nSecondary and exploratory endpoints will evaluate safety, tolerability, neuropsychiatric\nand cognitive outcomes, and change in body composition by DEXA, and is also\nassessing synergistic outcomes when nimacimab is combined with semaglutide, a\nGLP-1 receptor agonist\nInterim data targeted for Q2 2025: 50% enrollment of planned 120 patients after 26\nweeks of treatment\nTopline data targeted for Q4 2025 after full enrollment.\nNew Preclinical Data Provides Insight into Mechanism of CB1 Inhibition and\nNimacimab\nTo evaluate and provide more insight into the mechanisms of CB1 inhibition and the unique\nelements of its differentiated CB1 inhibitor, Skye developed a novel diet-induced obesity\n(DIO) model. Results:\nDIO model uses a transgenic mouse expressing the human CB1 receptor (hCB1R)\nDose-dependent weight loss with nimacimab of 4.5%, 11.4% and 16.0% compared to\nvehicle\nSignificant fat mass loss with lean mass preservation\nDose-dependent improvement in glucose tolerance\nPreliminary results provide first direct evidence supporting hypothesis that peripheral\nCB1 inhibition is the primary driver of weight loss whereas central CB1 inhibition\ncontributes minimally to efficacy yet promotes neuropsychiatric adverse events.\nFurther data will be forthcoming. A recording of this presentation, conducted as a\nsatellite event at ObesityWeek 2024, is available here.\nCorporate Highlights\nSkye appointed Dr. Puneet Arora as its Chief Medical Officer. Dr. Arora is an\nendocrinologist with extensive metabolic experience.\nSkye recently announced the appointment of Paul Grayson as its new Chairman of the\nBoard.\nSubsequent to quarter end, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth District\nvacated the judgment with respect to an outstanding litigation matter. As a result, the\nCompany will be able to recover the $9 million restriction on its cash related to the\nappeal bond, which is expected to be released before year-end.\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights:\nCash Position: Cash and cash equivalents totaled $76.5 million, including restricted cash of\n$9.1 million on September 30, 2024. The Company expects its current capital to fund\nprojected operations through Q3 2027.\nR&D Expenses: Research and development (R&D) expenses for the third quarter of 2024\nwere $4.9 million, as compared to $1.3 million for the same period in 2023. The increase\nwas primarily due to contracted clinical and manufacturing costs associated with our Phase\n2 clinical trial for nimacimab in obesity. The remainder of the increase resulted from\nincreases in employee benefits, travel, and consulting fees driven by increases in\nheadcount.\nG&A Expenses: General and administrative (G&A) expenses for the third quarter of 2024\nwere $4.6 million, as compared to $2.2 million for the same period in 2023. The increases\nwere primarily related to non-cash incentive stock-based compensation, professional\nservices and fees for tax, audit, and legal services related to our required regulatory filings,\nfinancial advisory services, and patent prosecution for the nimacimab IP. These costs were\noffset by a period over period decrease in litigation related legal fees.\nNet Loss: Net loss for the third quarter of 2024 totaled $3.9 million, with non-cash share-\nbased compensation expense of $1.9 million, compared to $24.9 million for the third quarter\nof 2023, with non-cash share-based compensation expense of $0.2 million. The primary\nreason for the significant decrease related to the acquisition of the nimacimab in-process\nresearch and development asset, for $21.2 million during the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, all of which was expensed upon acquisition. In addition, we recognized\n$1 million in interest income and $4.6 million in income from the partial derecognition of\nliabilities and the recovery of losses related to our legal proceedings.\nConference Call Details\nSkye will host a conference call to discuss its results at 1:30 p.m. PT/4:30 p.m. ET today,\nNovember 7th. The live webcast of the call can be accessed at the Skye Investor Relations\nwebsite, along with the company's earnings press release, financial tables, and investor\npresentation. Following the call, a replay and transcript will be available at the same website.\nAbout Skye Bioscience\nSkye is focused on unlocking new therapeutic pathways for metabolic health through the\ndevelopment of next-generation molecules that modulate G-protein-coupled receptors.\nSkye's strategy leverages biologic targets with substantial human proof of mechanism for the\ndevelopment of first-in-class therapeutics with clinical and commercial differentiation.

Thank you for joining us on Skye's first\nearnings call and we appreciate your continued interest in Skye and your support for\nour journey focused on developing metabolic medicine that we believe is relevant to the\nmarket and has the potential to be impactful for patients.\nThe third quarter and periods subsequent to the quarter have been momentous on the\nclinical front and with respect to new preclinical data, and I'll provide an update on\nthese accomplishments in an overall strategic context and ongoing efforts across our\nprograms and operations.\nWe believe that the utility of the incretin mimetic drugs still begs improvement with\nrespect to tolerability, lean mass preservation and the sustainability of using such\nweight-loss drugs. The pharmaceutical obesity drug leaders themselves have been\nSkye Bioscience, Inc.\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call\nacknowledging this need and the potential importance of non-incretin mechanisms via\nmultiple announced acquisitions and partnerships.\nWe believe that CB1 inhibition has mechanistic attributes and potential clinical\noutcomes that position it as a promising complement or alternative to incretin mimetics\nsuch as GLP-1 receptor agonists.\nThe history of CB1 inhibition mechanism has provided promising clinical evidence of its\nutility. However, there's also been concerning neuropsychiatric adverse events\nassociated with the first- and second-generation small molecules employing this\nmechanism.\nHence, we face an exercise to reset the evidence and discussion around the CB1 class of\ndrugs. And we do this by conducting research and conveying data that delineates the\nrole and requirement of peripheral versus central CB1 inhibition and we also do this by\nhighlighting the importance of differentiating outcomes that can potentially be realized\nfrom CB1 inhibition based on the distinguished approach of a monoclonal antibody,\nsuch as Skye's nimacimab, versus the original approach of small molecules.\nWe recently have made an important stride to contribute to this knowledge base and\ndiscussion. So let me first delve into our newly announced preclinical data and then I'll\nupdate you on our Phase 2 obesity clinical trial.\nJust days ago, we issued a news release and conducted a satellite event at ObesityWeek\nwith our science team and KOLs that highlighted compelling preclinical data showing\nthe prominent role played by peripheral CB1 inhibition and the lack of need for central\nCB1 inhibition to achieve significant dose-dependent weight loss.\nWe believe this was the first-ever publishing of such evidence using a virtually\ncompletely peripherally-restricted CB1 inhibitor. We believe this data is important\nbecause even though first- and second-generation small molecule CB1 inhibitors have\nboth achieved clinically-relevant weight loss, the data does not indicate the weight loss\nwas driven by central CB1 inhibition.\nSkye Bioscience, Inc.\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call\nYet their accumulation in the brain induced neuropsychiatric adverse events, serious in\nthe case of rimonabant, mild to moderate in the recently reported case of\nmonlunabant, and these small molecule CB1 inhibitors collectively caused adverse\nevents ranging from suicidality and depression to anxiety, irritability and sleep\ndisturbances.\nIn contrast, data from the prior Phase 1 and comprehensive non-human primate studies\nfor Skye's nimacimab, which is virtually undetectable in the central nervous system and\nis to our knowledge the most peripherally-restricted CB1 inhibitor, showed no\nneuropsychiatric adverse events.\nI will also emphasize that, referencing back to the high incidence of gastrointestinal\nconcerns with GLP-1 receptor agonists, in the Phase 1 study of nimacimab, the\nincidence of GI adverse events was below 5%.\nTo repeat simply: we believe you need peripheral CB1 inhibition and that you do not\nneed central CB1 inhibition. If a CB1 inhibitor has exposure to the brain, it could create\nneuropsychiatric adverse events and we don't think most observers view even mild to\nmoderate neuropsychiatric adverse events as being acceptable in the context of a drug\nthat must be used for extended periods and in maintenance mode potentially forever.\nThese limitations of small molecules underscore the need for a new approach of a novel\nmolecule such as nimacimab.\nBy the way, I encourage you to watch the video at the ObesityWeek event, which is now\nposted on our website.\nWith the distinct positioning of nimacimab within the class of CB1 inhibitors and with\nthe compelling new insight from our preclinical work, we could not have greater\nenthusiasm and energy to advance this program. With our human CB1 knock-in model\nup and running, we have an ongoing research program to explore different parameters\nrelated to nimacimab alone and in combination to arrive at further insight regarding\nCB1 inhibition and nimacimab.\nAnd we're applying maximum effort to what is obviously a vital outcome on translating\nthis into the clinic - Phase 2 data. I can tell you that our Phase 2 obesity clinical trial,\nSkye Bioscience, Inc.\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call\nnamed CBeyondTM, which started enrolling patients in August throughout the U.S., is\nenrolling very well. The study's tracking towards our anticipated goal of announcing\ninterim data at 50% enrollment of the planned 120 patients after 26 weeks of treatment\nin Q2 next year and topline data after full enrollment by the end of 2025.\nCBeyondTM is a randomized, double-blind study that is designed to demonstrate an 8%\ndifference in mean weight loss using nimacimab versus placebo at 26 weeks. Secondary\nand exploratory endpoints will evaluate safety, tolerability, neuropsychiatric and\ncognitive outcomes, and change in body composition by DEXA. The study is also\nassessing synergistic outcomes when nimacimab is combined with semaglutide, a GLP-1\nreceptor agonist.\nSuccessful execution of the CBeyond trial will help refine our clinical development\nstrategy, but also establish a counterpoint to the safety concerns that have been\nclaimed against this class of drugs as a result of the small molecule CB1 inhibitors.\nWe believe that the Phase 2 CBeyond trial will recapitulate the Phase 1 safety data for\nnimacimab and establish that a truly perfectly restricted antibody can drive significant\nweight loss without neuropsychiatric liability.\nOur objective is to demonstrate clinical proof-of-concept supporting our options to\ninitiate a Phase 2b trial and/or advance closer to Phase 3 readiness and position\nnimacimab as a strong candidate in the anti-obesity medication landscape. These\nefforts are fully aligned with our broad goal of establishing Skye as a leader in non-\nincretin metabolic therapies.\nBeyond these primary initiatives, we are naturally looking towards the horizon and\nlaying a foundation for a comprehensive and differentiated clinical pipeline and\ntherapeutic footprint in the metabolic health space.\nOur multiple initiatives include, first, pursuing key preclinical work to further\nunderstand pertinent metabolic-related mechanisms. Second, we want to optimize\nnimacimab's clinical profile to ensure efficacy, safety and ultimately market\npenetration. And third, we're advancing the evaluation of additional GPCR targets that\naddress the complexity of various metabolic pathways with the focus on really\nSkye Bioscience, Inc.\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call\ncomplementing nimacimab's mechanism of action and evaluating combinations of\ndifferent drug targets.\nOur goal is to create therapies that are not only effective, but also capable of providing\na multimodal mechanism for treating comorbidities of obesity safely and sustainably.\nSupporting this is long-term adherence to pharmacotherapy and safety, which are\ncrucial, particularly for chronic disease management. We look forward to sharing more\non these initiatives in 2025.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Kaitlyn, our CFO.\nKaitlyn Arsenault^ Thanks, Punit. After the market closed today, we issued a news\nrelease and filed Skye's Form 10-Q filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,\noutlining our third quarter financials. We encourage you to reference the filing for\ndetails of our financials and the risk factors described in our other filings with the SEC.\nI will now provide a brief overview of key financial results for the third quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2024. Research and development expenses for the third quarter of 2024\nwere $4.9 million, as compared to $1.3 million for the same period in 2023. The increase\nof approximately $3.6 million was primarily due to contracted clinical and\nmanufacturing costs associated with our Phase 2 clinical trial for nimacimab and\nobesity. The remainder of the increase resulted from increases in employee benefits,\ntravel and consulting fees driven by increases in headcounts.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the third quarter were $4.6 million, compared\nto $2.2 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases\nin non-cash incentive stock-based compensation, professional services, and fees for tax,\naudit and legal services related to our required regulatory filings, financial advisory\nservices and patent prosecution for the nimacimab IP. These costs were offset by a\nperiod-over-period decrease in litigation-related fees.\nThe net loss for the third quarter of 2024 totaled $3.9 million and included non-cash\nshare-based compensation expense of $1.9 million, compared to a $24.9 million net loss\nfor the third quarter of 2023, including non-cash share-based compensation expense of\n$0.2 million. The primary reason for the significant decrease related to the acquisition\nSkye Bioscience, Inc.\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call\nof the nimacimab in-process research and development asset for $21.2 million during\nthe three months ended September 30, 2023, all of which was expensed upon\nacquisition. In addition, we recognized $1 million in interest income and $4.6 million in\nincome from the partial derecognition of liabilities and the recovery of losses related to\nour legal proceedings.\nOn September 30, 2024, Skye had cash and cash equivalents of $76.5 million, including\nits restricted cash. During the third quarter, our $5 million note was converted into\nshares of Skye common stock and subsequent to quarter end, the United States Court\nof Appeals for the Ninth District vacated the judgment with respect to an outstanding\nlitigation matter. As a result, the company will be able to recover the $9 million\nrestriction on its cash related to the appeal bond, which is expected to be released\nbefore year end.\nWe are currently burning approximately $6 million per quarter, which we expect to\nincrease to approximately $9 million per quarter in 2025. We believe that our capital will\nfund our Phase 2 clinical trial for nimacimab and operations through the third quarter\nof 2027, extending our runway one quarter past our last estimate. Our priority is high-\nvalue metabolic programs, and we believe that this strong financial footing allows us to\nfocus on reaching critical milestones without financial constraints.\nI'll now turn the call back over to Punit.\nPunit Dhillon^ Thank you, Kait. I want to highlight that we have purposefully worked to\nmaintain an effective but relatively small team of well-qualified individuals who possess\nthe right expertise and experience and who are focused and motivated. We strive every\nday to make good strategic and tactical decisions while being unafraid to move forward\non steps that will expedite our journey to get to data and answer hard questions that\ncould potentially represent important inflection points.\nIt's important to emphasize that our primary focus is on the regulatory approval\nstrategy and execution for nimacimab and the treatment of obesity.\nSkye Bioscience, Inc.\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call\nThe second is advancing opportunities with nimacimab in the clinic and evaluating\nother metabolic diseases, and we have a foundation on the preclinical model we\nhighlighted in yesterday's announcement.\nThe third is to expand the pipeline to broaden our metabolic targets.\nSo we're conscious about effective spending and always consider value rather than\nsimply cost, and we're driven to have a cohesive but critical team advancing towards\nthe milestones that we've laid out for our company and its stakeholders. We are\ngenuinely focused on creating value for patients and for our shareholders.\nWith this overarching view, our team numbers 17 at this point, and in the third quarter,\nwe added Dr. Puneet Arora, our Chief Medical Officer. Dr. Arora is an endocrinologist\nwith extensive metabolic experience. Since he started in early September, he has hit the\nground running and has already made important contributions.\nWe've also aimed to have relevant and demanding but constructive Board members.\nAfter evolving the board earlier this year, in the third quarter we added Karen Smith as\na new director. She has significant global biotech and pharmaceutical experience. Paul\nGrayson has also expanded his board role to become Chairman, and we congratulate\nhim on that important step.\nWe also rely on very competent service providers to execute key initiatives in the\nrespective key functions of our company.\nWe have a sharp focus to strengthen the team and systems that allow us to move\nforward, and our team's resilience, focus and pursuit of innovation have enabled us to\nadvance rapidly in this exciting and dynamic space. And that is the essence as we move\nforward.\nSo, to quickly recap, we believe nimacimab's first-in-class profile as a peripherally\ntargeting CB1 inhibitor offers the right combination of efficacy and safety that position\nit to realize a significant opportunity for CB1 inhibition to drive meaningful dose-\ndependent weight loss, fat mass reduction and lean mass preservation, improve\nSkye Bioscience, Inc.\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call\nglycemic control in weight loss, and achieve other metabolic benefits, all without\ncrossing into the central nervous system and risking neuropsychiatric adverse events.\nWe view Skye as having the right combination of attributes to lead to the emergence of\nCB1 inhibition as an important additional mechanism in the obesity landscape and to\nplay a broader role in enhancing metabolic health.\nShareholders can expect that since launching our CBeyond clinical trial in Q3 2024, our\ngoal is to achieve our Phase 2 clinical milestones while also advancing the necessary\nregulatory and manufacturing steps to prepare nimacimab for late-stage clinical\ndevelopment.\nWe have a comprehensive strategic roadmap that over the next three years positions us\nto deliver key clinical and preclinical data and lays the long-term foundation. And we are\nmore optimistic than ever about our strategic path forward.\nI want to thank our investors, employees, development partners, and our clinicians and\npatients for helping us advance our mission. Together, we're building a future where\nimpactful new treatments in metabolic health can become a reality.\nThis concludes our prepared comments for today. Thank you very much for joining us\nand we'll now open the call for questions from our covering sell-side analysts.\nOperator, over to you.\nOperator^ Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of\nEdward Tenthoff with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nPunit Dhillon^ Hi, Ed.\nEdward Tenthoff^ Great. Thank you so much for the update and I'm really excited with\nall of the progress. I'm looking forward to the data next year.\nI wanted to ask, just in terms of CBeyond, can you give a little more color on how\nenrollment is going? Is there excitement around this? I have to mention, especially with\nSkye Bioscience, Inc.\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call\nthe potential of combining mechanisms. And when it comes to the data that we could\nget, the interim data look, I know you've given a sense of what we should expect in\nterms of monotherapy weight loss from nimacimab. What do you think we should be\nexpecting in terms of combination data, since there will be really only kind of a few\npatients, half of the patients, probably around 10 per arm at that point? Thanks so\nmuch.\nPunit Dhillon^ Yeah. Ted, thanks for joining the call and I appreciate seeing you earlier\nin the week at the ObesityWeek event. Yeah, so on the direct question on operations,\nwe're executing very well on the CBeyond Phase 2 obesity study. The study has 18 sites\nacross the U.S., which include some notable academic centers, with the exception of\nthree sites. 15 sites are actively recruiting. Regarding enrollment, we're enrolling really\nwell. I think we're on track to have 50% enrollment before year-end.\nAnd I think on the finer point of what we expect in terms of data, the monotherapy is\nwhere the primary power is of the study. So the primary endpoint is 8% weight loss,\nplacebo-adjusted. But the exploratory endpoint is looking at the combination with a\nGLP-1 receptor agonist with semaglutide and there we're looking for an additive or\nsynergistic kind of a weight response. So it should be higher and hopefully demonstrate\nimproved tolerability.\nI think, overall, our purpose behind this study has really been about the robustness of a\nstudy plan, where we're asking all the critical questions of weight loss, of body\ncomposition, of durability across three active arms, right? So we have the monotherapy\narm and then the Wegovy arm, and then the Wegovy plus the nimacimab arm, and then\ncomparing that against placebo over 26 weeks -- as well as the 13-week follow-up.\nSo when you think about it kind of collectively with what's happening in the space, we\nbelieve it's going to be the key data point, the key next data point, not only in the CB1\nclass, but overall in the non-incretin classes, as well as this important data point that\nyou highlight in terms of the combination. So I think that should be quite exciting in\nterms of what we've been seeing so far coming off of ObesityWeek and then into the\nupcoming scientific meetings that are happening in 2025.\nSkye Bioscience, Inc.\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call\nEdward Tenthoff^ Great. That's super helpful. I'm really excited to see the data. Thanks\nso much.\nOperator^ Our next question comes from the line of Jay Olson with Oppenheimer. Your\nline is open.\nJay Olson^ Oh, hey. Congrats on all the progress and thanks for providing this update.\nWe have a few questions, maybe just to start. Can you discuss any KOL feedback from\nthe preclinical data you presented at ObesityWeek at your satellite event, and especially\nwith regards to the body composition findings in your preclinical model and potential to\npreserve lean muscle mass, and any physician reactions to those findings? And then we\nhave follow-up.\nPunit Dhillon^ Yeah. Thanks, Jay. I appreciate your coverage of that event. The key\nthing, the finer technical points that we established at the meeting were really\ndistinguishing between the peripheral versus central CB1 inhibition - that peripheral\nCB1 inhibition is not only necessary, but sufficient for weight loss.\nAnd in terms of the KOL feedback, I think it's a much broader appreciation relative to\nthe backdrop of the monlunabant data. So if we go back about six weeks with the\nmonlunabant data, it basically revealed that central CB1 inhibition leads to adverse\nneuropsychiatric effects and without any additional benefit in terms of dose response.\nSo our event, I think, covered some very important background in terms of the\nsufficiency of peripheral response that the PK modeling that Chris shared in detail [at\nthe ObesityWeek satellite presentation] showed that there's effective peripheral CB1\ninhibition that's required in order to get the efficacy that we're looking at.\nWhen we're looking at concentrations above IC90, with nimacimab we're not seeing any\nof the exposure in the brain. And based on the modeling that he presented, small\nmolecules are exceeding IC90 in the brain at the mid and high doses. And I think that\nhas really helped in terms of conveying the mechanism understanding with KOLs.\nDr. Aronne was at the event and I think he disclosed that he's an advisor to Novo. So I\nthink he has been very, I think, impressed with the peripheral restriction of nimacimab.\nSkye Bioscience, Inc.\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call\nWe encourage everyone to watch the overall event or look at the slides and you can\nkind of get into all of the details that I'm explaining here.\nBut the key takeaway is that, there's really strong preclinical efficacy of nimacimab. It's\ndemonstrating significant dose-dependent weight loss and it's shown this improvement\nin terms of glucose metabolism, as well as lean mass preservation. So it's pointing\ntowards a favorable impact on body composition as well.\nJay Olson^ Great. That's super helpful. Thank you for that. And then just to follow up on\nyour earlier comment that the focus of the CBeyond study will be on the monotherapy\ntreatment with nimacimab. I guess just from a commercial perspective, how are you\nviewing the path forward for combinations of GLP-1 drugs with nimacimab in the\ntreatment landscape and that opportunity as it compares to the monotherapy\ntreatment opportunity in the commercial setting? Thank you.\nPunit Dhillon^ Yeah. It's a great question. I think it's clear that the field is really\ndominated by the incretin mimetics or most of the drugs, like how we've classified it, as\nfocused on appetite suppression. I think nimacimab really stands out as an alternative.\nCertainly categorically a groundbreaking alternative, I would say, because it's a\nperipheral-driven mechanism and rather than just forcing caloric restriction, it's\ntargeting peripheral CBeyond receptors that really promote that metabolism. So what\nwe're doing is restoring by targeting that metabolism, we're restoring insulin, we're\nrestoring leptin sensitivity with this mechanism and that's what we're trying to\ndemonstrate in the clinical trial.\nThis mechanism, I think, is very complementary to the GLP-1 class based on how we're\nevaluating this clinical trial based on input that we've been able to get in designing the\ntrial from our advisory group. The goal here is to show durable, high quality weight loss\nand an overall improved metabolic health. I think it's evident that the GLP-1 and overall\nincretin combos are very effective. They're showing 20% plus weight loss. But at the\nsame note, that's not entirely necessary across the entire cross-section of the\noverweight or obese population. And there is an opportunity to focus in on overweight\nin the Class 1 category, as well as kind of better appreciate the subtypes of obesity\nbecause of other comorbidities.\nSkye Bioscience, Inc.\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call\nI think we have an opportunity to continue to demonstrate that with a sustainable,\nhopefully smarter weight management and overcome some of the issues with what's\nbeen only available to-date. And for us, every meeting that we've been going to and\nevery data point that we've been able to share has really helped in terms of broadening\nthat confidence externally and in terms of Rx development execution, in terms of KOLs\nand obesity doctors appreciating that there's a need for these non-incretin\nmechanisms.\nJay Olson^ Excellent. We definitely appreciate the strategy there and thank you so\nmuch for taking our question.\nPunit Dhillon^ Thank you, Jay.\nOperator^ Our next question comes from the line of George Farmer with Scotiabank.\nYour line is open.\nGeorge Farmer^ Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Yeah. In reference\nto the presentation that you had at ObesityWeek and being able to use such a powerful\nmouse model now at your disposal, I'm wondering if you have plans to do further\npreclinical work, say, comparing nimacimab with other small molecule CB1 modulators\nor perhaps combining with incretin mimetics and building a preclinical body of evidence\nbefore the ultimate clinical trial data reads out. That might be really helpful. I'm just\nwondering what you're thinking.\nPunit Dhillon^ Yeah. Thanks, George. That's a great question. So, Chris is on the line, so\nI will let him expand on this. But what we -- we're really happy that we have this\nproprietary DIO model up and running. So that's really the foundation for how we\nexpect to continue to build on the data set. As we've seen in the space, everyone's\ncontinued to refine their DIO models and demonstrating different components of that.\nWe have additional data that hasn't been shared yet that came out of this experiment,\nwhich we'll continue to make public.\nBut the goal here is to continue to expand on our preclinical data to better understand\nthe nimacimab mechanism, as well as evaluate combinations. So we are exploring other\ncombinations. We haven't given any guidance on when all that data is available. There's\nSkye Bioscience, Inc.\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call\ncertainly a goal here to be continuing to share that broader understanding of what the\nnimacimab mechanism is and what the relevance is in terms of other non-incretin as\nwell as incretin mechanisms.\nAnd then there's I think the emphasis, I would say, has still been just execution on the\nclinical program. So everything kind of always goes back to what we are learning from\nthe preclinical studies to support our better understanding of clinical. I hope I didn't\ntake all the words out of Chris. But Chris, do you want to elaborate on anything?\nChris Twitty^ No. Well, I'll just briefly mention, and thanks for the question, George,\nthat as we noted, we do have a homozygous colony that's been expanded. So we're in a\nreally nice position to set up a series of studies. And you're correct to identify some of\nthe comparators that we're going to be looking at, not only the combinations, but\nimportantly, as you mentioned, some other potential anti-obesity medications,\nincluding some of the small molecule inhibitors. That's going to be quite interesting. The\nthings that we're all considering in addition to the combos is really digging into not just\nweight loss, body composition, but other related mechanistic biomarkers and readouts.\nSo we're really looking forward to sharing all that, and yeah, we'll keep you posted as\nwe do that.\nGeorge Farmer^ Okay. Great. Thanks very much.\nPunit Dhillon^ Thanks, George.\nOperator^ Next question comes from the line of Albert Lowe with Craig-Hallum. Your\nline is open.\nAlbert Lowe^ Okay. Thanks for taking my question. I just had one that I was curious\nabout. Do you have any theories on perhaps if nimacimab's unique mechanism of\naction could potentially underlie this well-tolerated profile that you've seen so far,\nespecially with respect to GI adverse events?\nPunit Dhillon^ Yeah. Chris, I'll let you take that or Dr. Arora, if you want. Maybe Chris?\nSkye Bioscience, Inc.\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call\nChris Twitty^ Yeah. It's a great question. We've certainly seen a very favorable, not only\nfrom a neuropsych perspective, but a GI perspective. The tox profile has been excellent\nwith a fairly robust number of Phase 1 patients. And it's no secret relative to small\nmolecule disorders that in general antibodies are incredibly specific and it may relate to\nreally being a difference, not so much in the target, but in the modality, antibody versus\nsmall molecule, and that may relate to sort of the PK relationship, the amount of dose,\nand ultimately specificity. But we don't have a really clear answer. We just have the\ndata. And to your point, so far it looks excellent and we're hoping to build on that. But I\ndon't know, Dr. Arora or Tu may have a different opinion.\nDr. Puneet Arora^ Yeah. There can be different mechanisms by which you get GI\nintolerance, especially with the GLP-1 agents. And they tend to be related, for example, I\nmean, take GLP-1 as a framework here, both to delayed gastric emptying, which is\nperipheral, but also their actions from the area of the schema by those individual\npeptides. The same thing can be true of small molecules when they are able to\npenetrate. So, yeah, being an antibody might make a difference. I think I agree with\nChris here. We don't completely understand where all these actions come from, but\nwe're happy to see the data.\nAlbert Lowe^ Got it. All right. Thanks for the explanation and thanks again for taking\nmy question.\nOperator^ Next question comes from the line of Jonathan Wolleben with Citizens JMP.\nYour line is open.\nCatherine Okoukoni^ Hi. This is Catherine on for Jon. I have a question about kind of\nputting the preclinical data that you guys have shown. I mean, your mouse model\nrelative to some of the other data that we've seen kind of from some of the other\ncompounds. I know that Nova recently extended data from their second generation in\nat least 347. And I'm just wondering, what is the way to kind of look at this data? I know\nthat it's animal data, taking it with a grain of salt, but is there anything that can be\ngleaned as far as the potency of the relative molecules or kind of if you could provide a\nlittle bit of color on how to contextualize the preclinical data we're seeing?\nPunit Dhillon^ Yeah. I can just kick it off here with just a little bit of differentiation and\nthen turn it over to Chris on -- Chris, maybe you want to elaborate just in terms of the\ncomments of these different models on how they're all unique in order to look at data\nSkye Bioscience, Inc.\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call\nside by side. I think some experiments have certainly been overzealous in terms of the\nway that they've been positioning just to drive weight loss rather than overall metabolic\ngain. So I want Chris to touch on that.\nBut regarding on differentiation, nimacimab is clearly distinguished in terms of a\npharmacokinetic advantage. We're starting obviously with all of the data that we've\nshared over this last week. And even with the PK data that we've shared earlier, it's\nshowing a higher exposure, more sustained peripheral exposure with minimal brain\nexposure and it's reducing any of the CNS side effects. So that's the clearest\ndifferentiation against small molecules.\nAnd what's been evident is that monlunabant and other small molecules have\nlimitations of peripheral efficacy, and partly due to the small molecule mechanism\nthat's competing with natural ligands and also the potential approach in terms of their\nbinding, in terms of competing against the endocannabinoids at the orthosteric site.\nAnd that's reducing the ability to achieve I think the important therapeutic\nconcentration that is necessary and then once you bring on more drugs, you're only\nopening up the issue of more brain exposure.\nSo nimacimab is unique in terms of its allosteric binding. It's an antibody. It's allowing\nfor a safer, higher dosing and without any of this PK/PD limitation that we're seeing\nwith small molecules effectiveness. So I think that that's the clearest in terms of the\ndifferentiation. But yeah, Chris, why don't you kind of elaborate on the preclinical\nstudies a bit more?\nChris Twitty^ Yeah. I think backing up just a half second and looking at the potency\ndirectly, that question I think is a fair one, and certainly a bias towards beta-arrestin-\nbased recruitment in terms of a measure of potency. But if we look at the more classic\ncAMP-based readout, very similar potency, whether you're a small molecule like\nmonlunabant, or its nimacimab. So from a potency perspective, very similar. You can\nlook at our modeling data and that's pretty clear there in terms of our IC50, IC90 values.\nI think where, in terms of translating DIO studies, and I think what Punit was alluding to,\nreally the way to do this is in the same study if you want to have that sort of direct\ncomparator in terms of understanding relative efficacy, it can be difficult by clinical\nSkye Bioscience, Inc.\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call\ntrials to do cross-trial comparisons. It can be challenging and what we typically do to\nkind of get a soft comparison, if you will, is we use a benchmark where you dose at the\nsame concentration, same dosing schema, and you can use something that's fairly\nvalidated. In this case, we did use some semaglutide at a 10 nanomole per kg dose, and\nyou can see that that sort of had a 5% to 10% weight loss over our dosing range and\nthat is in line with other published research.\nI would argue more of a suboptimal dose of semaglutide, but if we look at that as a\nbenchmark, we can see that our highest dose of nimacimab actually was significantly\nimproved -- had a significant improvement relative to that semaglutide dose. So that's\none way of looking at it and sort of comparing to other therapeutics, benchmarking on\nsemaglutide. But in the end, we really need to look at that head-to-head comparison,\nwhich is something we're interested in doing. We haven't really given guidance on what\nthat will be and when that will come out, but that is something that I think is of interest.\nBut overall, we feel very comfortable with our efficacy profile, especially considering it's\nthe initial study, and I think we have a lot of room to improve the efficacy results, so\nwe're really digging into some of the key parameters to understand in this model what\nis the exposure, what are the kinetics of that exposure, and how do we achieve that\ninhibition as quick as possible. This is an IP dose that we use, but we're exploring other\nroutes to really get that inhibition happening quickly and really drive that efficacy down,\nso more room to optimize the model and drive even better weight loss.\nCatherine Okoukoni^ ^ Thank you so much.\nPunit Dhillon^ Thanks, Catherine.\nOperator^ And our next question comes from the line of Kristen Kluska with Cantor\nFitzgerald. Your line is open.\nAyan Hussein^ Hi. This is Ayan for Kristen. Can everyone hear me?\nPunit Dhillon^ Yes. Hey, Ayan.\nSkye Bioscience, Inc.\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call\nAyan Hussein^ Great. Hi. Thank you so much for taking our questions. First question, on\nneuropsychiatric adverse events, can you walk us through specifically what is\nhappening through central CB1 targeting that leads to these events, and how quickly\ndid others observe this impact in trials? And what gives you the confidence that\nperipheral targeting will not lead to this?\nPunit Dhillon^ Yeah. I'll turn it over to Dr. Arora to take that question.\nDr. Puneet Arora^ Yeah. I'm sorry, but could you just clarify that question for me again?\nI heard part of what you said, but I'd just like to be clear about what you're asking.\nAyan Hussein^ I guess the first part of the question is really just trying to get a better\nunderstanding of what is happening through central CB1 targeting that's leading to the\nneuropsychiatric adverse events.\nDr. Puneet Arora^ Oh, yeah. Okay.\nAyan Hussein^ And the second part is just how quickly others observed that impact in\ntrials?\nDr. Puneet Arora^ Yes. So what's happening is that there are CB1 receptors that are all\nthrough the CNS. So CB1 is actually a really important pathway. And I think you can\ngauge that from even how much peripheral distribution it has in key organs, but\ncertainly in the CNS.\nAnd if you look across literature, there are a lot of reports of how CB1 as a pathway and\nthe endocannabinoids, which are the ligands for this, our natural physiological ligands,\nare involved in things like the responses to stress, for example, and maintaining\npeople's general mood balance and so on.\nSo what happens is that when you have widespread distribution of a ligand to these\nreceptors in the CNS and [CB1 inhibitors] block the action of the endocannabinoid\nreceptors, then people lose their ability to respond as well to stress and to get the right\nresponses to it and to deal with anxiety, for example.\nSkye Bioscience, Inc.\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call\nSo by blocking these pathways, we are putting people who are already prone to getting\nproblems like anxiety and depression to be at a higher risk of developing these\nproblems. And that's what we saw when we were looking at rimonabant. For example,\nrimonabant leaks widely into the CNS. In fact, rimonabant was designed quite happily\nwith that purpose, because I think this was not completely understood at that point and\nwe saw these effects.\nAnd I believe we see these effects relatively early. So in the kinds of clinical data that\nwe're seeing right now, you should already be seeing them. And in the month-long\nPhase 1b study that we saw, we should have seen a glimmer of a signal already in that\nand we did not see it. You can see from monlunabant that we are getting some signals\nvery early on.\nSo this is not something that's very delayed. To some extent, you'll see differences\nbetween studies in terms of which patients they exclude. So a lot of studies right now\nare being done at least early on with participants who never had any issues or are not\nknown to be prone to depression or anxiety. But nevertheless, this is a physiological\npathway and if you block it in a blanket manner in the CNS, that's the risk that you\nengender.\nAyan Hussein^ Great. Thank you so much for that. And if I may just ask a second\nquestion. With the addition of GLP-1 therapies, how are you thinking about commercial\nuse? Would patients likely start on both and then stay on the CB1 inhibitor for longer-\nterm maintenance? How are you thinking about this?\nPunit Dhillon^ Yeah.\nDr. Puneet Arora^ Actually, all options are open. I'm going to ask Punit to take that.\nPunit Dhillon^ Yeah. I think, I mean, I would just stress that for us, we want to be really\nclear. I guess we get this question a lot. Obviously, there's a lot of options that are open\nthere. But what's important in terms of our takeaway, in terms of that general question,\nis that we really want to continue to emphasize that our primary focus is to get a\nregulatory approval for nimacimab and get it across the finish line. And that is as a\nSkye Bioscience, Inc.\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call\nmonotherapy to demonstrate weight loss. That's the way the FDA is looking at it. That's\nthe way anti-obesity medications have been approved.\nSo certainly, as a non-incretin, there's a great opportunity for CB1 because it has this\nmultimodal mechanism. And there is going to be a lot of interesting approaches in the\npost-GLP-1 market in terms of combination and all of that. From a regulatory pathway,\njust so there's no ambiguity for general investor audiences, making sure that the\nregulatory pathway here is as a monotherapy. But, yeah, as Dr. Arora indicated, all of\nour options are open. Of course, scientifically, we're exploring those and we'll continue\nto do that.\nAyan Hussein^ Thank you. That was super helpful.\nOperator^ That concludes the question-and-answer session. Mr. Punit Dhillon, our CEO,\nI turn the call back over to you.\nPunit Dhillon^ Yeah. Thank you, everybody, for participating in our first call. And it's\ncertainly a great moment for CB1 as a class and for Skye developing this molecule. I\nthink what we've indicated multiple times, it's really an opportunity to re-underwrite\nour understanding of CB1 inhibition, especially with the backdrop of new data that\ncontinues to come out in this class and nimacimab and how it's really positioned to\nseparate from the pack and we're looking forward to executing on our development\nstrategy. And stay tuned for additional updates.\nOperator^ Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now\ndisconnect."

Business.\nOverview\nWe are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company with a mission to pioneer the development of new medicines that unlock the pharmaceutical potential of the endocannabinoid\nsystem (\"ECS\"). Our clinical assets focus on the modulation of cannabinoid receptor 1 (\"CB1\") to provide novel treatments and alternatives for diseases caused by metabolic disorders,\ninflammation, fibrosis and neurodegeneration, such as obesity and glaucoma. Our Phase 2 clinical candidates include nimacimab, a negative allosteric modulating antibody that\ninhibits peripheral CB1 receptors, currently being developed for the treatment of obesity and SBI-100 Ophthalmic Emulsion (\"SBI-100 OE\"), a CB1 agonist (activator), currently\nbeing developed for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension. Both of these differentiated drug candidates are focused on distinct opportunities with large unmet needs: 1)\nObesity - where a patients now need additional treatments that have the ability to preserve muscle tissue and improve metabolic dysfunction either as new monotherapies or in\ncombination which existing treatments, and 2) Glaucoma - where novel drugs with distinct mechanisms are needed, especially those that are safe, well-tolerated and have\nneuroprotective potential. We have filed and successfully opened an Investigational New Drug (\"IND\") application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") for\nnimacimab in obesity, and we plan to launch a Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate nimacimab for the treatment of obesity as monotherapy compared against placebo, as well as evaluate\nthe combination of nimacimab and a GLP-1 agonist in Q3 2024, with final data in late 2025. We are also continuing clinical development of SBI-100 OE for glaucoma and ocular\nhypertension, with the first data read out from our recently completed Phase 2a trial anticipated in Q2 2024.\nThe Endocannabinoid System\nNimacimab: Peripheral CB1 Inhibitor\nThe exploration of the CB1 pathway as a therapeutic target has seen a resurgence of scientific interest, particularly for its role in modulating key physiological functions such as\nappetite regulation, weight loss and related metabolic processes. Interest in CB1 inhibition has grown in part due to the unprecedented efficacy and commercial success but also the\nlimitations of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1) agonists for the treatment of obesity due to its distinct mechanisms and poor tolerability. While Novo Nordisk's Wegovy®\n(semaglutide) once-weekly GLP-1 agonist injection for obesity had sales grow 442% to $4.7 billion in 2023, at the same time Novo Nordisk purchased Inversago, a clinical-stage\ncompany developing a peripherally-restricted CB1 inverse agonist therapy for weight loss. We believe this is in part because CB1 inhibition holds significant potential in obesity, and\nother metabolic diseases, as either a stand-alone drug or in combination with Novo Nordisk's GLP-1 agonist therapy, Wegovy®. The history of CB1 inhibition for the treatment of\nweight loss in obesity is long and well documented. It started with the clinical validation of an approved drug, Accomplia®, along with it's ultimate demise due to serious side effects.\nThis was followed by a period of deep research into better understanding the mechanisms of weight loss, as well as, the corresponding side effects from CB1 inhibition - ultimately\nleading to a new class of \"peripherally restricted\" CB1 inhibitors. As a result, we now understand that inhibiting the CB1 receptor in peripheral tissues has the potential to not only\ncause weight loss, but may also, provide additional benefits such as improving insulin and leptin sensitivity, while specifically targeting fat loss and preserving lean muscle.\nIn 2006, Accomplia® (rimonabant) was approved for the treatment of obesity by the European Medicines Agency. Rimonabant was a CB1 inverse agonist that inhibited signaling both\nin the central nervous system and peripherally. Rimonabant consistently induced weight loss of 4-6 kg over 6-12 months vs. placebo, with accompanying improvements in metabolic\ncontrol and hyperlipidemia (Van Gaal et al. Lancet, 2016, Astrup et al., Lancet, 2007). Subsequent meta-analyses showed that rimonabant increased risk of serious psychiatric adverse\nevents such as anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation. It is believed that rimonabant's accumulation in the brain is the primary reason for the increased risk of serious psychiatric\nevents. However, an increasing body of research suggests that the weight loss benefits of rimonabant may be achieved by targeting CB1 inhibition solely in the periphery and not in the\nbrain, thereby avoiding risk of psychiatric adverse events. Although nimacimab is not in direct competition with GLP-1 agonists, a comparative analysis of rimonabant and\nsemaglutide highlights significant differences in their gastrointestinal (GI) adverse event (AE) profiles. By evaluating rimonabant's GI tolerability and addressing the potential reduced\nrisk of neuropsychiatric AEs with nimacimab—a peripherally acting antibody—nimacimab may emerge as an important next generation mechanisms beyond GLP-1 agonists for\nhealthier, more sustainable weight loss and precision obesity including preserving muscle mass. (Van Gaal et al., Diabetes Care 2008 and Wilding et al., New England J Medicine\n2021).\n4\nTable of Contents\nSeveral mouse model studies support the hypothesis that selectively targeting CB1 inhibition exclusively in the periphery results in weight loss as well as other potential benefits. For\nexample, Jenrin Discovery developed JD5037 a CB1 antagonist from ibipinabant with limited brain penetrance. Preclinical studies in the diet-induced obese mouse demonstrated that\ntreatment with 3mg/kg daily of JD5037 over a 28-day period reduced body weight to normal levels. (Tam et al., Cell Metabolism 2012) Mice treated with JD5037 reduced body fat\nwithout loss of lean muscle mass. Treated mice experienced restoration of leptin sensitivity by decreasing leptin excretion by fat tissue, which resulted in increased fat loss. When these\ndata are taken together with data from rimonabant, we can conclude that peripheral inhibition of CB1 is sufficient to induce weight loss, while preserving lean muscle mass and\navoiding risks associated with inhibiting CB1 in the brain and central nervous system. Additional preclinical evidence also suggests that targeting both GLP-1 and inhibiting CB1 in\nthe periphery with JD-5037 results in restoration of insulin sensitivity that is not seen with GLP-1 agonist therapy alone. (Liu et al., ACS Pharmacol. Transl. Sci. 2021 and Tam et al.,\nMolecular Metabolism 2017)\nWe are currently developing nimacimab, a patented peripherally-acting negative allosteric modulating CB1 inhibitor, initially for treatment of obesity. As a monoclonal antibody,\nnimacimab may offer a wider therapeutic window compared to competitive small-molecule peripheral CB1 inhibitors. Animal data generated positive safety data over 26 weeks and\nshowed that, following dosing, nimacimab primarily remained in peripheral tissue outside the brain/central nervous system (\"CNS\") and the product candidate had a positive PK/PD\nsupportive of once-monthly dosing.\nSBI-100 Ophthalmic Emulsion: CB1 Agonist (Activator)\nWe are also developing a CB1 agonist for treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension. Approximately 7 million people in the United States and 60 million people worldwide suffer\nfrom glaucoma and ocular hypertension (\"OH\"), which is caused by slow drainage of the eye and leads to increases in intraocular pressure (\"IOP\"). Ultimately, increased IOP is\nbelieved to be a main cause of optic nerve damage in glaucoma. Currently, only IOP lowering has been proven to be a modifiable risk factor for glaucoma onset and progression, and\nthus is the only acceptable endpoint for marketing approval by the FDA (De Moraes et al., Sci. Rep. 2023 and Leske et al., Arch Ophthalmol 2003). We believe that the unmet need for\ntreatments in glaucoma is high. Approximately 40% of patients fail first line therapy and approximately 50% of patients require more than one therapy.\nSBI-100 OE is a CB1 agonist (activator) and is a patented prodrug of tetrahydrocannabinol (\"THC\") focused on lowering IOP related to glaucoma and ocular hypertension.\nOphthalmology opinion leaders have described the unmet need for a new alternate class of medicine to lower intraocular pressure and ideally provide protection against detrimental\nneurodegenerative effects on the optic nerve. Third party research has demonstrated the utility of THC to lower intraocular pressure and also indicated its neuroprotective capabilities.\nIn October 2023, Skye announced Phase 1 data indicating this differentiated eyedrop was safe and well tolerated, with a low rate of hyperaemia (red eyes) and no signs of intoxication\nfrom exposure to THC. Encouraging signs of reduction in IOP were also observed in the subset of healthy volunteers who had an elevated baseline IOP, indicating the potential utility\nof SBI-100 OE in reducing IOP in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. We launched a Phase 2a clinical trial of SBI-100 OE in Q4 2023. Enrollment was completed in Q1\n2024, with data expected in Q2 2024.\nStrategy\nOur aim is to be a leader in research and product development focused on the EC system. Our goal is to develop first-in-class products to treat significant unmet medical need in global\nmarkets. Our operating strategy emphasizes:\nAdvancing Our Differentiated CB1 Inhibitor, Nimacimab, with a Focus on Obesity as a Stand Alone and Adjunct Therapy to GLP-1 by:\n• Continuing to build on Phase 1 clinical data supporting evidence demonstrating safety and evidence of weight loss through restoring leptin sensitivity and enhancing fat\nmetabolism\n• Developing clinical data in Phase 2 supporting our hypothesis that nimacimab may cause weight loss while preserving muscle mass, which is not possible with current GLP-1\nand GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide) agonist therapies where reduction of muscle mass is a known side effect.\n• Showing through clinical data the potential for nimacimab to preserve muscle mass, and induce further reduction in weight loss when used in conjunction with GLP-1 and\nGIP agonist therapies\n• Exploring strategic collaborations for further development and deployment of nimacimab by expanding the clinical trial pipeline\n5\nTable of Contents\nAdvance Our First of Kind Eye Drop Formulation of CB1 Agonist SBI-100 OE as a New Treatment for Ocular Hypertension and Glaucoma by:\n• Continuing our Phase 2a proof-of-concept study to develop evidence supporting our hypothesis that SBI-100 OE will lower IOP in patients with ocular hypertension and\nglaucoma as it did in healthy patients during our Phase 1 clinical trial\n• Initiating a Phase 2b study evaluating SBI-100 OE against a current standard of care\nBy adhering to this strategy, Skye aims to create medicines that significantly improve the lives of patients around the world. Our focus on the ECS and CB1 modulation reflects our\ncommitment to developing innovative treatments for chronic diseases with large unmet needs characterized by neuropathic, inflammatory, and metabolic processes.\nOur Product Candidates\nNimacimab: Peripheral CB1 Inhibitor\nUnmet Need & Market Opportunity\nGlobal obesity rates have been rising dramatically, affecting more than one billion people worldwide (approximately 650 million adults). For example, approximately 42.4% of adults\nliving in the United States are obese. This translates to more than 112.5 million American adults with a BMI of >30kg/m2, although it is likely that current rates and patient numbers\nare higher given obesity prevalence has increased 30.5% since 2000. Obesity is a complex disease characterized by excess and chronic inflammation of adipose tissues, and it results\nfrom a chronic energy surplus in which the body’s energy intake exceeds its energy expenditure. Other stressors and environmental factors contribute to this chronic imbalance. Today,\nobesity is the fifth-leading risk factor cited by the World Health Organization (\"WHO\") for contributing as a primary cause of death globally. Current estimates by the World Obesity\nAtlas suggest that over half the global population will be overweight or obese by 2035, compared to 38% in 2020.\nEarly-generation therapies for obesity offered only modest help in weight reduction, with some drugs being removed from the market due to safety concerns. More recently, a new\nclass of drugs have proven very effective at achieving weight loss. These incretin mimetics, including GLP-1 agonists such as semaglutide and GLP-1/GIP combinations such as\ntirzepatide, have changed the paradigm for anti-obesity treatments. Products derived from these compounds suppress appetite and induce satiety, reduce gastric emptying, and thus\nreduce calorie intake, achieving weight-loss of up to 20% within one year. However, these drugs come with some potentially significant gastrointestinal side effects that may arise,\nincluding diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain and bloating, and in some cases patients may suffer from a condition known as gastroparesis, or paralyzed stomach. Additional side effects,\nalthough infrequent, include instances of acute pancreatitis, gallbladder disease, hypoglycemia, acute kidney injury and diabetic retinopathy (in diabetics). Beyond these potential side\neffects, it has been observed that muscle mass loss accounts for up to 40% of the weight lost in patients using these drugs, which is higher than the typical loss of approximately 25%\nmuscle mass loss in normal weight loss settings. As a result of these side effects many patients are intolerant to these incretin-mimetic drugs. In most cases, even when therapy is\ntolerated, patients are unable to get to a healthy weight. When taken off therapy, patients can gain a majority of their weight back within the first year. Nevertheless, the market for this\nclass of drugs is projected to grow to $20 billion in sales by 2030. Despite this unprecedented efficacy and commercial success, we believe there remains room for improvement over\nthese new therapies.\nPotential of the Body's Endocannabinoid System for Pharmaceutical Drug Development in the Treatment of Obesity\nThe cloning of CB1, along with the discovery of its endogenous ligands, the endocannabinoids (\"ECs\"), anandamide (\"AEA\") and arachidonoylglycerol (\"2- AG\"), has illuminated\nsome of the biological intricacies and mechanisms involved in fat storage and development of obesity. ECs, CB1, and closely related cannabinoid type-2 receptors constitute the\nendocannabinoid system (\"ECS\"). The ECS primarily functions to regulate energy storage and balance within the body, facilitated by CB1's activity in the brain and peripheral tissues.\nThe ECS helps maintain many physiological processes by enabling different cellular functions, all with a role in achieving a global homeostasis despite fluctuations in the external\nenvironment. ECs are produced in the body, where their synthesis and degradation is regulated by different enzymes. These endocannabinoids act as agonists that can bind to and\nsignal via specific endocannabinoid receptors expressed on various cell types and tissues.\n6\nTable of Contents\nThe CB1 receptor is one of the most abundant ECS receptors in the body. It is predominantly found in the CNS, where its role is associated with motor control, cognition, and\nemotional processing, and including modulation of processes of the eye. CB1 receptors are also found in peripheral tissues, or outside of the CNS, such as the liver, kidney, adipose\ntissue (fat cells), pancreas, and the gastrointestinal tract. One notable role of CB1 receptors in peripheral tissues is their involvement in metabolic regulation. In adipose tissue,\nactivation of CB1 receptors has been linked to the promotion of fat storage, suggesting their role in the balance of energy storage and utilization. In the kidney, CB1 signaling helps\nmodulate blood flow vital for the filtration of waste products and excess fluids, a process essential for maintaining proper electrolyte balance and blood pressure. CB1 in the liver is\ninvolved in the regulation of lipid metabolism and glucose homeostasis. Activation of CB1 receptors in the gastrointestinal tract can modulate the release of neurotransmitters and\nhormones that influence appetite, gastric motility, and nutrient absorption.\nThe distribution and function of the CB1 axis provides a strong rationale to target this critical physiological system as a therapeutic to treat different pathological states. Moreover,\ndysregulation of the CB1 axis in peripheral tissues has been associated with metabolic disorders such as obesity and kidney disease. Operating as a G-protein coupled receptor, CB1\ntypically associates with inhibitory Gi/o proteins to reduce cellular activity by inhibiting adenylyl cyclase and cAMP activity. Additionally, CB1 interaction with ß-arrestin can initiate\na distinct signaling cascade, the full implications of which are not yet completely understood. This ß-arrestin pathway is known to affect receptor sensitivity and expression levels.\nRecent research highlights that inhibiting CB1 outside the brain can influence leptin sensitivity and adipocyte signaling, directly impacting fat cell physiology. Activation of CB1\npromotes fat accumulation and disrupts mitochondrial function in obesity models, whereas inhibiting CB1 enhances mitochondrial biogenesis. This metabolic adjustment results in\nweight loss primarily through heightened energy expenditure, increased lipolysis, and fatty acid oxidation processes, particularly in brown adipose tissue, which serves as an energy\nsource, contrasting white adipose tissue's role in long-term fat storage.\nIt has been previously demonstrated that inhibiting the CB1 receptor can significantly reduce weight in obese patients. In 2006, Sanofi developed a CB1 inverse agonist called\nrimonabant, which demonstrated 8-10% weight loss after one year. Despite being approved by the European Medicines Agency, the drug was soon taken off the market because it was\nshown to result in a higher risk of adverse psychiatric side effects. As a result, rimonabant was taken off the market in Europe and Sanofi, along with other large pharmaceutical\ncompanies like Merck and Pfizer, stopped all development of CB1 inhibitors.\nSince the demise of rimonabant, a significant amount of research was conducted to better understand the CB1 blockade and why drugs like rimonabant failed. Ultimately it was\ndetermined that rimonabant readily entered the brain, resulting in significant psychiatric side effects. However, it was also discovered that blockade of CB1 receptors outside of the\nbrain (i.e. peripheral CB1 receptors), could also result in meaningful weight loss and also improvement in other metabolic parameters. These studies have led to the development of\n\"peripherally restricted\" CB1 inhibitors that have significantly less penetration into the brain, resulting in a potentially safer drug while maintaining potentially similar weight loss\ncharacteristics. Moreover, researchers have shown that peripheral blockade of the CB1 receptors can also result in weight loss with less muscle mass loss (i.e. muscle wasting), while\nalso improving metabolic parameters important in changing the course of the disease in obesity, such as improving insulin sensitivity.\n7\nTable of Contents\nWe believe incretin mimetics, like GLP-1 agonists, have established themselves as a potential foundation for the therapeutic treatment of weight loss. However, with their potentially\nchallenging safety profile and marked incidence of muscle wasting associated with weight loss, we believe it is imperative to develop new drugs that can be complimentary to GLP-1\nagonists, such as in combination with, as a follow-on to standard-of-care GLP-1 therapies, or even as an alternative therapy for obese patients who can not tolerate the side effects of\nGLP-1 agonists. Peripheral CB1 inhibition represents an important new mechanism with potential to help reduce these challenges and create improved therapeutic outcomes.\nTechnology\nIn 2023, Skye acquired BRB along with its lead asset, nimacimab, a humanized IgG4 negative allosteric modulating (NAM) antibody that specifically binds to CB1 receptor and does\nnot cross-react with other GPCRs including CB2. CB1 binding characteristics including specificity and affinity have been confirmed with both ELISA and flow cytometry-based\nassays. Assessing functional inhibition including demonstration of noncompetitive binding CB1 has been confirmed with both b-arrestin-based and GPCR-based endpoints. This\nfunctional and specific CB1 inhibiting antibody has also been characterized in multiple biodistribution assays, which collectively demonstrated a high degree of peripheral restriction\nwith minimal detection in the CNS and brain in early time points as well as no accumulation in the brain over 28 days, despite nimacimab's 18-20 day half-life. This lack of blood-\nbrain barrier (BBB) penetration, while not uncommon for a larger biologic such as an antibody therapeutic, is an important feature that helps underpin nimacimab's excellent safety\nprofile.\nWhile different strategies have been developed to limit CB1 signaling, nimacimab's negative allosteric approach is differentiated relative to an inverse agonist inhibitor in a few\nnotable ways. A fundamental functional difference relates to the ability of nimacimab to inhibit in a non-competitive fashion. Since nimacimab limits the receptor activity by binding\naway (allosterically) from the agonist (endocannabinoid) receptor binding pocket, it is able to inhibit the CB1 signal independently of receptor engagement. In contrast, an inverse\nagonist competes with the endocannabinoid for receptor binding and thus inhibition of CB1 signaling.\nWhile this distinction may not be as impactful in healthier patients with minimal pathology, this mechanistic distinction becomes more relevant in patients with notable disease\nprogression where the CB1 axis (both receptor but importantly endocannabinoid density) can be significantly overactive in local tissues, enabling competition with an inverse agonist\nfor receptor occupancy. This difference can be exaggerated when the bioavailability of an inverse agonist is limited, which highlights a second key distinction between nimacimab, an\nantibody therapeutic, and inverse agonists, which are currently all small molecule therapeutics.\nSmall molecule-based CB1 inverse agonists have been modified to discourage distribution in the CNS and brain by increasing the polarity of surface residues, which also impacts\nmembranous trafficking and bioavailability. While this altered small molecule yields a notable improvement in CNS distribution relative to non-biased small molecules such as\nrimonabant, its presence and significant CB1 occupancy in the brain has still been noted in a chronic preclinical setting. Coupled with an impact on bioavailability, this may limit the\ntherapeutic index and thus its relative density in local tissues.\nIn contrast, nimacimab has an excellent clinical safety profile with a large NOAEL (no observed adverse effect level) and an 18-20 day half-life which collectively supports a favorable\npharmacologic profile capable of safely inhibiting CB1 signaling in relevant disease settings.\nNonclinical Data\nNonclinical studies were designed to characterize various pharmacodynamic aspects of nimacimab, including specificity and in vitro affinity binding, functional cell-based inhibition,\nas well as other mechanistic details. Key findings from these studies demonstrated that nimacimab is selective and does not bind to other GPCR targets while binding with low nM\naffinity to human CB1. The antibody was able to block CB1 activation by the natural endocannabinoid ligands AEA and 2-AG and demonstrated dose-dependent antagonist activity\nmeasured by both cAMP and b-arrestin signaling pathways. Pre-treatment with nimacimab blocked CB1 agonist-induced CB1 internalization and nimacimab did not induce\ninternalization in the absence of agonist. Additionally, nimacimab had no effect on antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) or complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC),\nsuggesting that nimacimab's mechanism of action is focused on blocking CB1 signaling and not any direct immune-mediated effects. Lastly, antibody blockade of CB1 on matured\nadipocytes from obese subjects significantly increased adiponectin production compared to vehicle control. These findings are of importance as adiponectin, an adipokine secreted by\nadipocytes, play a critical role in regulating glucose levels, lipid metabolism, and insulin sensitivity, which collectively support positive metabolomic regulation.\n8\nTable of Contents\nClinical Data\nIn a Phase 1b entitled \"Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of Nimacimab after Repeat Dosing in Subjects with Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD),\" the purpose was\nto evaluate the safety and tolerabilty of multiple doses of nimacimab after four weeks of dosing in subjects with NAFLD. Secondary objectives included determination of\npharmacokinetics of nimacimab for multiple doses, and to determine levels of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) after dosing with nimacimab. In Part A of this study, 24 healthy volunteers\nwere randomized to receive a single dose of either placebo or single ascending doses of nimacimab (0.6, 1.2 or 2.5 mg/kg). In Part B, 82 patients with pre-diabetes or diabetes and\nNAFLD were randomized to receive either placebo or multiple escalating doses of nimacimab (0.6, 1.2 or 2.5 mg/kg) once a week for four weeks.\nThere were no deaths, serious adverse events (SAEs) or treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) that lead to discontinuation. All TEAEs were graded as mild to moderate in\nintensity except for 1 severe TEAE (dizziness) in the nimacimab 0.6 mg/kg dose group determined to have not been related to study drug. The majority of TEAEs were not related to\nstudy drug and there was no apparent relationship between the dose level and the type, severity, or incidence of the TEAEs.\nFor all subjects at all doses, concentrations of nimacimab were quantifiable in serum by 0.5 hours after the first dose and remained quantifiable in most subjects through the last time\npoint (Day 67). Exposure to nimacimab as measured by AUC and C increased with increasing doses of nimacimab. At all dose levels, median T ranged from 0.5 to 2 hours and\nmax max\nmean t ranged from 18 to 22 days.\n1/2\nImmunogenicity was assessed in all subjects throughout the study. Only two subjects had consistently elevated titers over multiple time points of ADA. These data suggest that\nnimacimab has overall low immunogenicity.\nDecreases in mean alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were observed during the study in the active treatment groups, but not in the placebo group.\nNumeric decreases in ELF score and statistically significant reduction in hyaluronic acid (HA) was observed in the 1.2 mg/kg dose group compared to placebo (p=0.02). Assessment of\nserum lipids indicated a dose-dependent trend towards reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) starting from Day 29; on Day 67 there was a mean 8.9 mg/dL decrease\nin LDL-c in the 2.5 mg/kg dose group compared with a mean 8.3 mg/dL increase in the placebo group (p=0.0073). No effect was observed in total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein\ncholesterol (HDL-c), and triglycerides. No significant treatment effect was observed on liver fat percentage, DNL, inflammatory biomarkers and OGTT test.\nDevelopment Plan\nIND-enabling studies of nimacimab in non-human primates demonstrated a strong safety profile with a NOAEL of 75 mg/kg. Our Phase 2 study in obesity is designed to evaluate\nnimacimab's weight loss potential either as a single agent or in combination with a GLP-1 agonist like semaglutide. We believe the complementary mechanism of action of CB1\ninhibition with nimacimab in combination with a GLP-1 agonist has the potential to provide more meaningful weight loss, and potentially more durable weight loss, than a GLP-1\nagonist alone.\nOur Phase 2 clinical trial design will treat non-diabetic individuals with obesity (BMI≥30) or those overweight (BMI≥27) with at least one weight-related health issue. Participants will\nbe treated with either nimacaimb, a GLP-1 agonist such as semaglutide, a combination of nimacimab plus a GLP-1 agonist, or placebo. This 26-week study will be followed by a 12-\nweek observation period. The main goal is to measure the percentage of weight loss by week 26, with secondary goals assessing changes in waist size, body composition, fasting\ntriglyceride levels, cholesterol, and A1c. The study will help us evaluate the effectiveness of nimacimab alone versus placebo, as well as compare the difference between nimcacimab\nand semaglutide and the potential enhanced effects of their combination. A key focus is the impact on body composition across different groups, especially since nimacimab is\nexpected to better preserve muscle mass by promoting fat browning, a benefit observed in preclinical studies where CB1 inhibition led to significant weight reduction without muscle\nloss over 28 days. We plan to finalize the trial design and start the Phase 2 study in approximately mid-2024.\nSBI-100 Ophthalmic Emulsion: CB1 Agonist (Activator)\nUnmet Need & Market Opportunity\nGlaucoma is characterized by progressive ocular neuropathy associated with the initiation of apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells (\"RGCs\") in the optic nerve, which can progress and\ncause irreversible loss of vision. While the pathology of glaucoma is in the back of the eye, a key driver of this disease is often found in the front of the eye. Specifically, elevated\nintraocular pressure (\"IOP\") resulting from dysregulated outflow, and to a lesser extent production of aqueous humor (\"AH\") in the anterior/posterior chambers in the front of the eye,\nreadily promotes damage to RGC axons through vascular ischemia and physical crush injury as the elevated ocular pressure compresses these critical cells. IOP is currently the only\nmodifiable risk factor and lowering IOP results in reduced risk of progression of damage to the optic nerve. Moreover, IOP has been identified as an important risk factor in the\npathogenesis of this disease.\n9\nTable of Contents\nTo reduce IOP, the current classes of glaucoma therapeutics target pathways that shift the balance of production or outflow of AH. This therapeutic landscape is made up of five drug\nclasses focused on lowering IOP toward a target level whereby the rate of disease progression will be slowed sufficiently to avoid functional impairment from the disease.\nProstaglandin analogues and β-blockers are the first-line therapies and the most commonly used medications for the management of glaucoma. There are other therapeutic agents less\ncommonly used to reduce IOP, like cholinergic agonists, alpha agonists and ROCK inhibitors. While these treatments can be effective in some patients, side effects and lack of durable\nresponses often lead to many patients progressing through multiple therapies in an effort to control IOP. Current treatments are legacy classes of drugs thus there is an unmet need for\ncombinations and innovation in this therapeutic landscape. This unmet need is a potential opportunity for Skye's SBI-100 OE to have a positive impact in patients with glaucoma.\nTechnology\nCannabinoid receptors are highly concentrated in the eye, especially in the anterior compartment that helps regulate IOP, and in the posterior compartment in the area of the retina and\noptic nerve. Activation of CB1 has previously been shown to lower IOP in both animal and human studies. SBI-100 OE represents a novel treatment option for glaucoma. The active\npharmaceutical ingredient (\"API\"), SBI-100, is synthetically created using rational drug design and biochemical engineering to increase the hydrophilic properties of Δ9-\ntetrahydrocannabinol. This increased solubility coupled with a proprietary formulation to increase stability and residency time on the ocular surface allows for increased ocular tissue\npenetration. Once inside the eye, abundant esterases release the prodrug moiety, allowing for an active THC molecule to bind to abundant CB1 receptors throughout key ocular tissues\nsuch as the trabecular meshwork and ciliary body. Engagement of these receptors has been demonstrated to promote AH outflow via the trabecular meshwork as well as limit\nproduction via the ciliary body. Importantly, the active component of SBI-100 OE has been shown to have neuroprotective effects in both in vitro and in vivo studies. Since SBI-100\nOE has been detected in retinal tissues in biodistribution studies, we are investigating if SBI-100 OE may additionally demonstrate a neuroprotective aspect in its treatment of\nglaucoma, providing further differentiation from the current therapies on the market.\nWe licensed SBI-100, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in SBI-100 OE, from the University of Mississippi (\"UM\"). SBI-100 OE is initially being developed to treat glaucoma and\nocular hypertension. SBI-100 is Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol-valine-hemisuccinate (Δ9-THCVHS), a synthetically manufactured amide ester prodrug of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol\nmolecule formulated in a proprietary nanoemulsion formulation. In contrast to the parental Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol molecule, which has very poor bioavailability, this novel synthetic\nmolecule has been shown to penetrate into ocular tissue, where the prodrug moiety is quickly removed, allowing for the delivery of measurable amounts of active drug (Δ9-\ntetrahydrocannabinol) to the cornea, AH, iris-ciliary body, and retina choroid (RC), permitting interaction with cannabinoid receptors involved in regulating IOP.\nPreclinical Data\nIn 2019, UM completed experiments showing that SBI-100 was statistically superior in lowering IOP compared to the prostaglandin-based therapy latanoprost, the current standard-of-\ncare for treating glaucoma. Statistical significance was reached across multiple time points during a seven-day course of dosing using a validated rabbit normotensive ocular model and\nSBI-100 exerted pharmacologic activity consistent with once-daily to twice-daily dosing. Skye subsequently developed a proprietary nanoemulsion formulation to optimize the amount\nof SBI-100 that can be delivered to the eye in a single drop while also improving the duration of activity. Importantly, this formulation can be sterilized by filtration without impacting\nthe attributes of SBI-100. This final formulation of the API, known as SBI-100 Ophthalmic Emulsion, significantly reduced IOP compared to other commercially available ophthalmic\nsolutions and is now being evaluated in clinical trials.\nWe evaluated the mechanism of action and IOP-lowering ability of the active moiety of SBI-100 when administered into an ex vivo model of a 3D-human trabecular meshwork using\nboth healthy and glaucomatous-induced tissues. The trabecular meshwork plays a key role in removing a vital functional liquid in the eye, called aqueous humor, in order to maintain a\nhealthy balance of pressure in the eye (an imbalance can lead to a detrimental increase in IOP). This study validated the mechanism of action of SBI-100 in lowering IOP, a defining\ndisease process of hypertensive glaucoma. Moreover, biomarkers associated with inflammation and fibrosis in both normal tissue and tissues affected by glaucoma were significantly\ndecreased, pointing to anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic activities often associated with cannabinoids in other disease states. Data also revealed that biomarkers associated with\nneovascularization, a disease process of new blood vessel formation that can damage the retina in a variety of ocular diseases, was also inhibited by the active moiety, prompting\nfurther study for the utility of this drug in diseases of the retina.\n10\nTable of Contents\nClinical Data\nWe commenced dosing of the Phase 1 clinical study in December 2022 and in November 2023 we reported that our Phase 1 data demonstrated that SBI-100 OE was safe and well-\ntolerated. Importantly, we determined that there was minimal systemic exposure of the active metabolite of SBI-100 OE, THC, thus resulting in little to no side effects related to THC\nintoxication. Moreover, it was determined that after multiple days of dosing we saw minimal hyperaemia (i.e. redness of the eyes) following administration of SBI-100 OE.\nIn December 2022, we obtained FDA clearance of our Investigational New Drug application to conduct clinical studies in the US and in January 2023, our Phase 2 clinical trial\nprotocol received study level approval from a central institutional review board (“IRB”). In February 2024, we announced that we completed enrollment of our Phase 2a clinical study\nfor glaucoma and ocular hypertension. Due to the early completion of enrollment of our Phase 2a study, topline data will be available in Q2 2024.\nDevelopment Plan\nAs a novel agent for the potential treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension, SBI-100 OE may represent a new treatment opportunity for physicians and patients and we are\nleading the field in this area of research.\nWe are currently advancing a Phase 2a trial of SBI-100 targeting primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and OH. This study enrolled 56 patients with POAG and OH, presenting\nintraocular pressures (IOP) between 21-34mmHg, and with no history of surgical interventions. Participants were randomized to receive either 0.5% SBI-100, 1% SBI-100, or a\nplacebo, administered twice daily over a 14-day period. The study's main goal is to assess changes in diurnal IOP compared to placebo. Secondary objectives are to evaluate safety,\ntolerability, any psychotropic effects, changes in diurnal IOP from the study's start, and to explore potential biomarkers.\nFollowing the data release of our proof-of-concept Phase 2a study, we expect to initiate a Phase 2b study evaluating SBI-100 OE against a current standard of care such as timolol.\nSuccessful completion of this Phase 2b study by the end of 2025 may present an opportunity to hold an end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the US FDA to discuss our plan for Phase 3\nstudies for marketing authorization in glaucoma.\nCompetition\nOur industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition, rapid pace of new innovation, and a strong emphasis on proprietary products and defense of\nintellectual property. We face competition from pharmaceutical companies, including generic drug companies, biotechnology companies, drug delivery companies, and academic and\nresearch institutions, among others.\nCompetitors to nimacimab that are targeting peripheral inhibition of CB1 for the treatment of obesity and metabolic conditions include Inversago (acquired by Novo Nordisk in 2023)\nand Corbus Pharmaceuticals. We are not aware of any competitor attempting to inhibit CB1 in the periphery via a monoclonal antibody. There is also significant interest in and\ncompetitive activity targeting obesity and metabolic disorders from companies including Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly, Boehringer Ingelheim, Zealand Pharma, Pfizer, AstraZeneca,\nRegeneron, Carmot Therapeutics (acquired by Roche), Amgen, Viking Therapeutics, Structure Therapeutics, Versanis (acquired by Eli Lilly), Biohaven, Keros Therapeutics, Scholar\nRock, Terns Pharmaceuticals, Altimmune, Omega Therapeutics, Kallyope, Rivus and others including several privately financed companies whose information is not regularly\ndisclosed to the public.\nWe are not currently aware of any competitors to SBI-100 Ophthalmic Emulsion that are developing a CB1 agonist for the treatment of glaucoma and OH. Merck, Novartis, Abbvie,\nBausch + Lomb, and Alcon are generally known competitors currently offering treatments for glaucoma and ocular hypertension.\nManufacturing\nWe do not own or operate manufacturing facilities and we rely on third-party contract manufacturing organizations to supply Skye with drugs for pre-clinical and clinical studies.\nNimacimab\nNimacimab is a monoclonal antibody and we have developed a manufacturing process under current good manufacturing practice (\"cGMP\") to produce batches of drug substance and\ndrug product for pre-clinical and clinical studies. Drug substance for nimacimab will be produced by a contract manufacturer through recombinant DNA technology utilizing\ngenetically engineered host cells, upstream cell culture processes and downstream purification methods as required to manufacture the drug substance.

All fields of use means no restrictions on use of the underlying inventions, including developing UM 5050 to treat\nany disease through any form of delivery under the license agreement.\nThe license for SBI-100, a CB1 agonist, is expected to allow us to explore related uses for the active moiety of SBI-100.\nIn 2022, after notifying the Australian Therapeutics Goods Administration through the Clinical Trial Notification scheme of our intent to initiate our Phase 1 clinical trial for SBI-100\nOE, we triggered and paid the first milestone payment under our License Agreement for UM 5050 with UM.\nIn 2023, we granted to Tautomer Bioscience an exclusive license to develop and commercialize SBI-100 as a novel suppository formulation for chronic intractable pain and other\nindications in South Africa and the rest of Africa. We have retained certain rights and options to obtain rights to the future use of new jointly developed intellectual property and other\nintellectual property owned or controlled by Tautomer Bioscience related to SBI-100.\nGovernment Regulation\nGovernment authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing,\nmanufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, import and export of pharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. The\nprocesses for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the\nexpenditure of substantial time and financial resources. A failure to comply with such laws and regulations or prevail in any enforcement action or litigation related to noncompliance\ncould have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\nIn the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (\"FDCA\") and\nits implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations\nrequires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process,\napproval process or after approval, may subject us to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of an approval,\nimposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of\ngovernment contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.\nThe process required by the FDA before a drug may be legally marketed in the United States, generally involves the following:\n• conduct of laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with GLP regulations;\n• submission of an Investigational New Drug application (\"IND\") to the FDA , which must be found acceptable to proceed before clinical trials may begin;\n• approval and oversight of each study by an IRB before each clinical site may initiate the trial(s);\n• conduct of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice (\"GCP\") requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed\ndrug for each indication;\n• submission of an NDA to the FDA;\n• satisfactory development and completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess\ncompliance with cGMP requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;\n• satisfactory development and completion of an FDA BioResearch Monitoring (BIMO) inspection of the clinical study sites which participated in the studies supporting\nthe NDA application; and\n• FDA review and approval of marketing authorization application (NDA, BLA, etc).\n13\nNonclinical Studies\nNonclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must\nsubmit the results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part\nof an IND. Some nonclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND generally becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless, before that time, the\nFDA raises concerns or questions related to nonclinical or manufacturing documentation or one or more proposed clinical trials and places the IND on clinical hold. In such a case, the\nIND sponsor and the FDA work to resolve any outstanding concerns before the hold can be lifted and the clinical trial(s) can begin. As a result, submission of an IND does not always\nresult in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.\nClinical Trials\nClinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug candidate to humans under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements.\nThis includes the requirement that all research subjects/patients provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under\nprotocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each\nclinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB, either central or at each institution participating in the\nclinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before the study commences at a site. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific\ntimeframes to the NIH for public dissemination on the www.clinicaltrials.gov website.\nBefore marketing authorization, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:\n• Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into a small number of healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage\ntolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.\n• Phase 2: The drug is administered to a specific patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy and safety of\nthe product for specific diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.\n• Phase 3: The drug is administered to the established patient population expected to benefit based upon the risk/benefit profile. Generally, this phase of studies are\nconducted at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the\nproduct for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.\nReports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and IND safety reports are submitted more frequently if serious adverse events\npossibly related to the investigational product occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore,\nthe FDA or the Sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable\nhealth risk or due to a business decision. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance\nwith the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.\nMarketing Approval\nAssuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the nonclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry,\nmanufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an marketing authorization application requesting approval to market the product\nfor one or more indications. For drug products, or biologic products under the review of Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), the marketing authorization application is\nan NDA or a BLA, and submission is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (\"PDUFA\") commitments that are currently in effect, the\nFDA has a goal of reviewing and responding to a submission within ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity. This review typically takes at\nleast twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to the FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision. However, if issues arise during the\nreview, the FDA may request additional information and the review period may be extended to permit the applicant to provide and the FDA to review that information, which may\nsignificantly extend this time period. The process for review and issuance of a license for a BLA is similar to the NDA review path..\n14\nIn addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 (\"PREA\"), as amended and reauthorized, certain marketing authorizations or supplements to marketing authorizations\nmust contain data that is adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the approved product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support\ndosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant\ndeferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.\nThe FDA also may require submission of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) plan to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The REMS plan could\ninclude medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk\nminimization tools.\nThe FDA conducts a preliminary review of all pending marketing authorizations within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they\nare sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may refuse to file the application and request additional information rather than accept marketing authorization\napplication for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information requested. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA\naccepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether\nthe drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety,\nquality and purity.\nThe FDA may refer an application for a novel product and/or first-in-class product to an advisory committee. The FDA may also refer to the advisory committee certain scientific\nquestions raised by an application. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a\nrecommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it\nconsiders such recommendations carefully when making decisions.\nBefore approving a marketing authorization application, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an\napplication unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product\nwithin required specifications. Additionally, within the review period and before approving a marketing authorization application, the FDA will likely inspect one or more clinical trial\nsites to assure compliance with GCP requirements.\nThe testing and approval process for an NDA/BLA requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. Data obtained from\nnonclinical and clinical testing are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not\ngrant approval on a timely basis, or at all.\nAfter evaluating the NDA/BLA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and\nclinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions\nthat must be met to secure final approval of the NDA/BLA and may require additional clinical or nonclinical testing in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with\nsubmission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have\nbeen met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter for the NDA/BLA. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific\nprescribing information for specific indications. For some products, such as our product candidates where abuse potential is a possibility, an additional step of Drug Enforcement\nAdministration (DEA) review and scheduling is required.\nPost-Approval Requirements\nProducts manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating\nto recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion, and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most\nchanges to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to FDA review and approval prior to implementation. There also are continuing\nannual product fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental\napplications with clinical data.\nThe FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA/BLA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase\n4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.\n15\nIn addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state\nagencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are\nstrictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP\nrequirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly,\nmanufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.\nOnce an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product\nreaches the market.\nLater discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to\ncomply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to\nassess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program.\nOther potential consequences include, among other things:\n• restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;\n• fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;\n• refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs/BLAs or supplements to approved NDAs/BLAs, or suspension or revocation of product licenses or approvals;\n• product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or\n• injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nThe FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in\naccordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company\nthat is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.\nIn addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (\"PDMA\"), which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug\nsamples at the federal level and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of\nprescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.\nExclusivity and Approval of Competing Products\nHatch Waxman Act\nSection 505 of the FDCA describes three types of marketing applications that may be submitted to the FDA to request marketing authorization for a new drug. A Section 505(b)(1)\nNDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy. A 505(b)(2) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and\nefficacy but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not\nobtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. This regulatory pathway enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s\nprior findings of safety and efficacy for an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application. Section 505(j) establishes an abbreviated approval process for a\ngeneric version of approved drug products through the submission of an Abbreviated New Drug Application (\"ANDA\"). An ANDA provides for marketing of a generic drug product\nthat has the same active ingredients, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, performance characteristics and intended use, among other things, to a previously\napproved product. ANDAs are termed “abbreviated” because they are generally not required to include preclinical (animal) and clinical (human) data to establish safety and efficacy.\nInstead, generic applicants must scientifically demonstrate that their product is bioequivalent to, or performs in the same manner as, the innovator drug through in vitro, in vivo, or\nother testing. The generic version must deliver the same amount of active ingredients into a subject’s bloodstream in the same amount of time as the innovator drug and can often be\nsubstituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the reference listed drug.\n16\nHatch Waxman Patent Exclusivity\nIn seeking approval for a drug through a NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or a method of using the product.\nUpon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,\ncommonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA.\nThe ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book, except for patents covering\nmethods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that:\n• the required patent information has not been filed;\n• the listed patent has expired;\n• the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or\n• the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product.\nGenerally, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA cannot be approved until all listed patents have expired, except when the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant challenges a listed drug. A\ncertification that the proposed product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV\ncertification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicate that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA application will\nnot be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.\nIf the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and\npatent holders once the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of\nthe Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of notice of the Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA\nfrom approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to\nthe ANDA applicant.\nHatch Waxman Non-Patent Exclusivity\nIn addition to patent issues, market and data exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications for competing products. The\nFDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of a NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new\nchemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the activity of the drug\nsubstance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company that references the previously approved\ndrug. However, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted after four years if it contains a Paragraph IV certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also\nprovides three years of marketing exclusivity for a NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA or 505(b)(2) NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability\nstudies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant, are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application or supplement. Three-year exclusivity may be\nawarded for changes to a previously approved drug product, such as new indications, dosages, strengths or dosage forms of an existing drug.\nThis three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and, as a general matter, does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs\nor 505(b)(2) NDAs for other versions of a drug. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full\nNDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and\neffectiveness.\nOrphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity\nUnder the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a disease or condition that affects populations of fewer than 200,000\nindividuals in the United States or, if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug\nproduct available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting a NDA.\nOrphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.\n17\nIf a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan\ndrug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances,\nsuch as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity or inability to manufacture the product in sufficient quantities. The designation of such drug also\nentitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. Competitors, however, may receive\napproval of different products for the same indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication than that for\nwhich the orphan product has exclusivity.\nRegulation of Controlled Substances: Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Regulation\nCertain cannabinoids are regulated as “controlled substances” as defined in the Controlled Substances Act (the “CSA”), which establishes registration, security, recordkeeping,\nreporting, storage, distribution and other requirements administered by the DEA. The DEA is concerned with the control of handlers of controlled substances (and with the equipment\nand raw materials used in their manufacture and packaging) of controlled substances in order to prevent loss and diversion into illicit channels of commerce.\nThe DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have no established medicinal use and may not be marketed or\nsold in the United States. A pharmaceutical product may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest risk of abuse and Schedule\nV substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. Certain cannabinoids are listed by the DEA as Schedule I controlled substances under the CSA. Consequently,\ntheir manufacture, shipment, storage, sale and use are subject to a high degree of regulation. Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses,\nimports or exports any controlled substance. The registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule. For example, separate registrations are\nneeded for import and manufacturing, and each registration will specify which schedules of controlled substances are authorized.\nThe DEA typically inspects a facility to review its security measures prior to issuing a registration. Security requirements vary by controlled substance schedule, with the most\nstringent requirements applying to Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Required security measures include background checks on employees and physical control of inventory\nthrough measures such as cages, surveillance cameras and inventory reconciliations. The registered entity must maintain records for the handling of all controlled substances and must\nmake periodic reports to the DEA. These include, for example, distribution reports for Schedule I and II controlled substances, Schedule III substances that are narcotics, and other\ndesignated substances. The registered entity must also report thefts or losses of any controlled substance and obtain authorization to destroy any controlled substance. In addition,\nspecial authorization and notification requirements apply to imports and exports.\nIn addition, a DEA quota system controls and limits the availability and production of controlled substances in Schedule I or II. Distributions of any Schedule I or II controlled\nsubstance must also be accompanied by special order forms, with copies provided to the DEA. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas and individual production and\nprocurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments. To meet its responsibilities, the DEA\nconducts periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. In the event of non-compliance, the DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew\nnecessary registrations, or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could lead to criminal prosecution.\nSBI-100 remains a Schedule I controlled substance, pending a request to re-schedule SBI-100 after marketing authorization by the FDA or execution of the August 23, 2023 request by\nthe Assistant HHS secretary to DEA reschedule cannabis to Schedule 3.\nFederal and State Fraud and Abuse, Data Privacy and Security Laws and Regulations\nIn addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, federal and state fraud and abuse laws restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws\ninclude anti-kickback and false claims laws and regulations as well as data privacy and security laws and regulations.\n18\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing,\nleasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs.\nThe term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical\nmanufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors\nprotecting some common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to\ninduce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not meet the requirements of a statutory or regulatory exception or safe harbor. Several courts\nhave interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business,\nthe statute has been violated. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.\nThe federal False Claims Act prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making,\nusing, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money\nor property presented to the U.S. government. A violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute also constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act.\nSeveral pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the\ncustomers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of\nproducts for unapproved, and thus non-covered, uses. In addition, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under\nMedicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.\nThe federal False Claims Act also created federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including\nprivate third party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in\nconnection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge\nof the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.\nPharmaceutical companies are also subject to the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be\npresented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.\nIn addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other health care providers. The Patient Protection and\nAffordable Care Act, as amended by the ACA, signed into law on March 2010, created new federal requirements for reporting, by applicable manufacturers of covered drugs,\npayments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals. Applicable manufacturers are also required to report annually to the government certain ownership and\ninvestment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. In addition, certain states require implementation of commercial compliance programs and compliance\nwith the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, impose restrictions on marketing\npractices, and/or tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration or items of value provided to physicians and other health care professionals and entities.\nWe may also be subject to data privacy and security obligations, including federal and state laws related to the privacy and security of personal information. The Health Insurance\nPortability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and its implementing\nregulations (the “HIPAA Rules”) imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of protected health information (“PHI”) and may apply to certain of\nthe information we process. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s security and certain of its privacy requirements directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as\nindependent contractors or agents of covered entities, or other business associates, that create, receive, maintain, obtain, or transmit PHI in connection with providing a service on\nbehalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and\ngave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs\nassociated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each\nother in significant ways and may not have the same requirements, thus complicating compliance efforts.\n19\nTo the extent that any of our product candidates, once approved, are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for\ninstance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of\npayments or other transfers of value to healthcare professionals.\nThe shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with different compliance and/or reporting requirements in multiple\njurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any\nother governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or\nrestructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our\nbusiness and our financial results.\nCoverage and Reimbursement\nSignificant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other\ncountries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third party\npayors. Third party payors include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will\nprovide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third party payors may limit\ncoverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. A decision by a third party\npayor not to cover our products, if approved, could reduce physician utilization of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and\nfinancial condition. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third party\nreimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.\nIn addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on\ncoverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. By way of example, in the United States, the ACA contains provisions that may reduce the\nprofitability of drug products, including, for example, increased rebates for drugs sold to Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans,\nmandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries, and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. In addition, recently\nthere has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries\nand proposed bills designed to, among other things, reform government program reimbursement methodologies. For example, on August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022,\nor IRA, was signed into law. Among other things, the IRA requires manufacturers of certain drugs to engage in price negotiations with Medicare (beginning in 2026), with prices that\ncan be negotiated subject to a cap; imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation (first due in 2023); and replaces the\nPart D coverage gap discount program with a new discounting program (beginning in 2025). The IRA permits the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to\nimplement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. For that and other reasons, it is currently unclear how the IRA will be effectuated.\nAdditional state and federal healthcare reform measures may be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare\nproducts and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products once approved or additional pricing pressures.\nForeign Regulation\nIn order to market any product outside of the United States, we must comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and\ngoverning, among other things, clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. While our management and many of our consultants are familiar with and have\nbeen responsible for gaining marketing approval in many countries, we have not reviewed the specific regulations in countries outside of the United States, as it pertains to\ncannabinoids.\nAdditional Regulation\nWe are a reporting company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), and, therefore, subject to the information and reporting requirements of the Exchange Act of\n1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\") and other federal securities laws, and the compliance obligations of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\"Sarbanes-Oxley Act\"). In addition, our\nfinancial reporting is subject to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"), and GAAP is subject to change over time.\n20\nWe are also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations applied to businesses generally. We believe that we are in conformity with all applicable laws in all relevant\njurisdictions.\nEmployees & Human Capital Resources\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, we have a total of eleven full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining\nagreement. The majority of our employees work remotely, which we believe has provided us with greater access to qualified personnel around the United States. At the Company, we\nstrive to foster collaborative, communicative and flexible environment so that our employees feel supported in the workplace.\nWe anticipate that we will need to hire additional employees or independent contractors for our continued development efforts. We also intend to utilize independent contractors and\noutsourced services, such as CROs and third party manufacturers, where possible and appropriate.\nCorporate Information\nWe were incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 16, 2011.\nOur principal executive office is located at 11250 El Camino Real, Suite 100, San Diego, CA 92130.

Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial also\nmay materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nRisk Factor Summary\nBelow is a summary of the principal factors that make an investment in our common stock speculative or risky. This summary does not address all of the risks that we face. Additional\ndiscussion of the risks summarized in this risk factor summary, and other risks that we face, can be found below under the heading “Risk Factors” and should be carefully considered,\ntogether with other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, before making an investment\ndecision regarding our common stock.\n• We have a limited operating history, have incurred significant operating losses since our inception and expect to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future. We may\nnever generate any revenue or become profitable or, if we achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain it.\n• We are heavily dependent on the success of our early-stage product candidates, SBI-100 and nimacimab, which will require significant additional efforts to develop and\nmay prove not to be viable for commercialization.\n21\n• Serious adverse events or undesirable side effects or other unexpected properties of any of our product candidates may be identified during development or after approval\nthat could delay, prevent or cause the withdrawal of marketing approval, limit the commercial potential, or result in significant negative consequences following marketing\napproval.\n• We expect to rely on third parties, such as CROs, to conduct some or all of our nonclinical and clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their\ncontractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize any of our product candidates.\n• We rely on, and expect to continue relying on, third party contract manufacturing organizations to manufacture and supply product candidates for us, as well as certain raw\nmaterials used in the production thereof. If one of our suppliers or manufacturers fails to perform adequately, we may be required to incur significant delays and costs to find\nnew suppliers or manufacturers.\n• If we fail to enter and maintain successful collaborative arrangements or strategic alliances for our product candidates, we may have to reduce or delay our product\ncandidate development or increase our expenditures.\n• We expect to face intense competition, often from companies with greater resources and experience than we have.\n• UM is the owner of intellectual property underlying SBI-100 OE\n• Our product candidate, SBI-100 OE, will be subject to U.S. controlled substance laws and regulations, and failure to comply with or the cost of compliance with these\nlaws and regulations, may adversely affect the results of our business operations, and our financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Limited Operating History, Financial Position and Capital Requirements\nWe have a limited operating history, have incurred significant operating losses since our inception and expect to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future. We may never\ngenerate any revenue or become profitable or, if we achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain it.\nPharmaceutical product development is a highly speculative undertaking and involves a substantial degree of risk. We are a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company with a limited\noperating history upon which you can evaluate our business and prospects. We commenced operations in 2011, and to date, we have focused primarily on organizing and staffing our\ncompany, business planning, raising capital, discovering potential product candidates, and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials. Our approach to the discovery and\ndevelopment of product candidates is unproven, and we do not know whether we will be able to develop any products of commercial value. In addition, we have only two product\ncandidates, SBI-100 and nimacimab, in clinical development. We have not yet demonstrated an ability to obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, manufacture a\ncommercial scale product, or arrange for a third party to do so on our behalf, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful product commercialization.\nConsequently, any predictions made about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a history of successfully developing and commercializing\npharmaceutical products.\nWe have incurred significant operating losses since our inception. If our product candidates are not successfully developed and approved, we may never generate any revenue. We have\nincurred cumulative net losses since our inception and, as of December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of $104,382,549. Our losses have primarily resulted from expenses\nincurred in connection with our research and development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations. All of our product candidates will\nrequire substantial additional development time and resources before we would be able to apply for or receive regulatory approvals and begin generating revenue from product sales.\nWe expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and we anticipate these losses will increase substantially as we continue our development of, seek regulatory approval\nfor and potentially commercialize any approved products.\n22\nTo become and remain profitable, we must succeed in developing and eventually commercializing or licensing products that generate significant revenue. This will require us to be\nsuccessful in a range of challenging activities, including clinical trials of our product candidates, discovering additional product candidates, obtaining regulatory approval for these\nproduct candidates and manufacturing, marketing and selling any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. We may never succeed in these activities and, even if we do,\nmay never generate revenues that are significant enough to achieve profitability. In addition, we have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully overcome many of the risks and\nuncertainties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving fields, particularly in the biopharmaceutical industry. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties\nassociated with pharmaceutical product development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve\nprofitability. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable\nwould depress the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our research and development efforts, diversify our product\ncandidates or even continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company could also cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\nWe will require substantial additional financing to achieve our goals, and a failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, could force us to\ndelay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development programs, commercialization efforts or other operations.\nThe development of biopharmaceutical product candidates and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials are time-consuming and capital-intensive. We expect our expenses to\nincrease in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we conduct our ongoing and planned Phase 2 clinical trials of SBI-100 and nimacimab and continue our research and\ndevelopment activities. Furthermore, we incur, and expect to continue to incur, additional costs associated with operating as a public company. At the same time, our commercial\nrevenues, if any, will be derived from sales of products that we do not expect to be commercially available for many years, if at all. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial\nadditional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate\nour research and development programs or any future commercialization efforts.\nWe believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment securities will enable us to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. We have based this estimate on\nassumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Our operating plans and other demands on our cash resources may\nchange as a result of many factors currently unknown to us. Because the outcome of any preclinical study or clinical trial is highly uncertain, we cannot reasonably estimate the actual\namounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors,\nincluding:\n• the type, number, scope, progress, expansions, results, costs and timing of our preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates which we are pursuing or may\nchoose to pursue in the future;\n• the costs and timing of manufacturing and laboratory testing for our product candidates, including clinical supplies and commercial manufacturing if any product candidate is\napproved;\n• the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;\n• the costs of obtaining, maintaining and enforcing our patents and other intellectual property rights;\n• our efforts to enhance operational systems and hire additional personnel to satisfy our obligations as a public company, including enhanced internal controls over financial\nreporting;\n• the costs associated with hiring additional and retaining existing personnel and consultants as our preclinical and clinical activities increase;\n• the costs and timing of establishing or securing sales and marketing capabilities if any product candidate is approved;\n• our ability to achieve sufficient market acceptance, adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors and adequate market share and revenue for any approved\nproducts;\n• the effect of competing technological and market developments;\n• the terms and timing of establishing and maintaining collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements;\n• costs associated with any products or technologies that we may in-license or acquire; and\n• the funding of any co-development arrangements we enter into.\n23\nAccordingly, we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned, including through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources or through strategic\ncollaborations. Attempting to secure additional financing may divert our management from our day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop our product\ncandidates. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. We do not currently have any active grants nor do we expect grant revenues to be a\nmaterial source of future revenue. If we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis, we may be required to significantly curtail, delay or discontinue one or more of our research or\ndevelopment programs, including our clinical trial programs, or any future commercialization of any product candidates, or be unable to sustain or expand our operations or otherwise\ncapitalize on our business opportunities, as desired, any of which could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to raise capital may be limited by applicable laws and regulations.\nUsing a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 to raise additional capital generally takes less time and is less expensive than other means, such as conducting an offering under a\nForm S-1 registration statement. However, our ability to raise capital using a shelf registration statement may be limited by, among other things, SEC rules and regulations. Under SEC\nrules and regulations, if our public float (the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates) is less than $75,000,000, then the aggregate market value of securities sold by\nus or on our behalf under our Form S-3 in any 12-month period is limited to an aggregate of one-third of our public float. While our public float is currently more than $75,000,000,\nwe have been subject to this limitation in the past and we may be subject to it again in the future. If our ability to utilize a Form S-3 registration statement for a primary offering of our\nsecurities is limited to one-third of our public float, we may conduct such an offering pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act or under a Form S-1\nregistration statement, and we would expect either of those alternatives to increase the cost of raising additional capital relative to utilizing a Form S-3 registration statement.\nThe sale of additional shares or other equity securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders.\nWe require additional capital for the development and commercialization of our product candidates and may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or\nother future developments, including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue. If our resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, we will seek to sell\nadditional equity or debt securities or obtain a credit facility. The sale of additional equity securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders. If we incur additional\nindebtedness it would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations. We cannot assure you that\nfinancing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nRisks Related to the Discovery, Development and Regulatory Approval of Our Product Candidates\nWe are heavily dependent on the success of our early-stage product candidates, SBI-100 and nimacimab, which will require significant additional efforts to develop and may prove\nnot to be viable for commercialization.\nWe have no products approved for sale and all of our product candidates are in clinical development. Our business depends entirely on the successful development, clinical testing, and\ncommercialization of these and any other product candidates we may seek to develop in the future, which may never occur.\nThe success of our product candidates will depend on several factors, any one of which we may not be able to successfully complete, such as:\n• With respect to SBI-100, receipt of necessary controlled substance registrations from the DEA;\n• successful completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n• approval from regulatory agencies, such as the FDA or an IRB, to conduct our clinical trials;\n• receipt of marketing approvals from the FDA and other applicable regulatory authorities;\n• obtaining, maintaining and protecting our intellectual property portfolio, including patents and trade secrets, and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates;\n• identifying, making arrangements and ensuring necessary registrations with third-party manufacturers, or establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities for applicable\nproduct candidates;\n• launching commercial sales of the products, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others;\n• acceptance of our products, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;\n• effectively competing with other therapies;\n24\n• obtaining and maintaining healthcare coverage and adequate reimbursement of our products; and\n• maintaining a continued acceptable safety profile of our products following approval.\nIf we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize our product\ncandidates, which would materially harm our business.\nDue to our limited resources, we may be forced to focus on a limited number of development candidates which may force us to pass on opportunities that could have a greater\nchance of clinical success.\nDue to our limited resources and capabilities, we will have to decide to focus on developing a limited number of product candidates, currently SBI-100 and nimacimab. As a result, we\nmay forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation\ndecisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial product candidates or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on research and development programs and\nproduct candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular\nproduct candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been\nmore advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate.\nIf we fail to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of any product candidate that we develop to the satisfaction of the regulatory authorities, we may incur additional costs or\nexperience difficulty in completing, the development and commercialization of such product candidate.\nWe are not permitted to commercialize, market, promote, or sell any product candidate in the United States without obtaining marketing approval from the FDA or in other countries\nwithout obtaining approvals from comparable foreign regulatory authorities, such as the European Medicines Agency, and we may never receive such approvals. To gain approval to\nmarket a drug product, we must complete extensive nonclinical development and clinical trials that demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product for the intended indication to the\nsatisfaction of the FDA or other regulatory authority.\nWe have not previously submitted a NDA to the FDA, or similar drug approval filings to comparable foreign authorities, for any product candidate, and we cannot be certain that any\nof our product candidates will be successful in clinical trials or receive regulatory approval. If we do not receive regulatory approval for our product candidates, we may not be able to\ncontinue our operations. Even if we successfully obtain regulatory approval to market our product candidates, our revenue will be dependent, in part, upon the size of the markets in\nthe territories for which we gain regulatory approval and have commercial rights.\nThe FDA or any foreign regulatory bodies could delay, limit or deny approval of our product candidates for many reasons, including our inability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of\nthe FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory body that the product candidate is safe and effective for the requested indication, the regulatory agency’s disagreement with the\ninterpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials, or our inability to demonstrate that the clinical and other benefits of the product candidate outweigh any safety or other\nperceived risks. The FDA or applicable regulatory body could also require additional preclinical or clinical studies, deny approval of the formulation, labeling or the specifications of\nthe product candidate, or the manufacturing processes or facilities of third party manufacturers with which we contract. The policies of the applicable regulatory agencies could also\nsignificantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.\nEven if we eventually complete clinical testing and receive approval of a NDA or foreign regulatory filing for a product candidate, the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory agency\nmay grant approval contingent on the performance of costly additional clinical trials. The FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory agency also may approve the product candidate for\na more limited indication or a narrower patient population than we originally requested, and the FDA, or applicable foreign regulatory agency, may not approve the labeling that we\nbelieve is necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of the product. Any delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, applicable regulatory approval would delay or\nprevent commercialization of the product candidate and would materially adversely impact our business and prospects.\n25\nNonclinical and clinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome. We may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing,\nor ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nClinical testing is expensive and can take several years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Moreover, obtaining sufficient quantities of certain product of SBI-100 for\nclinical testing is subject to regulation by DEA and, in some cases, NIDA (National Institute of Drug Abuse). It is impossible to predict when or if any of our product candidates will\nprove effective or safe in humans or will receive regulatory approval. Before obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of any product candidate, we must\ncomplete preclinical studies and then conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans. A failure of one or more clinical\ntrials can occur at any stage of testing. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive\nmarketing approval or subsequently to commercialize our product candidates, including:\n• FDA, DEA or NIDA or other foreign equivalent authorities may not authorize the use and distribution of sufficient quantities of product for clinical testing;\n• regulators or independent institutional review boards (IRBs) may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective\ntrial site;\n• we may experience delays in reaching, or fail to reach, agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective trial sites;\n• regulators or IRBs may require that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements\nor a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n• the cost of clinical trials of our product candidates may be greater than we anticipate;\n• our product candidates may have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics, causing us or our investigators, regulators or IRBs to suspend or terminate the\ntrials.\nIf we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in clinical trials, our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.\nWe may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for our product candidates if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these\ntrials as required by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. In addition, some of our competitors have ongoing clinical trials for product candidates that\ntreat the same indications as our product candidates, and patients who would otherwise be eligible for our clinical trials may instead enroll in clinical trials of our competitors’ product\ncandidates. Patient enrollment is affected by other factors including the severity of the disease under investigation, the eligibility criteria for the study in question, the perceived risks\nand benefits of the product candidate, the patient referral practices of physicians, the ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment, and the proximity and\navailability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients.\nOur inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for our clinical trials would result in significant delays and could require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether,\nwhich could result in increased development costs and cause the value of our company to decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing.\n26\nOur development and commercialization strategy for SBI-100 OE, may depend, in part, on published scientific literature and the FDA’s prior findings regarding the safety and\nefficacy of dronabinol, based on data not developed by us, but upon which the FDA may rely in reviewing our NDA.\nThe Hatch-Waxman Act added Section 505(b)(2) to the FDCA, Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of a NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from\ninvestigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations\nwere conducted. The FDA interprets Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, for purposes of approving a NDA, to permit the applicant to rely, in part, upon published literature or the FDA’s\nprevious findings of safety and efficacy for an approved product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional clinical trials or measurements to support any deviation\nfrom the previously approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been\napproved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. The label, however, may require all or some of the limitations, contraindications, warnings or\nprecautions included in the listed product’s label, including a black box warning, or may require additional limitations, contraindications, warnings or precautions. Depending on\nguidance from the FDA, we may decide to submit a NDA for SBI-100 under Section 505(b)(2) relying, in part, on the FDA’s previous findings of safety and efficacy from\ninvestigations for the approved drug product dronabinol for which we have not received a right of reference and published scientific literature. Even though we may be able to take\nadvantage of Section 505(b)(2) to support potential U.S. approval, the FDA may require us to perform additional clinical trials or measurements to support approval. In addition,\nnotwithstanding the approval of many products by the FDA pursuant to Section 505(b)(2), some pharmaceutical companies and others have objected to the FDA’s interpretation of\nSection 505(b)(2). If the FDA changes its interpretation of Section 505(b)(2), or if the FDA’s interpretation is successfully challenged in court, this could delay or even prevent the\nFDA from approving any Section 505(b)(2) NDAs that we submit. Such a result could require us to conduct additional testing and costly clinical trials, which could substantially delay\nor prevent the approval and launch of SBI-100 or future product candidates.\nSerious adverse events or undesirable side effects or other unexpected properties of any of our product candidates may be identified during development or after approval that\ncould delay, prevent or cause the withdrawal of marketing approval, limit the commercial potential, or result in significant negative consequences following marketing approval.\nSerious adverse events or undesirable side effects caused by, or other unexpected properties of, our product candidates could cause us, an IRB, or regulatory authorities to interrupt,\ndelay or halt our clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label, the imposition of distribution or use restrictions or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or\ncomparable foreign regulatory authorities. If any of our product candidates are associated with serious adverse events or undesirable side effects or have properties that are unexpected,\nwe may need to abandon their development or limit development to certain uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less\nsevere or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. In our completed Phase 1 study of nimacimab, reported treatment emergent adverse events were diarrhea, headache,\ndizziness, upper respiratory tract infection, nausea and vomiting. In our completed Phase 1 study of SBI-100, the following adverse events occurred and were considered probably or\npossibly related to the study drug, included discomfort and pain upon eye drop instillation and mild hyperaemia. However, further analysis may reveal adverse events inconsistent with\nthe safety results observed. Many compounds that initially showed promise in clinical or earlier stage testing have later been found to cause undesirable or unexpected side effects that\nprevented further development of the compound.\nUndesirable side effects or other unexpected adverse events or properties of any of our other product candidates could arise or become known either during clinical development or, if\napproved, after the approved product has been marketed. If such an event occurs during development, our trials could be suspended or terminated and the FDA or comparable foreign\nregulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of, or deny approval of, our product candidates. If such an event occurs after such product candidates are approved, a\nnumber of potentially significant negative consequences may result, including withdrawal of regulatory approval, requirements for additional warnings on the label, use or distribution\nrestrictions, requirements to conduct post-market studies, requirements to create a medication guide outlining side effects, and liability for harm caused to patients.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product candidate, if approved, or could substantially increase\ncommercialization costs and expenses, which could delay or prevent us from generating revenue from the sale of our products and harm our business and results of operations.\n27\nAs an organization, we have never conducted later-stage clinical trials or submitted an NDA or BLA, and may be unable to do so for any of our product candidates.\nWe are early in our development efforts for our product candidates, and we will need to successfully complete pivotal clinical trials in order to seek FDA or applicable foreign\nauthority approval to market SBI-100, nimacimab and any future product candidates we may develop. Carrying out clinical trials and the submission of NDAs and BLAs are\ncomplicated. Based on the stage of development of our product candidates, the Company has not conducted any later stage or pivotal clinical trials. We also plan to conduct a number\nof clinical trials for multiple product candidates in parallel over the next several years. This may be a difficult process to manage with our limited resources and may divert the\nattention of management. In addition, we cannot be certain how many clinical trials of our product candidates will be required or how such trials will have to be designed to obtain\nmarketing authorization. Consequently, we may be unable to successfully and efficiently execute and complete necessary clinical trials in a way that leads to regulatory submission and\napproval of any of our product candidates. We may require more time and incur greater costs than our competitors and may not succeed in obtaining marketing approvals of product\ncandidates that we develop. Failure to commence or complete, or delays in, our planned clinical trials, could prevent us from or delay us in submitting NDAs for and commercializing\nour product candidates.\nWe have conducted clinical trials for our product candidates outside of the United States and we may do so for our product candidates in the future. However, the FDA and other\nforeign equivalents may not accept data from such trials, in which case our development plans will be delayed, which could materially harm our business.\nWe have conducted our initial Phase 1 clinical trial for SBI-100 OE in Australia. The acceptance of study data from clinical trials conducted outside the U.S. or another jurisdiction by\nthe FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority may be subject to certain conditions or may not be accepted at all. For example, in cases where data from foreign clinical trials\nare intended to serve as the sole basis for marketing approval in the U.S., the FDA will generally not approve the application on the basis of foreign data alone unless (i) the data are\napplicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice; (ii) the trials were performed by clinical investigators of recognized competence and pursuant to GCP regulations; and (iii)\nthe data may be considered valid without the need for an on-site inspection by the FDA, or if the FDA considers such inspection to be necessary, the FDA is able to validate the data\nthrough an on-site inspection or other appropriate means. In addition, even where the foreign study data are not intended to serve as the sole basis for approval, the FDA will not accept\nthe data as support for an application for marketing approval unless the study is adequately designed and well-controlled, conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the\nFDA is able to validate the data from the study through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary. Many foreign regulatory authorities have similar approval requirements. In addition,\nsuch foreign trials would be subject to the applicable local laws of the foreign jurisdictions where the trials are conducted.\nConducting trials outside the United States also exposes us to additional risks, including risks associated with:\n• additional foreign regulatory requirements;\n• foreign exchange fluctuations;\n• compliance with foreign manufacturing, customs, shipment and storage requirements;\n• cultural differences in medical practice and clinical research;\n• diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries; and\n• interruptions or delays in our trials resulting from geopolitical events, such as war or terrorism.\nPreliminary, topline and interim data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may change as more patient data become available and are subject to\naudit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data.\nFrom time to time, we may publicly disclose interim, preliminary or topline data from our clinical trials, which are based on a preliminary analysis of then-available data, and the\nresults and related findings and conclusions are subject to change following a more comprehensive review of the data related to the particular study or trial. We also make assumptions,\nestimations, calculations and conclusions as part of our analyses of data, and we may not have received or had the opportunity to fully and carefully evaluate all data. As a result, the\ntopline or preliminary results that we report may differ from future results of the same studies, or different conclusions or considerations may qualify such results, once additional data\nhave been received and fully evaluated. Topline and preliminary data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different\nfrom the topline or preliminary data we previously made public. As a result, topline and preliminary data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. From time to\ntime, we may also disclose interim data from our clinical trials. Interim data from clinical trials that we may complete are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes\nmay materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available. Adverse differences between topline, preliminary or interim data and final data could\nsignificantly harm our business prospects.\n28\nFurther, others, including regulatory agencies, may not accept or agree with our assumptions, estimates, calculations, conclusions or analyses or may interpret or weigh the importance\nof data differently, which could impact the value of the particular program, the approvability or commercialization of the particular product candidate or product and our company in\ngeneral. In addition, the information we choose to publicly disclose regarding a particular study or clinical trial is based on what is typically extensive information, and you or others\nmay not agree with what we determine is the material or otherwise appropriate information to include in our disclosure, and any information we determine not to disclose may\nultimately be deemed significant with respect to future decisions, conclusions, views, activities or otherwise regarding a particular product, product candidate or our business. If the\ntopline or preliminary data that we report differ from actual results, or if others, including regulatory authorities, disagree with the conclusions reached, our ability to obtain approval\nfor, and commercialize, our product candidates may be harmed, which could harm our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition.\nDisruptions at the FDA and other government agencies caused by funding shortages or global health concerns could hinder their ability to hire, retain or deploy key leadership\nand other personnel, or otherwise prevent new or modified products from being developed, approved or commercialized in a timely manner or at all, which could negatively\nimpact our business.\nThe ability of the FDA and applicable foreign authorities to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels,\nability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory, and policy changes. Average review times at the FDA have fluctuated in recent\nyears as a result. In addition, government funding of other government agencies that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently\nfluid and unpredictable. Disruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new drugs to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies,\nwhich would adversely affect our business. For example, over the last several years, the U.S. government shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA,\nfurloughed critical employees and ceased critical activities.\nSeparately, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA postponed most inspections of domestic and foreign manufacturing facilities at various points. Even though the FDA has\nsince resumed standard inspection operations of domestic facilities where feasible, any resurgence of the virus or emergence of new variants may lead to further inspectional delays.\nFurther, regulatory authorities outside the United States may adopt similar restrictions or other policy measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic or any other pandemic or\noutbreak of a contagious disease. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, or if global health concerns prevent the FDA or other regulatory authorities from conducting their\nregular inspections, reviews or other regulatory activities, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA or other regulatory authorities to timely review and process our regulatory\nsubmissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThird parties may obtain FDA regulatory exclusivity to our detriment.\nWe plan to seek to obtain market exclusivity for our drug candidates and any other drug candidates we develop in the future. To the extent that patent protection is not available or has\nexpired, FDA marketing exclusivity may be the only available form of exclusivity available for these proposed products. Marketing exclusivity can delay the submission or the\napproval of certain marketing applications. Potentially competitive products may also seek marketing exclusivity and may be in various stages of development, including some more\nadvanced than our drug candidates. We cannot predict with certainty the timing of FDA approval or whether FDA approval will be granted, nor can we predict with certainty the timing\nof FDA approval for competing products or whether such approval will be granted. It is possible that competing products may obtain FDA approval with marketing exclusivity before\nwe do, which could delay our ability to submit a marketing application or obtain necessary regulatory approvals, result in lost market opportunities with respect to our drug candidates\nand materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n29\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\nWe expect to rely on third parties, such as CROs, to conduct some or all of our nonclinical and clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual\nduties or meet expected deadlines, we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize any of our product candidates.\nWe expect to rely on medical institutions, clinical investigators, contract laboratories and other third parties, such as CROs, to conduct our nonclinical and clinical studies on our\nproduct candidates in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. For example, we are currently engaged with a CRO in the United States, to conduct our Phase 2 clinical\nstudy for SBI-100 OE . These third parties will not be our employees and, except for restrictions imposed by our contracts with such third parties, we will have limited ability to\ncontrol the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs. Although we expect to rely on these third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials, we\nwill remain responsible for ensuring that each of our preclinical studies and clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its investigational plan and protocol and the applicable legal,\nregulatory, and scientific standards, and our reliance on these third parties will not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. In the case of our Phase 2 trial for SBI-100 OE, these\nentities must maintain and comply with valid DEA registrations and requirements. The FDA and regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions require us to comply with regulations and\nstandards, commonly referred to as current good clinical practices, for conducting, monitoring, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials, in order to ensure that the data and\nresults are scientifically credible and accurate and that the trial subjects are adequately informed of the potential risks of participating in clinical trials. If we or any of our third party\ncontractors fail to comply with applicable current good clinical practices, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign\nregulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. In addition, we are required to report certain financial interests\nof our third party investigators if these relationships exceed certain financial thresholds and meet other criteria. The FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may question the\nintegrity of the data from those clinical trials conducted by principal investigators who previously served or currently serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us from time to time\nand receive cash compensation in connection with such services. Our clinical trials must also generally be conducted with products produced under current good manufacturing\npractice regulations. Our failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.\nSome of the third parties with whom we contract may also have relationships with other commercial entities, some of which may compete with us. If the third parties conducting our\npreclinical studies or our clinical trials do not perform their contractual duties or obligations or comply with regulatory requirements, we may need to enter into new arrangements with\nalternative third parties. This could be costly, and our nonclinical studies or clinical trials may need to be extended, delayed, terminated or repeated, and we may not be able to obtain\nregulatory approval in a timely fashion, or at all, for the applicable product candidate, or to commercialize such product candidate being tested in such studies or trials. If any of our\nrelationships with these third parties terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative third party contractors or to do so on commercially reasonable terms.\nThough we plan to carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter similar challenges or delays in the future or that these\ndelays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nWe rely on, and expect to continue relying on, third party contract manufacturing organizations to manufacture and supply product candidates for us, as well as certain raw\nmaterials used in the production thereof. If one of our suppliers or manufacturers fails to perform adequately, we may be required to incur significant delays and costs to find new\nsuppliers or manufacturers.\nWe do not own facilities for, manufacturing our product candidates. We rely on, and expect to continue relying upon, third party manufacturing organizations to manufacture and\nsupply our product candidates and certain raw materials used in the production thereof. Some of our key components for the production of our product candidates may have a limited\nnumber of suppliers.\n30\nThe facilities used by our contract manufacturers to manufacture our product candidates must be approved by the FDA pursuant to inspections that will be conducted after we submit\nour NDA to the FDA. We expect that we will not control the manufacturing process of, and will be completely dependent on, our contract manufacturing partners for compliance with\ncurrent good manufacturing practice requirements, for manufacture of our drug products. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our\nspecifications and the strict regulatory requirements of, as applicable, the FDA, DEA or others, they will not be able to secure and/or maintain DEA registrations and regulatory\napproval for their manufacturing facilities. In addition, we expect that we will have no control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control,\nquality assurance and qualified personnel. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our product candidates, or,\nwith respect to SBI-100, if DEA does not register these facilities for the manufacture of controlled substances, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would\nsignificantly impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market our product candidates, if approved.\nAlthough we have quality agreements governing our development of clinical supplies, we do not have any commercial supply agreements with our suppliers. In the event that we and\nour suppliers cannot agree to the terms and conditions for them to provide clinical and commercial supply needs, we would not be able to manufacture our product or candidates until a\nqualified alternative supplier is identified, which could also delay the development of, and impair our ability to commercialize, our product candidates. The failure of third party\nmanufacturers or suppliers to perform adequately or the termination of our arrangements with any of them may adversely affect our business.\nIf we fail to enter and maintain successful collaborative arrangements or strategic alliances for our product candidates, we may have to reduce or delay our product candidate\ndevelopment or increase our expenditures.\nAn important element of our strategy for developing, manufacturing and commercializing our product candidates is entering into collaborative arrangements or strategic alliances with\npharmaceutical companies, research institutions or other industry participants to advance our programs and enable us to maintain our financial and operational capacity. As of the date\nof this filing, we have only one collaboration agreement with Tautomer Biosciences (Pty) Limited (“Tautomer”), pursuant to which, among other things, we granted to Tautomer an\nexclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize one or more products containing our proprietary amino acid ester prodrug of delta delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, in the\nlicensed field in the countries of the continent of Africa and their territories and possessions. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate alliances. We may not be able to\nnegotiate alliances on acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, these alliances may be unsuccessful. If we fail to create and maintain suitable alliances, we may have to limit the size or\nscope of, or delay, one or more of our research or development programs.\nIn addition, these kinds of collaborative arrangements and strategic alliances may place certain aspects of the development of our product candidates outside of our control, may\nrequire us to relinquish important rights or may otherwise be on terms unfavorable to us.\nDependence on collaborative arrangements or strategic alliances will subject us to several risks, including the risks that:\n• we may not be able to control the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators may devote to the product candidates;\n• a significant change in the senior management team, a change in the financial condition or a change in the business operations, including a change in control or internal\ncorporate restructuring, of any of our collaborators, could result in delayed timelines, re-prioritization of our programs, decreasing resources or funding allocated to support\nour programs, or termination of the collaborations;\n• we may be required to relinquish important rights such as marketing and distribution rights;\n• business combinations or significant changes in a collaborator’s business strategy may also adversely affect a collaborator’s willingness or ability to complete its obligations\nunder any arrangement;\n• a collaborator could independently move forward with a competing product candidate developed either independently or in collaboration with others, including our\ncompetitors;\n• collaborative arrangements are often terminated or allowed to expire, which would delay development and may increase the cost of developing our product candidates;\n• collaborators may not comply with all applicable regulatory and legal requirements\n31\nRisks Related to Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\nEven if we receive marketing approval for a product candidate, we will be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in\nsignificant additional expense and subject us to restrictions, withdrawal from the market, or penalties if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements or if we\nexperience unanticipated problems with our product candidates, when and if approved.\nOnce regulatory approval has been granted, the approved product and its manufacturer are subject to continual review by the FDA, the DEA (with respect to SBI-100 OE) and/or non-\nU.S. regulatory authorities and such approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or contain requirements for potentially costly\npost-marketing follow-up studies or surveillance. In addition, we will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements with regard to labeling, packaging, adverse event\nreporting, storage, distribution, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and submission of safety and other post-market information. Manufacturers of our products and manufacturers’\nfacilities are required to comply with current good manufacturing practice regulations, which include requirements related to quality control and quality assurance as well as the\ncorresponding maintenance of records and documentation Accordingly, we and others with whom we work must continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory\ncompliance, including manufacturing, production and quality control. We will also be required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems, if any, to the FDA and to\ncomply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for our products. If we, any future collaboration partner or a regulatory authority discovers previously unknown\nproblems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory authority may\nimpose restrictions on that product, the collaboration partner, the manufacturer or us, including requiring withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing.\nAny DEA registrations that we receive for SBI-100 may also be subject to limitations such as the DEA’s annual manufacturing and procurement quota requirements. The annual quota\nallocated to us or our contract manufacturers for the controlled substances in our product candidates may not be sufficient to meet commercial demand. Our facilities that handle\ncontrolled substances, and those of our third party contractors, will also be subject to registration requirements and periodic inspections. Additionally, if approved by the FDA, the\nfinished dosage forms of certain of SBI-100 OE will be subject to the DEA’s rescheduling process, which may delay product launch and impose additional regulatory burdens. Failure\nto maintain compliance with the CSA, particularly non-compliance resulting in loss or diversion, can result in regulatory action that could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate proceedings to restrict, suspend or revoke\nthose registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could lead to criminal proceedings. For additional information, see Risk Factor, “Our product candidate, SBI-100 OE, will be\nsubject to U.S. controlled substance laws and regulations, and failure to comply with or the cost of compliance with these laws and regulations, may adversely affect the results of our\nbusiness operations, and our financial condition.”\nThe FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs to ensure drugs are marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions\nof the approved labeling and regulatory requirements. If we, our product candidates or the manufacturing facilities for our product candidates fail to comply with regulatory\nrequirements of the FDA and/or other non-U.S. regulatory authorities, we could be subject to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions.\nWidely publicized events concerning the safety risk of certain drug products have resulted in the withdrawal of drug products, revisions to drug labeling that further limit use of the\ndrug products and the imposition by the FDA of risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. In addition, widely publicized events\nconcerning the safety risk of certain drug products have resulted in the withdrawal of drug products, revisions to drug labeling that further limit use of the drug products and the\nimposition by the FDA of risk evaluation and mitigation strategies to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. In addition, because of the serious public health risks of\nhigh-profile adverse safety events with certain products, the FDA may require, as a condition of approval, costly risk evaluation and mitigation strategies programs.\nWe cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or in other\ncountries. If we or any future collaboration partner are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we or such collaboration partner, as applicable, will not be permitted to market our\nfuture products and our business will suffer.\n32\nWe expect to face intense competition, often from companies with greater resources and experience than we have.\nThe highly competitive pharmaceutical industry continues to rapidly expand and evolve as an increasing number of competitors and potential competitors enter the market, many of\nwhich have substantially greater financial, technological, managerial and research and development resources and experience than we have. Our competitors have developed, are\ndeveloping or may develop products, product candidates and processes competitive with our product candidates. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and\ncommercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. We believe that a significant number of products are currently under\ndevelopment, and may become commercially available in the future, for the treatment of conditions for which we may attempt to develop product candidates. In particular, there is\nintense competition in the field of metabolic disorders and glaucoma. Our competitors include larger and better funded pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical, biotechnological and\ntherapeutics companies. Moreover, we may also compete with universities and other research institutions who may be active in metabolic disorders and glaucoma research and could\nbe in direct competition with us. We also compete with these organizations to recruit management, scientists and clinical development personnel, which could negatively affect our\nlevel of expertise and our ability to execute our business plan. We will also face competition in establishing clinical trial sites, enrolling subjects for clinical trials and in identifying and\nin-licensing new product candidates. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and\nestablished companies.\nIf we successfully obtain approval for any product candidate, we will face competition based on many different factors, including the safety and effectiveness of our products, the ease\nwith which our products can be administered and the extent to which patients accept relatively new routes of administration, the timing and scope of regulatory approvals for these\nproducts, the availability and cost of manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities, price, reimbursement coverage and patent position. Competing products could present superior\ntreatment alternatives, including by being more effective, safer, more convenient, less expensive or marketed and sold more effectively than any products we may develop.\nCompetitive products may make any products we develop obsolete or noncompetitive before we recover the expense of developing and commercializing our product candidates.\nFor additional information about our competitors and competitive products, see the section entitled \"Competition\" in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIf we are unable to compete effectively, our opportunity to generate revenue from the sale of our products we may develop, if approved, could be material and adversely affected,\nwhich would materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and business.\nEven if our current or future product candidates receive marketing approval, they may fail to achieve market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors or others in\nthe medical community necessary for commercial success.\nEven if our current or future product candidates receive marketing approval, they may fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in\nthe medical community. If they do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenue and may not become profitable. The degree of market\nacceptance of our current or future product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to:\n• the clinical indications for which the product candidate is approved;\n• the efficacy and potential advantages compared to alternative treatments and therapies;\n• the timing of market introduction of the product as well as competitive products;\n• effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts;\n• the strength of our relationships with patient communities;\n• the cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments and therapies, including any similar generic treatments;\n• our ability to offer such product for sale at competitive prices;\n• the convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments and therapies;\n• the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;\n• the availability of third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement;\n• the willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of coverage and adequate reimbursement by third-party payors and government authorities;\n• the strength of marketing and distribution support;\n33\n• the prevalence and severity of any side effects; and\n• any restrictions on the use of the product together with other medications.\nOur efforts to educate physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community on the benefits of our product candidates may require significant resources and may\nnever be successful. Such efforts may require more resources than are typically required due to the complexity and uniqueness of our product candidates. Because we expect sales of\nour product candidates, if approved, to generate substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future, the failure of our product candidates, if approved, to find market acceptance\nwould harm our business and could require us to seek additional financing.\nCoverage and adequate reimbursement may not be available for our current or any future product candidates, which could make it difficult for us to sell profitably, if approved.\nMarket acceptance and sales of any product candidates that we commercialize, if approved, will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these\ndrugs and related treatments will be available from third-party payors, including government health administration authorities, managed care organizations and other private health\ninsurers. Third-party payors decide which therapies they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Commercial payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment\nlimitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies. However, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any\nproduct candidates that we develop will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. One third-party payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug does not assure that other payors will\nalso provide coverage, and adequate reimbursement, for the drug. Additionally, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a therapy does not imply that an adequate\nreimbursement rate will be approved. Each third-party payor determines whether or not it will provide coverage for a therapy, what amount it will pay the manufacturer for the therapy,\nand on what tier of its formulary it will be placed. The position on a third-party payor’s list of covered drugs, or formulary, generally determines the co-payment that a patient will need\nto make to obtain the therapy and can strongly influence the adoption of such therapy by patients and physicians. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and\nproviders prescribing such services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our drugs unless coverage\nis provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our drugs.\nA primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry, and elsewhere, is cost containment. Third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of\nreimbursement for particular medications. We cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement will be available for any drug that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available,\nwhat the level of reimbursement will be. Inadequate coverage and reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any drug for which we obtain marketing approval. If\ncoverage and adequate reimbursement are not available, or are available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our current and any future product\ncandidates that we develop, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and our overall financial condition. Further, coverage policies and third-party payor\nreimbursement rates may change at any time. Therefore, even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive marketing\napproval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.\nIf the market opportunities for any of our product candidates are smaller than we estimate, even assuming approval of a product candidate, our revenue may be adversely\naffected, and our business may suffer.\nThe precise incidence and prevalence for all the conditions we aim to address with our product candidates are unknown. Our projections of both the number of people who have these\ndiseases, as well as the subset of people with these diseases who have the potential to benefit from treatment with our product candidates, are based on our beliefs and estimates. These\nestimates have been derived from a variety of sources, including scientific literature, surveys of clinics, patient foundations or market research, and may prove to be incorrect. Further,\nnew information may change the estimated incidence or prevalence of these diseases. The total addressable market across all of our product candidates will ultimately depend upon,\namong other things, the diagnosis criteria included in the final label for each of our product candidates approved for sale for these indications, the availability of alternative treatments\nand the safety, convenience, cost and efficacy of our product candidates relative to such alternative treatments, acceptance by the medical community and patient access, drug pricing\nand reimbursement. The number of patients in the United States and other major markets and elsewhere may turn out to be lower than expected, patients may not be otherwise\namenable to treatment with our products or new patients may become increasingly difficult to identify or gain access to, all of which would adversely affect our results of operations\nand our business.\n34\nWe currently have no marketing and sales organization and have no experience as a company in commercializing products, and we may invest significant resources to develop\nthese capabilities. If we are unable to establish marketing and sales capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our products, we may not be able to\ngenerate product revenue.\nWe have no internal sales, marketing or distribution capabilities, nor have we as a company commercialized a product. If any of our product candidates ultimately receive marketing\napproval, we will be required to build a marketing and sales organization with technical expertise and supporting distribution capabilities to commercialize each such product in the\nmarkets that we target, which will be expensive and time consuming, or collaborate with third parties that have direct sales forces and established distribution systems, either to\naugment our own sales force and distribution systems or in lieu of our own sales force and distribution systems. We have no prior experience as a company in the marketing, sale and\ndistribution of biopharmaceutical products and there are significant risks and costs involved in building and managing a sales organization, including our ability to hire, retain and\nincentivize qualified individuals, generate sufficient sales leads, provide adequate training (e.g., about our products and compliance with applicable laws) to sales and marketing\npersonnel and effectively manage a geographically dispersed sales and marketing team. Any failure or delay in the development of our internal sales, marketing and distribution\ncapabilities or implementation of adequate controls and monitoring to ensure that our sales and marketing activities are in compliance with applicable laws would adversely impact the\ncommercialization of these products. We may not be able to enter into collaborations or hire consultants or external service providers to assist us in sales, marketing and distribution\nfunctions on acceptable financial terms, or at all. In addition, our product revenues and our profitability, if any, may be lower if we rely on third parties for these functions than if we\nwere to market, sell and distribute any products that we develop ourselves. We likely will have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary\nresources and attention to sell and market our products effectively or in compliance with applicable laws. If we are not successful in commercializing our products, either on our own\nor through arrangements with one or more third parties, we may not be able to generate any future product revenue and we would incur significant additional losses.\nOur future growth may depend, in part, on our ability to commercialize products in foreign markets, where we would be subject to additional regulatory burdens and other risks\nand uncertainties.\nOur future growth may depend, in part, on our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates in foreign markets. We are not permitted to market or promote any of our\nproduct candidates before we receive regulatory approval from applicable regulatory authorities in foreign markets, and we may never receive such regulatory approvals for any of our\nproduct candidates. To obtain separate regulatory approval in many other countries we must comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements regarding safety and efficacy\nand governing, among other things, clinical trials, commercial sales, pricing and distribution of our product candidates. If we obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates and\nultimately commercialize our products in foreign markets, we would be subject to additional risks and uncertainties, including:\n• different regulatory requirements for approval of drugs in foreign countries;\n• reduced protection for intellectual property rights;\n• the existence of additional third-party patent rights of potential relevance to our business;\n• unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;\n• economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n• compliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n• foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenues, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\n• foreign reimbursement, pricing and insurance regimes;\n• workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is common;\n• production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and\n• business interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters including earthquakes, typhoons, floods and fires.\n35\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Industry\nIf we are not able to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy.\nOur ability to compete in the highly competitive biotechnology and pharmaceuticals industries depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial, scientific and\nmedical personnel. Our success depends in large measure on our key personnel, including Mr. Punit Dhillon, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer, Ms. Kaitlyn Arsenault, our Chief\nFinancial Officer, Mr. Tuan Tu Diep, our Chief Development Officer and Dr. Christopher Twitty, our Chief Scientific Officer as well as other members of our senior management team.\nThe loss of the services of any of these individuals could significantly hinder our operations. We do not currently have \"key person\" insurance in effect for Mr. Dhillon, Ms. Arsenault,\nMr. Diep, Dr. Twitty or other members of our senior management team. In addition, the competition for qualified personnel in the pharmaceutical industry is intense and there can be\nno assurance that we will be able to continue to attract and retain all personnel necessary for the development and operation of our business. We also rely on, and have relied on in the\npast, consultants and advisors to assist us in formulating our strategy. Our consultants and advisors are either self-employed or employed by other organizations, and they may have\nconflicts of interest or other commitments, such as consulting or advisory contracts with other organizations, that may affect their ability to contribute to us.\nOur future performance will also depend, in part, on our ability to successfully integrate newly hired executive officers into our management team and our ability to develop an\neffective working relationship among senior management. Our failure to integrate these individuals and create effective working relationships among them and other members of\nmanagement could result in inefficiencies in the development and commercialization of our product candidates, harming future marketing approvals, sales of our product candidates\nand our results of operations.\nRecently enacted legislation, future legislation and healthcare reform measures may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval for and commercialize\nour product candidates and may affect the prices we may set.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system,\nincluding cost-containment measures that may reduce or limit coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates for\nwhich we obtain marketing approval. In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the U.S. federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs\nand improve the quality of healthcare.\nFor example, in March 2010, the ACA was enacted in the United States. Among the provisions of the ACA of importance to our potential product candidates, the ACA: established an\nannual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents; expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs;\nincreased the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; created a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program;\nestablished a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such\nresearch; and established a Center for Medicare Innovation at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower\nMedicare and Medicaid spending.\nSince its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most\nrecent judicial challenge to the ACA without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an executive order to\ninitiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive\norder also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining\nMedicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage\nthrough Medicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how any such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration, or any future presidential administration, will\nimpact the ACA or our business.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was signed into law, which,\namong other things, included reductions to Medicare payments to providers, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will\nremain in effect through 2032, unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among\nother things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to\nproviders from three to five years. In addition, on March 11, 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 was signed into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate\ncap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, or AMP, beginning January 1, 2024.\n36\nFurther, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States of pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs. Such scrutiny has\nresulted in several recent congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing,\nreview the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. On August 16, 2022, the\nInflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, was signed into law. Among other things, the IRA requires manufacturers of certain drugs to engage in price negotiations with Medicare\n(beginning in 2026), with prices that can be negotiated subject to a cap; imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation\n(first due in 2023); and replaces the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new discounting program (beginning in 2025). The IRA permits the Secretary of the Department of\nHealth and Human Services (HHS) to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. On June 30, 2023 the Centers for Medicare\nand Medicaid Services, or CMS, issued new guidance detailing the requirements and parameters of the first round of price negotiations, to take place during 2023 and 2024, for\nproducts subject to the “maximum fair price” provision that would become effective in 2026. On August 29, 2023, HHS announced the list of the first ten drugs that will be subject to\nprice negotiations, although the Medicare drug price negotiation program is currently subject to legal challenges. CMS and HHS will continue to issue and update guidance as these\nprograms are implemented. For that and other reasons, it is currently unclear how the IRA will be effectuated.\nAt the state level, individual states in the United States are also increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and\nbiological product pricing, including prescription drug affordability boards, price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing\ncost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Legally mandated price controls on\npayment amounts by third-party payors or other restrictions could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. In addition, regional healthcare\nauthorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription\ndrug and other healthcare programs. This could reduce the ultimate demand for our product candidates, if approved, or put pressure on our product pricing, which could negatively\naffect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe expect that these new laws and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding,\nmore rigorous coverage criteria, new payment methodologies and additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in\nreimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or\nother healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our product candidates, if approved, which could have a material\nadverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf product liability or state consumer protection act lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our\nproducts.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability as a result of the clinical trials of our product candidates and will face an even greater risk if we commercialize our product candidates. For\nexample, we may be sued if our product candidates allegedly cause injury or are found to be otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such\nproduct liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product candidate, negligence, strict liability\nand a breach of warranties. Claims may be brought against us by clinical trial participants, patients or others using, administering or selling products that may be approved in the\nfuture, and could be asserted as product liability claims or under state consumer protection acts.\nIf we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit or cease the commercialization of our products.\nEven a successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n• decreased demand for our products;\n• injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n• withdrawal of clinical trial participants and potential termination of clinical trial sites or entire clinical programs;\n• costs to defend the related litigation;\n• a diversion of management’s time and our resources;\n• substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n• product recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n37\n• initiation of investigations and enforcement actions by regulators;\n• significant negative financial impact;\n• the inability to commercialize our product candidates; and\n• a decline in our stock price.\nWe currently hold $3,000,000 in product liability insurance coverage in the aggregate. We may need to increase our insurance coverage as we expand our clinical trials or if we\ncommence commercialization of our product candidates. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. Our inability to obtain and retain sufficient product liability insurance at an\nacceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of our product candidates. Although we maintain such insurance, any\nclaim that may be brought against us could result in a court judgment or settlement in an amount that is not covered, in whole or in part, by our insurance or that is in excess of the\nlimits of our insurance coverage. Our insurance policies will also have various exclusions, and we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no coverage. We may\nhave to pay any amounts awarded by a court or negotiated in a settlement that exceed our coverage limitations or that are not covered by our insurance, and we may not have, or be\nable to obtain, sufficient capital to pay such amounts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, and health information privacy and security laws. If we are\nunable to comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face substantial penalties.\nIf we obtain FDA approval for any of our product candidates and begin commercializing those products in the United States, our operations may be directly, or indirectly through our\ncustomers, subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, and physician\nsunshine laws and regulations. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing, and education programs. In addition, we may be subject to privacy and\nsecurity obligations, including federal and state laws, regulations, guidance, and industry standards related to data privacy, security, and protection. The laws that may affect our ability\nto operate include:\n• the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly\nor indirectly, to induce, or in return for, the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a government healthcare program, such as the Medicare and\nMedicaid programs;\n• federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing\nto be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third party payors that are false or fraudulent;\n• HIPAA, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of PHI;\n• the federal physician sunshine requirements under the ACA, which require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report annually to the U.S.\nDepartment of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers, and teaching hospitals, and\nownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members; and\n• state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating\ncompliance efforts.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities, or those of our third-\nparty collaborators or service providers, could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. In addition, recent health care reform legislation has strengthened these laws. If\nour operations, or those of our third-party collaborators or service providers, are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that\napply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in government health care programs, such as Medicare\nand Medicaid, imprisonment, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of\noperations.\n38\nOur business and operations would be adversely affected in the event that our computer systems or those of our partners, contract research organizations, contractors, consultants\nor other third parties we work with were to suffer system failures, cyber-attacks, loss of data or other security incidents.\nDespite our efforts to implement security measures on our computer systems, as well as those of our partners, contract research organizations, contractors, consultants, law and\naccounting firms and other third parties we work with, may sustain damage from security vulnerabilities, unauthorized access, data breaches, phishing attacks, ransomware attacks,\ndenial-of-service attacks, cybercriminals, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. We rely on our partners and third-party providers to\nimplement effective security measures and identify and correct for any such failures, deficiencies or breaches. The risks of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-\nattacks or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, nation state actors and cyber-terrorists, have increased significantly and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect. If a\ncybersecurity-related incident or security breach were to occur, it may cause interruptions in our operations, or the operations of our partners or third-party providers, it could result in\na the misuse of sensitive information, including personal data (including health data), our intellectual property or financial information, trade secrets, or clinical trial participant\npersonal data, a material disruption or delay in our drug development programs, and/or significant monetary losses. For example, during the second quarter of 2022, we were indirectly\nimpacted by a cyberattack on our Phase 1 clinical supply contract manufacturer which delayed our production timeline and the initiation of enrollment in our Phase 1 clinical studies\nfor SBI-100 OE to the fourth quarter of 2022. Unauthorized access, compromise, damage to, or loss of preclinical or clinical trial data from completed, ongoing or planned trials, or\nchemistry, manufacturing and controls data for our product candidates, could result in delays in regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce\nthe data. Any such breach, loss or compromise of clinical trial participant personal data may also subject us to civil fines and penalties under the privacy laws of the European Union or\nother countries as well as state and federal privacy laws in the United States. We maintain cyber liability insurance; however, this insurance may only partly cover the financial, legal,\nbusiness or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our systems or the systems of our service providers.\nActual or perceived failures to comply with applicable data protection, privacy and security laws, regulations, standards and other requirements could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nPrivacy and data security have become a significant area of focus in the U.S., and in many other jurisdictions where we may in the future conduct our operations. The legislative and\nregulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues, which may affect our business\nand may increase our compliance costs and exposure to liability. As we receive, collect, process, use and store personal and confidential data, we are or may be subject to multiple laws\nand regulations relating to data privacy and security. Compliance with these privacy and data security requirements is rigorous and time-intensive and may increase our cost of doing\nbusiness, and despite those efforts, there is a risk that we may be subject to fines and penalties, litigation and reputational harm, which could materially and adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and operations.\nIn the U.S., we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA imposes, among other\nthings, requirements relating to the privacy, security, transmission and breach reporting of PHI held by covered entities and their business associates. We may obtain health information\nfrom third parties (including research institutions from which we obtain clinical trial data) that are subject to privacy and security requirements under HIPAA. Depending on the facts\nand circumstances, we could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly receive individually identifiable health information from a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not\nauthorized or permitted by HIPAA.\n39\nIn addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health-related and other personal information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant\nways and may not have the same requirements, thus complicating compliance efforts. Several states, including California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah and Virginia, have adopted\ngenerally applicable and comprehensive privacy laws, although most have an exception for information regulated by HIPAA. These aws provide a number of individual privacy rights\nand impose corresponding obligations on organizations doing business in these states. By way of example, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”),\neffective January 1, 2020 and amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, effective January 1, 2023, which imposes obligations on covered businesses to provide specific\ndisclosures related to a business’s collecting, using, and disclosing personal data and to respond to certain requests from California residents related to their personal data. The CCPA\nprovides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that has increased the likelihood of, and risks associated with, data breach litigation. The\nCCPA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. It also created a new California data protection agency, the California Privacy Protection Agency, which is authorized\nto issue substantive regulations and could result in increased privacy and information security enforcement and additional compliance investment and potential business process\nchanges may be required Similar laws have passed in Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Indiana, Iowa, Montana, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Virginia and have been\nproposed in other states and at the federal level, reflecting a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States. Further states have also enacted consumer health data\nprivacy laws, including states without comprehensive consumer privacy laws, such as Nevada and Washington state. Such laws could have different requirements that would make\ncompliance challenging. In the event that we are subject to HIPAA, the CCPA, the CPRA or other privacy and data protection laws, any liability from failure to comply with the\nrequirements of these laws could adversely affect our financial condition as a result of fines, penalties, litigation or other liabilities.\nOur employees, principal investigators, consultants and commercial partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory\nstandards and requirements and insider trading.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our employees, principal investigators, consultants and commercial partners. Misconduct by these parties could include\nintentional failures to comply with FDA regulations or the regulations applicable in other jurisdictions, provide accurate information to the FDA and applicable foreign authorities,\ncomply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws, and regulations in the United States and abroad, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us\nor comply with other applicable law. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to\nprevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and\npromotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Such misconduct also could involve the improper use of information obtained in the\ncourse of clinical trials or interactions with the FDA or applicable foreign authorities, which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation. It is not\nalways possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged\nrisks or losses or in protecting us from government investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are\ninstituted against us and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of\noperations and prospects, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\n40\nThe Company is currently subject to lawsuits, and in the future may be subject to additional lawsuits, that could divert its resources and result in the payment of significant\ndamages and other remedies.\nFrom time to time, the Company may be subject to litigation claims through the ordinary course of its business operations or otherwise, regarding, among other things, intellectual\nproperty rights matters, employment matters and tax matters. Litigation to defend the Company against claims by third parties, or to enforce any rights that the Company may have\nagainst third parties, may be necessary, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of the Company's resources, causing a material adverse effect on its business, financial\ncondition and results of operations. Given the nature of the Company's business, it is, and may from time to time in the future be, party to various, and at times numerous, legal,\nadministrative and regulatory inquiries, investigations, proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, as well as potential class action lawsuits. Because the\noutcome of such legal matters is inherently uncertain, if one or more of such legal matters were to be resolved against the Company for amounts in excess of management's\nexpectations or any applicable insurance coverage or indemnification right, the Company's results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Any\nlitigation to which the Company is a party may result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal, or in payments of substantial monetary damages or\nfines, the posting of bonds requiring significant collateral, letters of credit or similar instruments, or the Company may decide to settle lawsuits on similarly unfavorable terms.\nMoreover, the Company cannot be sure that the remedies available to it at law or under contract, will be sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully or partially offset any such\npossible liabilities. Any of these factors, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, cash flows or liquidity.\nFor a description of certain currently pending legal and regulatory proceedings, including the Cunning Lawsuit, see Note 13 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of\nthe Company included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe increasing use of social media platforms presents new risks and challenges.\nSocial media is increasingly being used to communicate about our product candidates, technologies and programs, and the diseases our product candidates are designed to treat. Social\nmedia practices in the biopharmaceutical industry continue to evolve and regulations relating to such use are not always clear. This evolution creates uncertainty and risk of\nnoncompliance with regulations applicable to our business. For example, patients may use social media channels to comment on the effectiveness of a product candidate or to report an\nalleged adverse event. When such disclosures occur, there is a risk that we fail to monitor and comply with applicable adverse event reporting obligations or we may not be able to\ndefend ourselves or the public’s legitimate interests in the face of the political and market pressures generated by social media due to restrictions on what we may say about our\nproduct candidates. There is also a risk of inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information or negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us on any social networking website. If\nany of these events were to occur or we otherwise fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could incur liability, face overly restrictive regulatory actions or incur other harm to\nour business.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property and our proprietary technologies.\nOur commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection and trade secret protection for our product candidates, proprietary technologies and\ntheir uses as well as our ability to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. We generally seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in\nthe United States and abroad related to our product candidates, proprietary technologies and their uses that are important to our business. We also seek to protect our proprietary\nposition by acquiring or in-licensing relevant issued patents or pending applications, or other intellectual property rights, from third parties.\nPending patent applications cannot be enforced against third parties practicing the technology claimed in such applications unless, and until, patents issue from such applications, and\nthen only to the extent the issued claims cover the technology and/or its use. There can be no assurance that any of our future patent applications or the patent applications of our\nlicensors will result in additional patents being issued or that issued patents will afford sufficient protection against competitors with similar technology, nor can there be any assurance\nthat the patents issued will not be infringed, designed around or invalidated by third parties.\nEven issued patents may later be found invalid or unenforceable or may be modified or revoked in proceedings instituted by third parties before various patent offices or in courts. The\ndegree of future protection for our and our licensors proprietary rights is uncertain. Only limited protection may be available and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to\ngain or keep any competitive advantage. These uncertainties and/or limitations in our ability to properly protect the intellectual property rights relating to our product candidates could\nhave a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n41\nThe patent application process is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that we or any of our potential future collaborators will be successful in\nprotecting our product candidates by obtaining and defending patents.\nThe patent prosecution process is also expensive and time-consuming, and we and our licensors, such as UM, may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent\napplications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner or in all jurisdictions where protection may be commercially advantageous. It is also possible that we or our licensors will fail to\nidentify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection.\nIn addition, although we enter into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to patentable aspects of our research and development output, such as\nour employees, outside scientific collaborators, contract research organizations, third-party manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties, any of these parties may breach\nsuch agreements and disclose such output before a patent application is filed, thereby jeopardizing our ability to seek patent protection.\nGiven the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly\nafter such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our intellectual property may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or\nidentical to ours.\nIn some circumstances, we may not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents, covering technology or products\nthat we license from third parties. Therefore, we cannot be certain that these patents and applications will be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of\nour business. In addition, if third parties who license patents to us fail to maintain such patents, or lose rights to those patents, the rights we have licensed may be reduced or\neliminated.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful. Further, our issued patents could be found invalid\nor unenforceable if challenged in court.\nCompetitors may infringe our intellectual property rights. To prevent infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and\ntime-consuming. In addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent we own is not valid, is unenforceable and/or is not infringed. If we or any of our\npotential future collaborators were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent directed at one of our product candidates, the defendant could counterclaim that\nour patent is invalid and/or unenforceable in whole or in part. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are\ncommonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge include an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including but not limited to lack of novelty, obviousness,\nwritten description or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could include an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant\ninformation from the USPTO or made a misleading statement during prosecution.\nThird parties may also raise similar invalidity claims before the USPTO or patent offices abroad, even outside the context of litigation. Such mechanisms include re-examination, PGR,\nIPR, derivation proceedings, and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions (e.g., opposition proceedings). Such proceedings could result in the revocation of, cancellation of or\namendment to our patents in such a way that they no longer cover our technology or platform, or any product candidates that we may develop. The outcome following legal assertions\nof invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the\npatent examiner were unaware during prosecution. There is also no assurance that there is not prior art of which we are aware, but which we do not believe affects the validity or\nenforceability of a claim in our patents and patent applications, which may, nonetheless, ultimately be found to affect the validity or enforceability of a patent claim. If a third party\nwere to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on our product candidates or other intellectual\nproperty that we may develop. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from\ncollaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates. Such a loss of patent protection would have a material adverse impact on our business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n42\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to our intellectual property rights may cause us to incur significant expenses and could distract our technical\nand management personnel from their normal responsibilities. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation\nor other legal proceedings relating to our intellectual property rights, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of\nlitigation or other proceedings. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities\nanalysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could\nsubstantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have\nsufficient financial or other resources to conduct such litigation or proceedings adequately. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings\nmore effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could\ncompromise our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations and may not adequately protect our\nbusiness or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. For example:\n• others may be able to develop products that are similar to our product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own;\n• we might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patents or patent application that we own;\n• we might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions;\n• others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights;\n• it is possible that our pending patent applications will not lead to issued patents;\n• issued patents that we own may be held invalid or unenforceable, as a result of legal challenges by our competitors;\n• our competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities\nto develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets;\n• we may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable; and\n• the patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nShould any of these events occur, it could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nOur commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. Claims by third parties that we\ninfringe their proprietary rights may result in liability for damages or prevent or delay our developmental and commercialization efforts.\nOur commercial success depends in part on avoiding infringement of the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. However, our research, development and commercialization\nactivities may be subject to claims that we infringe or otherwise violate patents or other intellectual property rights owned or controlled by third parties. Other entities may have or\nobtain patents or proprietary rights that could limit our ability to make, use, sell, offer for sale or import our product candidates and products that may be approved in the future, or\nimpair our competitive position. There is a substantial amount of litigation, both within and outside the United States, involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the\nbiopharmaceutical industry, including patent infringement lawsuits, oppositions, reexaminations, IPR proceedings and PGR proceedings before the USPTO and/or corresponding\nforeign patent offices. Numerous third-party U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications exist in the fields in which we are developing product candidates. There\nmay be third-party patents or patent applications with claims to materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our\nproduct candidates.\n43\nAs the biopharmaceutical industry expands and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our product candidates may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent rights of\nthird parties. Because patent applications are maintained as confidential for a certain period of time, until the relevant application is published, we may be unaware of third-party\npatents that may be infringed by commercialization of any of our product candidates, and we cannot be certain that we were the first to file a patent application related to a product\ncandidate or technology. Moreover, because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending patent applications that may later result in issued patents\nthat our product candidates may infringe. In addition, identification of third-party patent rights that may be relevant to our technology is difficult because patent searching is imperfect\ndue to differences in terminology among patents, incomplete databases and the difficulty in assessing the meaning of patent claims. There is also no assurance that there is not prior art\nof which we are aware, but which we do not believe is relevant to our business, which may, nonetheless, ultimately be found to limit our ability to make, use, sell, offer for sale or\nimport our products that may be approved in the future, or impair our competitive position. In addition, third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our\ntechnologies infringes upon these patents. Any claims of patent infringement asserted by third parties would be time consuming and could:\n• result in costly litigation that may cause negative publicity;\n• divert the time and attention of our technical personnel and management;\n• cause development delays;\n• prevent us from commercializing any of our product candidates until the asserted patent expires or is held finally invalid or not infringed in a court of law;\n• require us to develop non-infringing technology, which may not be possible on a cost-effective basis;\n• subject us to significant liability to third parties; or\n• require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or which might be non-exclusive, which\ncould result in our competitors gaining access to the same technology.\nAlthough no third party has asserted a claim of patent infringement against us as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, others may hold proprietary rights that could prevent\nour product candidates from being marketed once approved. Any patent-related legal action against us claiming damages and seeking to enjoin commercial activities relating to our\nproducts or processes could subject us to potential liability for damages, including treble damages if we were determined to willfully infringe, and require us to obtain a license to\nmanufacture or market our product candidates. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of\nemployee resources from our business. We cannot predict whether we would prevail in any such actions or that any license required under any of these patents would be made\navailable on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. Moreover, even if we or our future strategic partners were able to obtain a license, the rights may be nonexclusive, which could\nresult in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property. In addition, we cannot be certain that we could redesign our product candidates or processes to avoid\ninfringement, if necessary. Accordingly, an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding, or the failure to obtain necessary licenses, could delay or prevent us from\ndeveloping and commercializing our product candidates, which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, intellectual property litigation,\nregardless of its outcome, may cause negative publicity and could prohibit us from marketing or otherwise commercializing our product candidates and technology.\nParties making claims against us may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation or administrative proceedings, there is a risk that some of our\nconfidential information could be compromised by disclosure. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have material adverse\neffect on our ability to raise additional funds or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nIntellectual property litigation may lead to unfavorable publicity that harms our reputation and causes the market price of our common shares to decline.\nDuring the course of any intellectual property litigation, there could be public announcements of the initiation of the litigation as well as results of hearings, rulings on motions, and\nother interim proceedings in the litigation. If securities analysts or investors regard these announcements as negative, the perceived value of our existing products, programs or\nintellectual property could be diminished. Accordingly, the market price of shares of our common stock may decline. Such announcements could also harm our reputation or the\nmarket for our future products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n44\nDerivation proceedings may be necessary to determine priority of inventions, and an unfavorable outcome may require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to\nlicense rights from the prevailing party.\nDerivation proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by us or declared by the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or\npatent applications. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be\nharmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Our defense of derivation proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in\nsubstantial costs and distract our management and other employees. In addition, the uncertainties associated with such proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability\nto raise the funds necessary to continue our clinical trials, continue our research programs, license necessary technology from third parties or enter into development or manufacturing\npartnerships that would help us bring our product candidates to market.\nChanges in U.S. patent law, or laws in other countries or jurisdictions, could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our product\ncandidates.\nAs is the case with other pharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the\npharmaceutical industry involve a high degree of technological and legal complexity. Therefore, obtaining and enforcing pharmaceutical patents is costly, time consuming and\ninherently uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or in the interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual\nproperty and may increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of patent applications and the enforcement or defense of issued patents. We cannot predict the\nbreadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents or in third-party patents. In addition, Congress or other foreign legislative bodies may pass patent reform legislation\nthat is unfavorable to us.\nFor example, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening\nthe rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created\nuncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the U.S. federal courts, the USPTO, or similar authorities in foreign\njurisdictions, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and\npatents we might obtain in the future.\nWe may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our patents and other intellectual property.\nWe may also be subject to claims that former employees or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents or other intellectual property. Litigation may be necessary to\ndefend against these and other claims challenging inventorship or ownership. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable\nintellectual property rights. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in\nsubstantial costs and distraction to management and other employees.\nPatent terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our product candidates for an adequate amount of time.\nPatents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, if all maintenance fees are timely paid, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years from its earliest U.S. non-\nprovisional filing date. Various extensions may be available, but the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Even if patents covering our product candidates are\nobtained, once the patent life has expired, we may be open to competition from competitive products. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory\nreview of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our patent portfolio may not\nprovide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\n45\nIf we do not obtain patent term extension for our product candidates, our business may be materially harmed.\nDepending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA marketing approval of our product candidates, one or more of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term\nrestoration under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent\nrestoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. A maximum of one patent may be\nextended per FDA approved product as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a\npatent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only those claims covering such approved drug product, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it\nmay be extended. Patent term extension may also be available in certain foreign countries upon regulatory approval of our product candidates. However, we may not be granted an\nextension because of, for example, failing to apply within applicable deadlines, failing to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable\nrequirements. Moreover, the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded could be less than we request. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension or\nrestoration or the term of any such extension is less than we request, our competitors may obtain approval of competing products following our patent expiration, and our revenue\ncould be reduced, possibly materially. Further, if this occurs, our competitors may take advantage of our investment in development and trials by referencing our clinical and\npreclinical data and launch their product earlier than might otherwise be the case.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nPatents are of national or regional effect. Filing, prosecuting and defending patents in all countries throughout the world could be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property\nrights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual\nproperty rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all\ncountries outside the United States or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our\ntechnologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we\nhave patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our product candidates, and our patents or other intellectual\nproperty rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of many foreign countries\ndo not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of\ncompeting products in violation of our proprietary rights. As an example, as of June 2023, European patent applications have the option, upon grant of a patent, of becoming a Unitary\nPatent which will be subject to the jurisdiction of the Unitary Patent Court, or UPC. Patents granted before the implementation of the UPC will have the option of opting out of the\njurisdiction of the UPC and remaining as national patents in the UPC countries. Patents that remain under the jurisdiction of the UPC may be potentially vulnerable to a single UPC-\nbased revocation challenge that, if successful, could invalidate the patent in all countries who ratified the Unitary Patent Court Agreement. The option of a Unitary Patent will be a\nsignificant change in European patent practice. As the UPC is a new court system, there is no precedent for the court, increasing the uncertainty. Proceedings to enforce our patent\nrights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or\ninterpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate,\nand the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be\ninadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nMany countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of\npatents against government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of such\npatent. If we are forced to grant a license to third parties with respect to any patents relevant to our business, our competitive position may be impaired, and our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected.\nFurther, the standards applied by the USPTO and foreign patent offices in granting patents are not always applied uniformly or predictably. As such, we do not know the degree of\nfuture protection that we will have on our product candidates, proprietary technologies, and their uses. While we will endeavor to try to protect our product candidates, proprietary\ntechnologies, and their uses, with intellectual property rights such as patents, as appropriate, the process of obtaining patents is time consuming, expensive, and unpredictable.\n46\nFurther, geo-political actions in the United States and in foreign countries could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution or maintenance of our patent\napplications or those of any current or future licensors and the maintenance, enforcement or defense of our issued patents or those of any current or future licensors. Accordingly, our\ncompetitive position may be impaired, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, documentary, fee payment and other requirements imposed by regulations and\ngovernmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and/or applications will be due to the USPTO and various foreign patent offices\nat various points over the lifetime of our patents and/or applications. We have systems in place to remind us to pay these fees, and we rely on our outside patent annuity service to pay\nthese fees when due. Additionally, the USPTO and various foreign patent offices, require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar\nprovisions during the patent application process. We employ reputable law firms and other professionals to help us comply, and in many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by\npayment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with rules applicable to the particular jurisdiction. However, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in\nabandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. If such an event were to occur, it could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition, we rely on the protection of our trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information to maintain our competitive position.\nAlthough we have taken steps to protect our trade secrets and unpatented know-how, including entering into confidentiality agreements with third parties, and confidential information\nand inventions agreements with employees, consultants and advisors, we cannot provide any assurances that all such agreements have been duly executed, and any of these parties may\nbreach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim\nthat a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and\noutside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets.\nMoreover, third parties may still obtain this information or may come upon this or similar information independently, and we would have no right to prevent them from using that\ntechnology or information to compete with us. If any of these events occurs or if we otherwise lose protection for our trade secrets, the value of this information may be greatly\nreduced, and our competitive position would be harmed. If we do not apply for patent protection prior to such publication or if we cannot otherwise maintain the confidentiality of our\nproprietary technology and other confidential information, then our ability to obtain patent protection or to protect our trade secret information may be jeopardized.\nWe may be subject to claims that we have wrongfully hired an employee from a competitor or that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged confidential\ninformation or trade secrets of their former employers.\nAs is common in the pharmaceutical industry, in addition to our employees, we engage the services of consultants to assist us in the development of our product candidates. Many of\nthese consultants, and many of our employees, were previously employed at, or may have previously provided or may be currently providing consulting services to, other\npharmaceutical companies including our competitors or potential competitors. We may become subject to claims that we, our employees or a consultant inadvertently or otherwise\nused or disclosed trade secrets or other information proprietary to their former employers or their former or current clients. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims.\nIf we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel, which could adversely affect our\nbusiness. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to our management team and other employees.\nUM is the owner of intellectual property underlying SBI-100 OE\nIntellectual property rights (including any patents, non-manufacturing related know-how and improvements) for SBI-100 is owned by UM, and in the future we may need to seek\nUM’s consent to pursue, use, sub-license and/or enforce some of these intellectual property rights which we are entitled to use pursuant to the UM 5050 license agreement. An\nunexpected deterioration in our relationship with UM may have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n47\nBreach of the License Agreement with UM could result in the loss of such license rights that are important to our business and our operations could be materially harmed.\nWe license from UM the use, development and commercialization rights for SBI-100. As a result, our current business plans are dependent upon our maintenance of the UM 5050\nlicense agreement and the rights we license under them. If we breach the terms of our License Agreement with UM, or any future license agreement on which our business or product\ncandidates are dependent, UM or other licensors may have the right to terminate the applicable agreement in whole or in part and thereby limit or terminate our rights to the licensed\ntechnology and intellectual property and/or any rights we have acquired to develop and commercialize certain product candidates or cause us to have to negotiate new or reinstated\nlicenses on less favorable terms, or enable a competitor to gain access to the licensed technology. Moreover, disputes may arise regarding intellectual property subject to a license\nagreement such as our license agreements with UM, including: (i) the scope of the rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation related issues, (ii) the extent to\nwhich our product candidates, technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the licensing agreement, (iii) our diligence obligations\nunder the license agreement and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations. The loss of the rights licensed to us under our License Agreements with UM, or any future license\nagreement that we may enter granting rights on which our business or product candidates are dependent, would harm, or even eliminate, our ability to further develop the applicable\nproduct candidates and would materially harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Controlled Substances\nOur product candidate, SBI-100 OE, will be subject to U.S. controlled substance laws and regulations, and failure to comply with or the cost of compliance with these laws and\nregulations, may adversely affect the results of our business operations, and our financial condition.\nOur product candidate, SBI-100 OE, contains a controlled substance as defined in the CSA. Controlled substances that are pharmaceutical products are subject to a high degree of\nregulation under the CSA, which establishes, among other things, certain registration, manufacturing quotas, security, recordkeeping, reporting, import, export and other requirements\nadministered by the DEA. The DEA classifies controlled substances into five schedules: Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have a high\npotential for abuse, no currently “accepted medical use” in the United States, lack accepted safety for use under medical supervision, and may not be prescribed, marketed or sold in\nthe United States. Pharmaceutical products approved for use in the United States may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V. Schedule I and II drugs are subject to the strictest controls\nunder the CSA, including manufacturing and procurement quotas, security requirements and criteria for importation. In addition, dispensing of Schedule II drugs is further restricted.\nWhile certain cannabinoids may be classified as Schedule I controlled substances, products approved for medical use in the United States that contain certain cannabinoids must be\nplaced on Schedules II-V, since approval by the FDA satisfies the “accepted medical use” requirement. SBI-100 remains a Schedule I controlled substance, pending a request to re-\nschedule SBI-100 after marketing authorization by the FDA.\nIf approved by the FDA, we expect the finished dosage forms of SBI-100 OE to be reevaluated by the DEA and no longer listed as a Schedule I drug. Consequently, SBI-100's\nmanufacture, importation, exportation, domestic distribution, storage, sale and legitimate use may be subject to a significant degree of regulation by the DEA, if the finished dosage\nform is determined to be a Schedule II drug. In addition, the scheduling process may take one or more years, thereby delaying the launch of the drug product in the United States.\nFurthermore, if the FDA, DEA, or any foreign regulatory authority determines that any of our drug product candidates may have potential for abuse, it may require us to generate more\nclinical or other data than we currently anticipate establishing whether or to what extent the substance has an abuse potential, which could increase the cost and/or delay the launch of\nthe drug product.\n48\nFacilities conducting research, manufacturing, distributing, importing or exporting, or dispensing controlled substances must be registered (licensed) to perform these activities and\nhave the security, control, recordkeeping, reporting and inventory mechanisms required by the DEA to prevent drug loss and diversion. All these facilities must renew their\nregistrations annually, except dispensing facilities, which must renew every three years. The DEA conducts periodic inspections of certain registered establishments that handle\ncontrolled substances. Obtaining the necessary registrations may result in delay of the manufacturing, development, or distribution of our product candidates. Furthermore, failure to\nmaintain compliance with the CSA, particularly non-compliance resulting in loss or diversion, can result in regulatory action that could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate proceedings to restrict, suspend or revoke those\nregistrations. In certain circumstances, violations could lead to criminal proceedings. Individual states may also establish controlled substance laws and regulations that may require\nadditional regulatory approvals to conduct research and clinical trials in that state. As a result, we or our partners or clinical sites may also be required to obtain separate state\nregistrations, permits or licenses in order to be able to receive, handle, and distribute controlled substances for clinical trials. Delay in obtaining these state registrations, permits or\nlicenses may delay the start of our clinical trials for such products, including SBI-100 OE. While some states automatically schedule a drug based on federal action, other states\nschedule drugs through rule making or a legislative action. State scheduling may delay commercial sale of any product for which we obtain federal regulatory approval and adverse\nscheduling could have a material adverse effect on the commercial attractiveness of such product. We or our partners or clinical sites must also obtain separate state registrations,\npermits or licenses to be able to obtain, handle, and distribute controlled substances for clinical trials or commercial sale, and failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements could\nlead to enforcement and sanctions by the states in addition to those from the DEA or otherwise arising under federal law.\nTo conduct clinical trials with SBI-100 OE in the United States, prior to approval, each of our research sites must obtain and maintain a DEA researcher registration that will allow\nthose sites to handle and dispense the product candidate and to obtain the product. If the DEA delays or denies the grant of a research registration to one or more research sites, the\nclinical trial could be significantly delayed, and we could lose clinical trial sites.\nManufacturing of SBI-100 OE is, and, if approved, will be, subject to the DEA’s annual manufacturing and procurement quota requirements, if classified as Schedule II. The annual\nquota allocated to us or our contract manufacturers for the controlled substances in our product candidates may not be sufficient to meet commercial demand or complete clinical trials.\nConsequently, any delay or refusal by the DEA in establishing our, or our contract manufacturers’, procurement and/or production quota for controlled substances could delay or stop\nour clinical trials or product launches, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and operations.\nIf, upon approval of SBI-100 OE, the product is scheduled as Schedule II or III, we would also need to identify wholesale distributors with the appropriate DEA registrations and\nauthority to distribute the product to pharmacies and other health care providers. The failure to obtain, or delay in obtaining, or the loss of any of those registrations could result in\nincreased costs to us. Furthermore, state and federal enforcement actions, regulatory requirements, and legislation intended to reduce prescription drug abuse, such as the requirement\nthat physicians consult a state prescription drug monitoring program may make physicians less willing to prescribe, and pharmacies to dispense, our products, if approved.\nResearch restrictions, product shipment delays or prohibitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nResearch on and the shipment, import and export of SBI-100 OE and the API used in SBI-100 OE will require research permits, import and export licenses by many different\nauthorities. For instance, in the United States, the FDA, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and the DEA; in Canada, the Canada Border Services Agency, and Health Canada; in\nEurope, the European Medicines Agency and the European Commission; in Australia and New Zealand, the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service, the Therapeutic Goods\nAdministration, the New Zealand Medicines and Medical Device Safety Authority and the New Zealand Customs Service; and in other countries, similar regulatory authorities,\nregulate the research on and import and export of pharmaceutical products that contain controlled substances, such as SBI-100 OE. Specifically, the import and export process requires\nthe issuance of import and export licenses by the relevant controlled substance authority in both the importing and exporting country. We may not be granted, or if granted, maintain,\nsuch licenses from the authorities in certain countries. Even if we obtain the relevant licenses, shipments of API and our product candidates may be held up in transit, which could\ncause significant delays and may lead to product batches being stored outside required temperature ranges. Inappropriate storage may damage the product shipment resulting in delays\nin clinical trials. Once shipment is complete, we or the research contractors we are working with may also suffer further delays or restrictions as a result of regulations governing\nresearch on controlled substances. A delay in a clinical trial or, upon commercialization, a partial or total loss of revenue from one or more shipments of API or our product candidates\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The aforementioned examples and lists of various authorities that may currently, or\nin the future, affect our ability to conduct research on or import or export our product candidates and/or API, should not be construed as exhaustive or comprehensive in any way.\n49\nLaws and regulations affecting therapeutic uses of cannabinoids are constantly evolving.\nThe constant evolution of laws and regulations affecting the research and development of cannabinoid-based pharmaceutical products and treatments could detrimentally affect our\nbusiness. Laws and regulations related to the therapeutic uses of cannabinoids are subject to changing interpretations. These changes may require us to incur substantial costs\nassociated with legal and compliance fees and ultimately require us to alter our business plan. Furthermore, violations or alleged violation of these laws could disrupt our business and\nresult in a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, we cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications of laws and regulations and\nit is possible that new laws and regulations may be enacted in the future that will be directly applicable to our business.\nSBI-100 OE and our potential future product candidates may contain controlled substances, the use of which may generate public controversy\nSince SBI-100 OE and our potential product candidates may contain controlled substances, their regulatory approval may generate public controversy or scrutiny. Political and social\npressures and adverse publicity could lead to delays in approval of, and increased expenses for, our product candidates. These pressures could also limit or restrict the introduction and\nmarketing of our product candidates. Adverse publicity from misuse or adverse side effects cannabinoid derivatives may adversely affect the commercial success or market penetration\nachievable by our product candidates. The nature of our business will likely attract a high-level of public and media interest, and in the event of any resultant adverse publicity, our\nreputation may be harmed.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe trading price of our common stock has been volatile with substantial price fluctuations on heavy volume, which could result in substantial losses for purchasers of our\ncommon stock and existing stockholders.\nOur stock price has been and, in the future, may be subject to substantial volatility. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 through March 20, 2024, the price per share of our\ncommon stock has ranged as low as $1.44 and as high as $18.00.\nFurthermore, the stock market in general and the market for biopharmaceutical companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the\noperating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, investors may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the price paid for the shares. The market\nprice for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n• announcements relating to development, regulatory approvals or commercialization of our product candidates or those of competitors;\n• results of clinical trials of our product candidates or those of our competitors;\n• announcements by us or our competitors of significant strategic partnerships or collaborations or terminations of such arrangements;\n• actual or anticipated variations in our operating results and whether we have achieved key business targets;\n• sales of our common stock, including sales by our directors and officers or specific stockholders;\n• changes in, or our failure to meet, financial estimates by us or by any securities analysts who might cover our stock;\n• changes in securities analysts’ buy and/or sell recommendations;\n• general economic, political, or stock market conditions;\n• conditions or trends in our industry;\n• changes in laws or other regulatory actions affecting us or our industry;\n• stock market price and volume fluctuations of comparable companies and, in particular, those that operate in the biopharmaceutical industry;\n• announcements of investigations or regulatory scrutiny of our operations or lawsuits filed against us;\n• capital commitments;\n• investors’ general perception of our company, our business, and our prospects;\n• disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights; and\n• recruitment or departure of key personnel.\n50\nIn the past, stockholders have initiated class action lawsuits against pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of these\ncompanies’ stock. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert management’s attention and resources from our business.\nWe effected the Reverse Stock Split on September 8, 2023 and the liquidity of our common stock may be continue to be adversely effected.\nOn September 6, 2023, we filed a Certificate of Change and Certificate of Correction with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada, which effected a reverse stock split (the\n“Reverse Split”), at a ratio of one-for-250, of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Common Stock”). The Reverse Split\nbecame effective on September 8, 2023. The liquidity of the shares of our common stock may continue to be affected adversely by the Reverse Stock Split given the reduced number\nof shares of our common stock that are outstanding following the Reverse Stock Split, particularly if the market price of our common stock does not increase from its recent decline\npartly as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. Following the Reverse Stock Split, the market price of our common stock may not attract new investors and may not satisfy the investing\nrequirements of those investors. There can be no assurance that our share prices will attract new investors, including institutional investors. In addition, there can be no assurance that\nthe market price of our common stock will satisfy the investing requirements of those investors. As a result, the trading liquidity of our common stock may not necessarily improve.\nWe have never declared dividends and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends.\nWe have not declared or paid any dividends on any of our capital stock to date. The payment of dividends, if any, would be contingent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital\nrequirements, and general financial condition. The payment of any dividends will be within the discretion of our Board. We presently intend to retain all earnings, if any, to implement\nour business plan; accordingly, we do not anticipate the declaration of any dividends in the foreseeable future. Unless and until we pay dividends, stockholders may not receive a return\non their shares of common stock.\nOur executive officers, directors and principal stockholders, if they choose to act together, have the ability to control or significantly influence all matters submitted to\nstockholders for approval.\nOur executive officers, directors and greater than 5% stockholders, in the aggregate, own approximately 64% of our outstanding common stock as of March 20, 2024. As a result, such\npersons, acting together, have the ability to control or significantly influence all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors and\napproval of any significant transaction, as well as our management and business affairs. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a\nchange in control, impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise\nattempting to obtain control of our business, even if such a transaction would benefit other stockholders.\nAdditionally, under the terms of the securities purchase agreement (the \"January PIPE SPA\") entered into in connection with the January PIPE Financing, so long as the investors in\nthe January PIPE Financing continue to beneficially own in the aggregate at least 40% of the securities issued in the January PIPE Financing (such securities, the \"Closing Securities\"),\nthe Company may not transfer, license (other than in the ordinary course of business), encumber, or sell a royalty interest in any intellectual property relating to nimacimab unless Skye\nobtains the written consent of Qualified Investors that, together with their respective affiliates, beneficially own at least a majority of the then outstanding Closing Securities owned by\nthe Qualified Investors and their respective affiliates. The term \"Qualified Investors\" means any investor that, together with its affiliates, continues to own at least 80% of the securities\noriginally purchased by it under the January PIPE SPA. This restriction may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, impeding a merger, consolidation,\ntakeover or other business combination involving us, or discouraging a potential acquiror from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our business, even if\nsuch a transaction would benefit other stockholders.\n51\nWe have a substantial number of authorized common shares available for future issuance that could cause dilution to our Stockholders’ interest and adversely impact the rights of\nthe holders of our Shares.\nWe have a total of 100,000,000 shares of common stock authorized for issuance and up to 200,000 shares of preferred stock with the rights, preferences and privileges that our Board\nmay determine from time to time. As of March 20, 2024, we have reserved; 1,201,398 shares for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding options, 1,127,777 shares for issuance upon\nthe vesting of outstanding restricted stock units, 127,034 shares for issuance under our equity incentive plan, 112,000 shares for issuance under our 2022 employee stock purchase\nplan, and 13,259,679 shares for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding warrants. As of March 20, 2024, we had no outstanding preferred stock. As of March 20, 2024, we had\n55,140,232 shares of common stock unreserved and available for issuance. We may seek financing that could result in the issuance of additional shares of our capital stock and/or\nrights to acquire additional shares of our capital stock. We may also make acquisitions that result in issuances of additional shares of our capital stock. Those additional issuances of\ncapital stock would result in a significant reduction of your percentage interest in us. Furthermore, the book value per share of our common stock may be reduced. This reduction\nwould occur if the exercise price of any issued warrants, the conversion price of any convertible notes is lower than the book value per share of our common stock at the time of such\nexercise or conversion.\nThe addition of a substantial number of shares of our common stock into the market or by the registration of any of our other securities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended\n(the “Securities Act”), may significantly and negatively affect the prevailing market price for our common stock. The future sales of shares of our common stock issuable upon the\nexercise of outstanding warrants may have a depressive effect on the market price of our common stock, as such warrants would be more likely to be exercised at a time when the price\nof our common stock is greater than the exercise price.\nThe issuance of shares upon exercise of outstanding warrants, convertible debt and options may cause immediate and substantial dilution to our existing stockholders.\nIf the price per share of our common stock at the time of exercise of any warrants, options, or any other convertible securities is in excess of the various conversion or exercise prices\nof these convertible securities, conversion or exercise of these convertible securities would have a dilutive effect on our common stock. As of March 20, 2024, we had outstanding (i)\nwarrants to purchase up to 13,259,679 shares of our common stock at exercise prices ranging from $0.001 to $1,250 per share, (ii) options to purchase up to 1,201,398 shares of our\ncommon stock at exercise prices ranging from $1.69 to $750.00 per share, (iii) 1,127,777 unreleased restricted stock units exchangeable for shares of our common stock upon vesting.\nAdditionally, we have an outstanding convertible secured promissory note in the principal amount of $5,000,000 with a conversion price of $5.16. Further, any additional financing\nthat we secure may require the granting of rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock and which result in additional dilution of the existing ownership\ninterests of our common stockholders.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change net operating\nloss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. In general, an “ownership change” occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of\none or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who own at least 5% of a corporation’s stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest\nownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. If we experience ownership changes as a result of future transactions in our\nstock, our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset U.S. federal taxable income may be subject to further limitations, which could potentially\nresult in increased future tax liability to us.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by our existing stockholders in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by our existing stockholders in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur could significantly reduce\nthe market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise adequate capital through the sale of additional equity securities.\nThe holders of 24,140,023 shares of our outstanding common stock, or approximately 86% of our total outstanding common stock as of March 20, 2024, are entitled to rights with\nrespect to the registration of their shares under the Securities Act. Registration of these shares under the Securities Act would result in the shares becoming freely tradable without\nrestriction under the Securities Act, except for shares held by affiliates, as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Sales of securities by these stockholders could have a material\nadverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\n52\nWe cannot assure you that our common stock will become eligible for listing or quotation on any exchange and the failure to do so may adversely affect your ability to dispose of\nour common stock in a timely fashion.\nWe have, and may in the future, consider actions that make us eligible to list our common shares on a stock exchange, such as NASDAQ. We may not be able satisfy the initial\nstandards for listing or quotation on any exchange in the foreseeable future or at all. Even if we are able to become listed or quoted on an exchange, we may not be able to maintain a\nlisting of the common stock on such stock exchange.\nOur common shares are thinly-traded, and in the future, may continue to be thinly-traded, and you may be unable to sell at or near ask prices or at all.\nOur common shares are quoted on the OTCQB and are thinly traded. We cannot predict whether, and the extent to which, an active public market for our common stock will develop\nor be sustained due to a number of factors, including the fact that we are a small company that is relatively unknown to stock analysts, stock brokers, institutional investors, and others\nin the investment community that generate or influence sales volume, and that even if we came to the attention of such persons, they tend to be risk-averse and may be reluctant to\nfollow an unproven company such as ours or purchase or recommend the purchase of our shares until such time as we became more seasoned and viable. As a consequence, there have\nbeen, and may continue to be, periods of several days or more when trading activity in our shares is minimal or non-existent. We cannot give you any assurance that a broader or more\nactive public trading market for our common stock will develop or be sustained, or that current trading levels will be sustained.\nThe market for our common shares can be characterized by significant price volatility when compared to other more well known issuers, and we expect that our share price will\ncontinue to be more volatile than a well-known issuer for the indefinite future. The volatility in our share price is attributable to a number of factors. First, as noted above, our common\nshares have been, and may continue to be, sporadically and/or thinly traded. As a consequence of this lack of liquidity, the trading of relatively small quantities of shares by our\nstockholders may disproportionately influence the price of those shares in either direction. Secondly, an investment in us is a speculative or “risky” investment due to our lack of\nrevenues or profits to date. You should not invest in our common shares unless you have the ability to tolerate a thinly traded and volatile market for the shares.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports or publish unfavorable research or reports about our business, our stock price and trading volume could\ndecline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors.\nWe currently have limited research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If securities or industry analysts do not continue coverage of our company, the trading price for our\nstock would be negatively impacted. In the event one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these\nanalysts ceases to cover us or fails to regularly publish reports on us, interest in our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe engage in transactions with related parties which present possible conflicts of interest that could have an adverse effect on us.\nWe have entered, and may continue to enter, into transactions with affiliates and other related parties for financing, corporate, business development and operational services. Such\ntransactions may not have been entered into on an arm’s-length basis, and we may have achieved more or less favorable terms because such transactions were entered into with our\nrelated parties. We rely, and will continue to rely, on our related parties to maintain these services. If the pricing for these services changes, or if our related parties cease to provide\nthese services, including by terminating agreements with us, we may be unable to obtain replacements for these services on the same terms without disruption to our business. This\ncould have a material effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The details of certain of these transactions are set forth in “Certain Relationships and Related\nParty Transactions”. Related party transactions create the possibility of conflicts of interest with regard to our management, we may enter into contracts between us, on the one hand,\nand related parties, on the other, that may not result in arm’s-length transactions, including that:\n• our executive officers and directors that hold positions of responsibility with related parties may be aware of certain business opportunities that are appropriate for\npresentation to us as well as to such other related parties and may present such business opportunities to such other parties; and\n• our executive officers and directors that hold positions of responsibility with related parties may have significant duties with, and spend significant time serving, other entities\nand may have conflicts of interest in allocating time.\n53\nSuch conflicts could cause an individual in our management to seek to advance his or her economic interests or the economic interests of certain related parties above ours. Further, the\nappearance of conflicts of interest created by related party transactions could impair the confidence of our investors. Our audit committee reviews these transactions. Notwithstanding\nthis, it is possible that a conflict of interest could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nUnpredictable business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenues and financial condition, increase our costs and expenses, and impact our ability to raise capital.\nOur operations could be subject to unpredictable events, such as earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, water shortages, medical epidemics and other natural or\nman made disasters or business interruptions, for which we are predominantly self-insured. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm our operations\nand financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. Notably, we rely on third party manufacturers to produce our product candidates, and such third party manufacturers\nability to manufacture our products could be negatively affected by such events.\nThe current volatility of global financial conditions and inflation could negatively impact our business and financial condition.\nCurrent global financial conditions and recent market events have been characterized by increased volatility, inflation and the resulting tightening of the credit and capital markets has\nreduced the amount of available liquidity and overall economic activity. Economic factors over which the Company has no control, including changes in inflation, interest rates and\nforeign currency rates may have a potential adverse effect of on revenues, expenses and resulting margins. We cannot guarantee that debt or equity financing, and the ability to borrow\nfunds or cash generated by operations will be available or sufficient to meet or satisfy our initiatives, objectives, or requirements. Our inability to access sufficient amounts of capital\non terms acceptable to us for our operations will negatively impact our business, prospects, liquidity and financial condition.\nGlobal markets have recently experienced increased rates of inflation. Inflation itself, as well as certain governmental efforts to combat inflation, may have significant negative effects\non any economy which the Company does business. Past governmental efforts to curb inflation also involved other more drastic economic measures. Any future economic measures to\ncurb inflation could be expected to have similar adverse effects on the level of economic activity in the market, which the Company does business and, in turn, on the operations of the\nCompany. For example, the Federal Reserve recently raised interest rates multiple times in response to concerns about inflation and it may raise them again. Higher interest rates,\ncoupled with reduced government spending and volatility in financial markets may increase economic uncertainty and affect consumer spending. Increased inflation rates can\nadversely affect us by increasing our costs, including labor and employee benefit costs. Other policies and measures adopted by governments include interest rate adjustments,\nintervention in the currency markets or actions to adjust or fix the value of the local currency may adversely affect the Company’s business and results of operations.\nAdverse U.S. or international economic conditions could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We face risks associated with U.S. and\ninternational economic conditions and are subject to events beyond our control including war, public health crises, trade disputes, economic sanctions, and their collateral impacts.\nAdverse U.S. or international economic conditions or periods of inflation or high energy prices may contribute to higher unemployment levels, decreased consumer spending, reduced\ncredit availability and declining consumer confidence and demand, each of which poses a risk to our business. In February 2022, armed conflict escalated between Russia and Ukraine.\nThe sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other countries against Russia, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, to date include restrictions on selling or importing goods, services, or\ntechnology in or from affected regions and travel bans and asset freezes impacting connected individuals and political, military, business and financial organizations in Russia. The\nU.S. and other countries could impose wider sanctions and take other actions should the conflict further escalate. It is not possible to predict the broader consequences of this conflict,\nwhich could include further sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, geopolitical shifts and adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions, currency exchange rates and financial\nmarkets, all of which could impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity.\nWe maintain a cyber risk management program designed to identify, assess, manage, mitigate, and respond to cybersecurity threats. This program, in conjunction with the Company’s\nenterprise risk management assessment processes, addresses cybersecurity risks to the corporate information technology (“IT”) environment including systems, hardware, software,\ndata, people, and processes.\n54\nThe underlying processes and controls of our cyber risk management program are designed based on standards for cybersecurity and information technology, including the National\nInstitute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) Cybersecurity Framework (“CSF”). Skye has an annual assessment performed by a third-party specialist of its cyber risk management\nprogram against the NIST CSF. The annual risk assessment identifies, quantifies, and categorizes significant cyber risks. In addition, the Company, in conjunction with the third-party\ncyber risk management specialists develop a risk mitigation plan to address identified risks and, where necessary, remediate potential issues identified through the annual assessment\nprocess.\nIn addition, we maintain an information security policy that covers safeguarding and managing confidential information, handling personal and company-sensitive data, managing\naccess on/off-boarding and user accounts, acceptable use and IT change management to help govern the processes put in place by management designed to protect Skye’s IT assets,\ndata, and services from threats and vulnerabilities. We partner with industry recognized cybersecurity providers leveraging third-party technology and expertise. We and our\ncybersecurity partners maintain an IT assets inventory, identity access management controls including restricted access of privileged accounts, physical security measures at Company\nfacilities, information protection/detection systems including maintenance of firewalls and anti-malware tools, network and data traffic monitoring and automated alerting, capacity\nmanagement, industry-standard encryption protocols, formalized change management processes, critical data backups infrastructure maintenance, incident response, cybersecurity\nstrategy, and cyber risk advisory, assessment and remediation.\nOur management team is responsible for oversight and administration of our cyber risk management program, and for informing senior management and other relevant stakeholders\nregarding the prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents. Our management team has experience selecting, deploying, and overseeing cybersecurity\ntechnologies, initiatives, and processes directly or via selection of strategic third-party partners, and relies on threat intelligence as well as other information obtained from\ngovernmental, public, or private sources, including external consultants engaged by Skye for strategic cyber risk management, advisory and decision making.\nWe have implemented third-party risk management processes to manage the risks associated with reliance on vendors, critical IT service providers, and other third-parties that may\nlead to a service disruption or an adverse cybersecurity incident. This includes processes for performing due diligence upon on-boarding.\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors oversees our cybersecurity risk exposures and the steps taken by management to monitor and mitigate cybersecurity risks. The\ncybersecurity stakeholders, including management assigned with cybersecurity oversight responsibility and/or third-party consultants providing cyber risk services brief the Audit\nCommittee on cyber vulnerabilities identified through the risk management process, the effectiveness of our cyber risk management program, and the emerging threat landscape and\nnew cyber risks on at least an annual basis. This includes updates on our processes to prevent, detect, and mitigate cybersecurity incidents. In addition, cybersecurity risks are reviewed\nby our Board of Directors at least annually, as part of our corporate risk oversight processes.\nWe face risks from cybersecurity threats that could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or reputation. We acknowledge\nthat the risk of cyber incidents is prevalent in the current threat landscape and that a future cyber incident may occur in the normal course of its business. However, prior cybersecurity\nincidents have not had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. We proactively seek to detect and investigate unauthorized\nattempts and attacks against IT assets, data, and services, and to prevent their occurrence and recurrence where practicable through changes or updates to internal processes and tools\nand changes or updates to the our service delivery; however, potential vulnerabilities to known or unknown threats will still remain and we may not be able to prevent security\nincidents in the future. Further, there is increasing regulation regarding responses to cybersecurity incidents, including reporting to regulators, investors, and additional stakeholders,\nwhich could subject us to additional liability and reputational harm. In response to such risks, we have implemented initiatives such as implementation of the cybersecurity risk\nassessment process and development of an incident response plan. See Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\" for more information on cybersecurity risks.\nItem 2. Properties.\nWe lease our principal executive offices and corporate offices, which are located at 11250 El Camino Real Suite 100, San Diego, CA 92130.\nItem 3.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022 together with notes thereto. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks,\nuncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including, but not\nlimited, to those set forth under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nUnless otherwise provided in this Annual Report, references to “we,” “us,” “our” and “Skye Bioscience” in this discussion and analysis refer to Skye Bioscience, Inc., a Nevada\ncorporation , together with its wholly owned subsidiaries, Nemus, a California corporation, SKYE Bioscience Pty Ltd (\"SKYE Bioscience Australia\"), an Australian proprietary\nlimited company, Emerald Health Therapeutics, Inc. (EHT) a corporation governed by the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia), Birdrock Bio Sub, Inc. (\"BRB\"), a Delaware\ncorporation, Ruiyi Acquisition Corp, a Delaware corporation and Avalite Sciences, Inc. (AVI) a corporation governed by the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia).\nOverview\nWe are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company with a mission to pioneer and lead the development of new pharmaceutical products that unlock the potential of the ECS. Our\nstrategy and clinical assets focus, initially, on the modulation of the CB1 axis to advance the standard of care and provide novel alternative therapies to treat diseases with neuropathic,\ninflammatory, and metabolic conditions.\nOur lead clinical program's product candidate nimacimab, is a peripherally-restricted negative allosteric modulating antibody specific for the human CB1 receptor, administered as a\nsubcutaneous injectable for the treatment of metabolic disorders, including obesity. We plan to launch a Phase 2 clinical trial of nimacimab, which will include a combination study\nwith a GLP-1 agonist, to treat obesity by mid-year 2024, with final data in late 2025.\n56\nIn August of 2023, we acquired nimacimab from the acquisition of BRB as a Phase 2 ready asset. Nimacimab's Phase 1 trial was designed to test the safety and tolerability in a single\nascending dose (SAD) in health volunteers and a multiple ascending dose (MAD) in patients with NAFLD. The Phase 1 study, indicated a strong safety profile and provided important\nindications of effectiveness in reducing cholesterol levels in the NAFLD population. Based on the results of this study, we further evaluated other potential use cases for nimacimab in\nmetabolic, inflammatory and fibrotic processes. Based on our comprehensive review of the overall market, clinical pipeline of competition and potential target product profile (TPP) of\nnimacimab, in December 2023, we filed an IND to treat patients with obesity in a Phase 2 study.\nOur other product candidate, SBI-100 OE, is a Phase 2-stage CB1 agonist (activator) delivered topically into the eye for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension. Our\nproprietary eye drop is a nano emulsion formulation that has been developed in a way that provides enhanced bio-availability and permeability, while also extending the duration of\nactivity. In February 2024, we announced the completion of patient enrollment in our Phase 2a placebo controlled study designed to treat glaucoma and ocular hypertension and are\nexpecting to report data in Q2 2024.\nWe commenced dosing of our Phase 1 clinical study for SBI-100 OE in December 2022 and in November 2023 we reported data demonstrating that SBI-100 OE was safe and well-\ntolerated. Importantly, we determined that there was minimal systemic exposure of the active metabolite of SBI-100 OE, THC, thus resulting in little to no side effects related to THC\nintoxication. Moreover, it was determined that after multiple days of dosing we saw minimal hyperaemia (i.e. redness of the eyes) following administration of SBI-100 OE.\nIn preclinical experiments using SBI-100 OE we have demonstrated statistically superior IOP lowering compared to the prostaglandin-based therapy, latanoprost, the current standard-\nof-care for treating glaucoma. Statistical significance was reached across multiple time points during a seven-day course of dosing using a validated rabbit normotensive ocular model\nand SBI-100 exerted pharmacologic activity consistent with once-daily to twice-daily dosing.\nWe believe that both of our drug candidates are differentiated in their respective markets and target indications with a large unmet need. Because the modulation of the ECS through\nCB1 has been shown to play a role in both glaucoma and obesity, we believe that both our products are strong candidates for marketing authorization as either first or second-line\ntherapies.\nIn January 2024 and March 2024, we completed two private placement equity transactions with institutional investors, in which we raised combined net aggregate proceeds of\napproximately $83,500,000. The capital from the January and March PIPE financings will allow us to fund both of our planned clinical trials for glaucoma and obesity through top line\nPhase 2 data.\nOn September 6, 2023, we filed a Certificate of Change and Certificate of Correction with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada, which effected a reverse stock split, at a ratio\nof one-for-250, of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of common ctock (the \"Reverse Split\"). The Reverse Split was effective on September 8, 2023. As a result of the\nReverse Split, each two-hundred fifty (250) shares of common stock was combined into one (1) share of common stock and the total number of shares of common stock authorized\nwas reduced from 5,000,000,000 to 20,000,000 and the number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding was reduced from 3,078,137,871 shares of common stock to\n12,312,551 shares of common stock. Subsequently, on November 6, 2023, we increased our authorized shares of common stock to 100,000,000.\nOn August 18, 2023, we completed a strategic transaction to acquire a clinical asset pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of August 15, 2023, by\nand among the Company, Bird Rock Bio, Inc. and Aquila Merger Sub, Inc., pursuant to which Aquila Merger Sub, Inc. merged with and into Bird Rock Bio, Inc. with Bird Rock Bio,\nInc. surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the “BRB Acquisition”). The purpose of the BRB Acquisition was to acquire BRB's clinical asset, nimacimab, an\nantibody targeting the CB1 receptor, for development to treat metabolic, inflammatory, and fibrotic conditions.\nWe were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 16, 2011 and are based in San Diego, CA. Since our incorporation, we have devoted substantially all of our\nefforts to building our product portfolio through the acquisition of clinical assets and licensing agreements, carrying out research and development, building infrastructure and raising\ncapital.\nFinancial Overview\nRevenues\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue. We do not expect to receive any revenue from any drug candidates that we develop unless and until we obtain regulatory approval for, and\ncommercialize, our drug candidates or generate revenue from collaborative agreements with third parties.\n57\nResearch and Development Expenses\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we incurred $5,819,461 in research and development expenses primarily related to our efforts in conducting the Phase 1 and Phase 2a SBI-\n100 OE clinical trials. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred $6,011,805 in research and development expense primarily related to our efforts in conducting the Phase\n1 SBI-100 clinical trial and the manufacturing of the API required for the Phase 1 and Phase 2a SBI-100 clinical studies. We expect that our ongoing research and development\nexpenses will consist of costs incurred for the development of our drug candidates, including, but not limited to:\n• license fees;\n• employee-related expenses, which include salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation;\n• payments to third party contract research organizations and investigative sites; and\n• payments to third party manufacturing organizations and consultants.\nWe expect to incur future research and development expenditures to support our nonclinical and clinical studies. Nonclinical activities include, laboratory evaluation of product\nchemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess safety and efficacy. Subject to the submission and approval by the FDA of our IND, clinical trials may\ncommence and will involve the administration of the investigational new drug candidate to human subjects.\nThe process of conducting the necessary clinical research to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time consuming and the successful development of our drug candidates is highly\nuncertain. Our future research and development expenses will depend on the clinical success of each of our drug candidates, as well as ongoing assessments of the commercial\npotential of such drug candidates. In addition, we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which drug candidates may be subject to future collaborations, when such arrangements\nwill be secured, if at all, and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements. We expect to incur increased research and development\nexpenses in the future as we continue our efforts towards advancing our lead program for nimacimab.\nCost to acquire IPR&D Asset\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we incurred a one-time non-cash charge of $21,215,214 related to the acquisition of our lead clinical asset, nimacimab. This in-process\nR&D was expensed when purchased in exchange for shares of our common stock, as its only future use was determined to be for drug development.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nOur general and administrative expenses have fluctuated year-over-year as we have entered into various strategic acquisitions to restructure and re-position our company. Additionally,\nas a business in the early stages of drug development we are in the process of scaling our operations by hiring additional employees, and building the infrastructure necessary to\nincrease efficiencies. These initiatives have resulted in additional costs related to the implementation of certain systems, insurance, legal and accounting related to operating as a public\ncompany. To incentivize our employees and be competitive to retain strong talent we issued additional equity awards in 2023, which have resulted in increased stock-based\ncompensation expense. We expect that our general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in the future in order to support our expected increase in research and\ndevelopment activities, including increased salaries and other related costs, stock-based compensation and consulting fees for executive, finance, accounting and business development\nfunctions. We also expect general and administrative expenses to increase as a result of additional costs associated with being a public company, including expenses related to\ncompliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC, additional insurance expenses, investor relations activities and other administration and professional services. Other significant\ncosts are expected to include legal fees relating to patent and corporate matters, facility costs and fees for accounting and other consulting services.\nEstimated legal contingency\nThe estimated legal contingency relates to a wrongful termination suit brought against the former management team that is currently being appealed. As of December 31, 2023, the\nmaximum amount of the liability is known and we have posted an appellate bond that is collateralized by an irrevocable letter of credit equal to, $9,080,202, approximately 150% of\nthe liability recorded on our balance sheet.\nOther Expense\nOther expense primarily includes interest expense incurred from our short term convertible debt, a loss related to the divestiture of an asset from our 2022 acquisition and an\ninducement charge from the conversion of debt. In both 2023 and 2022 we also reported wind-down costs from our 2022 acquisition of EHT which we do not expect to incur in future\nperiods. These expenses are offset by interest income earned on our cash balances.\n58\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section discusses our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in\naccordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of income and\nexpenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to accrued expenses, the percentage of\ncompletion as it relates to our clinical accruals, financing operations, contingencies, the fair value of assets acquired in the acquisitions, and litigation. Management bases its estimates\nand judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making\njudgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions\nor conditions. The most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements include estimates as to the appropriate carrying value of\ncertain assets and liabilities which are not readily apparent from other sources. These accounting estimates are described at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis and in the\nnotes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid you in fully\nunderstanding and evaluating our reported financial results and affect the more significant judgments and estimates that we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial\nstatements.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing\ncontracts and vendor agreements, communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service\nperformed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost. We make estimates of our accrued and prepaid\nclinical expenses on a quarterly basis in our consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. Examples of estimated accrued research and\ndevelopment expenses include fees paid to contract research organizations (CROs), investigative sites in connection with clinical studies and to vendors related to product\nmanufacturing and development of clinical supplies.\nWe base our expenses related to clinical study and trial costs on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and\nCROs that conduct and manage clinical studies on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in\nuneven payment flows and expense recognition. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors out of our control, such as the successful enrollment of patients and the\ncompletion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each\nperiod. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to\nbe materially different from amounts actually incurred, if our estimates of the status and timing of services performed differ from the actual status and timing of services performed, we\nmay report amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. There have been no material changes in estimates for the periods presented.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nWe have stock-based compensation programs, which include restricted stock units (RSUs); stock options and an employee stock purchase plan. We account for stock-based\ncompensation expense, including the expense for grants of stock options and RSUs that may be settled in shares of our common stock, based on the fair values of the equity\ninstruments issued. The fair value is determined on the measurement date, which is generally the date of grant. The fair value of our RSUs is generally measured at the market price of\nour common stock on the measurement date. Additionally, we use the Monte Carlo Simulation model to evaluate the derived service period and fair value of awards with market\nconditions, including assumptions of historical volatility, time to the next capital raise and risk-free interest rate commensurate with the vesting term. The fair value for our stock\noption awards is determined at the grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation model.\nAssumptions for the Black-Scholes valuation model used for employee stock awards include:\n• Volatility - Stock price volatility is estimated over the expected term based on a blended daily rate of industry peers stock volatility.\n• Expected term - The expected term is based on a simplified method which defines the life as the weighted average of the contractual term of the options and the vesting period\nfor each award.\n• Risk-free rate - The risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the average market rate on U.S. Treasury securities in effect during the period in\nwhich the awards were granted.\n59\n• Dividends - The dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of paying no dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine stock-based compensation expense.\nHowever, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to changes in stock-based compensation expense that could be material or the\nstock-based compensation expense reported in our financial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the stock-based compensation.\nRecently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on recently issued accounting\npronouncements and recently adopted accounting pronouncements. While we expect certain recently adopted accounting pronouncements to impact our estimates in future periods, the\nimpact upon adoption was not significant to our current estimates and operations.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\nResearch and Development Expenses\nBelow is a summary of our research and development expenses during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nYear Ended December 31,\n$ Change % Change\n2023 2022 2023 vs. 2022 2023 vs. 2022\nResearch and development expenses $ 5,819,461 $ 6,011,805 $ (192,344) (3)%\nResearch and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 decreased by $192,344 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in research\nand development expenses was primarily due to a slight delay starting our Phase 2a glaucoma study that we experienced during the second half of 2023. In addition, the decrease in\ncontract manufacturing costs during 2023 was due to the efficient management of sufficient reserves of clinical trial material from our Phase 1 trial to administer the Phase 2a clinical\nstudy for glaucoma. The overall decline included a decrease of $422,939 and $210,270 in clinical contract costs and consulting, respectively.

The valuation assumptions used in the valuation of options and RSUs may be found in Note 2 to our financial statements included in this\nannual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The amount reported is also the amount that would be reported assuming the highest level of\nperformance conditions are achieved. The restricted stock units vest upon achievement of the following performance milestones, subject to continued services to the\nCompany through the applicable vesting date: an incremental 25% of the restricted stock units vest upon the Company achieving a market capitalization of $125 million,\n$250 million, $400 million, respectively, and an additional 25% vests if the Company achieves a value of $500 million or greater at an exit event. If the Company achieves\nan exit value greater than $500 million at an earlier date, subject to the executive’s continued services with the Company through such exit event, all of the restricted stock\nunits will vest. No restricted stock units will vest until the compensation committee of the Company determines that shares can be sold into the market to cover withholding\ntax obligations associated with the vesting of the restricted stock units. As of December 31, 2023, no market capitalization milestone was achieved and no restricted stock\nunits were vested. Amounts reflect the full grant date fair value of stock options, computed in accordance with ASC Topic 718 - Stock based compensation, rather than the\namounts paid to or realized by the named executive officers. The value of stock option awards was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The valuation\nassumptions used in the valuation of options and restricted stock units may be found in Note 2 to our financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for\nthe year ended December 31, 2023.\n(2) Amounts reflect the cash bonuses earned by our named executive officers for performance of services in 2023 and 2022. Bonuses were based upon achievement of\ncorporate performance goals as determined by the Board.\nNarrative Disclosure to Summary Compensation Table\nOur compensation committee has historically determined the compensation of our named executive officers. Our compensation committee typically reviews and discusses\nmanagement’s proposed compensation with the Chief Executive Officer for all executives other than the Chief Executive Officer. Based on those discussions and its discretion, the\ncompensation committee then approves the compensation of each executive officer after discussions without members of management present.\n71\nBase Salary\nBase salaries for our named executive officers are initially established through arm’s-length negotiations at the time of the executive officer’s hiring, taking into account such executive\nofficer’s qualifications, experience, the scope of his or her responsibilities and competitive market compensation paid by other companies for similar positions within the industry and\ngeography. Annual base salaries are intended to provide a fixed component of compensation to our named executive officers, reflecting their skill sets, experience, roles and\nresponsibilities. Base salaries are reviewed, determined, and approved periodically, typically in connection with our annual performance review process, and adjusted from time to time\nto realign salaries with market levels after taking into account individual responsibilities, performance and experience. The annualized 2023 base salaries for our named executive\nofficers were as follows: (i) $450,000 for Mr. Dhillon and (ii) $340,000 for Ms. Arsenault.\nAnnual Performance-Based Compensation\nIn addition to base salaries, our named executive officers are eligible to receive annual performance-based bonuses, which are designed to provide appropriate incentives to our\nexecutive officers to achieve annual performance goals and to reward them for achievement towards these goals. Performance based milestones are approved by the board at the\nbeginning of the year and executive officers are assessed against these performance-based milestones subsequent to year end. With respect to 2023, our compensation committee\nawarded a bonus of $161,904 to Mr. Dhillon, a bonus of $87,731 to Ms. Arsenault. Please see “Employment and Severance Agreements —Employment Agreements” below for\nadditional information.\nEquity Incentives\nWe believe that our ability to grant equity-based awards is a valuable and necessary compensation tool that aligns the long-term financial interests of our employees, consultants and\ndirectors with the financial interests of our shareholders. Our compensation committee periodically reviews the equity incentive compensation of our executive officers, including our\nnamed executive officers, and from time to time may grant equity incentive awards to them.\nIn August 2023, we completed the acquisition of Bird Rock Bio, Inc. and closed a concurrent private placement financing and a convertible note financing. Following the completion\nof the transaction, our compensation committee, and its advisors undertook a review of the compensation of our executive officers, directors and employees.\nFollowing such review, on August 25, 2023, we granted each of Mr. Dhillon and Ms. Arsenault (i) an option to purchase 9,013 and 13,383 shares of our common stock, respectively, at\nan exercise price per share of $3.50 and (ii) a contingent option award to, purchase 21,586 and 32,053 shares of our common stock, respectively, at an exercise price per share of $3.50,\nsubject to the approval of an amendment to our Amended and Restated 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “A&R 2014 Incentive Plan”) to increase the number of shares authorized for\nissuance under the A&R 2014 Incentive Plan (the “Plan Amendment”). On September 29, 2023 holders of a majority of the voting power of the outstanding capital stock of the\nCompany (the “Majority Stockholders”) and the Board approved the Plan Amendment. These options vest in equal monthly installments over four years, subject to continued services\nto the Company through the applicable vesting date. If a change in control occurs, 100% of such options will become fully vested.\nAdditionally, on August 25, 2023, we granted each of Mr. Dhillon and Ms. Arsenault (i) performance-based RSUs covering 81,110 and 53,529 shares of our common stock,\nrespectively, and (ii) contingent performance-based RSUs covering 194,270 and 128,209 shares of our common stock, respectively, subject to approval of the Plan Amendment, which\nwas approved by the Majority Stockholders and the Board on September 29, 2023. These RSUs vest upon achievement of the following performance milestones, subject to continued\nservices to the Company through the applicable vesting date: 25% of the restricted stock units vest upon the Company achieving a market capitalization of $125 million, $250 million,\n$400 million, respectively, and an additional 25% vests if the Company achieves a value of $500 million or greater at an exit event. If the Company achieves an exit value greater than\n$500 million at an earlier date, subject to the executive’s continued services with the Company through such exit event, all of the RSUs will vest. No RSUs will vest until the\ncompensation committee of the Company determines that shares can be sold into the market to cover withholding tax obligations associated with the vesting of the restricted stock\nunits. As of December 31, 2023, no market capitalization milestone was achieved and no restricted stock units were vested.\nFor additional information, please see below under “Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year End.”\n72\nEmployment and Severance Arrangements\nEmployment Agreement with Punit Dhillon\nOn August 7, 2020, we entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Dhillon, our Chief Executive Officer.

Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. Nature of Operations and Business Activities\nNature of Operations\nSkye Bioscience, Inc. (the “Company” or “Skye”) was incorporated in Nevada on March 16, 2011. The Company is a clinical stage pharmaceutical company located in San Diego,\nCalifornia, focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of novel classes of therapeutic drugs that modulate the endocannabinoid system, which has been shown to\nplay a vital role in overall human health. Notably, the Company is developing drugs with novel mechanisms of action targeting the CB1 receptor through its own research efforts\nacquired intellectual property and license agreements.\nIn August 2019, the Company formed a new subsidiary in Australia, SKYE Bioscience Pty Ltd. (formerly \"EMBI Australia Pty Ltd.\"), an Australian proprietary limited company\n(\"SKYE Bioscience Australia\"), in order to qualify for the Australian government’s research and development tax credit for research and development dollars spent in Australia. The\nCompany conducted its Phase 1 clinical trial for glaucoma at SKYE Bioscience Australia.\nOn August 18, 2023, the Company completed a strategic transaction to acquire a clinical asset pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of August\n15, 2023, by and among the Company, Bird Rock Bio, Inc. and Aquila Merger Sub, Inc., pursuant to which Aquila Merger Sub, Inc. merged with and into Bird Rock Bio, Inc. with\nBird Rock Bio, Inc. surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the “BRB Acquisition”). In connection with the BRB Acquisition, Bird Rock Bio changed its name from\nBird Rock Bio, Inc. to Bird Rock Bio Sub, Inc (\"BRB\"). In the BRB Acquisition, the Company issued to certain former stockholders of BRB an aggregate of 5,436,378 shares of the\ncommon stock of the Company, valued at $21,609,586 (Note 3).\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company has devoted substantially all its efforts to securing product licenses, carrying out its own research and development, building infrastructure and\nraising capital. The Company has not yet realized revenue from its planned principal operations and is a number of years away from potentially being able to do so.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company has incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and as of December 31, 2023, had a working capital deficit of $2,250,156 and an\naccumulated deficit of $104,382,549. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had unrestricted cash in the amount of $1,256,453. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nthe Company incurred losses from operations of $34,735,173 and $18,311,732, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company incurred net losses of\n$37,644,784 and $19,481,602, respectively. The Company expects to continue to incur significant losses and negative cash flows from operations through 2024 and in the future.\nHistorically, the Company has funded its operations through convertible debt, public equity financings, asset acquisitions and private investments in public equity. On August 18, 2023,\nthe Company entered into the Convertible Note Financing, the August PIPE Financing and BRB Acquisition which provided the Company with the necessary funds to continue\noperations post an appeal bond to stay the execution of the judgment in the Cunning Lawsuit (Note 13) and reposition the Company to focus on nimacimab as its lead clinical asset for\nobesity. Following the August 2023 financings, the Company executed a 1:250 reverse stock split and increased its authorized shares outstanding (Note 7). On January 31, 2024 and\nMarch 13, 2024, the Company completed two private placement equity transactions with institutional investors, in which it raised combined net aggregate proceeds of approximately\n$83,500,000. The capital from the January and March financings will allow the Company to fund its planned Phase 2 clinical trials for glaucoma and obesity through top line data.\nThe Company’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of the Company continuing as a going concern for the next 12 months. Based on its current\noperational requirements, the Company believes that its current cash, and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund its projected operations for at least 12 months from the date of the\nissuance of these consolidated financial statements.\nImpact of Geopolitical and Macroeconomic Factors\nIt is possible that the Company may encounter supply chain issues related to global economic and political conditions such as a lack of production or laboratory resources. pandemics\nor cyberattacks that could cause business disruptions and clinical trial delays which will need to be managed in the future. There may also be significant uncertainty resulting from the\nimpact of other geopolitical and macroeconomic factors, including global pandemics, inflation, supply chain issues, rising interest rates, future bank failures, increased geopolitical\ntensions between the U.S. and China and the impact of the Russia/Ukraine conflict and the Israel-Hamas war.\nF-8\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCertain reclassifications have been made to the amounts in prior periods to conform to the current period’s presentation, primarily the separate classification of prepaid expenses, other\ncurrent assets, estimate for legal contingency, accrued interest for legal contingency, and other current liabilities. Such reclassifications did not have a material impact on the\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\nReverse Stock Split\nOn September 6, 2023, the Company filed a Certificate of Change and Certificate of Correction with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada which effected a reverse stock split\nat a ratio of one-for-two hundred and fifty (1-for-250) of the Company's issued and outstanding shares of common stock as of 12:01 a.m. Eastern Standard Time on September 8, 2023.\nThe Company did not issue fractional shares in the reverse stock split and elected to issue one whole share for each fractional share which resulted in the issuance of 26,349 common\nshares to our existing stockholders. The Company's financial statements have been adjusted on a retrospective basis to reflect the change.\nAssets Held for Sale\nOn November 10, 2022, the Company completed the EHT Acquisition. At the time of the EHT Acquisition there were arrangements in place to sell the acquired assets and liabilities\nthat comprised two of EHT's subsidiaries, Emerald Health Therapeutics Canada, Inc. (\"EHTC\") and VDL. As a result, EHTC and VDL were considered held for sale since the EHT\nAcquisition and the Company has classified the associated assets of VDL as held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the period costs related to both EHTC and VDL have\nbeen presented as wind-down costs in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. EHTC was divested on December 28, 2022, and VDL was divested on February 9, 2023 (see Note\n3). Assets meeting the held-for-sale criteria are classified as held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in subsequent periods until sold.\nAssets that meet the held-for-sale criteria are held for sale and reported at the lower of their carrying value or their fair value, less estimated costs to sell. Changes in fair value are\nrecorded as a gain or loss in the results of operations but not to exceed the original carrying value. Due to the asset acquisition accounting on the date of the EHT Acquisition, AVI had\nno initial carrying value.\nDerecognition of Nonfinancial Assets\nThe Company generally accounts for sales of nonfinancial assets that are outside the scope of our ordinary activities under ASC 610-20, Other Income - Gains and Losses from the\nDerecognition of Nonfinancial Assets. Pursuant to ASC 610-20, the Company applies the guidance in ASC 606 to determine if a contract exists, identify the distinct nonfinancial\nassets, and determine when control transfers and, therefore, when to derecognize the nonfinancial asset. Additionally, the Company applies the measurement principles of ASC 606 to\ndetermine the amount of consideration, if any, to include in the calculation of the gain or loss for the sale of the nonfinancial asset. Refer to Note 3 for further information.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023, include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries SKYE Bioscience Australia,\nEHT, AVI, BRB, Ruiyi Acquisition Corporation, and Nemus Sub. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets\nand liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of income and expense during the\nreporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of the Company’s financial statements include\nestimates and judgements used in determining stock based compensation expense and estimates related to the Company's estimation of the percentage of completion under its research\nand development contracts, which are not readily apparent from other sources.\nF-9\nRisks and Uncertainties\nThe Company’s operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to, changes in the general economy, the size and growth of the potential markets\nfor any of the Company’s product candidates, uncertainties related to the current global environment, including economic factors such as inflation, and risks related to the global\nsupply chain disruptions (Note 1), risks related to operating primarily in a virtual environment, results of research and development activities, uncertainties surrounding regulatory\ndevelopments in the United States, Canada, the European Union, and Australia and the Company’s ability to attract new funding.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The carrying values of those investments\napproximate their fair value due to their short maturity and liquidity. Cash includes cash on hand and amounts on deposit with financial institutions, which amounts may at times\nexceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses on such accounts and does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risk.\nDecember 31, 2023, restricted cash on the balance sheet collateralizes an irrevocable letter of credit (Note 13). As of December 31, 2022, restricted cash is a certificate of deposit held\nby the Company’s bank as collateral for the Company’s credit cards.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, net\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives\nof the assets, generally three to five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the improvements or the remaining lease term.\nExpenditures for repairs and maintenance, which do not extend the useful life of the property and equipment, are expensed as incurred. Upon retirement, the asset cost and related\naccumulated depreciation are relieved from the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nFair Value Measurements\nCertain assets and liabilities are carried at fair value under GAAP. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (the “exit\nprice”) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used\nto measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. A fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first\ntwo are considered observable, and the last is considered unobservable, is used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1: Valuations for assets and liabilities traded in active markets from readily available pricing sources such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2: Observable inputs (other than Level 1 quoted prices) such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active for\nidentical or similar assets or liabilities, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to determining the fair value of the assets or liabilities, including pricing\nmodels, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques.\nThe carrying values of the Company’s financial instruments, with the exception of the derivative liabilities, approximate their fair value due to their short maturities. The derivative\nliabilities are valued on a recurring basis utilizing Level 3 inputs (Note 5).\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, net operating loss\ncarryforwards (the “NOLs”) and other tax credit carryforwards. These items are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected\nto reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date. Any interest or penalties would be\nrecorded in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period incurred. When necessary, the Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters\nin income tax expense.\nF-10\nThe Company records a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to the extent that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be\nrealized. In making such determinations, management considers all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future\ntaxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. Due to the substantial doubt related to the Company’s ability to utilize its deferred tax assets, a valuation\nallowance for the full amount of the deferred tax assets has been established at December 31, 2023 and 2022. As a result of this valuation allowance, there are no income tax benefits\nreflected in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations to offset pre-tax losses.\nThe Company recognizes a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions when it is more likely than not (50%) that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of\nany related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.\nConvertible Instruments\nThe Company accounts for hybrid contracts with embedded conversion features in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging Activities (\"ASC 815\") which requires\ncompanies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and account for them as free-standing derivative financial instruments according to certain criteria. The criteria\nincludes circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and\nrisks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise\napplicable GAAP with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be\nconsidered a derivative instrument.\nThe Company accounts for convertible debt instruments with embedded conversion features in accordance with ASC 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (\"ASC 470-\n20\") if it is determined that the conversion feature should not be bifurcated from their host instruments. Under ASC 470-20, the Company records, when necessary, discounts to\nconvertible notes for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in debt instruments based upon the difference between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the\ncommitment date and the embedded effective conversion price. When the Company determines that the embedded conversion option should be bifurcated from its host instrument, the\nembedded feature is accounted for in accordance with ASC 815. Under ASC 815, a portion of the proceeds received upon the issuance of the hybrid contract is allocated to the fair\nvalue of the derivative. The derivative is subsequently recorded at fair value at each reporting date based on current fair value, with the changes in fair value reported in the results of\noperations.\nThe Company also follows ASC 480-10, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (\"ASC 480-10\") when evaluating the accounting for its hybrid instruments. A financial instrument that\nembodies an unconditional obligation, or a financial instrument other than an outstanding share that embodies a conditional obligation, that the issuer must or may settle by issuing a\nvariable number of its equity shares shall be classified as a liability (or an asset in some circumstances) if, at inception, the monetary value of the obligation is based solely or\npredominantly on any one of the following: (a) a fixed monetary amount known at inception (for example, a payable settled with a variable number of the issuer’s equity shares); (b)\nvariations in something other than the fair value of the issuer’s equity shares (for example, a financial instrument indexed to the Standard and Poor’s S&P 500 Index and settled with a\nvariable number of the issuer’s equity shares); or (c) variations inversely related to changes in the fair value of the issuer’s equity shares (for example, a written put option that could\nbe net share settled). Hybrid instruments meeting these criteria are not further evaluated for any embedded derivatives and are carried as a liability at fair value at each balance sheet\ndate with a re-measurement reported in other expense (income), net in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nWhen determining the short-term vs. long-term classification of derivative liabilities, the Company first evaluates the instruments’ exercise provisions. Generally, if a derivative is a\nliability and exercisable within one year, it will be classified as short-term. However, because of the unique provisions and circumstances that may impact the accounting for derivative\ninstruments, the Company carefully evaluates all factors that could potentially restrict the instrument from being exercised or create a situation where exercise would be considered\nremote. The Company re-evaluates its derivative liabilities at each reporting period end and makes updates for any changes in facts and circumstances that may impact classification.\nWarrants Issued in Connection with Financings\nThe Company generally accounts for warrants issued in connection with debt and equity financings as a component of equity, unless the warrants include a conditional obligation to\nissue a variable number of shares or there is a deemed possibility that the Company may need to settle the warrants in cash. For warrants issued with a conditional obligation to issue a\nvariable number of shares or the deemed possibility of a cash settlement, the Company records the fair value of the warrants as a liability at each balance sheet date and records\nchanges in fair value in other expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nF-11\nDebt Issuance Costs and Interest\nDiscounts related to bifurcated derivatives, freestanding instruments issued in bundled transactions, and issuance costs are recorded as a reduction to the carrying value of the debt and\namortized over the life of the debt using the effective interest method. The Company makes changes to the effective interest rate, as necessary, on a prospective basis. For debt\nfacilities that provide for multiple advances, the Company initially defers any issuance costs until the first advance is made and then amortizes the costs over the life of the facility.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company accounts for its collaboration arrangement under the provisions of Accounting Standard Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contract with Customers, or ASC 606. In\naccordance with ASC 606, when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those\ngoods or services, the Company performs the following five steps in determining the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as it fulfills its obligations under such\nagreements:\n• identification of the promised goods and services in the contract;\n• determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract;\n• measurement of the transaction price, including any constraint on variable consideration;\n• allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and\n• recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy each performance obligation.\nIf an agreement includes a license to the Company's intellectual property and that license is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the\narrangement, the Company recognizes revenues allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the customer and the customer is able to use and benefit from the license. For\nlicenses that are bundled with other promises, the Company utilizes judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligations to determine whether the combined\nperformance obligations are satisfied over time or at a point in time. If over time, the Company evaluates the measure of progress over time proportionate to the costs incurred to\nperform the services using an input method as a measure of progress towards satisfying the performance obligation. Any change made to estimated progress towards completion of a\nperformance obligation due to changes in the estimated activities required to complete the performance obligation and, therefore, revenue recognized will be recorded as a change in\nestimate.\nThe Company receives payments from its collaborators based on billing schedules established in each contract. Upfront payments and other payments may require deferral of revenue\nrecognition to a future period until the Company performs its obligation under its collaboration arrangements. Amounts are recorded as accounts receivable when the Company’s right\nto consideration is unconditional.\nResearch and Development Expenses and Licensed Technology\nResearch and development costs are expensed when incurred. These costs may consist of external research and development expenses incurred under agreements with third party\ncontract research organizations and investigative sites; third party manufacturing organizations and consultants; license fees; employee-related expenses, which include salaries and\nbenefits for the personnel involved in the Company’s preclinical; and clinical drug development activities, other expenses and equipment and laboratory supplies.\nCosts incurred for the rights to use licensed technologies in the research and development process, including licensing fees and milestone payments, are charged to research and\ndevelopment expense as incurred in situations where the Company has not identified an alternative future use for the acquired rights, and are capitalized in situations where there is an\nidentified alternative future use. None of the costs associated with the use of licensed technologies has been capitalized to date.\nSimilarly, costs incurred to acquire in-process research and development (\"IPR&D\") are charged to research and development expense in the situation where the Company has not\nidentified an alternative future use and are capitalized in the situation where there is an alternative future use. All costs associated with the acquisition of IPR&D have been expensed\nto date.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nStock-based compensation expense is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award, and the fair value is recognized as expense ratably over the vesting period with\nforfeitures accounted for as they occur.\nF-12\nUpon the exercise of stock option awards, the Company's policy is to issue new shares of its common stock. The Company uses the Black-Scholes valuation method for estimating the\ngrant date fair value of stock options using the following assumptions:\n• Volatility - Stock price volatility is estimated over the expected term based on a blended daily rate of industry peers stock volatility.\n• Expected term - The expected term is based on a simplified method which defines the life as the weighted average of the contractual term of the options and the vesting\nperiod for each award.\n• Risk-free rate - The risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the average market rate on U.S. Treasury securities in effect during the period in\nwhich the awards were granted.\n• Dividends - The dividend yield assumption is based on the Company’s history and expectation of paying no dividends in the foreseeable future.\nAdditionally, the Company uses the Monte Carlo Simulation model to evaluate the derived service period and fair value of awards with market conditions, including assumptions of\nhistorical volatility and risk-free interest rate commensurate with the vesting term.\nLoss Per Common Share\nThe Company applies ASC No. 260, Earnings per Share in calculating its basic and diluted loss per common share. Basic loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss\navailable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted loss per share of common stock is computed by\ngiving effect to all potential common stock equivalents outstanding for the period determined using the treasury stock method. For purposes of this calculation, options to purchase\ncommon stock, restricted stock subject to vesting, restricted stock units, warrants to purchase common stock and common shares underlying convertible debt instruments are\nconsidered to be common stock equivalents. In periods with a reported net loss, such common stock equivalents are excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share of\ncommon stock if their effect is anti-dilutive. For additional information regarding the loss per share (see Note 9).\nLeases\nThe Company applies ASU, No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), in accounting for operating lease arrangements.\nAt the inception of an arrangement, the Company determines whether the arrangement is, or contains, a lease based on the unique facts and circumstances present. Operating lease\nliabilities and their corresponding right-of-use assets are recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the expected lease term. The interest rate implicit in the lease\ncontract is typically not readily determinable. As such, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate, which is the rate incurred to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar\nterm an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. Certain adjustments to the right-of-use asset may be required for items such as initial direct costs paid\nor incentives received.\nLease expense is recognized over the expected term on a straight-line basis. Operating leases are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as operating lease right-of-use assets,\noperating lease liability, current portion and operating lease liability, net of current portion.\nAsset Acquisitions\nThe Company evaluates acquisitions of assets and other similar transactions to assess whether or not the transaction should be accounted for as a business combination or asset\nacquisition by first applying a screen test to determine if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar\nidentifiable assets. If the screen is met, the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition. If the screen is not met, further determination is required as to whether or not the\nCompany has acquired inputs and processes that have the ability to create outputs which would meet the definition of a business. Significant judgment is required in the application of\nthe screen test to determine whether an acquisition is a business combination or an acquisition of assets.\nF-13\nFor asset acquisitions, a cost accumulation model is used to determine the cost of an asset acquisition. Common stock, warrants and options issued as consideration in an asset\nacquisition are generally measured based on the acquisition date fair value of the equity interests issued. The Company refers to ASC 718 and utilizes a Black-Scholes Model to value\nthe options and warrants issued is an asset acquisition and includes the fair value of such awards in the purchase consideration. Direct transaction costs are recognized as part of the\ncost of an asset acquisition. The Company also evaluates which elements of a transaction should be accounted for as a part of an asset acquisition and which should be accounted for\nseparately. Consideration deposited into escrow accounts are evaluated to determine whether it should be included as part of the cost of an asset acquisition or accounted for as\ncontingent consideration. Amounts held in escrow where we have legal title to such balances but where such accounts are not held in the Company's name, are recorded on a gross\nbasis as an asset with a corresponding liability in our consolidated balance sheet. Unless an acquired asset is expensed at the date of acquisition, in accordance with other applicable\nGAAP, the cost of an asset acquisition, including transaction costs, are allocated to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on a relative fair value basis. Goodwill is\nnot recognized in an asset acquisition. Any difference between the cost of an asset acquisition and the fair value of the net assets acquired is allocated to the non-monetary identifiable\nassets based on their relative fair values. However, as of the date of acquisition, if certain assets are carried at fair value under other applicable GAAP the consideration is first\nallocated to those assets with the remainder allocated to the non-monetary identifiable assets based on a relative fair value basis.\nGovernment Assistance\nThe Company adopted ASU 2021-10 Government Assistance on January 1, 2022. The Company accounts for the tax rebates received from the Australian Taxation Office (\"ATO\")\nunder such guidance. The Company accounts for the rebates that it receives under the AusIndustry research and development tax incentive program under the income recognition\nmodel of IAS 20. Under this model, when there is reasonable assurance that the rebate will be received, the Company recognizes the income from the tax rebate as an offset to research\nand development expense during the period which the benefit applies to the research and development costs incurred. The total tax rebates received under the AusIndustry incentive\nprogram were $180,374 for the year ended December 31, 2023 related to incentives earned in the prior year and $34,189 for the year ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31,\n2023 and 2022, the Company has recognized $540,604 and $179,687, respectively, in other current assets in its Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe Company’s reporting currency and the functional currency of its foreign subsidiaries is the United States dollar. The local currencies of its foreign subsidiaries are the Canadian\nDollar (“CAD”) or Australian dollar (“AUD”). Assets and liabilities are remeasured based on the exchange rates at the balance sheet date 0.7549 for the CAD, 0.6818 for the AUD as\nof December 31, 2023 and 0.7384 for the CAD and 0.6792 for the AUD as of December 31, 2022, while expense accounts are remeasured at the weighted average exchange rate for\nthe period 0.7453 for the CAD and 0.6697 for the AUD for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 0.7361for the CAD and 0.6748 for the AUD as of December 31, 2022. Equity\naccounts are remeasured at historical exchange rates. The resulting remeasurement adjustments are recognized in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated financial\nstatements.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded foreign currency remeasurements of $61,767 and $63,717, respectively, which are reflected in general\nand administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nForeign currency gains and losses resulting from transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded foreign currency transaction loss of $9,143 and gain of $3,352, respectively, which is reflected in the general and administrative\nexpenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nThe Company follows ASC 440, Commitments and ASC 450, Contingencies, subtopic 450-20 to report accounting for contingencies and commitments respectively. Certain conditions\nmay exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company, but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to\noccur.\nThe Company assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that\nare pending against the Company or un-asserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or un-asserted claims\nas well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein.\nF-14\nIf the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would\nbe accrued in the Company’s financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but\ncannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, and an estimate of the range of possible losses, if determinable and material, would be disclosed. Loss contingencies\nconsidered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed. Based upon information available at this time,\nmanagement believes that the current litigation matter related to the Cunning lawsuit will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of\noperations and cash flows. Refer to Note 13 for additional information.\nIn accordance with ASC 450, Contingencies, subtopic 450-20, the Company does not reflect a contingency that may result in a gain until it is realized.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Account Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326):\nMeasurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost. This\nASU replaces the existing incurred loss impairment model with an expected loss model. It also eliminates the concept of other-than-temporary impairment and requires credit losses\nrelated to available-for-sale debt securities to be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a reduction in the amortized cost basis of the securities. These changes\nwill result in earlier recognition of credit losses. The amendments in this ASU are effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim\nperiods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 as of January 1, 2023 and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial\nstatements and related disclosures.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. This ASU requires greater disaggregation of information about a reporting entity's\neffective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid. This ASU applies to all entities subject to income taxes and is intended to help investors better understand\nan entity’s exposure to potential changes in jurisdictional tax legislation and assess income tax information that affects cash flow forecasts and capital allocation decisions. This ASU is\neffective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. This ASU should be applied on a prospective basis although retrospective application is\npermitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The amendments in this ASU require\ndisclosures, on an annual and interim basis, of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), as well as the aggregate\namount of other segment items included in the reported measure of segment profit or loss. This ASU requires that a public entity disclose the title and position of the CODM and an\nexplanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. Public entities will be\nrequired to provide all annual disclosures currently required by Topic 280 in interim periods, and entities with a single reportable segment are required to provide all the disclosures\nrequired by the amendments in this ASU and existing segment disclosures in Topic 280. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods\nwithin fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The amendments in this ASU should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in\nthe financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, and does not expect the\nstandard will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity\n(Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity. This ASU amends the guidance on convertible instruments and the derivatives\nscope exception for contracts in an entity’s own equity and improves and amends the related EPS guidance for both Subtopics. The ASU will be effective for annual reporting periods\nbeginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within those annual periods and early adoption is permitted in fiscal periods ending after December 15, 2020. Upon\nimplementation, the Company may use either a modified retrospective or full retrospective method of adoption. The adoption of ASU 2020-06 will, result in expanded disclosures\naround convertible instruments and remove the requirement to assess and record beneficial conversion features. The Company currently plans to adopt the provisions of this ASU on\nthe effective date using a modified retrospective method of adoption.\nF-15\n3. Asset Acquisitions\nBRB Acquisition\nOn August 18, 2023, the Company acquired 100% of Bird Rock Bio Sub, Inc. pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated August 15, 2023. The purpose\nof the acquisition was to acquire BRB's clinical asset, nimacimab, an antibody targeting the CB1 receptor, for development to treat obesity. Pursuant to the BRB Acquisition, the\nCompany issued 3,872,184 shares of Skye common stock to the former preferred shareholders of BRB equal to $20,000,000 in base merger consideration priced at $5.16.\nIn addition, the former preferred shareholders of BRB were entitled to additional merger consideration for each dollar invested in the August 2023 PIPE Financing (Note 7). Because\nthe August 2023 PIPE Financing and BRB Acquisition occurred contemporaneously and in contemplation of each other, in accounting for the transaction, the Company allocated the\nshares issued as additional merger consideration between the BRB Acquisition and PIPE Financing using a residual allocation method, whereby the fair value of the consideration\ntransferred was first allocated to the monetary assets and August 2023 PIPE Financing proceeds with the remainder allocated to the IPR&D asset. As a result, 1,564,194 additional\nshares of common stock were allocated to the BRB Acquisition.\nBelow is a summary of the total consideration, assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in connection with the BRB Acquisition:\nAugust 18, 2023\nPurchase consideration\nCommon stock $ 21,609,586 (a)\nTotal consideration $ 21,609,586\nAssets acquired and liabilities assumed:\nIPR&D asset $ 21,215,214\nCash and cash equivalents 1,076,740\nPrepaid expenses 4,800\nAccounts payable (73,473)\nOther current liabilities (613,695)\nTotal net assets acquired $ 21,609,586\n(a) Equal to the aggregate common shares issued of 5,436,378, multiplied by the Company's closing stock price of $3.975 as of August 18, 2023.\nThe cost to acquire the IPR&D asset related to nimacimab was expensed on the date of the BRB Acquisition as it was determined to have no future alternative use. Accordingly, costs\nassociated with the BRB Acquisition to acquire the asset were expensed as incurred.\nAcquisition of Emerald Health Therapeutics, Inc.\nOn May 11, 2022, the Company entered into an Arrangement Agreement, as amended on June 14, 2022, July 15, 2022 and October 14, 2022 (the “Arrangement Agreement”) with\nEmerald Health Therapeutics, Inc., a corporation existing under the laws of the Province of British Columbia, Canada (“EHT”), pursuant to a plan of arrangement under the Business\nCorporations Act (British Columbia) (the “EHT Acquisition”). On November 10, 2022, the Company completed the EHT Acquisition and each share of EHT common stock\noutstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the EHT Acquisition was transferred to the Company in exchange for 1.95 shares of the Company's common stock (the\n“Exchange Ratio”).\nThe Company evaluated the accounting for the transaction and accounted for the EHT Acquisition as an asset acquisition due to the wind-down state of EHT. The primary purpose of\nthe EHT Acquisition was to utilize EHT's remaining cash and cash equivalents and liquidate the primary real estate asset owned by EHT in order to fund the Company's operations. To\naccount for the Acquisition, the Company measured the equity interests issued on the Closing Date (including the value of the options and warrants rolled over) and accumulated the\ndirect costs attributable to the Acquisition.\nF-16\nUpon closing the EHT Acquisition, the Company acquired net assets with an estimated fair value of $15,045,412. The fair value of the consideration was allocated on a relative fair\nvalue basis to the “qualifying assets” in the EHT Acquisition and any excess in the fair value of the assets initially reduced the value of the qualifying assets before reducing the value\nof the assets held for sale. The only qualifying asset identified in the EHT Acquisition was AVI. The fair value of AVI at the time of Acquisition was $1,536,275 and the value\nattributable to AVI was fully eliminated in the Acquisition accounting . As of December 31, 2023 the Company has divested both of EHT's former operating entities and as of January\n15, 2024, the divestiture of substantially all of EHTs assets, including the real estate held by AVI, is complete.\nUpon the Closing Date of the EHT Acquisition, the Company issued each EHT shareholder 1.95 shares of Skye common stock, for each share of EHT common stock outstanding as of\nthe Closing Date. On November 10, 2022, the Company issued 1,665,083 shares of stock as consideration in the EHT Acquisition and no fractional shares of Skye Common Stock\nwere issued. For U.S. and Canadian federal income tax purposes, the EHT Acquisition constitutes a taxable exchange by the EHT shareholders. In addition, all outstanding stock\noptions and warrants of EHT were exchanged for replacement options and warrants of Skye with identical terms, as adjusted in accordance with the Exchange Ratio.\nBelow is a summary of the total consideration, assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in connection with the Acquisition:\nNovember 10, 2022\nPurchase consideration\nCommon stock $ 9,574,222 (a)\nEHT rollover stock options 105,929 (b)\nEHT rollover warrants 203,515 (c)\nTransaction costs 1,552,490 (d)\nTotal consideration $ 11,436,156\nAssets acquired and liabilities assumed:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 6,784,057\nAccounts receivable 14,375\nPrepaid Expenses 4,227\nAssets held for sale 6,610,662 (e)\nRelated party loan 680,901 (f)\nOther current assets 356,961 (g)\nAccounts payable (909,048)\nShort term liability (557,010) (h)\nPayroll liabilities (577,421)\nInsurance premium loan payable (89,851)\nTax liabilities (158,858)\nOther current liabilities (722,839) (i)\nTotal net assets acquired $ 11,436,156\na. Common Stock, The Company issued 1,665,083 shares of common stock at $5.75 per share for an aggregate fair value of $9,574,222.\nb. EHT Rollover Stock Options, The estimated fair value of options issued as consideration in the EHT Acquisition was $105,929 and 33,132 SKYE options were issued after\napplying the Exchange Ratio. The assumptions to value these options were as follows (see Note 8):\nNovember 10, 2022\nDividend yield 0.00%\nVolatility 76.61 - 126.45%\nRisk-free interest rate 3.51 - 4.56%\nExpected term (years) 0.02 - 4.83\nF-17\nc. EHT Rollover Warrants, The estimated fair value of warrants issued as consideration for the Acquisition was $203,515 and 243,781 SKYE warrants were issued after\napplying the Exchange Ratio.\nThe assumptions used to value these warrants are as follows:\nNovember 10, 2022\nDividend yield 0.00%\nVolatility 102.9-114.6%\nRisk-free interest rate 4.29-4.53%\nExpected term (years) 0.56-2.27\nd. Transaction Costs, The Company incurred aggregate transaction costs of $1,945,140 in connection with the Acquisition, of which $341,629 were expensed, $1,552,490 were\nconsidered part of the transaction consideration and $25,511, represented equity issuance costs, which were included as an offset to equity.\ne. Assets held for sale, The Company acquired assets related to EHT and its subsidiaries which are considered held for held for sale in the amount of $6,610,662. This amount is\nprimarily composed of the following balances:\ni. The adjusted fair value of the VDL assets held for sale of $8,540,732, net of direct liquidation costs of $390,241, which includes legal costs, advisory fees and other\nprofessional fees. In addition, the VDL assets were further reduced by $2,072,981 as a result of the relative fair value allocation. The resulting carrying value of the\nasset recorded by the Company is $6,467,751.\nii. The Company acquired deposits related to utilities for EHT's subsidiaries held for sale. The fair value of these deposits at the time of acquisition is $23,910.\niii. The Company has acquired the value of EHTC's Health Canada license which was transferred with the sale of EHTC (See Divestiture of Emerald Health\nTherapeutics Canada, Inc. below). The value of the license at the time of the acquisition was $91,700.\niv. The Company acquired prepaid expenses related to entities held for sale of $27,301.\nf. Related party loan, on October 17, 2022, the Company and EHT entered into a loan agreement pursuant to which EHT loaned the Company $700,000 in accordance with the\nterms of a promissory note. Upon closing the Acquisition, the loan was offset by the balance due to Skye under the consulting agreement. The net related party loan balance\nwas $680,901 as of the closing of the Acquisition. After the closing of the EHT Acquisition, this balance eliminates in consolidation.\ng. Other current assets, The Company acquired other current assets related to EHT and its subsidiaries which are considered held for held for sale in the amount of $356,961.\nThis amount is primarily composed of the following balances:\ni. The Company acquired deposits related to EHT's excise tax bonds of $252,418. As a condition of the EHTC and VDL stock purchase agreements it is expected that\nthe cash value of these bonds will be received upon transfer of the Health Canada licenses to the purchasers of EHTC and VDL.\nii. The Company acquired an open receivables balance of $104,543 made up of a balance due from the buyer of VDL, a former customer of EHT's of $75,396.\nAdditionally, this balance includes a property tax refund due of $29,147.\nh. Short-term liability EHT received an upfront deposit of $557,010 for the sale of VDL,\ni. Other current liabilities, The Company acquired liabilities related to EHT and its subsidiaries which are considered in the amount of $722,839. This amount is primarily\ncomposed of the following balances:\ni. The Company acquired an outstanding accrued liabilities balance of $587,139. The majority of the balance includes estimated late fees related to late tax filings.\nii. In accordance with ASC 450, the Company has recorded a contingent liability related credits due to customers of EHT's former operations. At the time of the EHT\nAcquisition, this liability was estimated at $135,700.\nF-18\nDivestiture of Emerald Health Therapeutics Canada, Inc.\nOn December 28, 2022, approximately six weeks after the EHT Acquisition, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) with a third-party whereby the Company\ntransferred all of its outstanding and fully paid, non-assessable 11,776,338 shares of common stock (the \"EHTC Common Shares\"), all of which were held by EHT with no par value,\nfor the total purchase price of $110,759. The purchase price also includes the transfer of two licenses issued by Health Canada. EHTC was classified as an asset acquisition and did not\nmeet the criteria of a business at the of EHT Acquisition, and was considered held for sale at the time of EHT Acquisition. Therefore, the sale of EHTC is determined to be treated as\nthe sale of an asset to a third-party due to the discontinued state of the business at the date of divestment. No gain or loss related to the divestiture of EHTC was recorded.\nDivestiture of VDL\nOn November 10, 2022, EHT and C3, a third-party, entered into the Verdélite SPA, as amended, effective November 8, 2022, pursuant to which C3 would acquire all of the\noutstanding shares of VDL, the holder of EHT's most significant real estate asset.\nOn February 9, 2023, upon closing the transactions contemplated by the Verdélite SPA, the Company sold all of the outstanding shares of VDL for an aggregate purchase price of\napproximately $9,451,233. Prior to closing the EHT Acquisition, EHT received a $557,705 cash deposit, which was considered in the sale as of the closing date. Upon closing, the\nCompany received gross proceeds, net of legal and advisory fees as of the closing date, of $5,532,266. The remainder of the purchase price will be paid as follows: (i) $370,350 will be\npayable in five (5) equal monthly installments payable on the last day of each month beginning on December 31, 2023, and ending April 30, 2024, with interest in accordance with the\nterms of the Verdélite SPA and (ii) $2,777,625 will be payable in three (3) equal installments on each of the 18-month, 30-month, and 42-month anniversaries of the VDL Closing\nDate, with interest in accordance with the terms of the Verdélite SPA.

Refer to Note 6 for further information on the Amendment Agreement.\nF-21\nThe Company accounted for the repricing of the warrants as a modification by comparing the fair value of the warrants immediately before and after the modification date to determine\nthe incremental fair value of the repricing. The aggregate modified fair value of $150,851 resulted in an increase in fair value of $120,228. The Company recorded the incremental fair\nvalue as a finance charge to other expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2023. On the date of modification, the Company revalued the\nwarrants with a Black-Scholes valuation method using the following assumptions as of the repricing date:\nNovember 17, 2022\nDividend yield 0.00%\nVolatility factor 97.53 - 115.96%\nRisk-free interest rate 4.40 - 4.67%\nExpected term (years) 0.96 - 2.12\nUnderlying common stock price $4.25\nEHT Rollover Warrants\nOn November 10, 2022, the Company issued equity classified replacement warrants with a fair value of $203,515 in exchange for all outstanding warrants of EHT adjusted in\naccordance with the Exchange Ratio.

Refer to Note 8 for the summary of stock-based compensation expense.\nAs of the date of grant, the Company valued the warrants with a Black-Scholes valuation method using the following assumptions:\nApril 1, 2022 Date of\nIssuance\nDividend yield 0.00 %\nVolatility factor 118.46 %\nRisk-free interest rate 1.92 %\nExpected term (years) 1.27\nUnderlying common stock price $ 9.25\nDerivative Liability\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the warrant shares underlying the Emerald Financing Warrant Liability expired unexercised and the decrease in fair value during the year\nended December 31, 2023 was nominal.\nThe following table summarizes the activity of the derivative liability for the period indicated:\nYear Ended December 31, 2022\nDecember 31, Fair Value of Change in December 31,\n2021 , Fair Value of Derivative Fair value of Reclassification of 2022, Fair Value of\nDerivative Liabilities Liabilities Issued Liability Derivatives to Equity Derivative Liabilitiy\nEmerald Financing - warrant liability 59,732 — (59,729) — 3\nTotal derivative liability $ 59,732 $ — $ (59,729) $ — $ 3\nEmerald Financing Warrant Liability\nThe Emerald Financing Warrants were issued during 2018 in connection with the Emerald Financing, and originally contained a price protection feature. In connection with the August\n2020 Financing, the exercise price was permanently set to $25.00. The warrants contain a contingent put option if the Company undergoes a subsequent financing that results in a\nchange in control. The warrant holders also have the right to participate in subsequent financing transactions on an as-if converted basis.\nF-22\nThe Company reviewed the warrants for liability or equity classification under the guidance of ASC 480-10, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, and concluded that the warrants\nshould be classified as a liability and re-measured to fair value at the end of each reporting period. The Company also reviewed the warrants under ASC 815, Derivatives and\nHedging/Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity, and determined that the warrants also meet the definition of a derivative. With the assistance of a third party valuation specialist, the\nCompany valued the warrant liabilities utilizing the Monte Carlo valuation method pursuant to the accounting guidance of ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurements. Beginning March\n31, 2021, the Company changed its valuation model for the Emerald Financing Warrant Liability to a Black-Scholes valuation method, as it was determined that a more simplistic\nmodel such as the Black-Scholes valuation method yields a substantially similar result as a Monte Carlo simulation due to the Company's current assumptions.\nThe warrant liability is valued at the balance sheet dates using the following assumptions:\nDecember, 31, 2022\nDividend yield — %\nVolatility factor 140.83 %\nRisk-free interest rate 4.21 %\nExpected term (years) 1.13\nUnderlying common stock price $ 4.00\n6.

The Convertible Note bears interest at a rate of 10% per annum and matures on August 18, 2024, unless earlier repurchased or converted. The Convertible\nNote may be converted at any time and the conversion price is fixed at $5.16. Accrued interest will be payable quarterly within 30 days of the last day of each calendar quarter. The\nCompany may prepay the principal or interest outstanding under the Note at any time without penalty.\nIn accounting for the Convertible Note, the Company allocated $4,068,424 in proceeds to the debt host and $931,576 in proceeds to the freestanding warrants based on relative fair\nvalue. The debt discounts of $931,576 and $26,316 related to the warrants, and debt issuance costs, respectively, are being amortized over the term of the Convertible Note using the\neffective interest rate method. Amortization of the debt discount is recognized as non-cash interest expense in Other expense within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In\naddition, the Company recorded $6,026 in equity issuance costs as a deduction to additional paid in capital in the Statements of Stockholders' Deficit.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the effective interest rate on the Convertible Note was 31.39%, the remaining amortization period on the debt was 0.63 years and the fair value\nof the underlying conversion shares did not exceed the carrying value of the debt at December 31, 2023.\nF-23\nBridge Loan\nOn July 24, 2023, the Company entered into a loan agreement in the principal amount of $250,000 (the “Bridge Loan”) with MFDI, LLC.

Concurrent with the closing of the BRB Acquisition, August 2023 PIPE Financing\nand Convertible Note Financing, the Bridge Loan was cancelled and converted into an investment in the August 2023 PIPE Financing (Note 7). All interest and rights related to the\nBridge Loan were concurrently cancelled.\nMulti-Draw Credit Agreement- Related Party\nOn October 5, 2018, the Company entered into the Credit Agreement with Sciences, a related party (Note 12).

In addition, the Amended Credit Agreement was\namended to extend the maturity date to the earlier of December 30, 2022, or the Termination Date (as such term is defined in the Credit Agreement) and the parties agreed to use good\nfaith efforts to enter into a customary piggyback registration rights agreement. In exchange for the extension, the Company agreed to reprice all of the outstanding Sciences warrants to\n$4.25 per share (Note 5).\nOn December 30, 2022, the Company entered into Amendment No. 5 to the Amended Credit Agreement to extend the maturity date to the earlier of (a) five business days after the\nclosing of the sale of VDL (b) February 28, 2023 or (c) the Termination Date (as such term is defined in the Amended Credit Agreement). The terms of the Amended Credit Agreement\nprovided that convertible advances and unpaid interest may be converted into common stock at the applicable fixed conversion price of the underlying advance, subject to customary\nadjustments for stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations, etc. Effective February 16, 2022, upon entering the MTA, the remaining principal balance plus accrued interest was\noffset by the aggregate exercise price of $282,906 from the exercise of the MTA Warrants (Note 5) and the Company induced conversion by reducing the conversion price of the\nAmended Credit Agreement from $100.00 to $9.65. The remaining balance of $1,597,236 was converted into 165,517 shares of common stock of the Company. In connection with the\ninduced conversion, the Company recorded a debt conversion inducement expense of $1,383,285 equal to the fair value of the incremental shares issued upon conversion.\nFollowing the issuance of shares described above, the Amended Credit Agreement was terminated in its entirety per the terms of the MTA.

The August 2023 PIPE Financing was priced at $5.16 per share\nbased on the 60-day volume-weighted average share price preceding August 15, 2023. The two lead investors in the PIPE Financing were also former preferred shareholders of BRB.\nAs an incentive to participate in the August 2023 PIPE Financing, the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization with BRB entitled each BRB stockholder participating in the\nAugust 2023 PIPE Financing an additional share of common stock for every share of common stock purchased in the PIPE Financing. As a result, the two former BRB preferred\nshareholders who participated in the August 2023 PIPE Financing were issued an additional 2,228,638 shares of common stock.

The shares were issued in conjunction with the MTA, in exchange for\nthe remaining principal balance plus accrued interest less the aggregate exercise price of $282,905 from the exercise of the MTA Warrants in the amount of $1,597,236 at a conversion\nprice of $9.65 (Note 6).\nRestricted Stock Units Released\nOn December 14, 2023, the Company released 5,333 restricted stock units that had vested to executives of the Company (Note 8).\nOn December 14, 2022, the Company released 5,333 restricted stock units that had vested to executives of the Company (Note 8).\n8.

The RSUs cliff vest 33% per year on the anniversary of the grant date\nover a three year period.\nOn August 25, 2023, the Company granted RSUs to its executive management team and to certain members of the Board with market and performance based conditions. The RSUs\nare eligible to vest subject to the achievement and attainment of certain market capitalization target goals (market-based conditions) or the achievement of a successful exit (a\nperformance-based condition); provided, however, that no RSUs shall vest until the Compensation Committee of the Board determines that shares can be sold into the market to cover\nwithholding tax obligations associated with the vesting of the RSUs.\nF-28\nThe following is a summary of restricted stock unit activity during the year ended December 31, 2023:\nWeighted Average\nNumber of Grant Date Fair\nShares Value\nUnvested, December 31, 2022 10,665 $ 14.43\nGranted 842,445 3.59\nReleased (5,333) 14.43\nUnvested, December 31, 2023 847,777 $ 3.66\nThe Company used the Monte Carlo Simulation model to evaluate the derived service period and fair value of awards with market and performance conditions, including assumptions\nof historical volatility and risk-free interest rate commensurate with the vesting term.\nThe fair value of the Company's performance-based RSUs were estimated on the date of grant under the following assumptions:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023\nDividend yield 0.00%\nVolatility factor 87.4- 87.9%\nRisk-free interest rate 4.21- 4.54%\nDerived service periods (years) 0.81 - 3.11\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, the first three market based conditions of the RSUs were met.\nAwards Granted Outside the 2014 Amended and Restated Plan\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company granted shares of common stock to a non-employee consultant for investor relations services. Half of the shares were issued\nupon entering each service contract and the remaining half will be issued on October 31, 2024, unless the agreement is earlier terminated.\nThe following is a summary of restricted stock activity outside of the 2014 Amended and Restated Plan during the year ended December 31, 2023:\nWeighted Average\nGrant Date Fair\nNumber of Shares Value\nUnvested, December 31, 2022 — $ —\nGranted 10,000 1.55\nReleased (5,000) —\n*Unvested, December 31, 2023 5,000 $ 1.55\nF-29\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nThe Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense using the straight-line method over the requisite service period.

This amount will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 7.19 years.\n2022 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nIn June 2022, the Company's board of directors approved the 2022 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the \"ESPP\"). Under which the Company will offer eligible employees the option to\npurchase common stock at a 15% discount to the lower of the market value of the stock at the beginning or end of each participation period under the terms of the ESPP. Total\nindividual purchases in any year are limited to 15% of compensation. The ESPP was approved by the Company's stockholders on September 30, 2022. As of December 31, 2023, no\nshares were issued under the ESPP.\n9. Loss Per Share of Common Stock\nThe following tables are a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators used in the calculation of basic and diluted net loss per share computations:\nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2023\nLoss (Numerator) Shares (Denominator) Per-Share Amount\nNet loss $ (37,644,784)\nBasic EPS and diluted EPS\nNet loss available to common stockholders (37,644,784) 7,006,038 $ (5.37)\nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2022\nIncome (Numerator) Shares (Denominator) Per-Share Amount\nNet loss $ (19,481,602)\nBasic EPS and diluted EPS\nNet loss available to common stockholders (19,481,602) 2,221,080 $ (8.77)\nF-30\nThe following outstanding shares of common stock equivalents were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share of common stock for the periods presented because\nincluding them would have been anti-dilutive:\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nStock options 498,298 171,980\nUnvested restricted stock units 847,777 10,665\nUnvested restricted stock (service provider) 5,000 —\nCommon shares underlying convertible debt 968,973 18,642\nWarrants 3,280,940 788,539\nTotal 5,600,988 989,826\n10. Income Taxes\nThe components of loss before the income tax provision consist of the following:\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nUnited States $ (25,799,330) $ (18,801,570)\nForeign (11,841,854) (673,291)\nPre-tax loss and comprehensive loss from operations $ (37,641,184) $ (19,474,861)\nThe components of the income tax expense consisted of the following:\nYear Ended December 31,\nCurrent income tax expense 2023 2022\nFederal $ — $ —\nState 3,600 6,741\nForeign — —\nTotal current income tax expense $ 3,600 $ 6,741\nThe Company is subject to taxation in the United States, various states, Australia, and Canada. The Company’s tax years for 2020 (federal), 2019 (States), 2019 (Australia) and 2019\n(Canada) and forward are subject to examination by the United States, state, Australian, and Canadian tax authorities. However, to the extent allowed by law, the taxing authorities may\nhave the right to examine periods where NOLs and credits were generated and carried forward and make adjustments up to the amount of the NOL and credit carryforwards. The\nCompany is not currently under examination by any jurisdiction.\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company had federal and state NOLs aggregating $110,288,344 and $113,806,359, respectively. If not used, $46,622,953 of Federal NOLs and\n$113,678,291 of state NOLs will begin to expire in 2031, $63,665,391 of federal NOLs and $128,068 of state NOLs will carry forward indefinitely subject to an 80% limitation against\ntaxable income. At December 31, 2023, the Company had Australia NOLs aggregating $233,321 which do not expire and $43,762,031 of Canadian NOLS which begin to expire in\n2024.\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company had Canadian capital loss carryforwards of approximately $64,743,505 which may be carried forward indefinitely.\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company had federal and California research credit carryforwards of $3,480,111 and $2,073,709, respectively. The federal research credit carry forwards\nwill begin to expire in 2027, unless previously utilized. The California research credits will carry forward indefinitely. The Company’s NOLs and research credit carryforwards are\nsubject to a reserve. Additionally, the Company had Canadian SR&ED credits as of December 31, 2023 of $940,180 which may be carried forward indefinitely.\nF-31\nUtilization of the domestic NOL's and research credits could be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations that may have occurred, or that could\noccur in the future, as required by Section 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), as well as similar state provisions. These ownership changes\nmay limit the amount of NOLs and credits that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and tax, respectively. In general, an “ownership change” as defined by Section\n382 of the Code, results from a transaction or series of transactions over a three-year period resulting in an ownership change of more than 50 percentage points of the outstanding\nstock of a company by certain stockholders.\nUpon the occurrence of an ownership change under Section 382 as outlined above, utilization of the NOLs and credits are subject to an annual limitation under Section 382 of the\nCode, which is determined by first multiplying the value of the Company’s stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long-term, tax-exempt rate, and then could be\nsubject to additional adjustments, as required. Any limitation may result in expiration of a portion of the NOLs and credits before utilization. While the Company has not performed a\nSection 382 study, multiple ownership changes may have already occurred as the Company raised capital through the issuance of stock. However, due to the existence of the valuation\nallowance for deferred tax assets, any potential change in ownership will not impact the Company’s effective tax rate.\nThe tax effects of temporary differences and carryforwards that give rise to significant portions of the deferred income tax assets are as follows:\nAs of December 31,\nCurrent deferred tax assets and (liabilities): 2023 2022\nNet operating loss $ 40,900,348 $ 30,648,168\nCapital loss carryforwards 17,157,029 8,824,896\nContingent legal accrual 1,320,526 1,306,098\nDepreciation 663,197 286,452\nAmortization 225,678 216,077\nResearch and development credits 3,694,501 1,199,256\nCapitalized research and development costs 1,835,326 1,000,777\nLease liability 51,086 16,565\nState taxes 777 756\nOther 663,067 473,429\nGross deferred tax assets 66,511,533 43,972,473\nValuation allowance (66,461,557) (43,957,489)\nNet deferred tax assets $ 49,976 $ 14,984\nDeferred tax liabilities\nRight-of-use asset $ (49,976) $ (14,984)\nTotal deferred tax liabilities (49,976) (14,984)\nNet deferred tax assets $ — $ —\nF-32\nThe provision for income taxes on earnings subject to income taxes differs from the statutory Federal rate at December 31, 2023 and 2022, due to the following:\nAs of December 31,\n2023 2022\nExpected income tax benefit at federal statutory tax rate $ (7,904,649) $ (4,089,720)\nState income taxes, net of federal benefit (847,810) (749,744)\nChange in fair value of warrants — (76,672)\nChange in valuation allowance 3,167,507 (892,837)\nUncertain tax positions 1,008,482 884,911\nReduction in deferreds upon divestiture — 4,974,768\nNon-deductible interest — 35,624\nStock compensation 100,958 69,754\nResearch and development credits (315,498) (281,709)\nRate adjustment 6,042 (3,568)\nForeign rate differential (1,918,633) 14,934\nDivestiture of VDL 2,269,297 —\nIn process research and development 4,455,195 —\nOther (17,293) 121,000\nProvision for income taxes $ 3,600 $ 6,741\nThe Company records a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to the extent that it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of, the deferred tax assets will not be\nrealized. Due to the the substantial doubt related to the Company's ability to utilize its deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance for the full amount of the deferred tax assets has been\nestablished at December 31, 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the valuation allowance increased by $22,504,068.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 subjects a U.S. shareholder to tax on global intangible low-taxed income (\"GILTI\") earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. The FASB Staff Q&A,\nTopic 740, No. 5, Accounting for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income, states that an entity can make an accounting policy election to recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis\ndifferences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or to provide for the tax expense related to GILTI in the year the tax is incurred as a period expense only. The Company elects\nto provide for the tax expense related to GILTI in the year the tax is incurred as a period expense only.\nUnder the FASB’s accounting guidance related to income tax positions, among other things, the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be\nrecognized at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it\nhas less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. Additionally, the guidance provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods,\ndisclosure and transition.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax positions are as follows:\nAs of December 31,\n2023 2022\nUnrecognized tax positions, beginning of the year $ 2,872,020 $ 1,784,626\nGross increase - current period tax positions 1,243,191 1,087,413\nGross increase - prior period tax positions 2,316,932 —\nGross decrease – prior period tax positions — (19)\nUnrecognized tax positions, end of year $ 6,432,143 $ 2,872,020\nIf recognized, none of the unrecognized tax positions would impact the Company’s income tax benefit or effective tax rate as long as the Company’s net deferred tax assets remain\nsubject to a full valuation allowance. The Company does not expect any significant increases or decreases to the Company’s unrecognized tax positions within the next twelve months.\nThe Company had no accrual for interest or penalties on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2023 and 2022 and has not recognized interest and/or penalties\nin the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years then ended.\nF-33\n11. Licensed Intellectual Property\nUM 5050\nThe Company in-licenses the intellectual property used in its glaucoma product, SBI-100 OE, from the University of Mississippi under an \"all fields of use\" license. The license grants\nthe Company an exclusive, perpetual license, including, with the prior written consent of UM, not to be unreasonably withheld, the right to sublicense.\nThe License Agreement provides for an annual maintenance fee of $75,000 payable on the anniversary of the effective date. The remaining milestone payments under the license are as\nfollows:\ni) $200,000 paid within 30 days following the first submission of an Investigational New Drug Application (\"NDA\") , or an equivalent application to a regulatory agency anywhere\nin the world, for each product that is administered in a different route of administration from that of the early submitted product(s); and\nii) $400,000 paid within 30 days following the approval of an NDA, or an equivalent application to a regulatory agency anywhere in the world, for each product that is administered\nin a different route of administration from that of the early approved product(s).\nThe royalty percentage due on net sales under each License Agreement is in the mid-single digits. The Company must also pay to UM a portion of all licensing fees received from any\nsublicensees, subject to a minimum royalty on net sales, and the Company is required to reimburse patent costs incurred by UM related to the licensed products. The royalty\nobligations apply by country and by licensed product, and end upon the later of the date that no valid claim of a licensed patent covers a licensed product in a given country, or ten\nyears after the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country.\nEach License Agreement continues, unless terminated, until the later of the expiration of the last to expire of the patents or patent applications within the licensed technology or the\nexpiration of the Company’s payment obligations under such License Agreement.\nIn July 2022, the Company paid $100,000 upon submitting its Investigational New Drug Application to the Food and Drug Administration for authorization to conduct the Company's\nPhase 1 trial of SBI-100 OE to the Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia.\nUM 5070 and 8930 License Agreements\nUntil January 8, 2022 and January 30, 2024, the Company licensed UM 5070 and UM 8930, respectively. Under these agreements, the Company was required to pay annual\nmaintenance fees and certain milestones. However, after further evaluation, both licenses were terminated.\nTautomer Exclusive License Agreement\nOn November 30, 2023, the Company provided Tautomer Bioscience, (Pty) Limited (“Tautomer”). with an exclusive license to develop and commercialize SBI-100 as a novel\nsuppository formulation in the territory of the countries of the continent of Africa for chronic intractable pain and other indications in South Africa and the rest of Africa (the\n\"Territory\"). Under the terms of the agreement, Tautomer is responsible for all formulation, preclinical and clinical development, drug product manufacturing and regulatory costs. The\nCompany is entitled to receive from Tautomer milestone payments upon achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial events of up to $11,350,000 and tiered\ndouble-digit royalties on net product sales in the Territory. Additionally, the Company will be paid cost plus 20% mark-up for all development work, including the supply of SBI-100.\nWe have retained certain rights and options to obtain rights to the future use of new jointly developed intellectual property and other intellectual property owned or controlled by\nTautomer related to SBI-100.\n12. Related Party Matters\nEmerald Health Sciences\nIn January 2018, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with Sciences pursuant to which Sciences purchased a majority of the equity interest in the Company,\nresulting in a change in control (the \"Emerald Financing\"). While Sciences no longer maintains a controlling interest in the Company, MFDI has significant influence over Sciences\nand has been issued the Convertible Note from the Company (Note 6) and participated in the August 2023 PIPE Financing (Note 7). As of December 31, 2023, the Amended Credit\nAgreement has been extinguished and all of the warrants held by Sciences were exercised pursuant to the MTA (Notes 5 & 6).\nF-34\nOn May 18, 2022, Jim Heppell resigned from the Company's board of directors and concurrently entered into a consulting agreement with the Company pursuant to which Mr. Heppell\nwill provide services mutually agreed upon by the Company. The consulting agreement has an initial minimum term of one-year and will be automatically renewed for a one-year\nperiod on the anniversary of the contract unless terminated with 60 days' notice. Under the consulting agreement, Mr. Heppell is entitled to a monthly fee of $6,300, which was\nincreased to $16,600 per month upon the closing of the EHT Acquisition.

In addition, Mr. Heppell was\nawarded 16,000 stock options which are subject to certain performance and other conditions. On February 9, 2023, the Company provided notice and terminated the consulting\nagreement with Mr. Heppell effective March 11, 2023 and effective March 10, 2023, Mr. Heppell was removed from the Board of Sciences and no longer serves as Sciences CEO.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the first tranche of stock options issued to Mr. Heppell were cancelled, unexercised, and the second tranche of stock options were cancelled\nupon the closing of the Verdélite SPA.\nThe Company accounted for the consulting contract as an in-substance severance arrangement. During the year ended December 31, 2023, no severance expense was recognized. The\nCompany recognized $139,615 in severance expense during the year ended December 31, 2022. The accrual for Mr. Heppell's severance was adjusted to include the increased fee\npayments when the Company closed the EHT Acquisition.

The Company will\nhave the right to use all data, products, and information, including intellectual property, which are generated in the performance of the research under each and all projects funded by\nthe Company pursuant to the ESRA. VivaCell assigns and agrees to assign to the Company all rights to any intellectual property created or reduced-to-practice under or as a part of a\nproject funded by the Company pursuant to the ESRA.\nThe Company has agreed to pay to VivaCell a royalty based on any and all licensing revenue or other consideration paid to the Company by a third-party licensee, assignee or\npurchaser of intellectual property rights created under the ESRA. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company incurred $50,000 and $200,000, respectively, in\nresearch and development expenses related to the retainer under the ESRA.

Commitments and Contingencies\nOffice Lease\nThe Company leases office space for its corporate headquarters, located at 11250 El Camino Real, Suite 100 San Diego, California 92130. The original lease term was effective from\nSeptember 1, 2021 through October 31, 2023 and contained a renewal option for a two-year extension after the current expiration date. At the commencement date, the Company did\nnot expect to exercise the renewal option, and has therefore excluded the option from the calculation of the right of use asset and lease liability. The lease provides for two months of\nrent abatement and the initial monthly rent is $8,067 per month with annual increases of 3% commencing on November 1, 2022. The lease included non-lease components (i.e.,\nproperty management costs) that are paid separately from rent, based on actual costs incurred, and therefore were not included in the right-of-use asset and lease liability but are\nreflected as an expense in the period incurred. In calculating the present value of the lease payments, the Company has elected to utilize its incremental borrowing rate based on the\nlease term.\nThe Company entered into an amended and restated lease agreement on June 27, 2023 for its corporate headquarters, extending the lease term to 36 months, retroactive to September\n1, 2021 through October 31, 2026. The Company treated the amended and restated lease agreement as a single modified lease.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, lease expense comprised of $97,986 and $90,701, respectively in lease cost from the Company's non-cancellable operating lease.\nThe remaining lease term and discount rate related to the operating lease are presented in the following table:\nDecember 31, 2023\nWeighted-average remaining term – operating lease (in years) 2.83\nWeighted-average discount rate – operating lease 15 %\nFuture minimum lease payments as of December 31, 2023 are presented in the following table:\nYear:\n2024 103,216\n2025 106,313\n2026 90,798\nTotal future minimum lease payments: 300,327\nLess imputed interest (57,059)\nTotal $ 243,268\nReported as:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nOperating lease liability $ 72,038 $ 78,700\nOperating lease liability, net of current portion 171,230 —\nTotal lease liability $ 243,268 $ 78,700\nGeneral Litigation and Disputes\nFrom time to time, in the normal course of operations, the Company may be a party to litigation and other dispute matters and claims. Litigation can be expensive and disruptive to\nnormal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict. An unfavorable outcome to any legal matter, if material, could have a materially\nadverse effect on the Company’s operations or financial position, liquidity or results of operations.\nF-36\nWendy Cunning vs Skye Bioscience, Inc.\nThe Company is a party to a legal proceeding with a former employee alleging, among other things, wrongful termination, violation of whistleblower protections under the Sarbanes-\nOxley Act of 2002, and retaliation under California law against the Company relating to certain actions and events that occurred with the Company's former management during the\nemployee's employment term from March 2018 to July 2019. The case, entitled Wendy Cunning vs Skye Bioscience, Inc., was filed in U.S. District Court (the \"District Court\") for the\nCentral District of California (the “Cunning Lawsuit”). On January 18, 2023, a jury rendered a verdict in favor of Ms. Cunning and awarded her $512,500 in economic damages (e.g.,\nlost earnings, future earnings and interest), $840,960 in non-economic damages (e.g., emotional distress) and $3,500,000 in punitive damages. On February 13, 2023, the Company\nreceived the final judgment on the special verdict (the \"Final Judgment\") from the District Court.\nOn August 2, 2023, the District Court ruled on the plaintiff's motion for attorney fees and awarded the plaintiff $1,200,008. Based on this order, the Company reduced the aggregate\nestimate for the legal contingency by $151,842, the difference between the attorney fees awarded by the District Court and the Company's previous estimate.\nImmediately prior to the closing of the PIPE Financing, on August 17, 2023, the Company obtained a stay on enforcement of the judgment in the Cunning Lawsuit by posting an\nappeal bond in the amount of $9,080,202.\nOn October 19, 2023, the Company received the final orders from the District Court denying the post-trial motions that the Company filed with the District Court in March 2023\nseeking judgment as a matter of law, a new trial, and/or a reduction of the judgment. Additionally, in March of 2023, the Company appealed the judgment in the Cunning Lawsuit with\nthe Ninth District Court of Appeals, which is moving forward now that the District Court has ruled on the post-trial motions. In March 2024, the Company filed the opening brief for\nthe appeal with the Ninth District Court of Appeals.\nThe Company strongly believes that this case was incorrectly decided as to liability, the amount of compensatory damages, and the appropriateness and amount of punitive damages.\nThe Company is challenging the verdict in the Ninth District Court of Appeals and is pursuing reimbursement under its existing insurance policies, but given the jury verdict, the\nCompany has determined that a loss is probable and accordingly have recorded a legal contingency expense and a current balance sheet liability for the total amount of the jury verdict.\nThe Company has recorded an aggregate estimate for the legal contingency of $6,053,468 plus accrued interest of $234,750 at an annual interest rate of 4.87% on the judgment and\n5.38% on the legal fees, which is determined by the Superior Court of California. Depending on the judge's final order on the post-trial motions and appeal, it is reasonably possible\nthat the legal contingency booked could materially change after the issuance of these financials.\nSkye Bioscience, Inc. vs Partner Re Ireland Insurance\nIn February 2023, the Company brought a suit against the Company's D&O carrier, Partner Re Ireland Insurance DAC (\"Partner Re\"), bringing claims for (a) breach of contract, (2)\ntortious breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and (3) declaratory relief that Partner Re is obligated to reimburse the Company for the defense fees and costs\nincurred in defense of the Cunning Lawsuit and must indemnify the Company for any settlement or judgment in the Cunning Lawsuit. The Company's allegations arise out of Partner\nRe's refusal to reimburse the Company for costs incurred by the Company in defending the Cunning Lawsuit. The case, entitled Skye Bioscience, Inc., v. Partner Re Ireland Insurance\nDAC, was filed in the United Stated District Court for the Central District of California.\nOn April 17, 2023, Partner Re filed a motion to dismiss the Company's complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). On June 20, 2023, the judge issued a final\nruling in favor of the Company and denied Partner Re's motion to dismiss the Company's lawsuit. In its ruling, the Court rejected Partner Re's primary basis for denying coverage.\nBased on the outcome, the Company is pursuing up to $5,000,000 in coverage less the deductible to cover legal expenses incurred and the final verdict or settlement of the Cunning\nLawsuit.\n14. Subsequent Events\nSale of Real Estate Held by AVI\nOn January 15, 2024, the Company closed the sale of the real estate held by AVI, which comprised of substantially all of AVI's assets.. The real estate and related equipment was sold\nto Tab Labs, Inc. for an aggregate purchase price of $1,139,572.\nF-37\nPIPE Financings\nJanuary 2024 PIPE Financing\nOn January 29, 2024, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which on January 31, 2023, the Company issued an aggregate of 11,713,664 shares of\ncommon stock and 9,978,739 pre-fund warrants to purchase up to 9,978,739 shares of common stock (the \"January 2024 PIPE Financing\") for an aggregate purchase price of\n$49,991,010. The January 2024 PIPE Financing was priced at $2.31 per common share and per $2.30 pre-funded warrant based on the 5-day average share price preceding January 29,\n2024.

The RSUs vest on the following milestones: (i) 25%\nvests upon achieving a market cap of $750,000,000 and a stock price of $20.00 per share, (ii) 25% vests upon achieving a market cap of $1,000,000,000 and a stock price of $30.00\nper share, (iii) 25% vests upon achieving a market cap of $1,250,000,000 and a stock price of $32.50 per share, and (iv) 25% vest upon achieving a market cap of $1,500,000,000 or\ngreater and a stock price of $35.00 per share; provided, however, that no RSUs shall vest until the compensation committee of the Company determines that shares can be sold into the\nmarket to cover withholding tax obligations associated with the vesting of the RSUs. Upon a change in control of the Issuer, 100% of the RSUs will become fully vested.\nOn February 29, 2024, the Company granted certain employees and directors 703,100 stock options to buy shares of the Company's common stock with and exercise price of $14.56.\nOf the aggregate grant, 250,000 shares will vest over a 1 year period and 488,100 shares will vest over a 4-year period.\nF-38\nThe following exhibits are filed with this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nExhibit Number Description of Exhibit\n2.1 Arrangement Agreement, dated May 11, 2022, by and between the Company and EHT (incorporated by reference to Exhibit 2.1 to our Current Report on\nForm 8-K filed on May 11, 2022)\n2.2 Amendment No. 1 to the Arrangement Agreement, dated June 14, 2022, by and between the Company and EHT (incorporated by reference to Exhibit\n10.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on June 17, 2022)\n2.3 Amendment No. 2 to the Arrangement Agreement, dated July 15, 2022, by and between the Company and EHT (incorporated by reference to Exhibit 10.1\nto our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on July 21, 2022)\n2.4 Amendment No. 3 to the Arrangement Agreement, dated October 18, 2022, by and between the Company and EHT (incorporated by reference to Exhibit\n10.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on October 19, 2022)\n2.5 Loan Agreement and Note, dated October 17, 2022, by and between the Company and EHT (incorporated by reference to Exhibit 10.2 to our Current\nReport on Form 8-K filed on October 19, 2022)\n2.6 Share Purchase Agreement, dated November 8, 2022, by and between Emerald Health Therapeutics, Inc., 14428773 Canada Inc., Verdelite Sciences, Inc.,\nVerdelite Property Holdings, Inc. and C3 Centre Holding Inc.

Such stockholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such shares of\nCompany Capital Stock held by them in accordance with the DGCL unless and until such stockholders fail to perfect or effectively withdraw or otherwise lose\ntheir appraisal rights under the DGCL. All Dissenting Shares held by stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost\ntheir right to appraisal of such shares of Company Capital Stock under the DGCL (whether occurring before, at or after the Effective Time) shall thereupon be\ndeemed to be converted into and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest,\nattributable to such Dissenting Shares upon their surrender in the manner provided in Sections 1.5 and 1.7.\n(b) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall give Parent prompt written notice of any demands by dissenting stockholders\nreceived by the Company, withdrawals of such\n-5-\ndemands and any other instruments served on the Company and any material correspondence received by the Company in connection with such demands, and\nthe Company shall have the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands; provided that Parent shall have the right to participate\nin such negotiations and proceedings.

If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is determined by the Surviving Corporation to be necessary or\ndesirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of\nthe Company, then the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be fully authorized, and shall use their and its commercially reasonable efforts\n(in the name of the Company, in the name of Merger Sub, in the name of the Surviving Corporation and otherwise) to take such action.\n1.10 Withholding.

To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and\npaid to the appropriate Governmental Body in accordance with applicable Law, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as\nhaving been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made.\nSection 2.

The following summary does not\npurport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by the Nevada Revised Statutes and other applicable law, as well as the provisions of the Company’s\narticles of incorporation, as amended and as currently in effect (the “Articles of Incorporation”), which are filed or incorporated by reference as Exhibit 3.1 to the Company’s\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) on March 20, 2024 and Exhibit 3.1 to the Company’s Current Report on\nForm 8-K filed with the Commission on November 7, 2023, and the Company’s amended and restated bylaws, as amended and as currently in effect (the “Bylaws”), which are\nfiled or incorporated by reference as Exhibit 3.2 to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Commission on March 31, 2023. The Company’s stockholders\nare urged to read the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws carefully and in their entirety.\nPursuant to the Articles of Incorporation, the total number of shares of all classes of stock that we have authority to issue is 100,200,000 consisting of 100,000,000 shares of\ncommon stock, par value $0.001 per share and 200,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share.\nCommon Stock\nGeneral\nThe holders of common stock of the Company are not entitled to pre-emptive or other similar subscription rights to purchase any of our securities. Our common stock is neither\nconvertible nor redeemable. Unless the board of directors of the Company determines otherwise, the Company will issue all of its capital stock in uncertificated form.\nVoting Rights\nThe holders of shares of our common stock are entitled to one non-cumulative vote per share.\nDividends and Distributions\nSubject to preferences that may apply to any shares of the Company’s preferred stock outstanding at the time, the holders of outstanding shares of common stock are entitled to\nreceive dividends out of funds legally available at the times and in the amounts that the Company’s board of directors may determine.\nLiquidation Rights\nUpon the Company’s liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, the assets legally available for distribution to the Company’s stockholders would be distributable ratably among the\nholders of common stock after payment of liquidation preferences on any Company preferred stock outstanding at that time and any creditors.\nThe rights, preferences and privileges of holders of common stock are subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of holders of shares of any series of preferred\nstock that the Company may designate and issue in the future.\nRights of Repurchase\nThe Company will not have any rights to repurchase shares of its common stock.\nPreemptive or Similar Rights\nThe common stock is not entitled to preemptive rights and is not subject to redemption.\nPreferred Stock\nThe board of directors of the Company has authority to issue shares of Company preferred stock in one or more series, to fix for each such series such voting powers (full or\nlimited, or no voting powers), designations, preferences, qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, including dividend rights, conversion rights, redemption privileges\nand liquidation preferences for the issue of such series all to the fullest extent permitted by the Nevada Revised Statutes and any other applicable Law (“Nevada Law”).

(the “Company”) due to the material\nnoncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under the applicable U.S. federal securities laws, including any required\naccounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements, or\nto correct an error that is not material to previously issued financial statements but would result in a material misstatement if the error were\ncorrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period (a “Restatement”), the Board of Directors of the Company (or any\ncommittee to which the Board of Directors may delegate its authority) (the “Board”) shall recover reasonably promptly from any person, who is or\nwas an “Executive Officer,” as such term is defined in Rule 10D-1 adopted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the\n“Exchange Act”) and Listing Rule 5608 of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) listing rules, of the Company (each, a “Covered Person”)\nthe amount of any “Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation” (as defined below).\nThe amount of Incentive-Based Compensation (as defined below) that must be recovered from a Covered Person pursuant to the immediately\npreceding paragraph is the amount of “Recoverable Incentive-Based Compensation” (as defined below) received by a Covered Person that\nexceeds the amount of Recoverable Incentive-Based Compensation that otherwise would have been received had it been determined based on the\nrestated amounts, computed without regard to any taxes paid (referred to as the “Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation”). For\nRecoverable Incentive-Based Compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return, where the amount of Erroneously Awarded Incentive-\nBased Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in a Restatement, the amount must be based on a\nreasonable estimate of the effect of the Restatement on the stock price or total shareholder return, as applicable, upon which the Recoverable\nIncentive-Based Compensation was received, and the Company must maintain documentation of that reasonable estimate and provide such\ndocumentation to Nasdaq. For the purposes of this Policy, Recoverable Incentive-Based Compensation will be deemed to be received in the fiscal\nperiod during which the financial reporting measure specified in the applicable Incentive-Based Compensation award is attained, even if the\npayment or grant occurs after the end of that period.\nFor purposes of this Policy, “Incentive-Based Compensation” means any compensation that is granted, earned, or vested based wholly or in part\nupon the attainment of a “financial reporting measure,” which means a measure that is determined and presented in accordance with Generally\nAccepted Accounting Principles which are used in preparing the Company’s financial statements, and any measure that is derived wholly or in\npart from such measures. Stock price and total shareholder return are also financial reporting measures for this purpose. For avoidance of doubt, a\nfinancial reporting measure need not be presented within the Company’s financial statements or included in a filing with the Securities and\nExchange Commission.\nFor purposes of this Policy, “Recoverable Incentive-Based Compensation” means all Incentive-Based Compensation received on or after the\nEffective Date of this Policy set forth above by a Covered Person: (i) after beginning service as an executive officer; (ii)\nwho served as an Executive Officer at any time during the performance period for the Incentive-Based Compensation; (iii) while the Company has\na class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or a national securities association; and (iv) during the three completed fiscal years\nimmediately preceding the date that the Company is required to prepare a Restatement, including any applicable transition period that results from\na change in the Company’s fiscal year within or immediately following those three completed fiscal years. For this purpose, the Company is\ndeemed to be required to prepare a Restatement on the earlier of: (i) the date the Board, or the Company’s officers authorized to take such action if\nBoard action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare a Restatement; and (ii) the\ndate a court, regulator, or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare a Restatement. The Company’s obligation to recover\nErroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation is not dependent on if or when the restated financial statements are filed with the Securities\nand Exchange Commission.\nThe Company shall recover the Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation from Covered Persons unless the Board determines that\nrecovery is impracticable because: (i) the direct expense to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the amount of Erroneously\nAwarded Incentive-Based Compensation; provided that the Company must make a reasonable attempt to recover the Erroneously Awarded\nIncentive-Based Compensation before concluding that recovery is impracticable, document such reasonable attempt to recover the Erroneously\nAwarded Incentive-Based Compensation and provide such documentation to Nasdaq; or (ii) recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-\nqualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet the applicable requirements of\n26 U.S.C. 401(a)(13) or 26 U.S.C. 411(a) and regulations thereunder.\nIn no event will the Company indemnify any Covered Person for any amounts that are recovered under this Policy. This Policy is in addition to\n(and not in lieu of) any right of repayment, forfeiture or right of offset against any employees that is required pursuant to any statutory repayment\nrequirement (regardless of whether implemented at any time prior to or following the adoption or amendment of this Policy), including Section\n304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Any amounts paid to the Company pursuant to Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 shall be\nconsidered in determining any amounts recovered under this Policy.\nThe application and enforcement of this Policy does not preclude the Company from taking any other action to enforce a Covered Person’s\nobligations to the Company, including termination of employment or institution of legal proceedings. Nothing in this Policy restricts the Company\nfrom seeking recoupment under any other compensation recoupment Policy or any applicable provisions in plans, agreements, awards or other\narrangements that contemplate the recoupment of compensation from a Covered Person. If a Covered Person fails to repay Erroneously Awarded\nCompensation that is owed to the Company under this policy, the Company shall take all appropriate action to recover such Erroneously Awarded\nCompensation from the Covered Person, and the Covered Person shall be required to reimburse the Company for all expenses (including legal\nexpenses) incurred by the Company in recovering such Erroneously Awarded Compensation.\nThe terms of this Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Covered Persons subject to this Policy and their beneficiaries, heirs,\nexecutors, administrators or other legal representatives. Any determination made by the Board under this Policy shall be final, binding and\nconclusive on all parties.\nIf any provision of this Policy or the application of such provision to any Covered Person shall be adjudicated to be invalid, illegal or\nunenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this Policy, and the invalid,\nillegal or unenforceable provisions or shall be deemed amended to the minimum extent necessary to render any such provision (or the application\nof such provision) valid, legal or enforceable.\nThis Policy shall be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with Rule 10D-1 under the Exchange Act, Rule 5608 of the Nasdaq listing rules and\nany related rules or regulations adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission or Nasdaq (the “Applicable Rules”) as well as any other\napplicable law. To the extent the Applicable Rules require recovery of incentive-based compensation in additional circumstances beyond those\nspecified above, nothing in this Policy shall be deemed to limit or restrict the right or obligation of the Company to recover incentive-based\ncompensation to the fullest extent required by the Applicable Rules.\nEach Covered Person shall sign and return to the Company, within 30 calendar days following the later of (i) the effective date of this Policy first\nset forth above or (ii) the date the individual becomes a Covered Person, the Acknowledgement Form attached hereto as Exhibit A, pursuant to\nwhich the Covered Person agrees to be bound by, and to comply with, the terms and conditions of this Policy.\nEXHIBIT A\nSKYE BIOSCIENCE, INC.\nCOMPENSATION RECOUPMENT POLICY\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT FORM\nBy signing below, the undersigned acknowledges and confirms that the undersigned has received and reviewed a copy of the Skye Bioscience, Inc.\n(the “Company”) Compensation Recoupment Policy (the “Policy”).\nBy signing this Acknowledgement Form, the undersigned acknowledges and agrees that the undersigned is and will continue to be subject to the\nPolicy and that the Policy will apply both during and after the undersigned’s employment with the Company. Further, by signing below, the\nundersigned agrees to abide by the terms of the Policy, including, without limitation, by returning any Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based\nCompensation (as defined in the Policy) to the Company to the extent required by, and in a manner consistent with, the Policy.\nCOVERED PERSON\nSignature ___________________________\nPrint Name ___________________________\nDate ___________________________"
