This dual action is what drives the strong activity we see when we combine IO102-IO103 with an anti-PD-1 therapy. In addition to IO102-IO103, the T-win platform has generated other novel candidates including IO112, targeting arginase 1 with a unique mechanism of action. We are excited about the strength of the data supporting the potential of IO112 and plan to submit an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the FDA for this program in 2025.”\n\n**Recent Business Highlights**\n\n  * The per-protocol interim analysis in the pivotal Phase 3 trial (IOB-013/KN-D18), which is evaluating IO102-IO103 in combination with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in advanced melanoma, was completed by the IDMC in the third quarter of 2024. Based on review of safety and efficacy data, the IDMC recommended the trial continue without modifications and noted that no new safety signals were observed. The outcome of the primary endpoint of PFS is projected to be available in the first half of 2025, potentially followed by a BLA submission in 2025 depending on the PFS outcome.\n  * Encouraging data for the fully enrolled squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cohorts of the Phase 2 basket trial (IOB-022/KN-D38) evaluating IO102-IO103 in combination with pembrolizumab in the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic disease were presented at the 2024 European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress in September and the 2024 Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) Annual Meeting in November, respectively. [<https://bit.ly/3zgzsoY>; <https://bit.ly/4fsVCno>]\n  * The company continues to progress its perioperative Phase 2 basket trial (IOB-032/PN-E40) studying treatment with IO102-IO103 in combination with pembrolizumab dosed before (neo-adjuvant) and after (adjuvant) surgery with curative intent in patients with resectable melanoma or SCCHN. Enrollment continues in both the single arm SCCHN cohort (cohort B) and the randomized melanoma cohort (cohort C), in which patients are randomized either to IO102-IO103 in combination with pembrolizumab or to pembrolizumab alone.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * Net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was $24.0 million, compared to $21.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n  * Research and development expenses were $20.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $17.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily related to timing of clinical trial-related activities for the company’s IO102-IO103 therapeutic cancer vaccine candidate, including the continued execution of the company’s pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial. The company recognized $0.6 million in research and development equity-based compensation for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n  * General and administrative expenses were $6.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $5.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The company recognized $1.0 million in general and administrative equity-based compensation for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n  * Cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 were $80.2 million, compared to $143.2 million at December 31, 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the company used cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $20.8 million. The company continues to expect that it will have sufficient cash to run the company into the fourth quarter of 2025.\n\n\n\n**About IO102-IO103**\n\nIO102-IO103 is an investigational off-the-shelf therapeutic cancer vaccine designed to kill both tumor cells and immune-suppressive cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) by stimulating activation and expansion of T cells against indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) positive and/or programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) positive cells. The company is currently conducting a pivotal Phase 3 trial (IOB-013/KN-D18; NCT05155254) investigating IO102-IO103 in combination with pembrolizumab versus pembrolizumab alone in patients with advanced melanoma, a Phase 2 basket trial (IOB-022/KN-D38; NCT05077709) investigating IO102-IO103 in combination with pembrolizumab as first line treatment in patients with solid tumors, and a Phase 2 basket trial (IOB-032/PN-E40; NCT05280314) investigating IO102-IO103 in combination with pembrolizumab as neo-adjuvant/adjuvant treatment of patients with solid tumors.\n\nThe clinical trials are sponsored by IO Biotech and conducted in collaboration with Merck, which is supplying pembrolizumab. IO Biotech maintains global commercial rights to IO102-IO103.\n\nKEYTRUDA® is a registered trademark of Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC, a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc., Rahway, NJ, USA.\n\n**About the IOB-013/KN-D18 Pivotal Phase 3 Clinical Trial**\n\nIOB-013/KN-D18 (Clinical [Trials.gov](http://Trials.gov): NCT05155254) is an open label, randomized Phase 3 pivotal clinical trial evaluating IO102-IO103 in combination with pembrolizumab versus pembrolizumab alone in patients with previously untreated, unresectable or metastatic (advanced) melanoma. A total of 407 patients have been enrolled from more than 100 centers across the United States, Europe, Australia, Turkey, Israel and South Africa. The primary endpoint of the study is progression free survival, an event-driven analysis conducted when 226 events, defined as disease progression or death, have been reported in the study. Secondary endpoints include overall response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), durable objective response rate (DRR), complete response rate (CRR), duration of response (DoR), time to complete response (TTCR), disease control rate (DCR), and incidence of AEs and SAEs (safety and tolerability). Biomarkers in the blood and tumor tissue will also be assessed. IO Biotech is sponsoring the Phase 3 trial and Merck is supplying pembrolizumab.\n\n**About IOB-022/KN-D38 Phase 2 Solid Tumor Basket Trial**\n\nIOB-022/KN-D38 (NCT05077709) is a non-comparative, open label trial to investigate the safety and efficacy of IO102-IO103 in combination with pembrolizumab in first-line advanced cancers in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). IO Biotech is sponsoring the Phase 2 trial and Merck is supplying pembrolizumab. IO Biotech maintains global commercial rights to IO102-IO103.\n\n**About IOB-032/PN-E40 Phase 2 Solid Tumor Basket Trial**\n\nIOB-032/PN-E40 (NCT05280314) is a Phase 2 basket trial investigating the IO102-IO103 therapeutic cancer vaccine in combination with pembrolizumab as neo-adjuvant/adjuvant treatment of patients with solid tumors. The study completed enrollment of 15 patients with melanoma in cohort A and continues to enroll 15 patients with SCCHN in cohort B as single arm cohorts receiving combination of IO102-IO103 with pembrolizumab, whereas in cohort C, melanoma patients will be randomized 1:1 to either the combination of IO102-IO103 with pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab alone. In the neo-adjuvant period, for all cohorts, treatment is every 3 weeks (Q3W) for 3 cycles (melanoma) or 2-3 cycles (SCCHN). Patients entering the study will be scheduled for surgery and begin neoadjuvant treatment 4-9 weeks prior. Surgery will be followed by adjuvant treatment with the same regimen for 15 cycles. Cohort C patients with poor pathological response to pembrolizumab alone in the neo-adjuvant phase (>10% residual viable tumor) may cross over to combination treatment post-surgery. The primary endpoint is major pathological response at surgery (≤10% residual viable tumor; central assessment). IO Biotech is sponsoring the Phase 2 trial and Merck is supplying pembrolizumab.\n\n**About IO Biotech**\n\nIO Biotech is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel, immune-modulating therapeutic cancer vaccines based on its T-win® platform.

These data, as well as new pre-clinical data from IO Biotech’s second vaccine candidate, IO112, will be presented at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer’s 39th Annual Meeting (SITC 2024) in Houston on November 8-10, 2024.\n\n“These data build on the growing clinical evidence for IO102-IO103 in hard-to-treat cancers. These Phase 2 NSCLC data evaluating IO102-IO103 in combination with pembrolizumab demonstrated a positive trend in ORR compared to benchmark data in the evaluable patient population with no unexpected toxicity,” stated Jonathan Riess, MD, principal investigator of the trial and Director, Thoracic Oncology at the UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center. “We need new treatments that can extend the durability of response for lung cancer patients. No progression in nearly half of the patients in this study at 12 months is a positive signal.”\n\nThe presentation contains clinical and biomarker data from the fully enrolled cohort of patients (n=37) with previously untreated metastatic stage NSCLC with PD-L1 high TPS ≥ 50. The data from 31 efficacy evaluable patients demonstrated:\n\n  * A 55% unconfirmed (16 partial responses, 1 complete response), 48% confirmed overall response rate (ORR) in a PD-L1 high population of patients with NSCLC\n  * An 81% disease control rate (DCR)\n  * No disease progression at 12 months in approximately 50% of patients\n  * An encouraging 8.1-month median progression-free survival (PFS)\n  * Median duration of response (DOR) not yet reached\n  * A safety profile consistent with previously reported data when combining IO102-IO103 with anti-PD-1 monotherapy\n  * Vaccine-specific T cell responses to both IO102 (IDO1) and IO103 (PD-L1) were detected in patients on treatment\n\n\n\n“The results of the combination of IO102-IO103 with the anti-PD-1 therapy pembrolizumab in the NSCLC cohort, combined with the promising data presented at ESMO for the SCCHN cohort and the previous Phase 1/2 data in melanoma, add to the body of evidence that our dual-approach of targeting tumor cells and immune suppressive cells in the tumor microenvironment may drive a meaningful clinical benefit across a range of hard-to-treat cancers,” said Qasim Ahmad, MD, Chief Medical Officer of IO Biotech. “Importantly, we are observing promising activity with no unexpected toxicity and safety concerns, which addresses a high unmet medical need and an important gap in current treatment options for patients.”\n\nTo date, the safety profile observed in this study (IOB-022/KN-D38) is consistent with prior studies of IO102-IO103 in combination with checkpoint inhibitors, with no unexpected systemic toxicity compared to anti-PD-1 monotherapy and low-grade transient injection site reactions reported as the most common treatment related adverse events​. Data from the squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) cohort of this study were presented at the 2024 European Society for Medical Oncology congress in September that demonstrated the cohort met its primary endpoint of ORR with encouraging PFS data.\n\n**Pre-clinical data from IO112, IO Biotech’s second therapeutic cancer vaccine candidate derived from the company’s T-win ® platform, also presented at SITC 2024**Arginase 1 (Arg1) plays a central role in immune suppression, and its overexpression has been reported in several cancers including renal cell carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, and head and neck cancer. Importantly, all immune suppressive myeloid cells in the TME express Arg1, and their key roles in cancer immune resistance mechanisms have been well described. The data presented in the poster showcase that IO112 vaccination leads to robust expansion of Arg1-specific T cells, which in turn directly target and reprogram immune suppressive TAMs, leading to tumor growth inhibition.\n\n“Our present data confirm the hypothesis that the primary and direct target of IO112 treatment are TAMs – and, what is striking, is how dynamically the vaccine-induced T cells are impacting TAMs,” said Ayako Wakatsuki Pedersen, PhD, Senior Vice President of Translational Research at IO Biotech. “Treatment with IO112 results in TAMs changing their phenotype completely, from immune suppressive to highly pro-inflammatory, driving the modulation of the TME, and facilitating the immune attack on tumor cells. These data give us further confidence in our T-win® platform, a unique approach to induce a proinflammatory and anti-tumorigenic TME via T cells that attack the primary drivers of immune suppression. This strong data adds to the rationale for IO112 clinical development, and we look forward to submitting an IND for IO112 in 2025.”\n\nThe posters can be found on the “[Posters & Publications](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=vgXeS7qh-hfQBKAUyI_PhTx6s3mKGVVJ6v0edvePzqR3_T-L85hVUyjbz9MDD3q3jHn9vSkyhIRXuCycW8nYJaaPAp1McX_Lfx1DVDbmPZmskJJok3V5HjHjsirmGsFJqexjWo-AqstNySwzl7RDiA==)” page of the IO Biotech website.
