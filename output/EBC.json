The merger added approximately $3.7 billion in loans, $3.9 billion in deposits, each at fair value, and $4.7 billion in AUM. \n\n“This quarter marked a transformational moment in Eastern’s history, as we closed on our merger with Cambridge Trust,” said Bob Rivers, Executive Chair and Chair of the Board of Directors of the Company and Eastern Bank. “This combination represents a powerful step forward in achieving our strategic vision, positioning us as a stronger, more competitive institution and Greater Boston’s leading local bank. I want to acknowledge the hard work and dedication of our entire team.” \n\nDenis Sheahan, Chief Executive Officer, added, “While we’ve grown, our focus remains deeply rooted in the Greater Boston community. Our expanded capabilities allow us to better serve the consumers and businesses that drive this region’s economy, by providing comprehensive, one-stop banking and wealth management solutions, ensuring that we remain a committed resource in their success.” \n\n“Following successful bank and wealth system conversions, we are on track to achieve the merger-related financial targets that were set forth at the time of our announcement just over a year ago,” said David Rosato, Chief Financial Officer. “This accomplishment underscores the strength of our integration strategy and our commitment to deliver shareholder value.” \n\n**BALANCE SHEET**\n\nTotal assets were $25.5 billion at September 30, 2024, representing an increase of $4.5 billion, or 21.2% from June 30, 2024. \n\n  * Cash and equivalents increased $138.6 million to $889.5 million. \n  * Securities increased $56.3 million, or 1.2%, to $4.6 billion, due to an increase in the market value of available for sale securities (“AFS securities”) driven by lower interest rates, partially offset by principal runoff. Acquired securities totaling $883.0 million were sold following completion of the merger. \n  * Loans totaled $18.1 billion, representing an increase of $3.9 billion, or 27.7%, due to the addition of Cambridge. Eastern-originated loans declined modestly by $16.1 million, or 0.1%, in the quarter. \n  * Deposits totaled $21.2 billion, representing an increase of $3.7 billion, or 21.0%. The merger added $3.9 billion of deposits. Legacy Eastern deposits decreased $195 million, or 0.9%, due primarily to a seasonal decline in municipal deposits, partially offset by an increase in time deposits. \n  * FHLB advances decreased $0.1 million to $17.3 million. Proceeds from the securities sale were used to pay off FHLB advances of $782.0 million that the Company assumed through the merger. \n  * Shareholders’ equity was $3.7 billion, representing an increase of $703.7 million, due primarily to the common shares issued in the merger, as well as an increase in AOCI, partially offset by a decrease in retained earnings. \n\n\n\nPlease refer to Appendix E for more information on organic loan and deposit growth and the impact of the Cambridge merger, and Appendix F for a roll-forward of tangible shareholders’ equity. \n\n**NET INTEREST INCOME**\n\nNet interest income was $169.9 million for the third quarter, compared to $128.6 million, representing an increase of $41.2 million, due to an increase in the net interest margin and increased average earning assets. \n\n  * Net interest income included net accretion income of $10.8 million from purchase accounting adjustments in connection with the merger. \n  * The net interest margin on a FTE basis was 2.97%, representing a 33 basis point increase and included net discount accretion of 18 basis points from the Cambridge merger. \n  * Total interest-earning assets yield increased 41 basis points from the prior quarter to 4.60%, due primarily to an increase in loan yields of 39 basis points, as well as higher other short-term investment balances. \n  * Total interest-bearing liabilities cost increased 6 basis points to 2.50%. \n\n\n\n**NONINTEREST INCOME**\n\nNoninterest income was $33.5 million for the third quarter, compared to $25.3 million, representing an increase of $8.2 million. Operating noninterest income was $32.9 million, compared to $31.1 million, representing an increase of $1.8 million. \n\n  * Trust and investment advisory fees increased $8.2 million to $14.9 million, due primarily to increased AUM as a result of the merger. \n  * Service charges on deposit accounts increased $0.2 million to $8.1 million. \n  * Debit card processing fees increased $0.3 million to $3.8 million. \n  * Customer swap income increased $0.1 million to $0.6 million. \n  * Income from investments held in rabbi trust accounts increased $1.8 million to $3.6 million. \n  * Losses on sales of mortgage loans held for sale were $0.4 million, compared to losses of $0.2 million in the prior quarter. \n  * There were no losses on sales of AFS securities in the third quarter, compared to losses of $7.6 million in the prior quarter. \n  * Other noninterest income decreased $9.8 million to $2.9 million, due in part to the merger-related disposal of fixed assets totaling $3.0 million. The prior quarter included an early termination payment of $7.8 million received from the early withdrawal of a $100 million deposit contract. \n\n\n\n**NONINTEREST EXPENSE**\n\nNoninterest expense was $159.8 million, compared to $109.9 million, an increase of $49.9 million. The increase was primarily driven by the increase in merger-related expenses of $23.9 million. Operating noninterest expense was $130.9 million, compared to $105.3 million, representing an increase of $25.6 million. \n\n  * Salaries and employee benefits expense was $93.8 million, an increase of $28.5 million. The increase in salaries expense of $24.6 million was due primarily to the addition of colleagues, and an increase in merger-related expenses of $11.8 million, including retention bonuses and severance payments. The increase in employee benefits expense of $3.9 million was attributable to an increase in federal payroll tax expense of $1.4 million, as well as the addition of colleagues and the increased market value of investments held in rabbi trust accounts by the Company’s defined contribution supplemental executive retirement plan (“DC SERP”). \n  * Office occupancy and equipment expense was $14.5 million, an increase of $4.4 million, due primarily to merger-related expenses of $2.6 million, as well as the addition of leases and equipment from the merger. \n  * Data processing expense was $19.5 million, an increase of $1.5 million. \n  * Professional services expense was $9.0 million, an increase of $4.7 million, due primarily to merger-related expenses of $4.5 million. \n  * Marketing expense was $1.6 million, a decrease of $0.3 million. \n  * Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance expense was $3.2 million, a decrease of $1.3 million. The prior quarter included a FDIC special assessment of $1.9 million. \n  * Amortization of intangible assets was $6.2 million, an increase of $5.7 million, driven primarily by the amortization of core deposit intangibles and wealth management intangibles in connection with the merger. \n  * Other noninterest expense was $12.1 million, an increase of $6.7 million, due primarily to an increase in provision for off balance sheet credit exposures of $2.9 million, including a $1.9 million initial provision on off balance sheet credit exposures acquired from Cambridge, as well as merger-related contract termination fees of $2.6 million. \n\n\n\nPlease refer to Appendix D for additional detail on merger-related charges. \n\n**ASSET QUALITY**\n\nNon-performing loans (“NPLs”) totaled $124.5 million, or 0.70% of total loans, at September 30, 2024 compared to $39.8 million, or 0.28% of total loans, at the end of the prior quarter. The increase in NPLs was driven primarily by purchased credit deteriorated (“PCD”) loans acquired from Cambridge that were on non-accrual status at September 30, 2024. \n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company recorded total net charge-offs of $5.1 million, or 0.12% of average total loans on an annualized basis, compared to total net recoveries of $0.8 million, or 0.02% of average total loans on an annualized basis, in the prior quarter, respectively. \n\nThe Company recorded a provision for loan losses totaling $47.0 million, including a $40.9 million initial provision on non-PCD loans acquired from Cambridge. The remaining provision was primarily associated with individual reserves on commercial real estate loans during the quarter. \n\nThe allowance for loan losses was $253.8 million at September 30, 2024, or 1.43% of total loans, compared to $156.1 million, or 1.11% of total loans, at June 30, 2024. The allowance in the third quarter included a $55.8 million initial allowance on PCD loans and a $40.9 million allowance established via the aforementioned initial provision on non-PCD loans, both related to the merger. \n\n**DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES**\n\nThe Company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.12 per common share, representing a $0.01, or 9%, increase. The dividend will be payable on December 16, 2024 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 3, 2024. \n\nThe Company repurchased 836,399 shares of common stock during the third quarter at a weighted average price of $15.08, for an aggregate purchase price of $12.6 million. \n\n**CONFERENCE CALL AND PRESENTATION INFORMATION**\n\nA conference call and webcast covering Eastern’s third quarter 2024 earnings will be held on Friday, October 25, 2024 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

Management believes excluding these items facilitates greater visibility for investors into the Company’s core business as well as underlying trends that may, to some extent, be obscured by inclusion of such items in the corresponding GAAP financial measures. Except as otherwise indicated, these non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release exclude discontinued operations. \n\nThere are items in the Company’s financial statements that impact its financial results, but which management believes are unrelated to the Company’s core business. Accordingly, the Company presents noninterest income on an operating basis, total operating revenue, noninterest expense on an operating basis, operating net income, operating earnings per share, operating return on average assets, operating return on average shareholders’ equity, operating return on average tangible shareholders’ equity (discussed further below), and the operating efficiency ratio. Each of these figures excludes the impact of such applicable items because management believes such exclusion can provide greater visibility into the Company’s core business and underlying trends. Such items that management does not consider to be core to the Company’s business include (i) income and expenses from investments held in rabbi trusts, (ii) gains and losses on sales of securities available for sale, net, (iii) gains and losses on the sale of other assets, (iv) rabbi trust employee benefits, (v) impairment charges on tax credit investments and associated tax credit benefits, (vi) other real estate owned (“OREO”) gains, (vii) merger and acquisition expenses, (viii) the non-cash pension settlement charge recognized related to the defined benefit plan, (ix) certain discrete tax items, and (x) net income from discontinued operations. Return on average tangible shareholders’ equity, operating return on average tangible shareholders’ equity as well as the operating efficiency ratio also further exclude the effect of amortization of intangible assets. The Company does not provide an outlook for its total noninterest income and total noninterest expense because each contains income or expense components, as applicable, such as income associated with rabbi trust accounts and rabbi trust employee benefit expense, which are market-driven, and over which the Company cannot exercise control. Accordingly, reconciliations of the Company’s outlook for its noninterest income on an operating basis and its noninterest expense on an operating basis to an outlook for total noninterest income and total noninterest expense are not provided. \n\nManagement also presents tangible assets, tangible shareholders’ equity, average tangible shareholders’ equity, tangible book value per share, the ratio of tangible shareholders’ equity to tangible assets, return on average tangible shareholders’ equity, and operating return on average shareholders’ equity (discussed further above), each of which excludes the impact of goodwill and other intangible assets and in the case of tangible net income (loss), return on average tangible shareholders’ equity and operating return on average tangible shareholders’ equity excludes the after-tax impact of amortization of intangible assets, as management believes these financial measures provide investors with the ability to further assess the Company’s performance, identify trends in its core business and provide a comparison of its capital adequacy to other companies. The Company includes the tangible ratios because management believes that investors may find it useful to have access to the same analytical tools used by management to assess performance and identify trends. \n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release should not be considered an alternative or substitute for financial results or measures determined in accordance with GAAP or as an indication of the Company’s cash flows from operating activities, a measure of its liquidity position or an indication of funds available for its cash needs. An item which management considers to be non-core and excludes when computing these non-GAAP measures can be of substantial importance to the Company’s results for any particular period. In addition, management’s methodology for calculating non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the methodologies employed by other banking companies to calculate the same or similar performance measures, and accordingly, the Company’s reported non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to the same or similar performance measures reported by other banking companies. Please refer to Appendices A-E for reconciliations of the Company's GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures in this press release. \n\n**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**\n\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

shareholders' equity components for the three months ended Sep 30, 2023 and Dec 31, 2023 presented in this section include discontinued operations.   \n(2) The net tax benefit (expense) associated with these items is generally determined by assessing whether each item is included or excluded from net taxable income and applying our combined statutory tax rate only to those items included in net taxable income. The net tax benefit for the three months ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to the tax benefit from state tax strategies associated with the utilization of capital losses as a result of the sale of securities in the first quarter of 2023. Upon the sale of securities in the first quarter of 2023, we established a valuation allowance of $17.4 million, as it was determined at that time that it was not more-likely-than-not that the entirety of the deferred tax asset related to the loss on such securities would be realized. Included in that $17.4 million was $2.8 million in expected lost state tax benefits. Following the execution of the sale of our insurance agency business in October 2023 and the resulting capital gain, coupled with tax planning strategies, a state tax benefit of $13.6 million was realized on the security sale losses.   \n(3) Presented on an annualized basis.   \n(4) The tax effect of amortization of intangible assets is calculated using the Company's combined statutory tax rate of 27.7% for the three months ended Dec 31, 2023 and the following periods, and 28.23% for the three months ended Sep 30, 2023.   \n(5) The tangible net income (loss), return on average tangible shareholders' equity ratio and operating return on average tangible shareholders' equity ratio exclude the amortization of intangible assets, net of tax.   \n**APPENDIX B: Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Operating Revenues and Expenses**  \n---  \nFor information on non-GAAP financial measures, please see the section titled \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"   \n**Three Months Ended**  \n**Sep 30, 2024** |  **Jun 30, 2024** |  **Mar 31, 2024** |  **Dec 31, 2023** |  **Sep 30, 2023**  \n(Unaudited, dollars in thousands)   \n**Net interest income (GAAP)** |  $  |  169,855  |  $  |  128,649  |  $  |  129,900  |  $  |  133,307  |  $  |  137,205   \nAdd:   \nTax-equivalent adjustment (non-GAAP) (1)  |  4,792  |  4,553  |  4,483  |  4,483  |  4,376   \n**Fully-taxable equivalent net interest income (non-GAAP)** |  $  |  174,647  |  $  |  133,202  |  $  |  134,383  |  $  |  137,790  |  $  |  141,581   \n**Noninterest income (GAAP)** |  $  |  33,528  |  $  |  25,348  |  $  |  27,692  |  $  |  26,739  |  $  |  19,157   \nLess:   \nIncome (losses) from investments held in rabbi trusts  |  3,591  |  1,761  |  4,318  |  4,969  |  (1,523  |  )   \nLosses on sales of securities available for sale, net  |  —  |  (7,557  |  )  |  —  |  —  |  —   \n(Losses) gains on sales of other assets  |  (2,970  |  )  |  (2  |  )  |  —  |  —  |  2   \n**Noninterest income on an operating basis (non-GAAP)** |  $  |  32,907  |  $  |  31,146  |  $  |  23,374  |  $  |  21,770  |  $  |  20,678   \n**Noninterest expense (GAAP)** |  $  |  159,753  |  $  |  109,869  |  $  |  101,202  |  $  |  121,029  |  $  |  101,748   \nLess:   \nRabbi trust employee benefit expense (income)  |  1,326  |  930  |  1,746  |  1,740  |  (586  |  )   \nMerger and acquisition expenses  |  27,577  |  3,684  |  1,816  |  1,865  |  3,630   \n**Noninterest expense on an operating basis (non-GAAP)** |  $  |  130,850  |  $  |  105,255  |  $  |  97,640  |  $  |  117,424  |  $  |  98,704   \n**Less: Amortization of intangible assets** |  $  |  6,210  |  $  |  504  |  $  |  504  |  $  |  505  |  $  |  504   \n**Noninterest expense for calculating the operating efficiency ratio (non-GAAP) (2)** |  $  |  124,640  |  $  |  104,751  |  $  |  97,136  |  $  |  116,919  |  $  |  98,200   \nTotal revenue (GAAP)  |  $  |  203,383  |  $  |  153,997  |  $  |  157,592  |  $  |  160,046  |  $  |  156,362   \nTotal operating revenue (non-GAAP)  |  $  |  207,554  |  $  |  164,348  |  $  |  157,757  |  $  |  159,560  |  $  |  162,259   \nEfficiency ratio (GAAP)  |  78.5  |  %  |  71.3  |  %  |  64.2  |  %  |  75.6  |  %  |  65.1  |  %   \nOperating efficiency ratio (non-GAAP) (2)  |  60.1  |  %  |  63.7  |  %  |  61.6  |  %  |  73.3  |  %  |  60.5  |  %   \n(1) Interest income on tax-exempt loans and investment securities has been adjusted to a FTE basis using a marginal tax rate of 21.8%, 21.7%, 21.7%, 21.9%, and 21.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, March 31, 2024, December 31, 2023, and September 30, 2023, respectively.   \n(2) The operating efficiency ratio excludes, in addition to the adjustments made to operating net income, the amortization of intangible assets.

Management believes excluding these\n109 / 110 / 112 255 / 107 / 000 items facilitates greater visibility for investors into the Company’s core business as well as underlying trends that may, to some extent, be obscured by inclusion of such items in the\ncorresponding GAAP financial measures. Except as otherwise indicated, these non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release exclude discontinued operations.\nThere are items in the Company’s financial statements that impact its financial results, but which management believes are unrelated to the Company’s core business. Accordingly, the\nCompany presents noninterest income on an operating basis, total operating revenue, noninterest expense on an operating basis, operating net income, operating earnings per share,\noperating return on average assets, operating return on average shareholders’ equity, operating return on average tangible shareholders’ equity (discussed further below), and the\n137 / 139 / 141 197 / 064 / 044\noperating efficiency ratio. Each of these figures excludes the impact of such applicable items because management believes such exclusion can provide greater visibility into the\nCompany’s core business and underlying trends. Such items that management does not consider to be core to the Company’s business include (i) income and expenses from investments\nheld in rabbi trusts, (ii) gains and losses on sales of securities available for sale, net, (iii) gains and losses on the sale of other assets, (iv) rabbi trust employee benefits, (v) impairment\ncharges on tax credit investments and associated tax credit benefits, (vi) other real estate owned (“OREO”) gains, (vii) merger and acquisition expenses, (viii) the non-cash pension\nsettlement charge recognized related to the defined benefit plan, (ix) certain discrete tax items, and (x) net income from discontinued operations. Return on average tangible\n166 / 168 / 171 103 / 086 / 164 shareholders’ equity, operating return on average tangible shareholders’ equity as well as the operating efficiency ratio also further exclude the effect of amortization of intangible assets.\nThe Company does not provide an outlook for its total noninterest income and total noninterest expense because each contains income or expense components, as applicable, such as\nincome associated with rabbi trust accounts and rabbi trust employee benefit expense, which are market-driven, and over which the Company cannot exercise control. Accordingly,\nreconciliations of the Company’s outlook for its noninterest income on an operating basis and its noninterest expense on an operating basis to an outlook for total noninterest income and\ntotal noninterest expense are not provided.\n208 / 210 / 211 238 / 184 / 028\nManagement also presents tangible assets, tangible shareholders’ equity, average tangible shareholders’ equity, tangible book value per share, the ratio of tangible shareholders’ equity to\ntangible assets, return on average tangible shareholders’ equity, and operating return on average shareholders’ equity (discussed further above), each of which excludes the impact of\ngoodwill and other intangible assets and in the case of tangible net income (loss), return on average tangible shareholders’ equity and operating return on average tangible shareholders’\nequity excludes the after-tax impact of amortization of intangible assets, as management believes these financial measures provide investors with the ability to further assess the\n237 / 237 / 238 000 / 139 / 151 Company’s performance, identify trends in its core business and provide a comparison of its capital adequacy to other companies. The Company includes the tangible ratios because\nmanagement believes that investors may find it useful to have access to the same analytical tools used by management to assess performance and identify trends.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release should not be considered an alternative or substitute for financial results or measures determined in accordance with\nGAAP or as an indication of the Company’s cash flows from operating activities, a measure of its liquidity position or an indication of funds available for its cash needs. An item which\n000 / 000 / 051 management considers to be non-core and excludes when computing these non-GAAP measures can be of substantial importance to the Company’s results for any particular period. In\naddition, management’s methodology for calculating non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the methodologies employed by other banking companies to calculate the same or\nsimilar performance measures, and accordingly, the Company’s reported non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to the same or similar performance measures reported by\nother banking companies. Please refer to Appendices A-E for reconciliations of the Company's GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures in this press release. 24\nDO NOT REFRESH\nComplementary Color Palette\n074B /o d 0y 7 5te /x t 076 030 / 152 / 213\nForward-looking statements\n185 / 197 / 212 023 / 061 / 110\nThis document contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and section 21E of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements include statements regarding anticipated future events and can be identified by the fact that they do\nnot relate strictly to historical or current facts. You can identify these statements from the use of the words “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “plan,” “potential,”\n119 / 139 / 154\n“estimate,” “project,” “believe,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “target”, “outlook” and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements, by their nature, are subject to\nrisks and uncertainties. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results described in the forward-looking statements.\nCertain factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results include; adverse developments in the level and direction of loan delinquencies\n109 / 110 / 112 255 / 107 / 000 and charge-offs and changes in estimates of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses; increased competitive pressures; changes in interest rates and resulting\nchanges in competitor or customer behavior, mix or costs of sources of funding, and deposit amounts and composition; risks associated with the Company’s\nimplementation of the merger, including that revenue or expense synergies may not fully materialize for the Company in the timeframe expected or at all, or may be\nmore costly to achieve; that following completion of the merger, Eastern’s business may not perform as expected due to transaction-related uncertainty or other\nfactors; that Eastern is unable to successfully implement integration strategies; that Eastern’s expansion of services or capabilities resulting from the merger may be\n137 / 139 / 141 197 / 064 / 044 more challenging than anticipated; reputational risks and the reaction of customers to the transaction; the inability to implement onboarding plans and other\nconsequences associated with mergers; the diversion of management time and Company resources on merger-related issues; and disruptions arising from transitions\nin management personnel; adverse national or regional economic conditions or conditions within the securities markets or banking sector; legislative and regulatory\nchanges and related compliance costs that could adversely affect the business in which the Company and its subsidiaries, including Eastern Bank, are engaged,\nincluding the effect of, and changes in, monetary and fiscal policies and laws, such as the interest rate policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\n166 / 168 / 171 103 / 086 / 164 System; market and monetary fluctuations, including inflationary or recessionary pressures, interest rate sensitivity, liquidity constraints, increased borrowing and\nfunding costs, and fluctuations due to actual or anticipated changes to federal tax laws; the realizability of deferred tax assets; the Company’s ability to successfully\nimplement its risk mitigation strategies; asset and credit quality deterioration, including adverse developments in local or regional real estate markets that decrease\ncollateral values associated with existing loans; operational risks such as cybersecurity incidents, natural disasters, and pandemics, including COVID-19 and the failure\nof the Company to execute its planned share repurchases. For further discussion of such factors, please see the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K\n208 / 210 / 211 238 / 184 / 028 and subsequent filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), which are available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.\nYou should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which reflect the Company's expectations only as of the date of this press release.

The net tax benefit for the three months ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to the tax benefit\nfrom state tax strategies associated with the utilization of capital losses as a result of the sale of securities in the first quarter of 2023.

The merger added approximately $3.7 billion in\nloans, $3.9 billion in deposits, each at fair value, and $4.7 billion in AUM.\n“This quarter marked a transformational moment in Eastern’s history, as we closed on our merger with\nCambridge Trust,” said Bob Rivers, Executive Chair and Chair of the Board of Directors of the Company and\nEastern Bank. “This combination represents a powerful step forward in achieving our strategic vision,\npositioning us as a stronger, more competitive institution and Greater Boston’s leading local bank. I want to\nacknowledge the hard work and dedication of our entire team.”\nDenis Sheahan, Chief Executive Officer, added, “While we’ve grown, our focus remains deeply rooted in the\nGreater Boston community. Our expanded capabilities allow us to better serve the consumers and\nbusinesses that drive this region’s economy, by providing comprehensive, one-stop banking and wealth\nmanagement solutions, ensuring that we remain a committed resource in their success.”\n“Following successful bank and wealth system conversions, we are on track to achieve the merger-related\nfinancial targets that were set forth at the time of our announcement just over a year ago,” said David\nRosato, Chief Financial Officer. “This accomplishment underscores the strength of our integration strategy\nand our commitment to deliver shareholder value.”\nBALANCE SHEET\nTotal assets were $25.5 billion at September 30, 2024, representing an increase of $4.5 billion, or 21.2% from\nJune 30, 2024.\n• Cash and equivalents increased $138.6 million to $889.5 million.\n• Securities increased $56.3 million, or 1.2%, to $4.6 billion, due to an increase in the market value of\navailable for sale securities (“AFS securities”) driven by lower interest rates, partially offset by\nprincipal runoff. Acquired securities totaling $883.0 million were sold following completion of the\nmerger.\n• Loans totaled $18.1 billion, representing an increase of $3.9 billion, or 27.7%, due to the addition of\nCambridge. Eastern-originated loans declined modestly by $16.1 million, or 0.1%, in the quarter.\n• Deposits totaled $21.2 billion, representing an increase of $3.7 billion, or 21.0%. The merger added\n$3.9 billion of deposits. Legacy Eastern deposits decreased $195 million, or 0.9%, due primarily to a\nseasonal decline in municipal deposits, partially offset by an increase in time deposits.\n• FHLB advances decreased $0.1 million to $17.3 million. Proceeds from the securities sale were used\nto pay off FHLB advances of $782.0 million that the Company assumed through the merger.\n• Shareholders’ equity was $3.7 billion, representing an increase of $703.7 million, due primarily to the\ncommon shares issued in the merger, as well as an increase in AOCI, partially offset by a decrease in\nretained earnings.\nPlease refer to Appendix E for more information on organic loan and deposit growth and the impact of the\nCambridge merger, and Appendix F for a roll-forward of tangible shareholders’ equity.\nNET INTEREST INCOME\nNet interest income was $169.9 million for the third quarter, compared to $128.6 million, representing an\nincrease of $41.2 million, due to an increase in the net interest margin and increased average earning assets.\n• Net interest income included net accretion income of $10.8 million from purchase accounting\nadjustments in connection with the merger.\n• The net interest margin on a FTE basis was 2.97%, representing a 33 basis point increase and\nincluded net discount accretion of 18 basis points from the Cambridge merger.\n• Total interest-earning assets yield increased 41 basis points from the prior quarter to 4.60%, due\nprimarily to an increase in loan yields of 39 basis points, as well as higher other short-term\ninvestment balances.\n• Total interest-bearing liabilities cost increased 6 basis points to 2.50%.\nNONINTEREST INCOME\n2\nNoninterest income was $33.5 million for the third quarter, compared to $25.3 million, representing an\nincrease of $8.2 million. Operating noninterest income was $32.9 million, compared to $31.1 million,\nrepresenting an increase of $1.8 million.\n• Trust and investment advisory fees increased $8.2 million to $14.9 million, due primarily to increased\nAUM as a result of the merger.\n• Service charges on deposit accounts increased $0.2 million to $8.1 million.\n• Debit card processing fees increased $0.3 million to $3.8 million.\n• Customer swap income increased $0.1 million to $0.6 million.\n• Income from investments held in rabbi trust accounts increased $1.8 million to $3.6 million.\n• Losses on sales of mortgage loans held for sale were $0.4 million, compared to losses of $0.2 million\nin the prior quarter.\n• There were no losses on sales of AFS securities in the third quarter, compared to losses of $7.6\nmillion in the prior quarter.\n• Other noninterest income decreased $9.8 million to $2.9 million, due in part to the merger-related\ndisposal of fixed assets totaling $3.0 million. The prior quarter included an early termination payment\nof $7.8 million received from the early withdrawal of a $100 million deposit contract.\nNONINTEREST EXPENSE\nNoninterest expense was $159.8 million, compared to $109.9 million, an increase of $49.9 million. The\nincrease was primarily driven by the increase in merger-related expenses of $23.9 million. Operating\nnoninterest expense was $130.9 million, compared to $105.3 million, representing an increase of $25.6\nmillion.\n• Salaries and employee benefits expense was $93.8 million, an increase of $28.5 million. The increase\nin salaries expense of $24.6 million was due primarily to the addition of colleagues, and an increase in\nmerger-related expenses of $11.8 million, including retention bonuses and severance payments. The\nincrease in employee benefits expense of $3.9 million was attributable to an increase in federal\npayroll tax expense of $1.4 million, as well as the addition of colleagues and the increased market\nvalue of investments held in rabbi trust accounts by the Company’s defined contribution\nsupplemental executive retirement plan (“DC SERP”).\n• Office occupancy and equipment expense was $14.5 million, an increase of $4.4 million, due primarily\nto merger-related expenses of $2.6 million, as well as the addition of leases and equipment from the\nmerger.\n• Data processing expense was $19.5 million, an increase of $1.5 million.\n• Professional services expense was $9.0 million, an increase of $4.7 million, due primarily to merger-\nrelated expenses of $4.5 million.\n• Marketing expense was $1.6 million, a decrease of $0.3 million.\n• Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance expense was $3.2 million, a decrease of\n$1.3 million. The prior quarter included a FDIC special assessment of $1.9 million.\n• Amortization of intangible assets was $6.2 million, an increase of $5.7 million, driven primarily by the\namortization of core deposit intangibles and wealth management intangibles in connection with the\nmerger.\n• Other noninterest expense was $12.1 million, an increase of $6.7 million, due primarily to an increase\nin provision for off balance sheet credit exposures of $2.9 million, including a $1.9 million initial\nprovision on off balance sheet credit exposures acquired from Cambridge, as well as merger-related\ncontract termination fees of $2.6 million.\nPlease refer to Appendix D for additional detail on merger-related charges.\nASSET QUALITY\nNon-performing loans (“NPLs”) totaled $124.5 million, or 0.70% of total loans, at September 30, 2024\ncompared to $39.8 million, or 0.28% of total loans, at the end of the prior quarter. The increase in NPLs was\ndriven primarily by purchased credit deteriorated (“PCD”) loans acquired from Cambridge that were on\nnon-accrual status at September 30, 2024.\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company recorded total net charge-offs of $5.1 million, or 0.12% of\naverage total loans on an annualized basis, compared to total net recoveries of $0.8 million, or 0.02% of\naverage total loans on an annualized basis, in the prior quarter, respectively.\n3\nThe Company recorded a provision for loan losses totaling $47.0 million, including a $40.9 million initial\nprovision on non-PCD loans acquired from Cambridge.

Management believes excluding these items facilitates greater visibility for investors into the\nCompany’s core business as well as underlying trends that may, to some extent, be obscured by inclusion of\nsuch items in the corresponding GAAP financial measures. Except as otherwise indicated, these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures presented in this press release exclude discontinued operations.\nThere are items in the Company’s financial statements that impact its financial results, but which\nmanagement believes are unrelated to the Company’s core business. Accordingly, the Company presents\nnoninterest income on an operating basis, total operating revenue, noninterest expense on an operating\nbasis, operating net income, operating earnings per share, operating return on average assets, operating\nreturn on average shareholders’ equity, operating return on average tangible shareholders’ equity\n(discussed further below), and the operating efficiency ratio. Each of these figures excludes the impact of\nsuch applicable items because management believes such exclusion can provide greater visibility into the\nCompany’s core business and underlying trends. Such items that management does not consider to be core\nto the Company’s business include (i) income and expenses from investments held in rabbi trusts, (ii) gains\nand losses on sales of securities available for sale, net, (iii) gains and losses on the sale of other assets, (iv)\nrabbi trust employee benefits, (v) impairment charges on tax credit investments and associated tax credit\nbenefits, (vi) other real estate owned (“OREO”) gains, (vii) merger and acquisition expenses, (viii) the non-\ncash pension settlement charge recognized related to the defined benefit plan, (ix) certain discrete tax\nitems, and (x) net income from discontinued operations. Return on average tangible shareholders’ equity,\noperating return on average tangible shareholders’ equity as well as the operating efficiency ratio also\nfurther exclude the effect of amortization of intangible assets. The Company does not provide an outlook\nfor its total noninterest income and total noninterest expense because each contains income or expense\ncomponents, as applicable, such as income associated with rabbi trust accounts and rabbi trust employee\nbenefit expense, which are market-driven, and over which the Company cannot exercise control.\nAccordingly, reconciliations of the Company’s outlook for its noninterest income on an operating basis and\nits noninterest expense on an operating basis to an outlook for total noninterest income and total\nnoninterest expense are not provided.\nManagement also presents tangible assets, tangible shareholders’ equity, average tangible shareholders’\nequity, tangible book value per share, the ratio of tangible shareholders’ equity to tangible assets, return on\naverage tangible shareholders’ equity, and operating return on average shareholders’ equity (discussed\nfurther above), each of which excludes the impact of goodwill and other intangible assets and in the case of\ntangible net income (loss), return on average tangible shareholders’ equity and operating return on average\ntangible shareholders’ equity excludes the after-tax impact of amortization of intangible assets, as\nmanagement believes these financial measures provide investors with the ability to further assess the\nCompany’s performance, identify trends in its core business and provide a comparison of its capital\nadequacy to other companies. The Company includes the tangible ratios because management believes\nthat investors may find it useful to have access to the same analytical tools used by management to assess\nperformance and identify trends.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release should not be considered an alternative\nor substitute for financial results or measures determined in accordance with GAAP or as an indication of\nthe Company’s cash flows from operating activities, a measure of its liquidity position or an indication of\nfunds available for its cash needs. An item which management considers to be non-core and excludes when\ncomputing these non-GAAP measures can be of substantial importance to the Company’s results for any\nparticular period. In addition, management’s methodology for calculating non-GAAP financial measures\nmay differ from the methodologies employed by other banking companies to calculate the same or similar\nperformance measures, and accordingly, the Company’s reported non-GAAP financial measures may not be\ncomparable to the same or similar performance measures reported by other banking companies. Please\nrefer to Appendices A-E for reconciliations of the Company's GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP\nfinancial measures in this press release.\n5\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of section 27A of the Securities\nAct of 1933, as amended, and section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

excluded from net\ntaxable income and applying our combined statutory tax rate only to those items included in net taxable income. The net tax benefit for the three months\nended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to the tax benefit from state tax strategies associated with the utilization of capital losses as a result of the\nsale of securities in the first quarter of 2023. Upon the sale of securities in the first quarter of 2023, we established a valuation allowance of $17.4 million,\nas it was determined at that time that it was not more-likely-than-not that the entirety of the deferred tax asset related to the loss on such securities\nwould be realized. Included in that $17.4 million was $2.8 million in expected lost state tax benefits. Following the execution of the sale of our insurance\nagency business in October 2023 and the resulting capital gain, coupled with tax planning strategies, a state tax benefit of $13.6 million was realized on\nthe security sale losses.\n(3) Presented on an annualized basis.\n(4) The tax effect of amortization of intangible assets is calculated using the Company's combined statutory tax rate of 27.7% for the three months ended\nDec 31, 2023 and the following periods, and 28.23% for the three months ended Sep 30, 2023.\n(5) The tangible net income (loss), return on average tangible shareholders' equity ratio and operating return on average tangible shareholders' equity\nratio exclude the amortization of intangible assets, net of tax.\n16\nAPPENDIX B: Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Operating Revenues and Expenses\nFor information on non-GAAP financial measures, please see the section titled \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\nThree Months Ended\nSep 30, 2024 Jun 30, 2024 Mar 31, 2024 Dec 31, 2023 Sep 30, 2023\n(Unaudited, dollars in thousands)\nNet interest income (GAAP) $ 169,855 $ 128,649 $ 129,900 $ 133,307 $ 137,205\nAdd:\nTax-equivalent adjustment (non-GAAP) (1) 4,792 4,553 4,483 4,483 4,376\nFully-taxable equivalent net interest income (non-GAAP) $ 174,647 $ 133,202 $ 134,383 $ 137,790 $ 141,581\nNoninterest income (GAAP) $ 33,528 $ 25,348 $ 27,692 $ 26,739 $ 19,157\nLess:\nIncome (losses) from investments held in rabbi trusts 3,591 1,761 4,318 4,969 (1,523)\nLosses on sales of securities available for sale, net — (7,557) — — —\n(Losses) gains on sales of other assets (2,970) (2) — — 2\nNoninterest income on an operating basis (non-GAAP) $ 32,907 $ 31,146 $ 23,374 $ 21,770 $ 20,678\nNoninterest expense (GAAP) $ 159,753 $ 109,869 $ 101,202 $ 121,029 $ 101,748\nLess:\nRabbi trust employee benefit expense (income) 1,326 930 1,746 1,740 (586)\nMerger and acquisition expenses 27,577 3,684 1,816 1,865 3,630\nNoninterest expense on an operating basis (non-GAAP) $ 130,850 $ 105,255 $ 97,640 $ 117,424 $ 98,704\nLess: Amortization of intangible assets $ 6,210 $ 504 $ 504 $ 505 $ 504\nNoninterest expense for calculating the operating efficiency\nratio (non-GAAP) (2) $ 124,640 $ 104,751 $ 97,136 $ 116,919 $ 98,200\nTotal revenue (GAAP) $ 203,383 $ 153,997 $ 157,592 $ 160,046 $ 156,362\nTotal operating revenue (non-GAAP) $ 207,554 $ 164,348 $ 157,757 $ 159,560 $ 162,259\nEfficiency ratio (GAAP) 78.5 % 71.3 % 64.2 % 75.6 % 65.1 %\nOperating efficiency ratio (non-GAAP) (2) 60.1 % 63.7 % 61.6 % 73.3 % 60.5 %\n(1) Interest income on tax-exempt loans and investment securities has been adjusted to a FTE basis using a marginal tax rate of 21.8%, 21.7%, 21.7%, 21.9%,\nand 21.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, March 31, 2024, December 31, 2023, and September 30, 2023, respectively.\n(2) The operating efficiency ratio excludes, in addition to the adjustments made to operating net income, the amortization of intangible assets.

Management believes excluding these\n109 / 110 / 112 255 / 107 / 000 items facilitates greater visibility for investors into the Company’s core business as well as underlying trends that may, to some extent, be obscured by inclusion of such items in the\ncorresponding GAAP financial measures. Except as otherwise indicated, these non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release exclude discontinued operations.\nThere are items in the Company’s financial statements that impact its financial results, but which management believes are unrelated to the Company’s core business. Accordingly, the\nCompany presents noninterest income on an operating basis, total operating revenue, noninterest expense on an operating basis, operating net income, operating earnings per share,\noperating return on average assets, operating return on average shareholders’ equity, operating return on average tangible shareholders’ equity (discussed further below), and the\n137 / 139 / 141 197 / 064 / 044\noperating efficiency ratio. Each of these figures excludes the impact of such applicable items because management believes such exclusion can provide greater visibility into the\nCompany’s core business and underlying trends. Such items that management does not consider to be core to the Company’s business include (i) income and expenses from investments\nheld in rabbi trusts, (ii) gains and losses on sales of securities available for sale, net, (iii) gains and losses on the sale of other assets, (iv) rabbi trust employee benefits, (v) impairment\ncharges on tax credit investments and associated tax credit benefits, (vi) other real estate owned (“OREO”) gains, (vii) merger and acquisition expenses, (viii) the non-cash pension\nsettlement charge recognized related to the defined benefit plan, (ix) certain discrete tax items, and (x) net income from discontinued operations. Return on average tangible\n166 / 168 / 171 103 / 086 / 164 shareholders’ equity, operating return on average tangible shareholders’ equity as well as the operating efficiency ratio also further exclude the effect of amortization of intangible assets.\nThe Company does not provide an outlook for its total noninterest income and total noninterest expense because each contains income or expense components, as applicable, such as\nincome associated with rabbi trust accounts and rabbi trust employee benefit expense, which are market-driven, and over which the Company cannot exercise control. Accordingly,\nreconciliations of the Company’s outlook for its noninterest income on an operating basis and its noninterest expense on an operating basis to an outlook for total noninterest income and\ntotal noninterest expense are not provided.\n208 / 210 / 211 238 / 184 / 028\nManagement also presents tangible assets, tangible shareholders’ equity, average tangible shareholders’ equity, tangible book value per share, the ratio of tangible shareholders’ equity to\ntangible assets, return on average tangible shareholders’ equity, and operating return on average shareholders’ equity (discussed further above), each of which excludes the impact of\ngoodwill and other intangible assets and in the case of tangible net income (loss), return on average tangible shareholders’ equity and operating return on average tangible shareholders’\nequity excludes the after-tax impact of amortization of intangible assets, as management believes these financial measures provide investors with the ability to further assess the\n237 / 237 / 238 000 / 139 / 151 Company’s performance, identify trends in its core business and provide a comparison of its capital adequacy to other companies. The Company includes the tangible ratios because\nmanagement believes that investors may find it useful to have access to the same analytical tools used by management to assess performance and identify trends.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release should not be considered an alternative or substitute for financial results or measures determined in accordance with\nGAAP or as an indication of the Company’s cash flows from operating activities, a measure of its liquidity position or an indication of funds available for its cash needs. An item which\n000 / 000 / 051 management considers to be non-core and excludes when computing these non-GAAP measures can be of substantial importance to the Company’s results for any particular period. In\naddition, management’s methodology for calculating non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the methodologies employed by other banking companies to calculate the same or\nsimilar performance measures, and accordingly, the Company’s reported non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to the same or similar performance measures reported by\nother banking companies. Please refer to Appendices A-E for reconciliations of the Company's GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures in this press release. 25\nDO NOT REFRESH\nComplementary Color Palette\n074B /o d 0y 7 5te /x t 076 030 / 152 / 213\nForward-looking statements\n185 / 197 / 212 023 / 061 / 110\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and section 21E of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements include statements regarding anticipated future events and can be identified by the fact that they do\nnot relate strictly to historical or current facts. You can identify these statements from the use of the words “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “plan,” “potential,”\n119 / 139 / 154\n“estimate,” “project,” “believe,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “target”, “outlook” and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements, by their nature, are subject to\nrisks and uncertainties. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results described in the forward-looking statements.\nCertain factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results include; adverse developments in the level and direction of loan delinquencies\n109 / 110 / 112 255 / 107 / 000 and charge-offs and changes in estimates of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses; increased competitive pressures; changes in interest rates and resulting\nchanges in competitor or customer behavior, mix or costs of sources of funding, and deposit amounts and composition; risks associated with the Company’s\nimplementation of the merger, including that revenue or expense synergies may not fully materialize for the Company in the timeframe expected or at all, or may be\nmore costly to achieve; that following completion of the merger, Eastern’s business may not perform as expected due to transaction-related uncertainty or other\nfactors; that Eastern is unable to successfully implement integration strategies; that Eastern’s expansion of services or capabilities resulting from the merger may be\n137 / 139 / 141 197 / 064 / 044 more challenging than anticipated; reputational risks and the reaction of customers to the transaction; the inability to implement onboarding plans and other\nconsequences associated with mergers; the diversion of management time and Company resources on merger-related issues; and disruptions arising from transitions\nin management personnel; adverse national or regional economic conditions or conditions within the securities markets or banking sector; legislative and regulatory\nchanges and related compliance costs that could adversely affect the business in which the Company and its subsidiaries, including Eastern Bank, are engaged,\nincluding the effect of, and changes in, monetary and fiscal policies and laws, such as the interest rate policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\n166 / 168 / 171 103 / 086 / 164 System; market and monetary fluctuations, including inflationary or recessionary pressures, interest rate sensitivity, liquidity constraints, increased borrowing and\nfunding costs, and fluctuations due to actual or anticipated changes to federal tax laws; the realizability of deferred tax assets; the Company’s ability to successfully\nimplement its risk mitigation strategies; asset and credit quality deterioration, including adverse developments in local or regional real estate markets that decrease\ncollateral values associated with existing loans; operational risks such as cybersecurity incidents, natural disasters, and pandemics, including COVID-19 and the failure\nof the Company to execute its planned share repurchases. For further discussion of such factors, please see the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K\n208 / 210 / 211 238 / 184 / 028 and subsequent filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), which are available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.\nYou should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which reflect the Company's expectations only as of the date of this press release.

The net tax benefit for the three months ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to the tax benefit\nfrom state tax strategies associated with the utilization of capital losses as a result of the sale of securities in the first quarter of 2023.
