The Nasdaq Staff has determined that the Company would not be able to become fully current with regards to the Company's late filings by October 14, 2024 (the maximum extent of the Staff's discretion under the Listing Rules), and as a result, the Staff determined to initiate the delisting process. Accordingly, the Company intends to timely request a hearing before an independent Hearings Panel (the \"Panel\"). The hearing request will automatically stay any suspension or delisting action through October 4, 2024. Concurrent with the hearing request, the Company intends to seek, subject to the Panel's discretion, an extended stay of suspension or delisting through the pendency of the hearing and the expiration of any additional extension period granted by the Panel following the hearing. Pursuant to the Nasdaq Listing Rules, the maximum amount of time that can be granted by the Panel runs through April 11, 2025.
