(NASDAQ: LAUR), which operates five higher education institutions across Mexico and Peru, today announced financial results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**_Third Quarter 2024_**** _Highlights (compared to_**** _third quarter 2023_**** _):_**\n\n  * On a reported basis, revenue increased 2% to $368.6 million. On an organic constant currency basis1, revenue increased 9%.\n  * Operating income for the third quarter of 2024 was $72.0 million, compared to operating income of $58.7 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Net income for the third quarter of 2024 was $85.3 million, compared to net income of $36.0 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in net income was due to a discrete tax benefit recorded during the third quarter of 2024 of approximately $37.9 million as well as an increase in operating income.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2024 was $91.4 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $78.4 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n\n\n\n**_Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024_**** _Highlights (compared to_**** _nine months ended September 30, 2023_**** _):_**\n\n  * New enrollments increased 4%.\n  * Total enrollments increased 5%.\n  * On a reported basis, revenue increased 6% to $1,143.2 million. On an organic constant currency basis1, revenue increased 6%.\n  * Operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $249.8 million, compared to operating income of $228.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n  * Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $202.8 million, compared to net income of $65.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net income was mainly driven by the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany balances compared to the 2023 period, as well as higher operating income and a discrete tax benefit recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $308.9 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $287.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n\n\nEilif Serck-Hanssen, President and Chief Executive Officer, said “The macroeconomic recovery in Peru contributed to strong operating performance for the third quarter. We believe that we are well-positioned to meet our 2024 goals, with continued revenue growth and margin expansion across all markets. Our results demonstrate the resilience of our business model and the strength of our brands in Mexico and Peru, reinforcing our commitment to driving long-term value for all stakeholders.”\n\n1 Organic constant currency results exclude the period-over-period impact from currency fluctuations, acquisitions and divestitures.\n\n**_Third Quarter 2024_**** _Results_**\n\nFor the third quarter of 2024, revenue on a reported basis was $368.6 million, an increase of $7.1 million, or 2%, compared to the third quarter of 2023. On an organic constant currency basis, revenue increased 9%. Operating income for the third quarter of 2024 was $72.0 million, compared to $58.7 million for the third quarter of 2023, an increase of $13.3 million. Net income for the third quarter of 2024 was $85.3 million, compared to net income of $36.0 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in net income was due to a discrete tax benefit recorded during the third quarter of 2024 of approximately $37.9 million as well as an increase in operating income. Basic and diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2024 were $0.56.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2024 was $91.4 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $78.4 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n\n**_Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024_**** _Results_**\n\nNew enrollments for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 4%, compared to new enrollment activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and total enrollments were up 5% compared to the prior-year period. New and total enrollments in Peru increased 4% and 3%, respectively, compared to the prior-year period. New and total enrollments in Mexico were up 4% and 7%, respectively, compared to the prior-year period.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenue on a reported basis was $1,143.2 million, an increase of $68.3 million, or 6%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. On an organic constant currency basis, revenue increased 6%. Operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $249.8 million, compared to $228.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of $21.0 million. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $202.8 million, compared to net income of $65.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net income was mainly driven by the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany balances compared to the 2023 period, as well as higher operating income and a discrete tax benefit recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Basic and diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $1.31.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $308.9 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $287.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n**_Balance Sheet and Capital Structure_**\n\nLaureate has a strong balance sheet position. As of September 30, 2024, Laureate had $134.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and gross debt of $154.8 million. Accordingly, net debt was $20.4 million as of September 30, 2024.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the $100 million repurchase program that had previously been announced in February 2024 was completed. On September 13, 2024, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had approved a new stock repurchase program to acquire up to $100 million of the Company’s common stock. The Company intends to finance the repurchases with free cash flow, excess cash and liquidity on-hand, including available capacity under its Revolving Credit Facility.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, Laureate had 150.7 million total shares outstanding.\n\n**_Outlook for Fiscal 2024_**\n\nLaureate is increasing its full-year constant currency outlook and adjusting its as-reported guidance to reflect more recent foreign currency rates, impacted by recent volatility in the Mexican peso.\n\nBased on the current foreign exchange spot rates2, Laureate now expects its full-year 2024 results to be as follows:\n\n  * Total enrollments are expected to be approximately 470,000 students, reflecting growth of approximately 5% versus 2023;\n  * Revenues are now expected to be in the range of $1,551 million to $1,556 million, reflecting growth of 5% on an as-reported basis and 7% on an organic constant currency basis versus 2023; and\n  * Adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be in the range of $447 million to $451 million, reflecting growth of 7%-8% on an as-reported basis and 9%-10% on an organic constant currency basis versus 2023.\n\n\n\nReconciliations of forward-looking non-GAAP measures, specifically the 2024 Adjusted EBITDA outlook, to the relevant forward-looking GAAP measures are not being provided, as Laureate does not currently have sufficient data to accurately estimate the variables and individual adjustments for such outlooks and reconciliations. Due to this uncertainty, the Company cannot reconcile projected Adjusted EBITDA to projected net income without unreasonable effort.\n\nPlease see the “Forward-Looking Statements” section in this release for a discussion of certain risks related to this outlook.\n\n**_Conference Call_**\n\nLaureate will host an earnings conference call today at 8:30 am ET. Interested parties are invited to listen to the earnings call by registering at <https://bit.ly/LAURQ32024> to receive dial-in information. The webcast of the conference call, including replays, and a copy of this press release and the related slides will be made available through the Investor Relations section of Laureate’s website at [www.laureate.net](http://www.laureate.net).\n\n2 Based on actual FX rates for January-October 2024, and current spot FX rates (local currency per U.S. Dollar) of MXN 20.20 and PEN 3.77 for November 2024 - December 2024. FX impact may change based on fluctuations in currency rates in future periods.\n\n**_Forward-Looking Statements_**\n\nThis press release includes statements that express Laureate’s opinions, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions or projections regarding future events or future results and therefore are, or may be deemed to be, ‘‘forward-looking statements’’ within the meaning of the federal securities laws, which involve risks and uncertainties. Laureate’s actual results may vary significantly from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. You can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as ‘‘believes,’’ ‘‘expects,’’ ‘‘may,’’ ‘‘will,’’ ‘‘should,’’ ‘‘seeks,’’ ‘‘approximately,’’ ‘‘intends,’’ ‘‘plans,’’ ‘‘estimates’’ or ‘‘anticipates’’ or similar expressions that concern our strategy, plans or intentions. In particular, statements regarding the amount, timing, process, tax treatment and impact of any future dividends represent forward-looking statements. All statements we make relating to guidance (including, but not limited to, total enrollments, revenues, and Adjusted EBITDA), and all statements we make relating to our current growth strategy and other future plans, strategies or transactions that may be identified, explored or implemented and any litigation or dispute resulting from any completed transaction are forward-looking statements. In addition, we, through our senior management, from time to time make forward-looking public statements concerning our expected future operations and performance and other developments. All of these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may change at any time, including with respect to our current growth strategy and the impact of any completed divestiture or separation transaction on our remaining businesses. Accordingly, our actual results may differ materially from those we expected. We derive most of our forward-looking statements from our operating budgets and forecasts, which are based upon many detailed assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, we caution that it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and, of course, it is impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations are disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 22, 2024, our subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed, and to be filed, with the SEC and other filings made with the SEC. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the time of this release and we do not undertake to publicly update or revise them, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\n\n**_Presentation of Non-GAAP Measures_**\n\nIn addition to the results provided in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) throughout this press release, Laureate provides the non-GAAP measurements of Adjusted EBITDA, and total debt, net of cash and cash equivalents (or net debt). We have included these non-GAAP measurements because they are key measures used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short- and long-term operational plans.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA consists of net income (loss), adjusted for the items included in the accompanying reconciliation. The exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is a key input into the formula used by the compensation committee of our board of directors and our Chief Executive Officer in connection with the payment of incentive compensation to our executive officers and other members of our management team. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors.\n\nTotal debt, net of cash and cash equivalents (or net debt) consists of total gross debt, less total cash and cash equivalents. Net debt provides a useful indicator about Laureate’s leverage and liquidity.\n\nLaureate’s calculations of Adjusted EBITDA, and total debt, net of cash and cash equivalents (or net debt) are not necessarily comparable to calculations performed by other companies and reported as similarly titled measures. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. Adjusted EBITDA is reconciled from the GAAP measure in the attached table “Non-GAAP Reconciliation.”\n\nWe evaluate our results of operations on both an as reported and an organic constant currency basis. The organic constant currency presentation, which is a non-GAAP measure, excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions and divestitures. We believe that providing organic constant currency information provides valuable supplemental information regarding our results of operations, consistent with how we evaluate our performance. We calculate organic constant currency amounts using the change from prior-period average foreign exchange rates to current-period average foreign exchange rates, as applied to local-currency operating results for the current period, and then exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestitures as per the accompanying presentation.\n\n**About Laureate Education, Inc.**\n\n_Laureate Education, Inc.__operates five higher education institutions across Mexico and Peru, enrolling more than 450,000 students in high-quality undergraduate, graduate, and specialized degree programs through campus-based and online learning.

The “Organic Constant Currency” percentage changes are calculated by dividing the Organic Constant Currency amounts by the 2023 Revenues and Adjusted EBITDA amounts, excluding the impact of the

(NASDAQ: LAUR) (the “Company”) announced that its board of directors has approved a new stock repurchase program to acquire up to $100 million of the Company’s common stock. The Company intends to finance the repurchases with free cash flow, excess cash and liquidity on-hand, including available capacity under its Revolving Credit Facility. The Company has completed the $100 million repurchase program that had previously been announced in February 2024. After giving effect to this new authorization, the Company will have returned nearly $3 billion of capital to shareholders since the beginning of 2019 through a combination of share repurchases, cash distributions and cash dividends.\n\nThe Company’s proposed repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market at prevailing market prices, in privately negotiated transactions, in block trades and/or through other legally permissible means, depending on market conditions and in accordance with applicable rules and regulations promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Repurchases may be effectuated pursuant to a trading plan adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. The Company’s board will review the share repurchase program periodically and may authorize adjustments to its terms and size or suspend or discontinue the program.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements** This press release includes certain statements which contain \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the federal securities laws, which involve risks and uncertainties. You can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as \"believes,\" \"expects,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"seeks,\" \"approximately,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"estimates\" or \"anticipates\" or similar expressions that concern our strategy, plans or intentions. In particular, statements regarding the impact of the forward-looking statements are based on the Company's current expectations and assumptions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements, which are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations are disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 22, 2024, our subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed and to be filed with the SEC and other filings made with the SEC.\n\n**About Laureate Education, Inc.** Laureate Education, Inc. operates five higher education institutions across Mexico and Peru, enrolling approximately 450,000 students in high-quality undergraduate, graduate, and specialized degree programs through campus-based and online learning.

Laureate’s actual results\nmay vary significantly from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. You can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as ‘‘believes,’’\n‘‘expects,’’ ‘‘may,’’ ‘‘will,’’ ‘‘should,’’ ‘‘seeks,’’ ‘‘approximately,’’ ‘‘intends,’’ ‘‘plans,’’ ‘‘estimates’’ or ‘‘anticipates’’ or similar expressions that concern our strategy, plans or intentions. All\nstatements we make relating to guidance (including, but not limited to, total enrollments, revenues, and Adjusted EBITDA), and all statements we make relating to our current growth\nstrategy and other future plans, strategies or transactions that may be identified, explored or implemented and any litigation or dispute resulting from any completed transaction are\nforward-looking statements. In addition, we, through our senior management, from time to time make forward-looking public statements concerning our expected future operations and\nperformance and other developments. All of these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may change at any time, including with respect to our current\ngrowthstrategy and the impact of any completed divestiture or separation transaction onour remaining businesses. Accordingly, our actual results may differ materially from those we\nexpected. We derive most of our forward-looking statements from our operating budgets and forecasts, which are based upon many detailed assumptions. While we believe that our\nassumptions are reasonable, we cautionthat it is very difficult to predict the impact of knownfactors, and, of course, it is impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could affect our\nactualresults.Importantfactorsthat could causeactualresults to differmaterially fromourexpectations aredisclosedinourAnnualReportonForm10-K filed withthe SEC onFebruary\n22, 2024, our subsequent Quarterly Reports onForm 10-Q filed, and to be filed, with the SEC and other filings made withthe SEC. These forward-looking statements speakonly as of\nthe timeofthis release and we donot undertake topublicly update orrevise them, whether as a result ofnew information, future events orotherwise, except as required by law.\nIn addition, this presentationcontains various operating data, including market share and market position, that are based oninternal company data and management estimates. While\nmanagement believes that our internalcompany researchis reliable andthedefinitions of ourmarkets whichare used hereinare appropriate, neither suchresearchnorthesedefinitions\nhave been verified by an independent source and there are inherent challenges and limitations involved in compiling data across various geographies and from various sources,\nincluding those discussed under “Industry and Market Data” inLaureate’s filings with the SEC.\n©2024 Laureate Education, Inc. 2\nPresentation of Non-GAAP Measures\nInadditiontotheresultsprovidedinaccordancewithU.S.generallyacceptedaccountingprinciples(GAAP)throughoutthispresentation,Laureateprovidesthe non-GAAPmeasurementsofAdjustedEBITDAand\nits related margin,Adjusted EBITDA to Unlevered Free CashFlowConversion,totaldebt,netof cashand cashequivalents (ornetdebt), and Free CashFlow.We have included these non-GAAP measurements\nbecause they are key measures used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget and to\ndevelopshort-and long-term operational plans.\nAdjustedEBITDAconsistsofnetincome(loss),adjustedfortheitemsincludedinthe accompanying reconciliation.The exclusionofcertainexpensesincalculatingAdjustedEBITDAcanprovide ausefulmeasure\nforperiod-to-period comparisons of our core business.Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, which is calculated bydividing Adjusted EBITDA byrevenue, are key inputs into the formula\nused by the compensation committee of our board of directors and our Chief Executive Officer in connection with the payment of incentive compensation to our executive officers and other members of our\nmanagement team. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the\nsamemanner as ourmanagement and board ofdirectors.\nAdjusted EBITDA to Unlevered Free CashFlowConversionconsists of Unlevered Free CashFlow (whichis defined as cashflows from operating activities,less capitalexpenditures (net of sales ofPP&E),plus\nnetcashinterestexpense)dividedbyAdjustedEBITDA.AdjustedEBITDAtoUnleveredFreeCashFlowprovidesusefulinformationto investors and othersinunderstanding andevaluating ourabilityto generate\ncashflows.\nTotaldebt,netofcashand cashequivalents (ornetdebt)consistsoftotalgrossdebt,lesstotalcashand cashequivalents.

These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in\naccordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are reconciled from their respective GAAP measures in the attached\ntables “Non-GAAPReconciliation”.\nWe evaluate our results of operations on both an as reported and an organic constant currency basis. The organic constant currency presentation, which is a non-GAAP measure, excludes the impact of\nfluctuations inforeigncurrencyexchange rates,acquisitions and divestitures.We believe that providing organic constantcurrencyinformationprovides valuable supplementalinformation regarding our results of\noperations, consistent with how we evaluate our performance. We calculate organic constant currency amounts using the change from prior-period average foreign exchange rates to current-period average\nforeignexchange rates,as appliedto local-currency operating results forthe current period,and then excludethe impactofacquisitions and divestitures.\n©2024 Laureate Education, Inc. 3\nSummary Overview\nNote: Throughout this presentation amounts may not sum to totals due to rounding\n©2024 Laureate Education, Inc. 4\nExecutive Summary\n Third quarter Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA ahead of guidance following strong\nmacroeconomic recovery in Peru\n New Enrollments in Peru +12% for Q3; through completion of the secondary intake cycle in November\nexpected to be up 16% year-over-year\n Favorable operating performance year-to-date\n Year-to-date New and Total Enrollments increased 4% and 5%, respectively, versus comparable prior\nyear period\n Net Income of $85M in Q3; $49M increase versus prior year period\n Includes one-time favorable tax adjustment of $38M\n Strong operating performance in second half of the year offsetting FX headwinds\n Increasing constant currency guidance, offsetting weakness in MXN\nStrong Third Quarter Results Following Peru Macroeconomic Recovery\nImproved Operating Performance Expected to Cover FX Headwinds\n©2024 Laureat©e2 E0d2u4c Laatiounre, aIntec.

(NASDAQ: LAUR), which operates five higher education institutions across Mexico and Peru, today announced financial results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**_Third Quarter 2024_**** _Highlights (compared to_**** _third quarter 2023_**** _):_**\n\n  * On a reported basis, revenue increased 2% to $368.6 million. On an organic constant currency basis1, revenue increased 9%.\n  * Operating income for the third quarter of 2024 was $72.0 million, compared to operating income of $58.7 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Net income for the third quarter of 2024 was $85.3 million, compared to net income of $36.0 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in net income was due to a discrete tax benefit recorded during the third quarter of 2024 of approximately $37.9 million as well as an increase in operating income.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2024 was $91.4 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $78.4 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n\n\n\n**_Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024_**** _Highlights (compared to_**** _nine months ended September 30, 2023_**** _):_**\n\n  * New enrollments increased 4%.\n  * Total enrollments increased 5%.\n  * On a reported basis, revenue increased 6% to $1,143.2 million. On an organic constant currency basis1, revenue increased 6%.\n  * Operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $249.8 million, compared to operating income of $228.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n  * Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $202.8 million, compared to net income of $65.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net income was mainly driven by the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany balances compared to the 2023 period, as well as higher operating income and a discrete tax benefit recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $308.9 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $287.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n\n\nEilif Serck-Hanssen, President and Chief Executive Officer, said “The macroeconomic recovery in Peru contributed to strong operating performance for the third quarter. We believe that we are well-positioned to meet our 2024 goals, with continued revenue growth and margin expansion across all markets. Our results demonstrate the resilience of our business model and the strength of our brands in Mexico and Peru, reinforcing our commitment to driving long-term value for all stakeholders.”\n\n1 Organic constant currency results exclude the period-over-period impact from currency fluctuations, acquisitions and divestitures.\n\n**_Third Quarter 2024_**** _Results_**\n\nFor the third quarter of 2024, revenue on a reported basis was $368.6 million, an increase of $7.1 million, or 2%, compared to the third quarter of 2023. On an organic constant currency basis, revenue increased 9%. Operating income for the third quarter of 2024 was $72.0 million, compared to $58.7 million for the third quarter of 2023, an increase of $13.3 million. Net income for the third quarter of 2024 was $85.3 million, compared to net income of $36.0 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in net income was due to a discrete tax benefit recorded during the third quarter of 2024 of approximately $37.9 million as well as an increase in operating income. Basic and diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2024 were $0.56.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2024 was $91.4 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $78.4 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n\n**_Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024_**** _Results_**\n\nNew enrollments for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 4%, compared to new enrollment activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and total enrollments were up 5% compared to the prior-year period. New and total enrollments in Peru increased 4% and 3%, respectively, compared to the prior-year period. New and total enrollments in Mexico were up 4% and 7%, respectively, compared to the prior-year period.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenue on a reported basis was $1,143.2 million, an increase of $68.3 million, or 6%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. On an organic constant currency basis, revenue increased 6%. Operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $249.8 million, compared to $228.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of $21.0 million. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $202.8 million, compared to net income of $65.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net income was mainly driven by the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany balances compared to the 2023 period, as well as higher operating income and a discrete tax benefit recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Basic and diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $1.31.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $308.9 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $287.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n**_Balance Sheet and Capital Structure_**\n\nLaureate has a strong balance sheet position. As of September 30, 2024, Laureate had $134.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and gross debt of $154.8 million. Accordingly, net debt was $20.4 million as of September 30, 2024.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the $100 million repurchase program that had previously been announced in February 2024 was completed. On September 13, 2024, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had approved a new stock repurchase program to acquire up to $100 million of the Company’s common stock. The Company intends to finance the repurchases with free cash flow, excess cash and liquidity on-hand, including available capacity under its Revolving Credit Facility.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, Laureate had 150.7 million total shares outstanding.\n\n**_Outlook for Fiscal 2024_**\n\nLaureate is increasing its full-year constant currency outlook and adjusting its as-reported guidance to reflect more recent foreign currency rates, impacted by recent volatility in the Mexican peso.\n\nBased on the current foreign exchange spot rates2, Laureate now expects its full-year 2024 results to be as follows:\n\n  * Total enrollments are expected to be approximately 470,000 students, reflecting growth of approximately 5% versus 2023;\n  * Revenues are now expected to be in the range of $1,551 million to $1,556 million, reflecting growth of 5% on an as-reported basis and 7% on an organic constant currency basis versus 2023; and\n  * Adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be in the range of $447 million to $451 million, reflecting growth of 7%-8% on an as-reported basis and 9%-10% on an organic constant currency basis versus 2023.\n\n\n\nReconciliations of forward-looking non-GAAP measures, specifically the 2024 Adjusted EBITDA outlook, to the relevant forward-looking GAAP measures are not being provided, as Laureate does not currently have sufficient data to accurately estimate the variables and individual adjustments for such outlooks and reconciliations. Due to this uncertainty, the Company cannot reconcile projected Adjusted EBITDA to projected net income without unreasonable effort.\n\nPlease see the “Forward-Looking Statements” section in this release for a discussion of certain risks related to this outlook.\n\n**_Conference Call_**\n\nLaureate will host an earnings conference call today at 8:30 am ET. Interested parties are invited to listen to the earnings call by registering at <https://bit.ly/LAURQ32024> to receive dial-in information. The webcast of the conference call, including replays, and a copy of this press release and the related slides will be made available through the Investor Relations section of Laureate’s website at [www.laureate.net](http://www.laureate.net).\n\n2 Based on actual FX rates for January-October 2024, and current spot FX rates (local currency per U.S. Dollar) of MXN 20.20 and PEN 3.77 for November 2024 - December 2024. FX impact may change based on fluctuations in currency rates in future periods.\n\n**_Forward-Looking Statements_**\n\nThis press release includes statements that express Laureate’s opinions, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions or projections regarding future events or future results and therefore are, or may be deemed to be, ‘‘forward-looking statements’’ within the meaning of the federal securities laws, which involve risks and uncertainties. Laureate’s actual results may vary significantly from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. You can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as ‘‘believes,’’ ‘‘expects,’’ ‘‘may,’’ ‘‘will,’’ ‘‘should,’’ ‘‘seeks,’’ ‘‘approximately,’’ ‘‘intends,’’ ‘‘plans,’’ ‘‘estimates’’ or ‘‘anticipates’’ or similar expressions that concern our strategy, plans or intentions. In particular, statements regarding the amount, timing, process, tax treatment and impact of any future dividends represent forward-looking statements. All statements we make relating to guidance (including, but not limited to, total enrollments, revenues, and Adjusted EBITDA), and all statements we make relating to our current growth strategy and other future plans, strategies or transactions that may be identified, explored or implemented and any litigation or dispute resulting from any completed transaction are forward-looking statements. In addition, we, through our senior management, from time to time make forward-looking public statements concerning our expected future operations and performance and other developments. All of these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may change at any time, including with respect to our current growth strategy and the impact of any completed divestiture or separation transaction on our remaining businesses. Accordingly, our actual results may differ materially from those we expected. We derive most of our forward-looking statements from our operating budgets and forecasts, which are based upon many detailed assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, we caution that it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and, of course, it is impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations are disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 22, 2024, our subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed, and to be filed, with the SEC and other filings made with the SEC. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the time of this release and we do not undertake to publicly update or revise them, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\n\n**_Presentation of Non-GAAP Measures_**\n\nIn addition to the results provided in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) throughout this press release, Laureate provides the non-GAAP measurements of Adjusted EBITDA, and total debt, net of cash and cash equivalents (or net debt). We have included these non-GAAP measurements because they are key measures used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short- and long-term operational plans.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA consists of net income (loss), adjusted for the items included in the accompanying reconciliation. The exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is a key input into the formula used by the compensation committee of our board of directors and our Chief Executive Officer in connection with the payment of incentive compensation to our executive officers and other members of our management team. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors.\n\nTotal debt, net of cash and cash equivalents (or net debt) consists of total gross debt, less total cash and cash equivalents. Net debt provides a useful indicator about Laureate’s leverage and liquidity.\n\nLaureate’s calculations of Adjusted EBITDA, and total debt, net of cash and cash equivalents (or net debt) are not necessarily comparable to calculations performed by other companies and reported as similarly titled measures. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. Adjusted EBITDA is reconciled from the GAAP measure in the attached table “Non-GAAP Reconciliation.”\n\nWe evaluate our results of operations on both an as reported and an organic constant currency basis. The organic constant currency presentation, which is a non-GAAP measure, excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions and divestitures. We believe that providing organic constant currency information provides valuable supplemental information regarding our results of operations, consistent with how we evaluate our performance. We calculate organic constant currency amounts using the change from prior-period average foreign exchange rates to current-period average foreign exchange rates, as applied to local-currency operating results for the current period, and then exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestitures as per the accompanying presentation.\n\n**About Laureate Education, Inc.**\n\n_Laureate Education, Inc.__operates five higher education institutions across Mexico and Peru, enrolling more than 450,000 students in high-quality undergraduate, graduate, and specialized degree programs through campus-based and online learning.
