(Nasdaq: XERS), a fast-growing biopharmaceutical company committed to improving patient lives by developing and commercializing innovative products across a range of therapies, today announced financial results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024. \n\n“We are proud to report our record-breaking quarter with total revenue of our $54 million led by strong demand of Recorlev® and Gvoke®. Our product revenue growth of 27% marks the 12th consecutive quarter of over 20% growth,\" said John Shannon, CEO of Xeris. \"We have made investments in areas that drive growth, notably Recorlev®, and we are seeing the benefits of those investments. Given our exceptional year-to-date performance, we are raising our revenue guidance to $198-$202 million from the previous $190-$200 million. Looking ahead, our focus remains on continuing to drive greater than 20% product revenue growth and advancing our robust pipeline - namely our Phase 3 ready, XP-8121.\" \n\n“While delivering exceptional revenue growth, we held our total operating expenses relatively flat to last quarter when you exclude non-routine charges,” said Steven Pieper, CFO of Xeris. “We will continue to drive robust revenue growth, maintain our strong margin profile, and diligently manage expenses, which gives us confidence that the business is financially sound and does not require any dilutive financing to fund our growth.” \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Highlights**\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,** |  **Change**  \n---|---  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **$** |  **%**  \nProduct revenue (in thousands):   \nGvoke  |  $  |  22,942  |  $  |  17,735  |  $  |  5,207  |  29.4   \nRecorlev  |  17,726  |  8,097  |  9,629  |  118.9   \nKeveyis  |  12,193  |  15,865  |  (3,672  |  )  |  (23.1  |  )   \nProduct revenue, net  |  52,861  |  41,697  |  11,164  |  26.8   \nRoyalty, contract and other revenue  |  1,407  |  6,623  |  (5,216  |  )  |  (78.8  |  )   \nTotal revenue  |  $  |  54,268  |  $  |  48,320  |  $  |  5,948  |  12.3   \n  \n**_Commercial Products_**\n\n  * **Gvoke®** : Third quarter net revenue was $22.9 million as compared to $17.7 million in the third quarter of 2023 – an increase of approximately 29%. Gvoke prescriptions topped 70,000 for the first time, growing 20% compared to the same period in 2023. Gvoke’s share of the retail TRx glucagon market grew to approximately 36% at the end of October. \n  * **Recorlev®** : Third quarter net revenue was $17.7 million – an increase of 119% compared to the third quarter of 2023. This growth was driven by the average number of patients on Recorlev increasing 125% from the same period in 2023. On a sequential basis, Recorlev net revenue increased 33% versus prior quarter. \n  * **Keveyis®** : Third quarter net revenue was $12.2 million as compared to $15.9 million in the third quarter of 2023 - a decrease of approximately 23% driven by a reduction in patients on therapy. On a sequential basis, net revenue decreased 7% due to pharmacy reimbursement changes. \n\n\n\n**Year-to-Date 2024 Financial Results**\n\n**Nine Months Ended September 30,** |  **Change**  \n---|---  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **$** |  **%**  \nProduct revenue (in thousands):   \nGvoke  |  $  |  59,567  |  $  |  48,406  |  $  |  11,161  |  23.1   \nRecorlev  |  41,663  |  19,741  |  21,922  |  111.0   \nKeveyis  |  38,406  |  42,708  |  (4,302  |  )  |  (10.1  |  )   \nProduct revenue, net  |  139,636  |  110,855  |  28,781  |  26.0   \nRoyalty, contract and other revenue  |  3,335  |  8,669  |  (5,334  |  )  |  (61.5  |  )   \nTotal revenue  |  $  |  142,971  |  $  |  119,524  |  $  |  23,447  |  19.6   \n  \n  * **Gvoke®** : Net revenue was $59.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a 23% increase compared to prior year. Gvoke prescriptions for the nine months were approximately 194,000, growing approximately 24% compared to the same period in 2023. \n  * **Recorlev®** : Net revenue was $41.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a 111% increase from last year, driven by an increase in the number of patients on therapy. \n  * **Keveyis®** : Net revenue was $38.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a 10% decrease from last year due to a reduction in patients on therapy. \n\n\n\n**Cost of goods sold** increased $5.4 million and $6.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods ended September 30, 2023. These increases were primarily due to a $3.6 million write-off of Gvoke components resulting from manufacturing process changes required to support ongoing Gvoke capacity expansion efforts. \n\n**Research and development (R &D) expenses** increased slightly by $0.9 million and $3.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods ended September 30, 2023. R&D increased primarily due to higher spending for pipeline and personnel related expenses. \n\n**Selling, general and administrative (SG &A) expenses **increased by $7.7 million and $14.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the costs associated with the CEO succession plan and related restructuring ($6.1 million) as well as higher costs related to the Recorlev expansions, partially offset by lower external spending. \n\n**Net Loss** for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was $15.7 million, or ($0.11) per share, and $49.7 million, or ($0.34) per share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Excluding the impact of the CEO succession plan and related restructuring costs of $6.1 million, earnings per share was ($0.06) for the quarter or ($0.30) for the year-to-date. \n\n**Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments** at September 30, 2024 was $69.4 million, compared to $72.5 million at December 31, 2023. Total shares outstanding at October 31, 2024 was 149,081,461. \n\n**Conference Call and Webcast Details**\n\nXeris will host a conference call and webcast today at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss the Company’s financial and operational results. \n\nTo pre-register for the call, please go to the following link: [https://www.netroadshow.com/events/login?show=6c5018a9&confId=72180](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.netroadshow.com%2Fevents%2Flogin%3Fshow%3D6c5018a9%26confId%3D72180&esheet=54149478&newsitemid=20241108040671&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.netroadshow.com%2Fevents%2Flogin%3Fshow%3D6c5018a9%26amp%3BconfId%3D72180&index=1&md5=736b375db680fd26bd834bb902540534) After registering, a confirmation email will be sent, including dial-in details and a unique code for entry.

(Nasdaq: XERS), a fast-growing biopharmaceutical company committed to improving patient lives by developing and commercializing innovative products across a range of therapies, today announced financial results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024. \n\n“We are proud to report our record-breaking quarter with total revenue of our $54 million led by strong demand of Recorlev® and Gvoke®. Our product revenue growth of 27% marks the 12th consecutive quarter of over 20% growth,\" said John Shannon, CEO of Xeris. \"We have made investments in areas that drive growth, notably Recorlev®, and we are seeing the benefits of those investments. Given our exceptional year-to-date performance, we are raising our revenue guidance to $198-$202 million from the previous $190-$200 million. Looking ahead, our focus remains on continuing to drive greater than 20% product revenue growth and advancing our robust pipeline - namely our Phase 3 ready, XP-8121.\" \n\n“While delivering exceptional revenue growth, we held our total operating expenses relatively flat to last quarter when you exclude non-routine charges,” said Steven Pieper, CFO of Xeris. “We will continue to drive robust revenue growth, maintain our strong margin profile, and diligently manage expenses, which gives us confidence that the business is financially sound and does not require any dilutive financing to fund our growth.” \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Highlights**\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,** |  **Change**  \n---|---  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **$** |  **%**  \nProduct revenue (in thousands):   \nGvoke  |  $  |  22,942  |  $  |  17,735  |  $  |  5,207  |  29.4   \nRecorlev  |  17,726  |  8,097  |  9,629  |  118.9   \nKeveyis  |  12,193  |  15,865  |  (3,672  |  )  |  (23.1  |  )   \nProduct revenue, net  |  52,861  |  41,697  |  11,164  |  26.8   \nRoyalty, contract and other revenue  |  1,407  |  6,623  |  (5,216  |  )  |  (78.8  |  )   \nTotal revenue  |  $  |  54,268  |  $  |  48,320  |  $  |  5,948  |  12.3   \n  \n**_Commercial Products_**\n\n  * **Gvoke®** : Third quarter net revenue was $22.9 million as compared to $17.7 million in the third quarter of 2023 – an increase of approximately 29%. Gvoke prescriptions topped 70,000 for the first time, growing 20% compared to the same period in 2023. Gvoke’s share of the retail TRx glucagon market grew to approximately 36% at the end of October. \n  * **Recorlev®** : Third quarter net revenue was $17.7 million – an increase of 119% compared to the third quarter of 2023. This growth was driven by the average number of patients on Recorlev increasing 125% from the same period in 2023. On a sequential basis, Recorlev net revenue increased 33% versus prior quarter. \n  * **Keveyis®** : Third quarter net revenue was $12.2 million as compared to $15.9 million in the third quarter of 2023 - a decrease of approximately 23% driven by a reduction in patients on therapy. On a sequential basis, net revenue decreased 7% due to pharmacy reimbursement changes. \n\n\n\n**Year-to-Date 2024 Financial Results**\n\n**Nine Months Ended September 30,** |  **Change**  \n---|---  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **$** |  **%**  \nProduct revenue (in thousands):   \nGvoke  |  $  |  59,567  |  $  |  48,406  |  $  |  11,161  |  23.1   \nRecorlev  |  41,663  |  19,741  |  21,922  |  111.0   \nKeveyis  |  38,406  |  42,708  |  (4,302  |  )  |  (10.1  |  )   \nProduct revenue, net  |  139,636  |  110,855  |  28,781  |  26.0   \nRoyalty, contract and other revenue  |  3,335  |  8,669  |  (5,334  |  )  |  (61.5  |  )   \nTotal revenue  |  $  |  142,971  |  $  |  119,524  |  $  |  23,447  |  19.6   \n  \n  * **Gvoke®** : Net revenue was $59.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a 23% increase compared to prior year. Gvoke prescriptions for the nine months were approximately 194,000, growing approximately 24% compared to the same period in 2023. \n  * **Recorlev®** : Net revenue was $41.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a 111% increase from last year, driven by an increase in the number of patients on therapy. \n  * **Keveyis®** : Net revenue was $38.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a 10% decrease from last year due to a reduction in patients on therapy. \n\n\n\n**Cost of goods sold** increased $5.4 million and $6.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods ended September 30, 2023. These increases were primarily due to a $3.6 million write-off of Gvoke components resulting from manufacturing process changes required to support ongoing Gvoke capacity expansion efforts. \n\n**Research and development (R &D) expenses** increased slightly by $0.9 million and $3.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods ended September 30, 2023. R&D increased primarily due to higher spending for pipeline and personnel related expenses. \n\n**Selling, general and administrative (SG &A) expenses **increased by $7.7 million and $14.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the costs associated with the CEO succession plan and related restructuring ($6.1 million) as well as higher costs related to the Recorlev expansions, partially offset by lower external spending. \n\n**Net Loss** for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was $15.7 million, or ($0.11) per share, and $49.7 million, or ($0.34) per share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Excluding the impact of the CEO succession plan and related restructuring costs of $6.1 million, earnings per share was ($0.06) for the quarter or ($0.30) for the year-to-date. \n\n**Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments** at September 30, 2024 was $69.4 million, compared to $72.5 million at December 31, 2023. Total shares outstanding at October 31, 2024 was 149,081,461. \n\n**Conference Call and Webcast Details**\n\nXeris will host a conference call and webcast today at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss the Company’s financial and operational results. \n\nTo pre-register for the call, please go to the following link: [https://www.netroadshow.com/events/login?show=6c5018a9&confId=72180](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.netroadshow.com%2Fevents%2Flogin%3Fshow%3D6c5018a9%26confId%3D72180&esheet=54149478&newsitemid=20241108040671&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.netroadshow.com%2Fevents%2Flogin%3Fshow%3D6c5018a9%26amp%3BconfId%3D72180&index=1&md5=736b375db680fd26bd834bb902540534) After registering, a confirmation email will be sent, including dial-in details and a unique code for entry.
