The clearance enables Movano Health to pursue multi-billion dollar business opportunities for health monitoring solutions needed for applications such as clinical trials, post-clinical trial management, and remote patient monitoring for both healthcare providers and payors.\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/Movano\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1718078/Movano_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1718078/Movano_Logo.html)\n\nMovano Health Receives FDA Clearance for EvieMED Ring\n\n\"We launched the Evie Ring in the consumer wearable market, but our broader goal has always been to provide a clinical-grade device for B2B channels,\" said John Mastrototaro, President and CEO of Movano Health. \"This FDA 510(k) clearance marks a major milestone for the Company and expands our reach to pharmaceutical companies, medical device manufacturers and payors looking for a more accurate, consistent and comfortable health monitoring solution that would help improve compliance by fitting easily into patient lifestyles.\"\n\nIn anticipation of an expected 510(k) clearance, Movano Health has been collaborating with a number of potential partners operating across the entire healthcare industry spectrum and expects its partner pipeline to expand further following the news of a clearance. The Company is currently in the agreement phase with a large payor for a pilot study with the EvieMED Ring planned for early 2025 related to the health management of high-risk populations and is also in discussions with a global pharmaceutical company and leading clinical research organization (CRO) to use the EvieMED Ring in upcoming clinical trials. In addition, the EvieMED Ring was recently selected for a groundbreaking MIT study on long COVID and chronic Lyme disease.\n\n\"This milestone marks the beginning of our plans to accelerate distribution of EvieMED. With the significant foundational work in achieving our first clearance now behind us, we are eager to continue to collaborate with the FDA on securing additional clearances including respiration rate and other critical analytes and diagnoses,\" continued Mastrototaro. \"We also remain excited about the opportunities to leverage our proprietary radio frequency (RF) technology to address cuffless blood pressure and noninvasive glucose monitoring.\"\n\nPulse oximeters measure blood oxygen (SpO2) levels and heart rate, but conventional solutions have significant shortcomings and can be uncomfortable, discouraging compliance that is needed to ensure reliable information for evaluating a patient's health. The EvieMED Ring eliminates those limitations by combining the accuracy of a medical device with the comfort of a wearable that can be worn continuously, thanks in part to an award-winning design with a small gap in the ring surface and slight flex that accommodates finger swelling. A pivotal study also found that the EvieMED Ring produces accurate readings among users with darker skin tones as measured by the Fitzpatrick scale of skin color classification.\n\nIn addition, the EvieMED Ring collects wellness metrics including sleep, activity, temperature variability, calories burned and respiration rate that can give both patients and healthcare providers a broader picture of the user's overall wellness.\n\nThe EvieMED Ring will be available in eight sizes ranging from 5 to 12 to accommodate the widest selection of patients. \n\n**About Movano Health**\n\nFounded in 2018, Movano Inc.
