(Nasdaq: CYCN) and Tisento Therapeutics, Inc. today announced the closing of the previously disclosed asset purchase agreement. Tisento is launching with an $81 million Series A financing to support its development of the Phase 2 soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulator zagociguat in MELAS and other genetic mitochondrial diseases, as well as the company’s advancement of additional assets for serious diseases with unmet need.\n\nZagociguat is a first-in-class, brain-penetrant sGC stimulator that modulates the nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) pathway, a fundamental cell-signaling pathway, and has shown potential to treat both central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral symptoms of mitochondrial diseases. Phase 2a clinical data, generated by Cyclerion, showed rapid improvements in disease-associated biomarkers in patients with MELAS who received zagociguat for 28 days. In the study, zagociguat exhibited an excellent safety profile, exposure in the CNS and throughout the body consistent with once-daily oral dosing, and improvements across key domains of the disease pathophysiology including neuronal function, mitochondrial function, cerebrovascular hemodynamics, and inflammatory processes.\n\n“Tisento is launching with a Phase 2b-ready asset, compelling clinical data, an experienced team led by CEO Peter Hecht, committed investors, and an established network of healthcare providers and patient advocates. We have significant momentum and a strong sense of urgency to deliver on behalf of patients who currently have no treatment options,” said Bryan Roberts, PhD, Chair of the Board at Tisento and partner at Venrock. “The nitric oxide-cyclic GMP pathway has yielded a number of meaningful approved therapies. We are excited to extend the potential of this mechanism into the central nervous system by advancing the first brain-penetrant sGC stimulators. We are laser-focused on executing on our Phase 2b study of zagociguat in MELAS in order to build on the promising Phase 2a clinical data and deliver a potential new option for patients as quickly as possible.”\n\nMajor Cyclerion shareholders participated in Tisento’s Series A financing, including Invus, Peter Hecht, Polaris, and others. They are joined in the Tisento investor syndicate by Sanofi Ventures, Venrock, J. Wood Capital, and others.\n\nIn the transaction, Tisento acquired from Cyclerion zagociguat and CY3018, a CNS-targeted sGC stimulator in IND-enabling studies. Cyclerion received 10 percent equity ownership in Tisento with anti-dilution protection through $100 million in post-money valuation, as well as the right to purchase additional Tisento equity in the future. The Tisento equity ownership provides Cyclerion shareholders with the opportunity to benefit from future Tisento value creation without further financial or operational obligations for the Tisento assets. In addition, Cyclerion received a $10.4 million cash payment, consisting of an $8 million upfront payment and reimbursement for certain employee and development expenses related to zagociguat and CY3018 for the period between the signing and closing of the transaction. In conjunction with the asset sale, Peter Hecht invested $5 million in Cyclerion.\n\n“We are very pleased to have found a good solution to advance our promising brain-penetrant sGC development programs on behalf of patients with significant unmet medical needs,” said Errol De Souza, Chair of the Board at Cyclerion. “In the midst of this extremely challenging financing climate for the biotech industry, we’re honored to partner with an excellent syndicate of investors. The launch of Tisento supports the optimal advancement of zagociguat and CY3018 while providing Cyclerion with near-term capital and potential future value for our shareholders. With cash runway now extended into 2025, Cyclerion will continue to seek to create value via a highly efficient, externalized business model, initially targeting later-staged, de-risked, quick-to-advance CNS assets and, in parallel, explore mechanisms to further advance its systemic sGC stimulators.”\n\n* MELAS (Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like episodes)\n\n**About Cyclerion Therapeutics** Cyclerion Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company on a mission to develop treatments for serious diseases.
