Our consolidated revenue of 68,652 kEUR rose more than 14% compared to the same period last year, with increased revenue in all three of our business segments. Materialise Medical posted an especially strong quarter with revenue increasing more than 24%. At the same time, we grew our consolidated Adjusted EBIT by 89% to 4,408 kEUR without compromising our continued investments to drive future growth.”_\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Results**\n\nTotal revenue for the third quarter of 2024 increased 14.2% to 68,652 kEUR from 60,130 kEUR for the third quarter of 2023.

Segment Adjusted EBITDA amounted to 701 kEUR compared to 1,074 kEUR for the same period last year, while the segment Adjusted EBITDA margin was 2.6% compared to 4.3% for the third quarter of 2023. \n\nGross profit was 39,297 kEUR compared to 33,696 kEUR for the same period last year, while gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to 57.2% compared to 56.0% for the third quarter of 2023. \n\nResearch and development (“R&D”), sales and marketing (“S&M”) and general and administrative (“G&A”) expenses increased in the aggregate by 11.8% to 35,856 kEUR for the third quarter of 2024 from 32,076 kEUR for the third quarter of 2023. \n\nNet other operating income increased to 872 kEUR from 710 kEUR for the third quarter of 2023. \n\nOperating result amounted to 4,313 kEUR compared to 2,330 kEUR for the third quarter of 2023. \n\nNet financial result was (1,137) kEUR compared to 1,319 kEUR for the third quarter of 2023 reflecting the impact of unfavorable currency exchange effects. \n\nThe third quarter of 2024 contained income tax results of (138) kEUR compared to 363 kEUR in the third quarter of 2023. \n\nAs a result of the above, net profit for the third quarter of 2024 was 3,038 kEUR, compared to 4,013 kEUR for the same period in 2023. Total comprehensive income for the third quarter of 2024, which includes exchange differences on translation of foreign operations, was 3,777 kEUR compared to 3,242 kEUR for the corresponding 2023 period. \n\nAt September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 116,163 kEUR, compared to 127,573 kEUR at December 31, 2023. Gross debt amounted to 53,037 kEUR compared to 64,398 kEUR at December 31, 2023. As a result, our net cash position (cash and cash equivalents less gross debt) was 63,126 kEUR compared to 63,175 kEUR at December 31, 2023. \n\nCash flow from operating activities for the third quarter of the year 2024 was 6,870 kEUR, compared to 8,143 kEUR for the same period in 2023. Total capital expenditures for the third quarter of the year 2024 amounted to 7,328 kEUR. \n\nNet shareholders’ equity at September 30, 2024 was 246,989 kEUR compared to 236,594 kEUR at December 31, 2023. \n\n**2024 Guidance**\n\nMrs. de Vet-Veithen concluded _, “The consistently strong operational performance of our business segments throughout the first nine months of this year strengthens our confidence that our full-year 2024 revenues will be within our previously communicated range of 265,000 to 275,000 kEUR. In spite of the integration of the recent FEops acquisition, we are also maintaining our Adjusted EBIT guidance of 11,000 kEUR to 14,000 kEUR for fiscal year 2024.”_\n\n**Non-IFRS Measures**\n\nMaterialise uses EBIT, EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental financial measures of its financial performance. EBIT is calculated as net profit plus income taxes, financial expenses (less financial income) and shares of profit or loss in a joint venture. EBITDA is calculated as net profit plus income taxes, financial expenses (less financial income), shares of profit or loss in a joint venture and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA are determined by adding share-based compensation expenses, acquisition-related expenses of business combinations, impairments and revaluation of fair value due to business combinations to EBIT and EBITDA, respectively. Management believes these non-IFRS measures to be important measures as they exclude the effects of items which primarily reflect the impact of financing decisions and, in the case of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, long term investment, rather than the performance of the company’s day-to-day operations. The company also uses segment Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the performance of its three business segments. As compared to net profit, these measures are limited in that they do not reflect the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on the company’s indebtedness and, in the case of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, these measures are further limited in that they do not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in the company’s business, or the changes associated with impairments. Management evaluates such items through other financial measures such as financial expenses, capital expenditures and cash flow provided by operating activities. The company believes that these measurements are useful to measure a company’s ability to grow or as a valuation measurement. The company’s calculation of EBIT, EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. EBIT, EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as alternatives to net profit or any other performance measure derived in accordance with IFRS. The company’s presentation of EBIT, EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed to imply that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. \n\n**Exchange Rate**\n\nThis document contains translations of certain euro amounts into U.S. dollars at specified rates solely for the convenience of readers.

This represents growth of more than 6% compared to an already strong second quarter in 2023. We are especially pleased that all three of our business segments reported increased revenue. Materialise Medical turned in another strong performance, growing by 13%, while also Materialise Software and Materialise Manufacturing posted higher revenues. This solid topline performance enabled us to intensify our investments while maintaining net profitability. In another step forward, in July 2024 we acquired FEops, a Belgian company that develops AI-driven simulation technology to improve procedure efficiency and clinical outcomes for structural heart interventions. The acquisition positions Materialise to advance the personalized treatment of patients with heart diseases.”_\n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Results**\n\nTotal revenue for the second quarter of 2024 increased 6.2% to 68,797 kEUR from 64,810 kEUR for the second quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBIT increased to 3,872 kEUR for the second quarter of 2024 from (597) kEUR for the 2023 period. The Adjusted EBIT margin (Adjusted EBIT divided by total revenue) for the second quarter of 2024 was 5.6%, compared to (0.9)% for the second quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA increased to 9,188 kEUR for the second quarter of 2024 from 4,755 kEUR for the 2023 period. \n\nRevenue from our Materialise Medical segment increased 12.8% to 28,141 kEUR for the second quarter of 2024 compared to 24,945 kEUR for the same period in 2023. Segment Adjusted EBITDA amounted to 8,199 kEUR for the second quarter of 2024 compared to 2,683 kEUR while the segment Adjusted EBITDA margin was 29.1% compared to 10.8% for the second quarter of 2023. \n\nRevenue from our Materialise Software segment increased 1.8% to 11,226 kEUR for the second quarter of 2024 from 11,030 kEUR for the same quarter last year. Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased to 1,374 kEUR from 1,973 kEUR while the segment Adjusted EBITDA margin was 12.2% compared to 17.9% for the corresponding prior-year period reflecting the impact of increased development investments. \n\nRevenue from our Materialise Manufacturing segment increased 2.1% to 29,429 kEUR for the second quarter of 2024 from 28,835 kEUR for the second quarter of 2023. Segment Adjusted EBITDA amounted to 2,416 kEUR compared to 2,708 kEUR for last year’s same period, while the segment Adjusted EBITDA margin was 8.2% compared to 9.4% for the second quarter of 2023. \n\nGross profit was 39,227 kEUR for the second quarter of 2024 compared to 37,047 kEUR for the same period last year, while gross profit as a percentage of revenue remained stable at 57.0% compared to 57.2% for the second quarter of 2023. \n\nResearch and development (“R&D”), sales and marketing (“S&M”) and general and administrative (“G&A”) expenses increased in the aggregate by 10.4% to 36,631 kEUR for the second quarter of 2024 from 33,176 kEUR for the second quarter of 2023. \n\nNet other operating income was 1,205 kEUR compared to (4,468) kEUR for the second quarter of 2023. \n\nOperating result amounted to 3,801 kEUR compared to (597) kEUR for the second quarter of 2023. \n\nNet financial result was 1,033 kEUR compared to 635 kEUR for the second quarter of 2023. \n\nThe second quarter of 2024 contained income tax expenses of (959) kEUR, compared to (532) kEUR in the second quarter of 2023. \n\nAs a result of the above, net result for the second quarter of 2024 was 3,875 kEUR, compared to (494) kEUR for the same period in 2023. Total comprehensive income for the second quarter of 2024, which includes exchange differences on translation of foreign operations, was 3,093 kEUR compared to 140 kEUR for the corresponding 2023 period. \n\nAt June 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 125,492 kEUR compared to 127,573 kEUR at December 31, 2023. Gross debt amounted to 57,968 kEUR, compared to 64,398 kEUR at December 31, 2023. As a result, our net cash position (cash and cash equivalents less gross debt) was 67,524 kEUR, an increase of 4,349 kEUR compared to December 31, 2023. \n\nCash flow from operating activities for the second quarter of 2024 was 8,400 kEUR compared to 775 kEUR for the same period in 2023. Total cash out from capital expenditures for the second quarter of 2024 amounted to 8,459 kEUR. \n\nNet shareholders’ equity at June 30, 2024 was 243,140 kEUR compared to 236,594 kEUR at December 31, 2023. \n\n**2024 Guidance**\n\nMrs. de Vet-Veithen concluded, “ _Given the strength of our operational performance half-way through 2024 we believe that we are well on track to deliver the growth targets we set earlier. Accordingly, we continue to expect to report consolidated revenue for the full fiscal year 2024 within the 265,000 to 275,000 kEUR range we communicated earlier. We are also maintaining our Adjusted EBIT guidance of 11,000 kEUR to 14,000 kEUR for fiscal year 2024.”_\n\n**Non-IFRS Measures**\n\nMaterialise uses EBIT, EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental financial measures of its financial performance. EBIT is calculated as net profit plus income taxes, financial expenses (less financial income) and shares of profit or loss in a joint venture. EBITDA is calculated as net profit plus income taxes, financial expenses (less financial income), shares of profit or loss in a joint venture and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA are determined by adding share-based compensation expenses, acquisition-related expenses of business combinations, impairments and revaluation of fair value due to business combinations to EBIT and EBITDA, respectively. Management believes these non-IFRS measures to be important measures as they exclude the effects of items which primarily reflect the impact of financing decisions and, in the case of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, long term investment, rather than the performance of the company’s day-to-day operations. The company also uses segment Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the performance of its three business segments. As compared to net profit, these measures are limited in that they do not reflect the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on the company’s indebtedness and, in the case of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, these measures are further limited in that they do not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in the company’s business, or the changes associated with impairments. Management evaluates such items through other financial measures such as financial expenses, capital expenditures and cash flow provided by operating activities. The company believes that these measurements are useful to measure a company’s ability to grow or as a valuation measurement. The company’s calculation of EBIT, EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. EBIT, EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as alternatives to net profit or any other performance measure derived in accordance with IFRS. The company’s presentation of EBIT, EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed to imply that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. \n\n**Exchange Rate**\n\nThis document contains translations of certain euro amounts into U.S. dollars at specified rates solely for the convenience of readers.
