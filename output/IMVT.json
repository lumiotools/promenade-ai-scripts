(Nasdaq: IMVT)** , a clinical-stage immunology company dedicated to enabling normal lives for people with autoimmune diseases, today reported development updates and financial results for its fiscal second quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\nImmunovant continues to focus on moving rapidly to unlock the full potential of its lead asset, IMVT-1402, for the benefit of people with underserved autoantibody-driven diseases. With five IND applications now cleared, the company remains on course to initiate four to five potentially registrational clinical development programs by March 31, 2025. These INDs are expected to support evaluation of IMVT-1402 in a variety of indications and therapeutic areas. As previously announced, Immunovant anticipates initiating clinical trials evaluating IMVT-1402 in a total of ten indications by March 31, 2026.\n\n“Since announcing the Phase 1 data for IMVT-1402 a year ago, we have made tremendous progress in advancing IMVT-1402 towards multiple potentially registrational study initiations. We’re ahead of our goal to activate three INDs by calendar year end and we are very excited about all five cleared INDs – both those that have been announced and those that have not yet been announced. In terms of announced indications, we believe our first-in-class program with IMVT-1402 in GD has the potential to transform the treatment of GD patients who respond poorly to ATDs,” said Pete Salzmann, M.D., chief executive officer of Immunovant.\n\n“We are also excited to announce expansion of our IMVT-1402 development program into Rheumatology. Our first program in Rheumatology will be a potentially registrational study in patients with D2T RA where we believe that deeper IgG reduction has the potential to deliver better clinical outcomes in an important subset of patients with elevated RA-specific autoantibodies (ACPA). People living with D2T RA have already exhausted multiple therapeutic options yet continue to suffer from active disease, persistent disability and pain,” Salzmann continued. “We believe IMVT-1402 can deliver meaningful clinical benefit in ACPA-positive (ACPA+) D2T RA patients, with a potentially best-in-class profile driven by deeper IgG reduction.”\n\nFcRn inhibition represents an attractive mechanism as a potential treatment for the approximately 70,000 US patients with D2T, ACPA+ RA. Recently disclosed in-class data demonstrated that both higher baseline ACPA levels and deeper ACPA reduction correlated with better clinical improvement in ACPA+ RA patients treated with an FcRn inhibitor. Having received FDA clearance of the IND for IMVT-1402 in RA, Immunovant plans to initiate a potentially registrational trial in ACPA+ D2T RA by March 31, 2025. The trial builds on in-class learning in terms of its target population (enriched for above-normal ACPA levels) and trial design (open-label lead-in followed by randomized withdrawal). The trial will leverage IMVT-1402’s higher dose (600 mg) during the open-label induction phase of the clinical trial to maximize reduction in ACPA levels.\n\n**Recent Highlights and Upcoming Milestones**\n\n**Endocrinology Program**\n\nIn September 2024, Immunovant provided a GD program update consisting of new epidemiologic data characterizing unmet need in GD patients who are relapsed, uncontrolled or intolerant of ATDs, additional results from the batoclimab GD study, and an overview of the IMVT-1402 development program in GD. In November 2024, additional data on the efficacy and safety of batoclimab in Graves’ thyroidal and extrathyroidal disease were presented in an oral presentation at the American Thyroid Association (ATA) 2024 Annual Meeting. These data showed that a 60% response rate (defined as T3 and T4 falling below the upper limit of normal (ULN) without increasing the ATD dose) was achieved by Week 2, demonstrating the rapidity of response to batoclimab 680mg dosed weekly. Meaningful improvements in proptosis and lid aperture were also observed at both Week 12 and Week 24. Pronounced improvements in multiple Thyroid-Related Patient-Reported Outcomes (ThyPRO-39) measurement scales were also observed, with ATD-Free Responders (defined as T3 and T4 falling below the ULN and ceasing all ATD medications) reporting greater improvements than other participants.\n\nThe batoclimab data in Graves’ disease support the potential for deep IgG reduction to modify the underlying pathophysiology of the disease, which could enable a transformation of the treatment of Graves’ disease for patients not well controlled on ATDs. Immunovant remains on track to initiate the first potentially registrational trial of IMVT-1402 in GD by calendar year end.\n\nCompetition for clinical trial participants with acute, active TED has increased over the course of the company’s Phase 3 program to evaluate batoclimab for the treatment of thyroid eye disease (TED). As a result, top-line results are now expected to be available in the second half of calendar year 2025, along with a decision on whether to advance batoclimab to registration in TED. Data from this trial will be leveraged to inform the overall program in GD for the Company’s lead asset, IMVT-1402.\n\n**Neurology Program**\n\nAs previously reported, Immunovant completed enrollment of the batoclimab pivotal trial in MG, with top-line results expected to be reported by March 31, 2025. Results from this trial are expected to inform a decision regarding next steps for batoclimab in MG and the design of the MG program for IMVT-1402, which Immunovant expects to initiate by March 31, 2025.\n\nEnrollment of study participants has completed in the Phase 2b trial evaluating batoclimab in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) for those patients to be included in the period 1 data readout expected by March 31, 2025. A decision to enroll additional patients in the batoclimab CIDP study will be made following the readout of period 1 data. Those results, as well as observations drawn from public disclosures of other studies in CIDP, will be used to inform the trial design for a potentially registrational program for IMVT-1402 in CIDP.\n\n**Corporate Update**\n\nImmunovant also announced today that it appointed Melanie Gloria as Chief Operating Officer, effective November 18, 2024. Ms. Gloria brings over 20 years of experience in the biotechnology industry, including leadership roles at Acelyrin, Horizon Therapeutics and AbbVie. At AbbVie and Horizon she led teams to achieve global approvals of HUMIRA®, Viekera Pak®, Mavyret®, Skyrizi®, Rinvoq®, TEPEZZA®, and ORILISSA®. “I am thrilled to welcome Melanie to Immunovant where her success in driving late-stage drug development will be incredibly valuable,” said Salzmann. “Melanie’s proven drug development capabilities are a great fit for Immunovant’s portfolio.”\n\n**Webcast Details**\n\nImmunovant will host a webcast at 8:00 a.m. ET today to discuss these updates. **Please click register**[**here**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=JeplhmdTTn5gjT86H7zZzcTVgvYswYMhkLE5zWeMoSh8kbNbd-OWApEFRYiysabzR5liYgqBzw-BFkaf327xPGioFTEQkEJtHkkFi7oCfQM= \"Opens in a new window\")**to register for the event.** The live webcast will also be available under the News & Events section of Immunovant’s website.

Although Graves’ disease can affect any age group or gender, it occurs often in women younger than 40 years of age. In Graves’ disease, harmful IgG autoantibodies bind to and activate the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor present on the thyroid gland, stimulating excess thyroid hormone production. Existing treatments, which include antithyroid drugs, radioactive iodine, and thyroid surgery, are aimed at reducing thyroid hormone levels to lessen the severity of symptoms. These treatments have remained largely unchanged for the past 70 years.\n\n**About** **Immunovant,** **Inc.**\n\nImmunovant, Inc. is a clinical-stage immunology company dedicated to enabling normal lives for people with autoimmune diseases.

Immunovant also disclosed data from several proprietary market research studies that showed a consistent unmet need among ATD treated patients who are intolerant to, uncontrolled on or relapsed after ATDs. Finally, Immunovant also announced alignment with the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) and Investigational New Drug Application (IND) clearance with initiation of a pivotal trial of IMVT-1402 in GD expected by December 31, 2024.\n\nAs previously disclosed, the batoclimab phase 2a trial in uncontrolled GD enrolled patients who were hyperthyroid despite ATD therapy. Participants in the trial received 12 weeks of high dose batoclimab, 680 mg weekly by subcutaneous injection (SC) followed by 12 weeks of lower dose batoclimab, 340 mg weekly SC. At the end of the first 12 weeks, participants experienced a mean IgG reduction of 77% leading to a 76% Response rate (defined as T3 and T4 falling below the upper limit of normal (ULN) without increasing the ATD dose). In addition, by the end of 12 weeks of higher dose batoclimab, 56% achieved an ATD-Free Response (defined as T3 and T4 falling below the ULN and the patient simultaneously tapering completely off their ATD). Despite benefiting from a lower starting IgG level after 12 weeks of 680mg therapy, during Weeks 13 to 24, the lower 340mg dose of batoclimab resulted in mean IgG reduction of 65% (vs. 77% on 680mg dose) with a correspondingly lower responder rate of 68%. In addition, a lower ATD-Free Response rate of 36% was also observed in the second 12 weeks. Finally, patients who achieved at least a 70% IgG reduction at the end of the trial had nearly a threefold higher ATD-Free Response rate than those who did not (60% vs. 23%).\n\n“We are thrilled to share these updates today which we believe validate a large and important degree of unmet medical need in patients uncontrolled on ATDs and which we believe demonstrate strong response rates in this same population,” said Pete Salzmann, M.D., chief executive officer of Immunovant. “We find the correlation between clinical response and IgG lowering impressive and believe this creates not only a potential first-in-class but also a potential best-in-class opportunity for IMVT-1402. We are very pleased to have aligned with the FDA on a pivotal trial design that we expect to initiate by the end of the year.”\n\n**Webcast Details**\n\nImmunovant will host a webcast at 8:00 a.m. ET today to discuss these updates. **Please click**[**here**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=AeIOJmgrpyKp9CJ13Vq58Ue9GOsF2knmseV9y-NehWoLBphkCpxbr6gG6jKy_R-TcjsABhM7nb1ep5qYF_ND-8X-9dvOFYisXhLI8IK-3Ao= \"Opens in a new window\")**to register for the event.** The live webcast will also be available under the [News & Events](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=TLNs0xv6eeQeAEK2VnvwcjK7nfqNKJY90OhrHc5_stu_BhDUU7-n-u8RnvNO3GOOSZ0SuL5NKCWLI6AT2eDADFusXi6U-_SlI0yRjeDrdm1TeDu0SBzMa45J0ZR8aRN9 \"Opens in a new window\") section of Immunovant’s website.

(Nasdaq: IMVT)** , a clinical-stage immunology company dedicated to enabling normal lives for people with autoimmune diseases, today reported development updates and financial results for its fiscal second quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\nImmunovant continues to focus on moving rapidly to unlock the full potential of its lead asset, IMVT-1402, for the benefit of people with underserved autoantibody-driven diseases. With five IND applications now cleared, the company remains on course to initiate four to five potentially registrational clinical development programs by March 31, 2025. These INDs are expected to support evaluation of IMVT-1402 in a variety of indications and therapeutic areas. As previously announced, Immunovant anticipates initiating clinical trials evaluating IMVT-1402 in a total of ten indications by March 31, 2026.\n\n“Since announcing the Phase 1 data for IMVT-1402 a year ago, we have made tremendous progress in advancing IMVT-1402 towards multiple potentially registrational study initiations. We’re ahead of our goal to activate three INDs by calendar year end and we are very excited about all five cleared INDs – both those that have been announced and those that have not yet been announced. In terms of announced indications, we believe our first-in-class program with IMVT-1402 in GD has the potential to transform the treatment of GD patients who respond poorly to ATDs,” said Pete Salzmann, M.D., chief executive officer of Immunovant.\n\n“We are also excited to announce expansion of our IMVT-1402 development program into Rheumatology. Our first program in Rheumatology will be a potentially registrational study in patients with D2T RA where we believe that deeper IgG reduction has the potential to deliver better clinical outcomes in an important subset of patients with elevated RA-specific autoantibodies (ACPA). People living with D2T RA have already exhausted multiple therapeutic options yet continue to suffer from active disease, persistent disability and pain,” Salzmann continued. “We believe IMVT-1402 can deliver meaningful clinical benefit in ACPA-positive (ACPA+) D2T RA patients, with a potentially best-in-class profile driven by deeper IgG reduction.”\n\nFcRn inhibition represents an attractive mechanism as a potential treatment for the approximately 70,000 US patients with D2T, ACPA+ RA. Recently disclosed in-class data demonstrated that both higher baseline ACPA levels and deeper ACPA reduction correlated with better clinical improvement in ACPA+ RA patients treated with an FcRn inhibitor. Having received FDA clearance of the IND for IMVT-1402 in RA, Immunovant plans to initiate a potentially registrational trial in ACPA+ D2T RA by March 31, 2025. The trial builds on in-class learning in terms of its target population (enriched for above-normal ACPA levels) and trial design (open-label lead-in followed by randomized withdrawal). The trial will leverage IMVT-1402’s higher dose (600 mg) during the open-label induction phase of the clinical trial to maximize reduction in ACPA levels.\n\n**Recent Highlights and Upcoming Milestones**\n\n**Endocrinology Program**\n\nIn September 2024, Immunovant provided a GD program update consisting of new epidemiologic data characterizing unmet need in GD patients who are relapsed, uncontrolled or intolerant of ATDs, additional results from the batoclimab GD study, and an overview of the IMVT-1402 development program in GD. In November 2024, additional data on the efficacy and safety of batoclimab in Graves’ thyroidal and extrathyroidal disease were presented in an oral presentation at the American Thyroid Association (ATA) 2024 Annual Meeting. These data showed that a 60% response rate (defined as T3 and T4 falling below the upper limit of normal (ULN) without increasing the ATD dose) was achieved by Week 2, demonstrating the rapidity of response to batoclimab 680mg dosed weekly. Meaningful improvements in proptosis and lid aperture were also observed at both Week 12 and Week 24. Pronounced improvements in multiple Thyroid-Related Patient-Reported Outcomes (ThyPRO-39) measurement scales were also observed, with ATD-Free Responders (defined as T3 and T4 falling below the ULN and ceasing all ATD medications) reporting greater improvements than other participants.\n\nThe batoclimab data in Graves’ disease support the potential for deep IgG reduction to modify the underlying pathophysiology of the disease, which could enable a transformation of the treatment of Graves’ disease for patients not well controlled on ATDs. Immunovant remains on track to initiate the first potentially registrational trial of IMVT-1402 in GD by calendar year end.\n\nCompetition for clinical trial participants with acute, active TED has increased over the course of the company’s Phase 3 program to evaluate batoclimab for the treatment of thyroid eye disease (TED). As a result, top-line results are now expected to be available in the second half of calendar year 2025, along with a decision on whether to advance batoclimab to registration in TED. Data from this trial will be leveraged to inform the overall program in GD for the Company’s lead asset, IMVT-1402.\n\n**Neurology Program**\n\nAs previously reported, Immunovant completed enrollment of the batoclimab pivotal trial in MG, with top-line results expected to be reported by March 31, 2025. Results from this trial are expected to inform a decision regarding next steps for batoclimab in MG and the design of the MG program for IMVT-1402, which Immunovant expects to initiate by March 31, 2025.\n\nEnrollment of study participants has completed in the Phase 2b trial evaluating batoclimab in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) for those patients to be included in the period 1 data readout expected by March 31, 2025. A decision to enroll additional patients in the batoclimab CIDP study will be made following the readout of period 1 data. Those results, as well as observations drawn from public disclosures of other studies in CIDP, will be used to inform the trial design for a potentially registrational program for IMVT-1402 in CIDP.\n\n**Corporate Update**\n\nImmunovant also announced today that it appointed Melanie Gloria as Chief Operating Officer, effective November 18, 2024. Ms. Gloria brings over 20 years of experience in the biotechnology industry, including leadership roles at Acelyrin, Horizon Therapeutics and AbbVie. At AbbVie and Horizon she led teams to achieve global approvals of HUMIRA®, Viekera Pak®, Mavyret®, Skyrizi®, Rinvoq®, TEPEZZA®, and ORILISSA®. “I am thrilled to welcome Melanie to Immunovant where her success in driving late-stage drug development will be incredibly valuable,” said Salzmann. “Melanie’s proven drug development capabilities are a great fit for Immunovant’s portfolio.”\n\n**Webcast Details**\n\nImmunovant will host a webcast at 8:00 a.m. ET today to discuss these updates. **Please click register**[**here**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=JeplhmdTTn5gjT86H7zZzcTVgvYswYMhkLE5zWeMoSh8kbNbd-OWApEFRYiysabzR5liYgqBzw-BFkaf327xPGioFTEQkEJtHkkFi7oCfQM= \"Opens in a new window\")**to register for the event.** The live webcast will also be available under the News & Events section of Immunovant’s website.
