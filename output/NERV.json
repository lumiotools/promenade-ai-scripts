Interactions with the FDA continue with the goal of addressing questions raised in the CRL. \n\n**_Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results_**\n\n**Research and development (R &D) expense**: For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, R&D expense was $1.9 million and $3.4 million, respectively. R&D expense was lower versus the prior year period primarily due to lower costs associated with the FDA’s review of our NDA for roluperidone and lower compensation expenses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, R&D expense was $9.9 million and $8.0 million, respectively. R&D expense was higher versus the prior year period primarily due to higher subcontractor fees related to costs associated with our drug substance validation campaign and the conduct of the MIN-101C18 study, partially offset by lower compensation expenses.\n\n**General and administrative (G &A) expense: **For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, G&A expense was $2.5 million and $2.6 million, respectively. G&A expense was lower versus the prior year period primarily due to lower compensation expenses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, G&A expense was $7.4 million and $8.0 million, respectively. G&A expense was lower versus the prior year period primarily due to lower compensation expenses and professional service fees.\n\n**Non-cash interest expense** : For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, non-cash interest expense for the sale of future royalties was zero and $4.6 million, respectively, as compared to $2.1 million and $6.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The non-cash interest expense was lower versus the prior year periods primarily due to the change in the effective annual interest rate of the liability related to the sale of future royalties, whereby we no longer recognize interest on the liability as the effective annual interest rate is negative.\n\n**Other income:** For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, other income was $26.6 million and zero, respectively. Other income was higher versus the prior year periods due to the gain associated with the adjustment to the carrying amount of the liability related to the sale of future royalties.\n\n**Net income (loss):** Net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $22.5 million and $5.7 million, or a basic and diluted net income per share of $2.97 and $0.75, respectively, as compared to a net loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 of $7.8 million and $21.0 million or a basic and diluted net loss per share of $1.03 and $3.41, respectively.\n\n**Cash Position:** Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at September 30, 2024 were approximately $26.6 million, as compared to $41.0 million at December 31, 2023.\n\n**_About Minerva Neurosciences_**\n\nMinerva Neurosciences, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing product candidates to treat CNS diseases.
