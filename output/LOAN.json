(NASDAQ: LOAN)Your Solution for Hard Money Loans.\n\n# Annual Reports\n\n[![Annual Report](pdf/annual-report/annual_report_2023-2.jpg)](pdf/annual-report/annual-Report-2023.pdf)\n\n## [December 2023](pdf/annual-report/annual-Report-2023.pdf)\n\nFellow Shareholders, As an Israeli American, I have to start by condemning the vicious murders, rapes and kidnappings conducted by the terror organization Hamas on October 7th, 2023. I pray for the release of the hostages, and for the fast recovery of the injured and I offer my sincere condolences to the families of the murdered. I believe that our financial results for the year 2023 were impressive. We broke our record of both revenue and net earnings, while managing to avoid foreclosures and losses. Our low debt-to-equity ratio had become a major benefit in a high-interest environment, as we don’t pay higher interest on the majority of our capital, while charging higher interest on the entire portfolio.\n\n[![Annual Report](pdf/annual-report/annual_report_2022-2.jpg)](pdf/annual-report/annual_report_2022.pdf)\n\n## [December 2022](pdf/annual-report/annual_report_2022.pdf)\n\nFellow Shareholders, 2022 was a stormy year, yet we managed to operate above the weather. We earned a company record $5.2 million of net income and avoided losses that we believe were common for other hard money lenders throughout this rough period. At the beginning of the year we charged our borrowers around 9% interest plus initiation fees, and at the end of the year the interest charged to our borrowers was approxmiately 11.5% to 12% plus initiation fees, an increase of 2.5% to 3%. However, interest paid to our bank for the funds drawn against our line of credit increased by approximately 4.5%, from approximately 4% to approximately 8.5%. That significant increase prevented us from reaching a net earning of more than $0.45 per share, and therefore, in order to try to match net earnings with our dividends, we recently announced a quarterly dividend of $0.1125 (possibly reflecting $0.45 for the year) for the first quarter of 2023.\n\n[![Annual Report](pdf/annual-report/annual_report_2021-2.jpg)](pdf/annual-report/annual_report_2021.pdf)\n\n## [December 2021](pdf/annual-report/annual_report_2021.pdf)\n\nFellow Shareholders, When I founded Manhattan Bridge Capital in 1989, immediately after arriving in NYC from Israel, I didn’t imagine that the company would grow to become a leading Hard Money Lender in the New York Metropolitan area and in Florida, and operate as a mortgage real estate investment trust (REIT). We went a long way from starting in a basement in Flushing, Queens. I was 24 years old then and the company’s sole owner.\n\n[![Annual Report](pdf/annual-report/annual_report_2020-1.jpg)](pdf/annual-report/annual_report_2020.pdf)\n\n## [December 2020](pdf/annual-report/annual_report_2020.pdf)\n\nFellow Shareholders, I hope that you and your loved ones are well and safe. Who would have imagined that this crisis will still be dominating our lives in 2021? The scale of challenges in 2020 was unprecedented and it was a reality test for our mechanisms and system; yet, due to our conservative underwriting and disciplined loan policies, we prevailed and continued delivering an impressive performance, on-time cash dividends and increased shareholders’ value. \n\n[![Annual Report](pdf/annual-report/annual_report_2019-1.jpg)](pdf/annual-report/annual_report_2019.pdf)\n\n## [December 2019](pdf/annual-report/annual_report_2019.pdf)\n\nDear Shareholders, I hope that this letter finds you and your loved ones healthy and well. From the intensity of the current events and market conditions, 2019 seems like the distant past, and the challenges we dealt with last year seemlike a piece of cake versus what we are dealing with today. As you may recall, I anticipated a recession for some time. Money was too easy and too available in recent years, and our competition kept loosening underwriting standards and lowering interest rates.\n\n[![Annual Report](pdf/annual-report/cover2018.jpg)](pdf/annual-report/annual_report_2018.pdf)\n\n## [December 2018](pdf/annual-report/annual_report_2018.pdf)\n\nDear Valued Shareholder, Our challenge for 2018 was to continue to grow further while avoiding the new loose standards set by some of our competitors. Thanks to our solid position in the market-place as well as our strong reputation, we managed to achieve that goal. I am proud to present to you another year of record high revenue, record high net earnings of $0.48 per share and no loan defaults.\n\n[![Annual Report](pdf/annual-report/cover2017.jpg)](pdf/annual-report/annual_report_2017.pdf)\n\n## [December 2017](pdf/annual-report/annual_report_2017.pdf)\n\nDear Valued Shareholders, 2017 was an important year for Manhattan Bridge Capital. We successfully continued growing even in the face of intense competition in a market-place saturated with cash. Our robust sales and marketing network performed well and provided the needed deal flow in order to support our desired growth rate. Due to our solid loan portfolio, and lack of collection issues, our existing bank was willing to increase the size of our credit line. \n\n[![Annual Report](pdf/annual-report/cover2016.jpg)](pdf/annual-report/2016-Annual Report.pdf)\n\n## [December 2016](pdf/annual-report/2016-Annual Report.pdf)\n\nDear Valued Shareholders, 2016 was another record year at Manhattan Bridge Capital, Inc.

We achieved a number of successes: revenue increased 24.4% versus the prior year and net income increased from $0.9 to the impressive $0.14 per share (net after taxes). The even better news is that our continued growth both on revenue and net earnings seems to be continuing in 2014...\n\n[![Annual Report](pdf/annual-report/cover2012.jpg)](pdf/annual-report/annual2012.pdf)\n\n## [December 2012](pdf/annual-report/annual2012.pdf)\n\nDear Valued Shareholders, 2012 was a breakthrough year for Manhattan Bridge Capital.
