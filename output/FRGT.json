The Company’s Ordinary Shares will begin trading on a split adjusted basis on September 25, 2024.\n\nAs a result of the reverse share split, each twenty-five (25) pre-split Ordinary Shares of the Company will automatically combine into one (1) Ordinary Share without any action on the part of the holders, and the number of outstanding Ordinary Shares will be reduced from 35,844,999 to 1,433,800. The Company’s Ordinary Shares will continue to trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market (the “Nasdaq”) under the symbol “FRGT” but will trade under a new CUSIP number (G51413139).\n\nNo fractional shares will be issued as a result of the reverse share split. Shareholders who otherwise would be entitled to a fractional share because they hold a number of Ordinary Shares not evenly divisible by the one (1) for 25 reverse split ratio, will automatically be entitled to receive an additional fractional share of the Company’s Ordinary Shares to round up to the next whole share if they were to hold a fractional share less than one-half or more. Shareholders who hold a fractional share equal to less than one-half will have the fractional share cancelled.\n\nThe reverse stock split is intended to increase the per share trading price of the Ordinary Shares to satisfy the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq. Following the reverse stock split the Company will have approximately 1.43 million Ordinary Shares issued and outstanding, exclusive of shares issuable under outstanding options and warrants. The reverse stock split will not affect the number of total authorized Ordinary Shares of the Company.\n\nThe Company’s transfer agent, Transhare Corporation will act as the exchange agent.
