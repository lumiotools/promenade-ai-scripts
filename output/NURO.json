(Nasdaq: NURO) today reported financial and business highlights for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company develops proprietary non-invasive medical devices for the diagnosis and treatment of pain and neurological disorders. NeuroMetrix, Inc. is actively pursuing its previously announced review of strategic options to enhance shareholder value.\n\nOver the past several quarters, the Company has strengthened its Board of Directors, terminated common stock sales under its ATM program, implemented a reduction-in-force, and phased-out its legacy ADVANCE® business. As a result, operating expenses and cash usage have been lowered by over $0.5M per quarter. The Company continues to build the Quell® Fibromyalgia business via direct-to-physician marketing and sales to Veterans Health Administration facilities. \n\n**Q3 Business Highlights:**\n\n  * Quell revenue increased by 50% to $184,000 in Q3 2024 from $123,000 in Q3 2023. Quell revenue includes Quell Fibromyalgia (prescription) and Quell Relief (OTC).\n  * DPNCheck® revenue of $404,000 in Q3 2024 declined by $568,000 or 58% from Q3 2023. The primary DPNCheck market, Medicare Advantage (MA), is in the final year of the CMS phase-out of risk-adjustment compensation for many types of patient screening, including peripheral neuropathy. Potential opportunities in alternative markets are being pursued.\n\n\n\n**Q3 Financial Results:**\n\nRevenue in Q3 2024 of $0.6 million was lower by $0.6 million or 51% from Q3 2023. DPNCheck was the primary factor in the decline. Gross profit of $0.3 million was down by $0.5 million due to the DPNCheck revenue effect, the unfavorable shift in product mix, and lower production volume. Operating expenses of $2.1 million in Q3 2024, were reduced by $0.7 million or 25% from the prior year period. The Q3 2024 net loss was $1.5 million, or ($0.75) per share, versus $1.8 million, or ($1.66) per share, in Q3 2023. There were 2.0 million common shares outstanding at the end of Q3 2024 and 1.1 million shares outstanding at the end of Q3 2023.\n\nRevenue of $2.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 declined by $2.1 million or 47% from the comparable period in 2023. Net loss of $6.0 million, or ($3.10) per share, compared with the net loss of $4.9 million, or ($4.86) per share, during the 2023 period.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, cash, cash equivalents and securities totaled $14.8 million.\n\nThe Company believes it is in the best interests of shareholders that the strategic review process continues. There can be no assurance that this process will result in the Company pursuing or consummating any particular transaction or other strategic outcome. The Company has not set a timetable for completion of this evaluation process and may not disclose further developments unless disclosure is appropriate or necessary.\n\n**About NeuroMetrix **\n\nNeuroMetrix is a commercial stage healthcare company that develops and commercializes neurotechnology devices to address unmet needs in the chronic pain and diabetes markets. The Company's products are wearable or hand-held medical devices enabled by proprietary consumables and software solutions that include mobile apps, enterprise software and cloud-based systems.
