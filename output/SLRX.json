(NASDAQ: SLRX)**, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company using protein inhibition and protein degradation to develop cancer therapies for patients in need of new treatment options, today announced that investigators at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center’s Leukemia department presented clinical data on seclidemstat in patients with MDS and CMML at the 2024 European Hematology Association (EHA) Hybrid Congress. The meeting was held in Madrid and virtually from June 13-16, 2024.\n\nSeclidemstat is a novel oral, reversible, targeted LSD1 inhibitor. The poster was presented by Guillermo Montalban-Bravo, M.D. on June 14th, and is available on Salarius’ website, in the Investors, Events and Presentations section [here](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=pz_6sIZtqs22EbScF0VQZElEEfy3_Blb6WoGa1a6wL-XqQxHJAXDw8a6-b4DGPdNF8S3f1UmKF5XzidROKitraxa0X42yW1xML7wXJDssU-NwILP-MCThdpba3emErVFybrwO-NkQWB_Lxuvp9xBRA==).\n\nThe objective of this investigator-initiated Phase 1/2 dose-escalation study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose and overall response of seclidemstat in combination with azacitidine in adult patients with higher-risk MDS or CMML who previously failed or relapsed after hypomethylating agent therapy. As of May 2024, 16 patients were enrolled in this study with 14 patients evaluable for efficacy.\n\nAs presented at EHA, of the 14 evaluable patients for efficacy, 6 (43%) had an objective response including 1 complete response, 3 marrow complete responses, 1 marrow complete response plus hematological improvement and 1 hematologic improvement. The median overall survival was 18.5 months (95% CI, range 6.1-30.9 months), median event-free survival was 7.2 months (95% CI, range 6.3-8.2 months) and median follow-up time was 18.9 months (95% CI, range 0-48 months) from treatment initiation. As reported, overall survival after failing therapy with hypomethylating agents typically is 4-6 months.\n\n15 patients were evaluable for toxicity, with a dose-limiting toxicity observed in 1 patient in the 750mg BID cohort. Per protocol, the cohort was expanded to 3 additional patients. Based upon reported data, Salarius believes adverse events observed were manageable.\n\nThe Phase 1 dose-escalation portion of this study will evaluate up to six dose levels of seclidemstat. Cohort 5 (dose level 750mg BID seclidemstat in combination with azacitidine) is currently enrolling and cohort 6, the final cohort, will receive 900mg BID seclidemstat in combination with azacitidine. The maximum tolerated dose, which will inform the Phase 2 portion of the study, has not yet been reached.\n\n“We are encouraged by these promising results at this early stage of the study when seclidemstat is combined with azacitidine at doses below what we believe will be the recommended Phase 2 dose,” said William McVicar, Ph.D., Chairman of the Salarius Pharmaceuticals Board of Directors. “Patients who have failed prior treatments including hypomethylating agents have a poor prognosis and are in desperate need of new treatment options. With a 43% overall response rate, median overall survival of 18.5 months and median event-free survival of 7.2 months, we agree with the investigators that these results show promising early signs of activity in a high-risk MDS and CMML treatment failure population.”\n\n**About Salarius Pharmaceuticals**Salarius Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing therapies for patients with cancer in need of new treatment options.

(NASDAQ: SLRX)**, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company using protein inhibition and protein degradation to develop cancer therapies for patients in need of new treatment options, today announced that it will effect a 1-for-8 reverse stock split at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time, on June 14, 2024. Beginning with the opening of trading on June 17, 2024, Salarius’ common stock will trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market on a split-adjusted basis under a new CUSIP number 79400X404 and the Company’s existing trading symbol “SLRX.”\n\nThe reverse stock split is intended to enable Salarius to regain compliance with the $1.00 minimum closing bid price required for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market.\n\nAt a special meeting of stockholders held on May 9, 2024, Salarius’ stockholders approved the proposal to authorize Salarius’ Board of Directors to file an amendment to Salarius’ amended and restated certificate of incorporation (“Certificate of Incorporation”) to effect the reverse split at a ratio to be determined by the Board, ranging from 1-for-4 to 1-for-8. The specific 1-for-8 ratio was subsequently approved by Salarius’ Board of Directors and the reverse stock split will be effected by filing a Certificate of Amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. No further action is required by any stockholders in connection with approving or effecting the reverse stock split.\n\nThe reverse split will affect all issued and outstanding shares of Salarius’ common stock. At the effective time of the reverse stock split, the number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding will be reduced from approximately 4.7 million shares to approximately 0.6 million shares. All outstanding options and warrants entitling their holders to purchase shares of Salarius’ common stock will be adjusted as a result of the reverse split, as required by the terms of each security. The number of shares reserved for future issuance pursuant to Salarius’ 2015 Equity Incentive Plan and the number of shares reserved for future issuance pursuant to Salarius’ 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan also will be appropriately adjusted. The reverse stock split will affect all stockholders uniformly and will not affect any stockholder's ownership percentage of Salarius’ shares (except to the extent that the reverse stock split would result in some of the stockholders receiving cash in lieu of fractional shares). Stockholders will receive cash in lieu of fractional shares based on the closing price per share of Salarius’ common stock as quoted on the Nasdaq Capital Market on June 14, 2024. The reverse stock split will not reduce the number of authorized shares of common stock or preferred stock or change the par values of Salarius’ common stock (which will remain at $0.0001 per share) or preferred stock (which will remain at $0.0001 per share).\n\nEquiniti Trust Company, LLC, (“Equiniti”) is acting as the exchange agent and transfer agent for the reverse stock split. Equiniti will provide instructions to stockholders with physical certificates regarding the process for exchanging their pre-split stock certificates for post-split shares in book-entry form and receiving payment for any fractional shares.\n\nAdditional information about the reverse stock split can be found in the Company’s Definitive Proxy Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on March 26, 2024.

The 2022 net loss included a one-time non-cash expense of $8.9 million, or $4.17 per share, due to a loss on impairment of goodwill.\n  * Cash and cash equivalents were $5.9 million as of December 31, 2023, compared with $12.1 million as of December 31, 2022. The company collected all its remaining CPRIT payments during 2023.\n\n\n\nIn August 2023 Salarius announced a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives focused on maximizing shareholder value. While these efforts are ongoing, the Company continues to support its clinical programs, as appropriate, and the cost-savings measures approved by the Board of Directors are designed to enable the Company to continue supporting such activities. These measures included a reduction in certain executive, clinical and research and development staff, and the opportunistic engagement of consultants, among other activities.\n\n“During the second half of 2023 and the first months of 2024, Salarius reduced operating expenses, allowing us to extend our cash runway to generate additional clinical data in the seclidemstat hematologic and Ewing sarcoma clinical trials. We believe these data, if positive, will further enhance our opportunities to maximize shareholder value,” said William McVicar, Ph.D., Chairman of the Salarius Pharmaceuticals Board of Directors. “As previously announced, the MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) investigator-initiated hematologic cancer trial is active and enrolling patients, and we look forward to clinical trial updates later this year. The Company’s Ewing sarcoma Phase 1/2 study is not currently enrolling patients, but previously enrolled patients continue to be followed.”\n\n**Fourth Quarter Financial Results** Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $0.9 million, or $0.22 per share, compared with a net loss for the fourth quarter of 2022 of $6.4 million, or $2.83 per share. The decrease was due to the cost-savings plan implemented in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nResearch and development expenses were $0.06 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared with $4.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting the above-mentioned cost-savings plan.\n\nNet cash used for operating activities during the fourth quarter of 2023 was $1.5 million, compared with $4.7 million during the same quarter in 2022, reflecting the above-mentioned cost-savings plan.\n\n**Full Year Financial Results** Net loss for 2023 was $12.5 million, or $3.84 per share, compared with a net loss for 2022 of $31.6 million, or $14.88 per share. This reduction of approximately $19.1 million resulted from an $8.9 million one-time non-cash expense for impairment of goodwill in 2022, significantly lower research and development expenses and lower general and administrative expenses in 2023 resulting from the Company’s idled clinical trial in late 2022, and cost-cutting measures that began in the third quarter of 2023. Costs resulting from the acquisition and development of SP-3164 in 2022 did not repeat in 2023.\n\nResearch and development expenses were $7.2 million for 2023, compared with $15.8 million for 2022. The decrease was principally due to the company’s lower spending on SP-2577, which went on clinical hold during the fourth quarter of 2022 and remained idle through 2023, cost cutting measures undertaken beginning in the third quarter of 2023 and SP-3164 acquisition costs in 2022 that did not repeat in 2023.\n\nNet cash used in operating activities for 2023 was $12.8 million, compared with $17.6 million for 2022. The decrease was primarily due to lower overall operating loss in the current year.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, Salarius had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $5.9 million, compared with $12.1 million as of December 31, 2022. Current cash and cash equivalents are expected to fund the company’s planned operations into the first half of 2025.\n\n**Targeted Protein Inhibitor (Seclidemstat) Highlights** Seclidemstat (SP-2577) is a novel oral reversible inhibitor of the LSD1 enzyme that is being studied as a treatment for hematologic cancers in an investigator-initiated clinical trial at MDACC and in a Company-sponsored trial as a treatment for Ewing sarcoma.\n\nIn December 2022, researchers at MDACC reported interim clinical trial results evaluating seclidemstat in combination with azacitidine for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia patients who relapsed or progressed after hypomethylating agent therapy. Of eight evaluable patients, four (50%) had an objective response. These researchers reported a 90% probability of survival for 11 months in patients receiving seclidemstat plus azacitidine. Typically, overall survival is four to six months after failing therapy with hypomethylating agents. The hematologic cancer Phase 1/2 clinical trial being conducted at MDACC is now listed as active and recruiting on [clinical ](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ZzaeS4CKB4WAaHtXX607f9hLgxO-pfb-aMg9aZr8UgUDD7w3pemKeDhgqBo9oEFBXbJjMFdR06_BIMj2BK7fiSPMWtpD5LyIYVkrYLC9_O-NY2-AuhlU2XSq53pAkt564CQ9FwcMEDDjG06_w5d8X7wXtYa2Nm92-az8_-3-7v0=)[trials.gov](http://trials.gov) – trial NCT04734990.\n\nSeclidemstat has received fast track, orphan drug and rare pediatric disease designations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Ewing sarcoma and has been studied in a Company-sponsored Phase 1/2 trial evaluating its use in combination with topotecan and cyclophosphamide (TC) for the treatment of relapsed/refractory Ewing sarcoma. To date, 13 relapsed Ewing sarcoma patients, including five patients with first relapse and eight patients with second relapse, have been enrolled at 600 mg or 900 mg of seclidemstat dosed twice daily in combination with TC.\n\n  * The five first-relapse patients demonstrated a 60% objective response rate (ORR) and a 60% disease control rate (DCR), including one complete response and two partial responses. Among the three patients achieving objective responses, the median progression-free survival (mPFS) has not been reached with these patients still alive with disease control and objective responses at 17.4, 25.7 and 27.2 months, and increasing, after starting seclidemstat + TC combination therapy.\n  * The eight second-relapse patients demonstrated a 13% ORR, a 25% DCR and a mPFS of 1.6 months (range: 0.0 months to 10.7 months).\n  * Together, the 13 first- and second-relapse patients demonstrated a mPFS of 8.1 months (range: 2.0 months to 27.2 months). Five patients, or 38%, achieved confirmed disease control and progression has not been observed in any of these patients while on study.\n\n\n\nSalarius has completed the FDA Type B End of Phase 2 (EOP2) meeting process for the seclidemstat Ewing sarcoma development program and has amended the current clinical trial protocol to reflect guidance agreed to with FDA. There is currently one patient enrolled in the Ewing sarcoma clinical trial who recently achieved a partial response, defined as a 30% or greater reduction in their target lesions, and this patient is continuing treatment with seclidemstat plus TC therapy. The Ewing sarcoma trial is currently active but is not enrolling additional patients.\n\n**Targeted Protein Degrader (Molecular Glue) Highlights** SP-3164 is an oral, next-generation molecular glue that uses Salarius’ deuterium-enabled chiral switching platform to stabilize the preferred (_S_)-enantiomer of avadomide, an extensively studied clinical compound that has demonstrated encouraging single-agent and combination-therapy clinical efficacy in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and other hematologic malignancies. The addition of deuterium at the chiral center of the molecule prevents conversion to the unwanted _(R)_ -enantiomer, allowing for isolation and development of the preferred (_S_)-enantiomer into a potential new cancer treatment. In July 2023 the FDA cleared the Company’s investigational new drug (IND) application to commence a Phase 1 clinical trial with SP-3164 in patients with relapsed/refractory NHL. That trial has not commenced.\n\n**About Salarius Pharmaceuticals**Salarius Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing therapies for patients with cancer in need of new treatment options. Salarius’ product portfolio includes seclidemstat, its lead candidate, which is being studied as a potential treatment for pediatric cancers, sarcomas and other cancers with limited treatment options, and SP-3164, an oral small molecule protein degrader being developed for the treatment of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Salarius has received financial support from the National Pediatric Cancer Foundation to advance the Ewing sarcoma program and was a recipient of a Product Development Award from the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT).
