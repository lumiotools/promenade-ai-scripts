Reports Fiscal 2024 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Financial Results; Provides Initial Fiscal Year 2025 Financial Guidance; Discontinues Insulin Patch Pump Program; and Announces Restructuring to Streamline Operations and Reduce Costs\n\nNovember 26, 2024 \n\n[Q4'24 Earnings Release](/static-files/e6374e17-2f17-4cb6-a157-c978517214fb \"Q4 2024 EX-99.1_FINAL.pdf\") 307.5 KB\n\nPARSIPPANY, N.J., Nov. 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Embecta Corp. (“embecta” or the \"Company\") (Nasdaq: EMBC), a global diabetes care company, today reported financial results for the three- and twelve-month periods ended September 30, 2024.\n\n\"We are pleased to report a strong fourth quarter and end to our fiscal year, as we once again delivered results that exceeded our expectations across key financial metrics. We continued to execute on our strategic priorities, and to date, our significant accomplishments include the successful transition of approximately 98% of our revenue to our own ERP system, shared service capabilities, and distribution infrastructure, with India remaining as our only deferred market. Additionally, the recent launch of our small-pack GLP-1 needles in Germany has gone well, and we are evaluating expanding into other markets,\" said Devdatt (Dev) Kurdikar, Chief Executive Officer of embecta.\n\nMr. Kurdikar continued: \"As our stand-up work nears completion and following an in-depth review of our portfolio and strategy, we have decided to discontinue our insulin patch pump program and initiate an organizational restructuring plan. We believe this approach will streamline operations, reduce costs and enhance our profitability and free cash flow profile. We intend to concentrate our resources on our core business and to prioritize our free cash flow towards paying down debt which we expect will give us the financial flexibility needed for future investments.\"\n\nThe Company currently expects to incur total pre-tax charges of between $35 million and $45 million in fiscal year 2025 related to the restructuring plan, consisting of between $25 million and $30 million in pre-tax, cash charges for planned workforce reductions and other associated costs from the discontinuation of the patch pump program, and between $10 million and $15 million in pre-tax, non-cash charges for asset impairments and write-offs. Note, these preliminary estimates may be revised following the completion of the ongoing analysis of the expected additional pre-tax non-cash charges associated with the implementation of the restructuring plan.\n\nThe Company expects the restructuring plan to be substantially complete during the first half of fiscal year 2025 and expects the discontinuation of the patch pump program and organizational restructuring plan to generate annualized pre-tax cost savings of between $60 million and $65 million. Given the organizational restructuring plan, the Company has decided to postpone the previously announced Analyst & Investor Day to Spring 2025.\n\n**_Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Highlights_ :**\n\n  * Reported Revenues of $286.1 million, up 1.5%;\n\n  * Adjusted Revenues of $290.2 million, up 4.1% on an adjusted constant currency basis\n\n    * U.S. revenues increased 10.3% on both a reported and adjusted constant currency basis\n\n    * International revenues decreased 8.8% on a reported basis, and decreased 3.1% on an adjusted constant currency basis\n\n  * Gross profit and margin of $173.8 million and 60.7%, compared to $181.8 million and 64.5% in the prior year period\n\n  * Adjusted gross profit and margin of $178.3 million and 61.4% compared to $182.6 million and 64.8% in the prior year period\n\n  * Operating income and margin of $26.2 million and 9.2%, compared to $25.8 million and 9.2% in the prior year period\n\n  * Adjusted operating income and margin of $61.2 million and 21.1%, compared to $65.2 million and 23.1% in the prior year period\n  * Net income of $14.6 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.25.

The impact of changes in foreign currency may vary significantly from period to period, and such changes generally are outside of the control of our management. We believe that this measure facilitates a comparison of our operating performance exclusive of currency exchange rate fluctuations that do not reflect our underlying performance or business trends. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP. Results on an Adjusted constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not measures of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\n**_Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Results:_**\n\nRevenues by geographic region are as follows:\n\n**Three months ended September 30,**  \n---  \n_**Dollars in millions**_| **% Increase/(Decrease)**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **Reported****Revenue****Growth**| **Currency****Impact**| **Adjustment****Impact**| **Adjusted****Constant****Currency****Revenue Growth**  \n**Reported****Revenues**| **Adjustment**| **Adjusted****Revenues**| **Reported****Revenues**| **Adjustment**| **Adjusted****Revenues**| **%**  \nUnited States| $| 167.4| $| —| $| 167.4| $| 151.8| $| —| $| 151.8| 10.3| %| —| %| —| %| 10.3| %  \nInternational1| 118.7| (4.1| )| 122.8| 130.1| —| 130.1| (8.8| )| (2.6| )| (3.1| )| (3.1| )  \nTotal| $| 286.1| $| (4.1| )| $| 290.2| $| 281.9| $| —| $| 281.9| 1.5| %| (1.2| )%| (1.4| )%| 4.1| %  \n  \nRevenues by product family are as follows:\n\n**Three months ended September 30,**  \n---  \n_**Dollars in millions**_| **% Increase/(Decrease)**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **Reported****Revenue****Growth**| **Currency****Impact**| **Adjustment****Impact**| **Adjusted****Constant****Currency****Revenue Growth**  \n**Reported****Revenues**| **Adjustment**| **Adjusted Revenues**| **Reported****Revenues**| **Adjustment**| **Adjusted Revenues**| **%**  \nPen Needles| $| 215.2| $| —| $| 215.2| $| 211.1| $| —| $| 211.1| 1.9| %| (0.9| )%| —| %| 2.8| %  \nSyringes| 33.7| —| 33.7| 33.2| —| 33.2| 1.5| (3.3| )| —| 4.8  \nSafety| 32.8| —| 32.8| 31.3| —| 31.3| 4.8| (1.0| )| —| 5.8  \nOther2| (0.3| )| (4.1| )| 3.8| 3.9| —| 3.9| (107.7| )| (5.1| )| (102.6| )| —  \nContract Manufacturing| 4.7| —| 4.7| 2.4| —| 2.4| 95.8| —| —| 95.8  \nTotal| $| 286.1| $| (4.1| )| $| 290.2| $| 281.9| $| —| $| 281.9| 1.5| %| (1.2| )%| (1.4| )%| 4.1| %  \n  \n1 In 2024, International includes the recognition of incremental Italian payback accruals resulting from the two July 22, 2024 rulings by the Constitutional Court of Italy relating to certain prior years since 2015 in order to arrive at Adjusted Revenues.2 Other includes product revenue for swabs and other accessories. In 2024, Other reflects the recognition of incremental Italian payback accruals resulting from the two July 22, 2024 rulings by the Constitutional Court of Italy relating to certain prior years since 2015 in order to arrive at Adjusted Revenues.\n\nOur revenues increased by $4.2 million, or 1.5%, to $286.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2024 as compared to revenues of $281.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. Changes in our revenues are driven by the volume of goods that we sell, the prices we negotiate with customers and changes in foreign exchange rates. The increase in revenues was driven by $13.7 associated with favorable changes in price and a $2.3 increase in contract manufacturing revenues related to sales of non-diabetes products to BD. This was partially offset by $5.3 million of unfavorable gross-to-net adjustments primarily attributed to the recognition of incremental Italian payback accruals resulting from the two July 22, 2024 rulings by the Constitutional Court of Italy, $3.4 million associated with the negative impact of foreign currency translation primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, and $3.1 million of unfavorable changes in volume.\n\n**_Twelve Months Fiscal Year 2024 Results:_**\n\nRevenues by geographic region are as follows:\n\n**Twelve months ended September 30,**  \n---  \n_**Dollars in millions**_| **% Increase/(Decrease)**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **Reported****Revenue****Growth**| **Currency****Impact**| **Adjustment****Impact**| **Adjusted****Constant****Currency****Revenue Growth**  \n**Reported****Revenues**| **Adjustment**| **Adjusted****Revenues**| **Reported****Revenues**| **Adjustment**| **Adjusted****Revenues**| **%**  \nUnited States| $| 607.2| $| —| $| 607.2| $| 601.4| $| —| $| 601.4| 1.0| %| —| %| —| %| 1.0| %  \nInternational1| 515.9| (4.1| )| 520.0| 519.4| —| 519.4| (0.7| )| (1.2| )| (0.8| )| 1.3  \nTotal| $| 1,123.1| $| (4.1| )| $| 1,127.2| $| 1,120.8| $| —| $| 1,120.8| 0.2| %| (0.5| )%| (0.4| )%| 1.1| %  \n  \nRevenues by product family are as follows:\n\n**Twelve months ended September 30,**  \n---  \n_**Dollars in millions**_| **% Increase/(Decrease)**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **Reported****Revenue****Growth**| **Currency****Impact**| **Adjustment****Impact**| **Adjusted****Constant****Currency****Revenue Growth**  \n**Reported****Revenues**| **Adjustment**| **Adjusted****Revenues**| **Reported****Revenues**| **Adjustment**| **Adjusted****Revenues**| **%**  \nPen Needles| $| 844.4| $| —| $| 844.4| $| 829.2| $| —| $| 829.2| 1.8| %| (0.8| )%| —| %| 2.6| %  \nSyringes| 126.2| —| 126.2| 138.1| —| 138.1| (8.6| )| 0.2| —| (8.8| )  \nSafety| 129.4| —| 129.4| 126.3| —| 126.3| 2.5| —| —| 2.5  \nOther2| 10.3| (4.1| )| 14.4| 14.2| —| 14.2| (27.5| )| —| (28.2| )| 0.7  \nContract Manufacturing| 12.8| —| 12.8| 13.0| —| 13.0| (1.5| )| —| —| (1.5| )  \nTotal| $| 1,123.1| $| (4.1| )| $| 1,127.2| $| 1,120.8| $| —| $| 1,120.8| 0.2| %| (0.5| )%| (0.4| )%| 1.1| %  \n  \n1 In 2024, International includes the recognition of incremental Italian payback accruals resulting from the two July 22, 2024 rulings by the Constitutional Court of Italy relating to certain prior years since 2015 in order to arrive at Adjusted Revenues. 2 Other includes product sales for swabs and other accessories.

These non-GAAP financial measures are indicators of our performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. They are presented with the intent of providing greater transparency to financial information used by us in our financial analysis and operational decision-making. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to assist investors, stockholders and other readers of our consolidated financial statements in making comparisons to our historical operating results and analyzing the underlying performance of our results of operations. However, the presentation of these measures has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for the company’s results as reported under GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, the presentations of these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. The Company uses non-GAAP financial measures in its operational and financial decision making, and believes that it is useful to exclude certain items in order to focus on what it regards to be a meaningful alternative representation of the underlying operating performance of the business.\n\nFor the three- and twelve-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the reconciliation of (1) GAAP Revenues (\"Reported Revenues\") to Adjusted Revenues and (2) GAAP Net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA was as follows (unaudited, in millions)\n\n**Three Months Ended****September 30,**| **Twelve Months Ended****September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \n**Reported Revenues**| **$**| **286.1**| **$**| **281.9**| **$**| **1,123.1**| **$**| **1,120.8**  \nItalian payback measure (1)| 4.1| —| 4.1| —  \n**Adjusted Revenues**| **$**| **290.2**| **$**| **281.9**| **$**| **1,127.2**| **$**| **1,120.8**  \n**GAAP Net Income**| **$**| **14.6**| **$**| **6.0**| **$**| **78.3**| **$**| **70.4**  \nInterest expense, net| 29.0| 27.6| 112.3| 107.0  \nIncome taxes| (21.6| )| (1.0| )| (34.1| )| 35.3  \nDepreciation and amortization| 9.5| 9.3| 36.2| 32.6  \n**EBITDA**| **$**| **31.5**| **$**| **41.9**| **$**| **192.7**| **$**| **245.3**  \nStock-based compensation expense (2)| 6.2| 4.9| 26.6| 21.9  \nOne-time stand up costs (3)| 26.2| 31.8| 111.2| 93.7  \nEuropean regulatory initiative-related costs (\"EU MDR\") (4)| 0.2| 0.6| 0.5| 1.3  \nBusiness optimization and severance related costs (5)| 1.7| 2.6| 7.4| 5.6  \nImpairment losses (6)| —| 2.5| —| 2.5  \nDeferred jurisdiction adjustments in Other income (expense), net for taxes (7)| 0.6| (4.7| )| 4.6| 8.4  \nAmortization of cloud computing arrangements (8)| 2.5| —| 6.3| —  \nItalian payback measure (1)| 4.1| —| 4.1| —  \n**Adjusted EBITDA**| **$**| **73.0**| **$**| **79.6**| **$**| **353.4**| **$**| **378.7**  \n _**Adjusted EBITDA Margin**_|  _**25.2**_|  _**%**_| _**28.2**_|  _**%**_| _**31.4**_|  _**%**_| _**33.8**_|  _**%**_  \n  \n1| Reflects the recognition of incremental Italian payback accruals resulting from the two July 22, 2024 rulings by the Constitutional Court of Italy relating to certain prior years since 2015 recorded in Revenues.  \n---|---  \n2.| Represents stock-based compensation expense incurred during the three and twelve months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

These forward-looking statements concern our current expectations regarding our future results from operations, performance, financial condition, goals, strategies, plans and achievements. These forward-looking statements are subject to various known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, and you should not rely upon them except as statements of our present intentions and of our present expectations, which may or may not occur. When we use words such as \"believes,\" \"expects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"estimates,\" \"plans,\" \"intends\", “pursue”, “will”, “may” or similar expressions, we are making forward-looking statements. For example, embecta is using forward-looking statements when it discusses its plans to discontinue its patch pump program, concentrate its resources on its core business, prioritize free cash flow towards paying down debt, and create financial flexibility for future investments, its ability to reduce costs, streamline operations and enhance profitability, its expected savings and expenses from its organizational restructuring and the timing thereof, its fiscal 2025 financial guidance and its expectations with respect to strengthening its base business, separating and standing up embecta as an independent company, and investing in growth, and geographic expansion of new product pacts for non-insulin diabetes drugs. Although we believe that our forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, our expected results may not be achieved, and actual results may differ materially from our expectations. In addition, important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations include, among others: (i) competitive factors that could adversely affect embecta’s operations; (ii) any inability to extend or replace the services provided by BD under the transaction documents; (iii) any failure by BD to perform its obligations under the various separation agreements entered into in connection with the separation and distribution; (iv) any events that adversely affect the sale or profitability of embecta’s products or the revenues delivered from sales to its customers; (v) increases in operating costs, including fluctuations in the cost and availability of raw materials or components used in its products, the ability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relationships, and the potential adverse effects of any disruption in the availability of such items; (vi) changes in reimbursement practices of governments or private payers or other cost containment measures; (vii) the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as regional, national and foreign economic factors, including inflation, deflation, and fluctuations in interest rates; (viii) the impact of changes in U.S. federal laws and policy that could affect fiscal and tax policies, healthcare and international trade, including import and export regulation and international trade agreements; (ix) any new pandemic, or any geopolitical instability, including disruptions in its operations and supply chains; (x) new or changing laws and regulations, or changes in enforcement practices, including laws relating to healthcare, environmental protection, trade, monetary and fiscal policies, taxation and licensing and regulatory requirements for products; (xi) the expected benefits of the separation from BD; (xii) risks associated with embecta’s indebtedness; (xiii) the risk that ongoing dis-synergy costs, costs of restructuring and other costs incurred in connection with the separation from BD will exceed our estimates of these costs; (xiv) the risk that it will be more difficult than expected to effect embecta’s full separation from BD; (xv) expectations related to the costs, profitability, timing and the estimated financial impact of, and charges and savings associated with, the restructuring plan we announced; (xvi) risks associated with not completing strategic collaborative partnerships and acquisitions for innovative technologies, complementary product lines, and new markets; and (xvii) the other risks described in our periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including under the caption “Risk Factors” in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, as further updated by our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q we have filed or will file hereafter. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements appearing in this release.\n\n**CONTACTS**\n\n**Investors:** Pravesh KhandelwalVP, Head of Investor Relations551-264-6547[ _Contact IR_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=OPSC5ROtOtL7HRdoTCilzr_pufNKODbNEQ5gZna9YBvxe2bD-hMKVIhHYja0i47JNBv8a_5XSxq3E5Olr0fkCvUTcVLcpZG89hC_WOV6-MQ=)\n\n**Media:** Christian GlazarSr. Director, Corporate Communications 908-821-6922[ _Contact Media Relations_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=OPSC5ROtOtL7HRdoTCilznZ3yLExS1J6F7Ke1Bd4zpUj0Hp7xdvoPsXBzl7GGNM0aNTdhsN6k2AdHfav7kIXnumpXTaoOWsMORE5qilEoEnOBqt4jCtbjjYHMjLHP3UR)\n\n![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/MGY1NGYyZjAtMTc3My00MTI2LWE4ZTktYTU5ODljYjA5Y2M4LTEyNTYxMjI=/tiny/Embecta-Corp-.png)\n\n## Stay Informed with Email Alerts\n\n[Sign Up](/shareholder-services/email-alerts)\n"
