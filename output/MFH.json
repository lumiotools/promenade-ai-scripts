The\nfinancial information related to the two divested VIEs have been reclassified in the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations for the\nyear ended December 31, 2021.\n(ii) On December 29, 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the proposal on the share consolidation to the authorized share capital (the \"Share Consolidation”) at a\nratio of four hundred (400)-for-one (1) with the par value of each ordinary share changed to US$0.004 per ordinary share, which has been effective on February 28, 2023.\nAs SAB 4C, changes to a stock dividend, stock split or reverse split in the capital structure must be given retroactive effect in the balance sheet.

Capitalization and Indebtedness\nNot applicable.\nC. Reasons for the Offer and Use of Proceeds\nNot applicable.\nD. Risk Factors\nSummary of Risk Factors\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry\n● We have a limited operating history in the evolving industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and may increase the risk that we will not be\nsuccessful.\n● We currently have a limited customer base for our Business consultation services. If we were to lose any of our customers, or if the volume of business with such\ncustomers were to decrease, or if we are unable to offer services that attract new customers from existing customers, our business, financial condition and results of\noperations may be materially and adversely affected.\n● Certain crypto assets and cryptocurrencies have been identified as a \"security” in certain jurisdictions, and we may be subject to regulatory scrutiny, inquiries,\ninvestigations, fines and other penalties, which may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\n● As we acquire, dispose of or restructure our businesses, product lines, and technologies, we may encounter unforeseen costs and difficulties that could adversely affect\nour financial performance.\n● We may be unable to competitively engage in further distributed storage and computing services, Business consultation services, financial advisory services and\nsecurities brokerage services activities, if we cannot attract or retain employees and/or consultants who have expertise in these fields.\n● Any harm to our Mercurity brand or reputation may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n● We have a history of operating losses, and we may report additional operating losses in the future.\n● If we are unable to conduct adequate and cost-effective marketing activities, our results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\n● If our senior management is unable to work together effectively or efficiently or if we lose their services, our business may be severely disrupted.\n● We have limited insurance coverage and could incur losses resulting from liability claims or business interruptions.\n● We are subject to changing laws and regulations regarding regulatory matters, corporate governance and public disclosure that may increase both our operating costs\nand the risk of non-compliance.\n● We have failed to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, and\ninvestor confidence and the market price of our shares may be adversely impacted.\n● The enactment of legislation imposing moratoriums on issuing permits for certain cryptocurrency mining operations that use carbon-based power sources and similar laws\ncould adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\n6\n● Blockchain mining activities are energy-intensive, which may restrict the geographic locations of miners and have a negative environmental impact.\n● Environmental concerns associated with cryptocurrencies mining could have adverse impacts on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n● We are subject to an extensive, highly evolving and uncertain regulatory landscape and any adverse changes to, or our failure to comply with, any laws and regulations\ncould adversely affect our brand, reputation, business, operating results, and financial condition.\n● Our operating results may fluctuate and continue to fluctuate, including due to the highly volatile nature of crypto.\n● Fluctuations in Filecoin value might impact our operating results and add to our regulatory compliance obligations under applicable law and regulation, including the\nInvestment Company Act of 1940.\n● Our revenue is partially dependent on the prices of crypto assets. If such price or volume declines, our business, operating results and financial condition would be\nadversely affected.\n● The future development and growth of crypto is subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to predict and evaluate. If crypto does not grow as we expect, our\nbusiness, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n● Any failure to safeguard and manage our crypto assets could adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\n● The theft, loss or destruction of private keys required to access any crypto assets held in custody for our own account may be irreversible. If we are unable to access our\nprivate keys or if we experience a hack or other data loss relating to our ability to access any crypto assets, it could cause regulatory scrutiny, reputational harm and other\nlosses.\n● Any gaps in our risk management processes and policies in respect of crypto asset could adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\n● Crypto assets deposited with third party custodians are subject to risks attendant with such custody arrangements. If such custodians were to become insolvent, or\nsuffer from hacking or cybersecurity or other technical failures, or if our assets were to be misused or lost, we may lose ownership or control of our crypto assets, and we\nmay not be able to recover our losses through legal or other channels.\n● The assertion of jurisdiction by U.S. and foreign regulators and other government entities over crypto assets and crypto asset markets could adversely impact our\nbusiness, operating results and financial condition.\n● If we were deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, applicable restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our business as\ncontemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Relating to Doing Business in the PRC\n● We conduct a portion of our business operations in China and are subject to the attendant risks of operating in China, including regulatory risks resulting from political\nand regulatory changes which may be swift and unexpected.\n● You may incur additional costs and procedural obstacles in effecting service of legal process, enforcing foreign judgments or bringing actions in Hong Kong against us or\nour management based on Hong Kong laws.\n● You may experience difficulties in effecting service of legal process, enforcing foreign judgments or bringing actions in the PRC against us or our management based on\nforeign laws.\n7\n● We may rely on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by our PRC and Hong Kong subsidiaries to fund any cash and financing requirements we may have, and\nany limitation on the ability of our PRC and Hong Kong subsidiaries to make payments to us could have a material and adverse effect on our ability to conduct our\nbusiness.\n● Regulation and censorship of information disseminated over the internet in the PRC could adversely affect our business in China, and we may be liable for any such\ninformation displayed on, retrieved from or linked to our website.\n● A failure by our shareholders or beneficial owners who are PRC citizens or residents in the PRC to comply with certain PRC foreign exchange regulations could restrict our\nability to distribute profits, restrict our overseas and cross-border investment activities or subject us to liability under PRC laws, which could adversely affect our\nbusiness and financial condition.\n● A failure to comply with PRC regulations regarding the registration of shares and share options held by our employees who are PRC citizens could subject such\nemployees or us to fines and legal or administrative sanctions.\n● It may be difficult for overseas regulators to conduct investigations or collect evidence within PRC.\n● It may be difficult for overseas shareholders and/or regulators to conduct investigations or collect evidence within Hong Kong.\nRisks Relating to Our Ordinary Shares\n● The trading price of our shares could be volatile, which would result in substantial losses to investors.\n● Substantial future sales of our shares in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause our share price to decline.\n● If we fail to maintain the Nasdaq minimum market value of publicly held shares, minimum bid requirements or minimum stockholder equity standard, our shares could be\ndelisted.\n● We are a foreign private issuer within the meaning of the rules under the Exchange Act, and as such we are exempt from certain provisions applicable to U.S. domestic\npublic companies.\n● As a foreign private issuer, we are permitted to, and we plan to, rely on exemptions from certain Nasdaq corporate governance standards applicable to U.S. issuers,\nincluding the requirement that a majority of an issuer’s directors consist of independent directors. This might afford less protection to holders of our shares.\n● Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents could discourage a third-party from acquiring us, which could limit our shareholders’ opportunities to sell their shares\nat a premium.\n● We are a Cayman Islands company and, because judicial precedent regarding the rights of shareholders is more limited under Cayman Islands law than under U.S. law,\nyou could have less protection of your shareholder rights than you would under U.S. law.\n● You will have limited ability to bring an action against us or against our directors and officers, or to enforce a judgment against us or them, because we are incorporated in\nthe Cayman Islands, because we conduct parts of our operations in the PRC and Hong Kong and because some of our directors and officers reside outside the United\nStates.\n● Compliance with rules and requirements applicable to public companies could cause us to incur increased costs, which could negatively affect our results of operations.\n8\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry\nWe have a limited operating history in the evolving industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful.\nWe disposed of our business of providing integrated B2B services to food service suppliers and customers in July 2019. We started to provide blockchain technical services\nin May 2019. Due to the extremely adverse regulatory measures taken by the Chinese government in 2021 in the field of digital currency production and transaction, we disposed of\nthe Chinese companies of the blockchain technical services business controlled through VIE agreements in January 2022. We commenced cryptocurrency mining operations in\n2021 and expanded this line of business in the U.S. in December 2022. We commenced business consultation services in August 2022.\nThe limited history of our current operations may make it difficult for you to evaluate our business, financial performance and prospects, and our historical growth rate might\nnot be indicative of our future performance. We cannot assure you that our current business will grow as rapidly as we expect or achieve the critical mass needed for long-term\nsuccess. Given the limited history of our business model and the rapid developments in the related industry, it may be difficult to predict if our expected business growth can be\nachieved in the future, and that the market might evolve in ways that are difficult to anticipate. You should consider our prospects considering risks and uncertainties that\ncompanies in a rapidly evolving market might encounter. These risks and difficulties include, but are not limited to:\n● a new and relatively unproven business model;\n● our ability to anticipate and adapt to a fast developing market and industry;\n● market acceptance of our products and services;\n● high expenditures associated with our technology upgrading, brand promotion and marketing activities;\n● our ability to attract customers and business partners to generate sufficient cash flows;\n● Complexities in managing rapid expansion of personnel and operations; and\n● our ability to compete in the fast-changing marketplace.\nWe cannot be certain that our business strategy will be successful or that we will successfully address these risks. Failure to address any of the risks described above could\nhave an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe currently have a limited customer base for our business consultation services. If we were to lose any of our customers, or if the volume of business with such customers\nwere to decrease, or if we are unable to offer services that attract new customers from existing customers, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be\nmaterially and adversely affected.\nIn July 2022, we added consultation services to our business, providing business consultation services to global corporate clients, especially those in the blockchain industry.\nMeanwhile, we conducted viability studies about the business models, license requirements and operational costs of online and traditional brokerage services and digital payment\nbusiness and have been expanding our business into the online and traditional brokerage services, such as building up client base and acquiring the necessary licenses. However,\ndue to resource restraints, we have ceased our development plans in digital payment business, including digital payment services and solution consulting, and applications for the\nrequired money transmit licenses since March 2024.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we only have two customers of our business consultation services, one based in China and the other based in the U.S. Due to our very limited\ncustomer base, any of the following events may cause a material decline in our revenue and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations:\n● reductions, delays or cessation of purchases from the existing customers;\n9\n● loss of any of our existing customers and our inability to find new customers that can generate the same volume of business; and\n● Any of the existing customer’s failure to make timely payment for our services; and\n● We are unable to offer services that attract new customers from existing customers.\nWe cannot assure you that our relationships with these customers will continue to develop or that these customers will continue to generate material revenue for us in the\nfuture, or we will acquire more new customers. We need to invest significant resources in selling and marketing efforts. We take targeted business development approaches to\nreach out to our potential customers and provide them with our company profile through various means, such as emails and social network media. We also attend offline marketing\nactivities to promote our presence and brand recognition in the blockchain and digital asset industry. To continue to reach potential customers and grow our current business, we\nmust identify and devote more of our marketing expenditures to new and evolving marketing channels, which may include mobile and virtual channels. The opportunities in and\nsophistication of newer marketing channels generally are relatively undeveloped and unproven, making it difficult to assess returns on investment associated with such channels,\nand there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to appropriately manage and fine-tune our marketing efforts in response to these and other trends in the industry.\nAny failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nCertain crypto assets and cryptocurrencies have been identified as a \"security” in certain jurisdictions, and we may be subject to regulatory scrutiny, inquiries, investigations,\nfines and other penalties, which may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nCryptocurrency mining operations constitute a portion of our business and regulatory developments in the characterization of such crypto assets will have an impact on our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. The SEC and its staff have taken the position that certain crypto assets fall within the definition of a \"security” under the\nU.S. federal securities laws.\n10\nSeveral other foreign jurisdictions have taken a broad-based approach to classifying crypto assets as \"securities,” while other foreign jurisdictions, such as Switzerland, Malta\nand Singapore, have adopted a narrower approach. As a result, certain crypto assets may be deemed to be a \"security” under the laws of some jurisdictions but not others. Various\nforeign jurisdictions may, in the future, adopt additional laws, regulations or directives that affect the characterization of crypto assets as \"securities.”\nThe classification of a crypto asset as a security under applicable law has wide-ranging implications for businesses engaged in operations relating to crypto assets. For\nexample, a crypto asset that is a security in the United States may generally only be offered or sold in the United States pursuant to a registration statement filed with the SEC or in\nan offering that qualifies for an exemption from registration. Persons that effect transactions in crypto assets that are securities in the United States may be subject to registration\nwith the SEC as a \"broker” or \"dealer.” Platforms that bring together purchasers and sellers to trade crypto assets that are securities in the United States are generally subject to\nregistration as national securities exchanges, or must qualify for an exemption, such as by being operated by a registered broker-dealer as an automated trading system (\"ATS”) in\ncompliance with rules for ATSs. Persons facilitating clearing and settlement of securities may be subject to registration with the SEC as a clearing agency. Foreign jurisdictions may\nhave similar licensing, registration and qualification requirements.\nFurther, if Bitcoin, Ethereum, stablecoins or any other crypto asset is deemed to be a security under any U.S. federal, state or foreign jurisdiction, or in a proceeding in a court\nof law or otherwise, it may have adverse consequences for such crypto asset. For instance, all transactions in such crypto asset would have to be registered with the SEC or other\nforeign authority, or conducted in accordance with an exemption from registration, which could severely limit its liquidity, usability and transactability. Moreover, the networks on\nwhich such crypto assets are utilized may be required to be regulated as securities intermediaries, and subject to applicable rules, which could effectively render the network\nimpracticable for its existing purposes. Further, it could draw negative publicity and a decline in the general acceptance of the crypto asset. Also, it may make it difficult for such\ncrypto asset to be traded, cleared and custodied as compared to other crypto assets that are not considered to be securities. As such, our holdings of cryptocurrencies from our\nmining operations, as well as our storage and trading of such cryptocurrencies on third party service provider platforms, may be adversely affected by any fall in value of\ncryptocurrencies and any increased restrictions on their trading and liquidity. Whether our activities require registration or the crypto assets we hold would be considered\nsecurities is a risk-based assessment, and not a legal standard binding on a regulatory body or court, and does not preclude legal or regulatory action. We may decide in the future\nto mine or transact in other types of cryptocurrencies, which may constitute securities under U.S. law, although we have not presently determined definitively the type of\ncryptocurrencies we may mine or transact in in the future. We will consult with our legal advisers and abide by all SEC guidance and court rulings in this regard and monitor our\nactivities in securities transactions, but we currently do not have plans to mine any type of cryptocurrency that constitute \"securities” under U.S. law. Nevertheless, any breach of\napplicable US law will have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial performance and the value of our shares.\nAs we acquire, dispose of or restructure our businesses, product lines, and technologies, we may encounter unforeseen costs and difficulties that could impair our financial\nperformance.\nWe actively explore acquisition prospects that would complement our existing services, augment our market coverage and distribution ability, or enhance our capabilities. As a\nresult, we may seek to acquire certain companies, products, or technologies, or we may reduce or dispose of certain product lines or technologies that no longer fit our business\nstrategies. For regulatory or other reasons, we may not be successful in our attempts to acquire or dispose of businesses, products, or technologies, resulting in significant\nfinancial costs, reduced or lost opportunities, and diversion of management’s attention. Managing an acquired business, disposing of product technologies, or reducing personnel\nentails numerous operational and financial risks, including, among other things:\n● difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel or separating existing business or product groups;\n● diversion of management’s attention away from other business concerns;\n● amortization of acquired intangible assets;\n● adverse customer reaction to our decision to cease support for a product; and\n● potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired or disposed operations.\n11\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and manage successfully any such integration of potential acquisitions, disposition of product lines or technologies,\nor reduction in personnel or that our management, personnel, or systems will be adequate to support continued operations. Any such inabilities or inadequacies could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.\nWe may be unable to competitively engage in further distributed storage and computing services, business consultation services, financial advisory services and securities\nbrokerage services activities, if we cannot attract or retain employees and/or consultants who have expertise in these fields.\nIf we cannot attract or retain skilled employees and/or consultants in the distributed storage and computing services, business consultation services, financial advisory\nservices and securities brokerage services activities, our business may suffer. Because our above businesses require expertise, our business may be materially and adversely\naffected if our current employees and consultants who have expertise in the business leave or if we cannot continue to attract employees and consultants with expertise in the field\nof distributed storage and computing services, Business consultation services, financial advisory services and securities brokerage services.\nAny harm to our Mercurity brand or reputation may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe believe that the recognition and reputation of our Mercurity brand is critical to our business and competitiveness in the related industry. Many factors, some of which are\nbeyond our control, are important to maintaining and enhancing our brand. These factors include our ability to:\n● enhance the quality of our Business consultation services, financial advisory services and securities brokerage services for our customers;\n● maintain or improve customers’ satisfaction with our services;\n● increase brand awareness through marketing and brand promotion activities; and\n● preserve our reputation and goodwill in the event of any negative publicity on our service quality, data privacy, price, or other issues affecting us.\nA public perception that we do not provide reliable services, even if factually incorrect or based on isolated incidents, could damage our reputation, diminish the value of our\nbrand, undermine the trust and credibility we have established and have a negative impact on our ability to attract new customers retain our current customers. If we are unable to\nmaintain our reputation, enhance our brand recognition or increase positive awareness of our website, products and services, it may be difficult to maintain and grow our customer\nbase, and our business and growth prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have a history of operating losses, and we may report additional operating losses in the future.\nSince October 2021, cryptocurrency mining has become one of our major businesses, and we have recorded historical losses and negative cash flow from our operations of\ncryptocurrency mining business when the value of cryptocurrency we mine does not exceed our associated costs. Further, as part of our strategic growth plans, we have made\ncapital investments in expanding and vertically integrating our mining operations, including the expansion of our mining machines and increased our employee base. However,\nfuture market prices of the cryptocurrency are difficult to predict, and we cannot guarantee that our future mining revenue will exceed our associated costs.\nIf we are unable to conduct adequate and cost-effective marketing activities, our results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have a limited operating history of our current business and may need to make significant investments in sales and marketing to promote our brand recognition. Our brand\npromotion and marketing activities may not be well received by customers and may not result in the levels of sales that we anticipate. The marketing of blockchain-based solutions\nservices to customers is evolving. This further requires us to enhance our marketing approaches and experiment with new marketing methods to keep pace with customer\npreferences. Failure to refine our existing marketing approaches or to introduce new marketing approaches cost-effectively could reduce our market share, cause our Revenue to\ndecline and negatively impact our profitability.\n12\nIf our senior management is unable to work together effectively or efficiently or if we lose their services, our business may be severely disrupted.\nOur success heavily depends upon the continued services of our management.\nIn early May 2022, the Company restructured its executive team after the absence and later resignation of Wei Zhu, the Company’s former co-chief executive officer and acting\nchief financial officer and the Company’s board of directors had a significant change in 2022. Currently, we rely on the expertise and experience of Mr. Shi Qiu, our chief executive\nofficer, Ms. Qian Sun, our chief operating officer, and Mr. Yukuan Zhang, our chief financial officer, and our other executive team. If our senior management cannot work together\neffectively or efficiently, our business may be severely disrupted. If one or more of our senior management were unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, we might\nnot be able to replace them easily or at all, and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. If any of our senior\nmanagement joins a competitor or forms a competing business, we may lose customers, internal expertise and key professionals and staff members.\nWe have limited insurance coverage and could incur losses resulting from liability claims or business interruptions.\nWe currently do not have any product liability insurance or business interruption insurance. As we continue to expand our business, we could be increasingly exposed to\nvarious liability claims related to our products and services. Any liability claims, business disruption, or natural disaster could result in substantial costs and the diversion of\nresources, which would have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to changing laws and regulations regarding regulatory matters, corporate governance and public disclosure that may increase both our operating costs and\nthe risk of non-compliance.\nWe are subject to rules and regulations by various governing bodies, including, among others, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC”), which is charged\nwith the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded, and the various regulatory authorities in the PRC, Hong Kong and the\nCayman Islands, and subject to new and evolving regulatory measures under applicable law. Our efforts to comply with new and changing laws and regulations have resulted in\nand are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to\ncompliance activities.\nMoreover, because these laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, their application in practice may evolve as new guidance becomes available.\nThis evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance\npractices. If we fail to address and comply with these regulations and any subsequent changes, we may be subject to penalties and our business may be harmed.\nWe have failed to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, and\ninvestor confidence and the market price of our shares may be adversely impacted.\nThe SEC, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, adopted rules requiring most public companies to include a management\nreport on such company’s internal control over financial reporting in its annual report, which contains management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the company’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. In addition, when a company meets the SEC’s criteria, an independent registered public accounting firm must report on the effectiveness of the\ncompany’s internal control over financial reporting.\nOur management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 was not effective. This could result in a loss of investor confidence\nin the reliability of our financial conditions which in turn could negatively impact the trading price of our shares and result in lawsuits being filed against us by our shareholders or\notherwise harm our reputation. Furthermore, we have incurred and anticipate that we will continue to incur considerable costs and use significant management time and other\nresources in an effort to comply with Section 404 and other requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\n13\nThe enactment of legislation imposing moratoriums on issuing permits for certain cryptocurrency mining operations that use carbon-based power sources and similar laws\ncould adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIn the 2021-2022 Legislative Session, the New York State Senate introduced Bill S6486D, which establishes a two-year moratorium on cryptocurrency mining operations\nthat use proof-of-work authentication methods to validate blockchain transactions. Such restrictions and moratoriums will materially limit the scope of our business operations if\nwe choose to carry out cryptocurrency mining operations in such jurisdictions where they are prohibited. Our cryptocurrency mining facilities are located in New Jersey, and at\npresent we remain unaffected by the potential passage of Bill S6486D. Nonetheless, if a law similar to Bill S6486D were passed and comes into effect in New Jersey or other\njurisdictions in which we may carry out cryptocurrency mining operations in the future, this might force us to relocate our cryptocurrency mining operations, which will incur time\nand resources, and may have other material effects on our business. The passage of any other crypto legislation or regulation which may be directly or indirectly related to our\nbusiness model may also material effects on your business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBlockchain mining activities are energy-intensive, which may restrict the geographic locations of miners and have a negative environmental impact.\nBlockchain mining activities are inherently energy-intensive and electricity costs account for a significant portion of the overall mining costs. The availability and cost of\nelectricity will restrict the geographic locations of mining activities. Any shortage of electricity supply or increase in electricity cost in a jurisdiction may negatively impact the\nviability and the expected economic return for blockchain mining activities in that jurisdiction, which may in turn negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nIn addition, the significant consumption of electricity may have a negative environmental impact, including contribution to climate change, which may give rise to public\nopinion against allowing the use of electricity for blockchain mining activities or government measures restricting or prohibiting the use of electricity for such mining activities, and\nmay also invite adverse media coverage or public opinion against our brand. Regulators may also impose regulatory restrictions on blockchain mining activities. Any such\ndevelopment in the jurisdictions where we carry out our cryptocurrency mining could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nEnvironmental concerns associated with cryptocurrencies mining could have adverse impacts on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nEngaging in cryptocurrency mining may result in certain environmental harms and transition risks related to climate change that may affect our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations, as mining operations consume a substantial amount of power, which may contribute to increased carbon emissions. Moreover, recent policy\nand regulatory changes relating to limiting carbon emissions could impose additional operational and compliance burdens on our cryptocurrency mining operations, such as more\nstringent reporting requirements or higher compliance fees. Such regulations may lead to increased credit risks, which may lead financiers and lender to be less willing to enter into\nbusiness relationships with us, as well as increased litigation risks related to climate change in the jurisdictions in which we carry out mining operations. Further, some businesses\nas well as some investors may have ceased accepting cryptocurrencies for certain types of purchases, and stopped investing in businesses involved in cryptocurrencies\nbusinesses due to environmental concerns associated with cryptocurrencies mining. Such developments could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to an extensive, highly evolving and uncertain regulatory landscape and any adverse changes to, or our failure to comply with, any laws and regulations could\nadversely affect our brand, reputation, business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to extensive laws, rules, regulations, policies, orders, determinations, directives, treaties and legal and regulatory interpretations and guidance in\nthe markets in which we operate, including those governing financial services and banking, securities, broker-dealers, crypto asset exchange and transfer, cross-border and\ndomestic money and crypto asset transmission, privacy, data governance, data protection, cybersecurity, fraud detection, payment services (including payment processing and\nsettlement services), anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing. Many of these legal and regulatory regimes were adopted prior to the advent of the internet, mobile\ntechnologies, crypto assets and related technologies. As a result, some applicable laws and regulations do not contemplate or address unique issues associated with the\ncryptoeconomy, are subject to significant uncertainty, and vary widely across U.S. federal, state and local and international jurisdictions. These legal and regulatory regimes,\nincluding the laws, rules and regulations thereunder, evolve frequently and may be modified, interpreted and applied in an inconsistent manner from one jurisdiction to another,\nand may conflict with one another. Moreover, the complexity and evolving nature of our business and the significant uncertainty surrounding the regulation of the cryptoeconomy\nrequires us to exercise our judgment as to whether certain laws, rules and regulations apply to us, and it is possible that governmental bodies and regulators may disagree with our\nconclusions. To the extent we have not complied with such laws, rules and regulations, we could be subject to significant fines, revocation of licenses, limitations on our products\nand services, reputational harm and other regulatory consequences, each of which may be significant and could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial\ncondition.\n14\nOur operating results may fluctuate and continue to fluctuate, including due to the highly volatile nature of crypto.\nOur business operations include cryptocurrency mining and the provision of consultation services, and thus our operating results are dependent on crypto assets and\nthe broader cryptoeconomy. Due to the highly volatile nature of the cryptoeconomy and the prices of crypto assets, which have experienced and continue to experience significant\nvolatility, our operating results have, and may continue to, fluctuate significantly in accordance with market sentiments and movements in the broader cryptoeconomy. Our\noperating results will continue to fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are unpredictable and in certain instances are outside of our control,\nincluding:\n● changes in the legislative or regulatory environment, or actions by U.S. or foreign governments or regulators, including fines, orders or consent decrees;\n● investments we make in the development of products and services as well as technology offered to our developers, international expansion and sales and marketing;\n● our ability to establish and maintain partnerships, collaborations, joint ventures or strategic alliances with third parties;\n● market conditions of, and overall sentiment towards, the cryptoeconomy, including the trading prices of crptocurrencies;\n● macroeconomic conditions, including interest rates and inflation;\n● adverse legal proceedings or regulatory enforcement actions, judgments, settlements or other legal proceeding and enforcement-related costs;\n● the development and introduction of existing and new products and services by us or our competitors;\n● our ability to control costs, including our operating expenses incurred to grow and expand our operations and to remain competitive;\n● system failure, outages or interruptions, including with respect to third-party crypto networks;\n● our lack of control over decentralized or third-party blockchains and networks that may experience downtime, cyber-attacks, critical failures, errors, bugs, corrupted\nfiles, data losses or other similar software failures, outages, breaches and losses; and\n● breaches of security or privacy.\nAs a result of these factors, it is difficult for us to forecast growth trends accurately and our business and future prospects are difficult to evaluate, particularly in the\nshort term.\n15\nFluctuations in Filecoin value might impact our operating results and add to our regulatory compliance obligations under applicable law and regulation, including the\nInvestment Company Act of 1940.\nOur strategic initiative to achieve an effective storage capacity of 64PiB for Filecoin’s mining business by the end of June 2024, and utilize the remaining available storage\ncapacity of the Web3 decentralized storage infrastructure to expand our Filecoin mining business, or engage in other cryptocurrency mining businesses, or provide cloud storage\nservices to other distributed application product operators, could expose us to financial risks, particularly due to the volatile nature of Filecoin’s value. Although currently the\nmarket value of the Filecoins held by us constitutes a minor fraction of our total assets, its influence on our revenue is considerably more pronounced. This disparity means that\nour operational results are susceptible to swings in Filecoin’s market value. If the value of Filecoin was to escalate significantly (e.g., $50 per Filecoin), the proportionate value of\nour holdings could become a dominant aspect of our asset base. This appreciation might inadvertently categorize us as an investment company under the Investment Company\nAct of 1940, introducing additional regulatory and compliance implications, which could disrupt our business model and impact our fiscal health. See also \"Risk Factors—If we\nwere deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, applicable restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our business as\ncontemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our business.”\nOur revenue forecasts are inherently speculative, which are predicated on Filecoin’s price projections and our operational performance. Given the historical volatility\nassociated with digital currencies, there is uncertainty surrounding these estimates. Factors beyond our control, including market trends, investor attitudes, regulatory\ndevelopments and alterations in the Filecoin network, affect Filecoin’s valuation, potentially leading to revenue and financial results that diverge substantially from our projections.\nShould the Filecoin price fail to meet our estimates, our revenues might outperform or fall below our expectations.\nWe are aware of the varying perceptions of risk tied to our Filecoin ventures among potential investors. Despite our risk management strategies (e.g., diversifying income\nstreams, refining our mining processes, etc.), there is no certainty that these measures will fully mitigate the intrinsic volatility of the Filecoin market.\nOur revenue is partially dependent on the prices of crypto assets. If such price or volume declines, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely\naffected.\nWe generate a portion of our total revenue from our cryptocurrency mining operations. Declines in the price of crypto assets may result in lower total revenue to us, cause\nus to recognize losses and affect the price of our shares.\nThe price of crypto assets and associated demand for buying, selling and trading crypto assets have historically been subject to significant volatility. For instance, in\n2017, the value of certain crypto assets, including Bitcoin, experienced steep increases in value, and our customer base expanded worldwide. The increases in value of certain\ncrypto assets, including Bitcoin, from 2016 to 2017, and then again in 2021, were followed by a steep decline in 2018 and again in 2022, which has adversely affected our net\nrevenue and operating results. If the value of crypto assets and transaction volume do not recover or further decline, our ability to generate revenue may suffer and customer\ndemand for our products and services may decline, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. The price and trading volume of any\ncrypto asset is subject to significant uncertainty and volatility, depending on a number of factors, including:\n● market conditions of, and overall sentiment towards, crypto assets and the cryptoeconomy, including, but not limited to, as a result of actions taken by or\ndevelopments of other companies in the cryptoeconomy;\n● changes in liquidity, market-making volume and trading activities;\n● trading activities on other crypto platforms worldwide, many of which may be unregulated, and may include manipulative activities;\n● investment and trading activities of highly active consumer and institutional users, speculators, miners and investors;\n● the speed and rate at which crypto is able to gain adoption as a medium of exchange, utility, store of value, consumptive asset, security instrument or other financial\nassets worldwide, if at all;\n● decreased user and investor confidence in crypto assets and crypto platforms;\n● negative publicity and events relating to the cryptoeconomy;\n● unpredictable social media coverage or \"trending” of, or other rumors and market speculation regarding crypto assets;\n● the ability for crypto assets to meet user and investor demands;\n16\n● the functionality and utility of crypto assets and their associated ecosystems and networks, including crypto assets designed for use in various applications;\n● consumer preferences and perceived value of crypto assets and crypto asset markets;\n● increased competition from other payment services or other crypto assets that exhibit better speed, security, scalability or other characteristics;\n● regulatory or legislative changes and updates affecting the cryptoeconomy;\n● the characterization of crypto assets under the laws of various jurisdictions around the world;\n● the adoption of unfavorable taxation policies on crypto asset investments by governmental entities;\n● legal and regulatory changes affecting the operations of miners and validators of blockchain networks, including limitations and prohibitions on mining activities, or\nnew legislative or regulatory requirements as a result of growing environmental concerns around the use of energy in bitcoin and other proof-of-work mining\nactivities;\n● ongoing technological viability and security of crypto assets and their associated smart contracts, applications and networks, including vulnerabilities against hacks\nand scalability;\n● monetary policies of governments, trade restrictions and fiat currency devaluations; and\n● national and international economic and political conditions.\nThere is no assurance that any crypto asset in which we conduct mining or related operations will maintain its value or that there will be meaningful levels of trading\nactivities and liquidity. In the event that the price of crypto assets decline, our business, operating results and financial condition, as well as our share price, would be adversely\naffected, and we may have to recognize losses or impairments in our investments or other crypto assets due to disruptions in the crypto asset markets.\nThe future development and growth of crypto is subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to predict and evaluate. If crypto does not grow as we expect, our business,\noperating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nCrypto assets built on blockchain technology were only introduced in 2008 and remain in the early stages of development. In addition, different crypto assets are\ndesigned for different purposes. Bitcoin, for instance, was designed to serve as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, while Ethereum was designed to be a smart contract and\ndecentralized application platform. Many other crypto networks-ranging from cloud computing to tokenized securities networks-have only recently been established. The further\ngrowth and development of any crypto assets and their underlying networks and other cryptographic and algorithmic protocols governing the creation, transfer and usage of\ncrypto assets represent a new and evolving paradigm that is subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate, including:\n● many crypto networks have limited operating histories, have not been validated in production, and are still in the process of developing and making significant\ndecisions that will affect the design, supply, issuance, functionality and governance of their respective crypto assets and underlying blockchain networks, any of\nwhich could adversely affect their respective crypto assets;\n● many crypto networks are in the process of implementing software upgrades and other changes to their protocols, which could introduce bugs, security risks or\nadversely affect the respective crypto networks;\n● several large networks, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, are developing new features to address fundamental speed, scalability and energy usage issues. If these\nissues are not successfully addressed, or are unable to receive widespread adoption, it could adversely affect the underlying crypto assets;\n17\n● security issues, bugs and software errors have been identified with many crypto assets and their underlying blockchain networks, some of which have been exploited\nby malicious actors. There are also inherent security weaknesses in some crypto assets, such as when creators of certain crypto networks use procedures that could\nallow hackers to counterfeit tokens. Any weaknesses identified with a crypto asset could adversely affect its price, security, liquidity and adoption. If a malicious\nactor or botnet (a volunteer or hacked collection of computers controlled by networked software coordinating the actions of the computers) obtains a majority of the\ncompute or staking power on a crypto network, as has happened in the past, it may be able to manipulate transactions, which could cause financial losses to holders,\ndamage the network’s reputation and security, and adversely affect its value;\n● the development of new technologies for mining, such as improved application-specific integrated circuits (commonly referred to as ASICs), or changes in industry\npatterns, such as the consolidation of mining power in a small number of large mining farms, could reduce the security of blockchain networks, lead to increased\nliquid supply of crypto assets and reduce a crypto’s price and attractiveness;\n● if rewards and transaction fees for miners or validators on any particular crypto network are not sufficiently high to attract and retain miners, a crypto network’s\nsecurity and speed may be adversely affected, increasing the likelihood of a malicious attack;\n● many crypto assets have concentrated ownership or an \"admin key,” allowing a small group of holders to have significant unilateral control and influence over key\ndecisions related to their crypto networks, such as governance decisions and protocol changes, as well as the market price of such crypto assets;\n● the governance of many decentralized blockchain networks is by voluntary consensus and open competition, and many developers are not directly compensated for\ntheir contributions. As a result, there may be a lack of consensus or clarity on the governance of any particular crypto network, a lack of incentives for developers to\nmaintain or develop the network and other unforeseen issues, any of which could result in unexpected or undesirable errors, bugs or changes, or stymie such\nnetwork’s utility and ability to respond to challenges and grow; and\n● many crypto networks are in the early stages of developing partnerships and collaborations, all of which may not succeed and adversely affect the usability and\nadoption of the respective crypto assets.\nVarious other technical issues have also been uncovered from time to time that resulted in disabled functionalities, exposure of certain users’ personal information, theft of\nusers’ assets and other negative consequences, and which required resolution with the attention and efforts of their global miner, user and development communities. If any such\nrisks or other risks materialize, and in particular if they are not resolved, the development and growth of crypto may be significantly affected and, as a result, our business,\noperating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nAny failure to safeguard and manage our crypto assets could adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe believe we have developed and maintained administrative, technical and physical safeguards and safeguard our crypto assets and which are designed to comply with\napplicable legal requirements and industry standards. However, it is nevertheless possible that hackers, employees or service providers acting contrary to our policies, or others\ncould circumvent these safeguards to improperly access our systems or documents, or the systems or documents of our business partners, agents or service providers, and\nimproperly access, obtain, misuse crypto assets and funds. The methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are also constantly\nchanging and evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time. Any loss of cash or crypto assets could result in a substantial business disruption,\nadverse reputational impact, inability to compete with our competitors and regulatory investigations, inquiries or actions. Any security incident resulting in a compromise of crypto\nassets could result in substantial costs to us, expose us to regulatory enforcement actions, limit our ability to provide services, subject us to litigation, significant financial losses,\ndamage our reputation and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows.\n18\nThe theft, loss or destruction of private keys required to access any crypto assets held in custody for our own account may be irreversible. If we are unable to access our\nprivate keys or if we experience a hack or other data loss relating to our ability to access any crypto assets, it could cause regulatory scrutiny, reputational harm and other\nlosses.\nCrypto assets are generally controllable only by the possessor of the unique private key relating to the digital wallet in which the crypto assets are held. While blockchain\nprotocols typically require public addresses to be published when used in a transaction, private keys must be safeguarded and kept private in order to prevent a third party from\naccessing the crypto assets held in such a wallet. To the extent that any of the private keys relating to our wallets containing crypto assets is lost, destroyed, or otherwise\ncompromised or unavailable, and no backup of the private key is accessible, we will be unable to access the crypto assets held in the related wallet. Further, we cannot provide\nassurance that our wallet will not be hacked or compromised. Crypto assets and blockchain technologies have been, and may in the future be, subject to security breaches, hacking\nor other malicious activities. Any loss of private keys relating to, or hack or other compromise of, digital wallets used to store our crypto assets could adversely affect our ability to\naccess or sell crypto assets, and subject us to significant financial losses in addition to hurting our brand and reputation, result in significant losses and adversely impact our\nbusiness.\nAny gaps in our risk management processes and policies in respect of crypto asset could adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nIn late February 2022, Wei Zhu, our former acting Chief Financial Officer, former Co-Chief Executive Officer, and a former member and Co-Chairperson of the Board, and\nMinghao Li, a former member of the Board, were suspected of certain criminal offenses unrelated to our Company’s operations and were detained by the Economic Crime\nInvestigation Detachment of Sheyang County Public Security Bureau, Yancheng City, Jiangsu Province, People’s Republic of China. At the same time, Sheyang Public Security\nBureau wrongly seized the digital assets hardware cold wallet belonging to the Company, along with the cryptocurrencies stored in the hardware cold wallet. Our Company has\nsince undergone major management personnel changes. As of the date of this annual report, our board and management have taken steps to remedy the gaps in our risk\nmanagement processes and policies in relation to our business model and any crypto assets that we hold. Nonetheless, if any future gaps in our risk management processes and\npolicies were to arise, such deficiencies could adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition. In turn, such deficiencies would require our Board and\nmanagement to make appropriate changes to our risk management processes and policies.\nCrypto assets deposited with third party custodians are subject to risks attendant with such custody arrangements. If such custodians were to become insolvent, or suffer from\nhacking or cybersecurity or other technical failures, or if our assets were to be misused or lost, we may lose ownership or control of our crypto assets, and we may not be able\nto recover our losses through legal or other channels.\nWe store a portion of our crypto assets with Coinbase, a third-party platform. Such custody arrangements increase ease of transaction and allow us to access the public\nmarkets and liquidate such assets at the prevailing prices more rapidly. However, this arrangement necessitates the relinquishment of control over our crypto assets. To access\nsuch assets, we rely on the technical platform provided by such third-party platforms and we are also subject to their terms of use.\nRecent high profile criminal investigations and bankruptcy cases in the U.S., such as those involving FTX and Celsius, highlight the risks of holding crypto assets on\nthird party platforms. In such cases, it is anticipated that account holders of such platforms will be unlikely to recover the crypto assets they deposited, and are likely to recover\nonly a fraction of the monetary value of their deposited assets through the bankruptcy and legal framework, if at all. Even if such platform operators maintain insurance policies to\ncompensate account holders for their losses, certain claims and payouts may be barred by the terms of the insurance policies, especially in the event of fraud, and any insurance\npolicy payout may not make losses whole and could take substantial periods of time to materialize, if at all. In particular, the insurance maintained by Coinbase with which we store\nour cryptocurrency is shared among all of Coinbase’s customers, is not specific to our Company and may not be available or sufficient to protect our Company from all possible\nlosses or sources of losses. We may be forced to share such insurance proceeds with other clients or customers of Coinbase, which could reduce the amount of such proceeds\nthat are available to us.\nIf the custodians we rely on to store our crypto assets were to become insolvent, or suffer from hacking or cybersecurity or other technical failures, or if our assets were to\nbe misused by the platform operator or were to become lost, we may lose ownership or control of our crypto assets, and we may not be able to recover our losses through legal or\nother channels. Any such incidents would likely have a material and adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and the price of our shares.\n19\nThe assertion of jurisdiction by U.S. and foreign regulators and other government entities over crypto assets and crypto asset markets could adversely impact our business,\noperating results and financial condition.\nWe operate our business in a number of jurisdictions, including the U.S. and China. In the case that U.S. and foreign regulators or other government entities assert\njurisdiction over a business in the crypto asset markets, this could lead to conflicting laws or directives which, in turn, could impede our business operations. Moreover, such\nconflicting laws or directives will make it difficult to determine which laws, rules and regulations apply to our business. Additionally, U.S. and foreign regulators as well as other\ngovernment entities may disagree with our determination as to which laws, rules and regulations apply to our business. This could lead to additional compliance cost burdens, as\nwell as increasing our risks of running afoul of laws and regulations from certain jurisdictions in which we operate our business.\nIf we were deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, applicable restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our business as\ncontemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have not been and do not intend to become registered as an \"investment company” under the Investment Company Act of 1940, or the 1940 Act. We intend to\nconduct our business so as not to become regulated as an investment company under the 1940 Act.\nGenerally, a company will be determined to be an \"investment company” if, absent an exclusion or exemption, it is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily, or\nproposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities or owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40\npercent of the value of its total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. We refer to this investment company definition test as\nthe \"40 percent test.”\nWe do not hold ourselves out as being engaged primarily, or propose to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities and believe that\nwe are not engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities.\nTo ensure that we are not obligated to register as an investment company, we must not exceed the thresholds provided by the 40 percent test. For purposes of the 40\npercent test, the term \"investment securities” includes all securities but does not include U.S. government securities or securities issued by majority-owned subsidiaries that are\nnot themselves investment companies and are not relying on Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act. Therefore, the assets that we and our subsidiaries hold and acquire\nare limited by the provisions of the 1940 Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.\nMost crypto assets are regarded as \"securities” under U.S. law, and hence, if our holding of cryptocurrencies exceed 40 percent of the value of our total assets, we may\nbecome regarded as an \"investment company” under the 1940 Act. We intend to monitor our holdings of crypto assets and other securities to ensure that we do not become\nregarded as an \"investment company.” If our holding of cryptocurrencies were to exceed such threshold, we will be required to comply with the provisions of the 1940 Act, which\nwill result in additional compliance costs and regulatory burdens and may materially and adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results.\nA portion of our business is conducted in the mining, holding and trading of cryptocurrencies. Such holdings may increase in the future. We may also decide in the future\nto mine or transact in other types of cryptocurrencies, which may constitute securities under U.S. law, although we have not presently determined definitively the type of\ncryptocurrencies we may mine or transact in in the future. We will consult with our legal advisers and abide by all SEC guidance and court rulings in this regard and monitor our\nactivities in securities transactions, but we currently do not have plans to mine any type of cryptocurrency that constitute \"securities” under U.S. law. We have been carrying out\nthe Filecoin mining business since December 2022. As of the date of this annual report, our two nodes on the Filecoin blockchain have exceeded storage capacity of 64PiB.\n20\nWe intend to monitor our status in relation to the 40 percent test by implementing procedures to review, on a semi-annual basis, specifically on June 30 and December 31,\nthe composition of our assets to ensure that our holdings of Filecoin and other investment securities, if any, do not breach the thresholds specified by the 1940 Act. While we\nbelieve that we currently conduct our business in a manner that does not result in classification as an investment company, there is no assurance that we will be able to maintain\nthat status. There is a possibility that changes in the value of our Filecoin holdings or in our business model could potentially cause us to exceed the 40% threshold. In the event\nthat we exceed the 40% threshold, the potential consequences of falling within this classification and not being registered as a 1940 Act company are as follows: (i) restrictions on\nbusiness operations; (ii) potential lawsuits involving voidable contracts entered into by an unregistered investment company; (iii) SEC enforcement, including penalties,\ninjunctions or other sanctions, and additional regulatory and compliance costs; and (iv) management restrictions and additional reporting obligations.\nRisks Relating to Doing Business in the PRC\nWe conduct a portion of our business operations in China and are subject to the attendant risks of operating in China, including regulatory risks resulting from political and\nregulatory changes which may be swift and unexpected.\nMFH Cayman is not a Chinese operating company but a Cayman Islands holding company with a portion of our operations conducted by our subsidiaries based in China.\nPrior to 2022, the majority of our operations were based in mainland China. During 2022, we divested our software development business in mainland China, established a new\nmanagement team, and relocated our headquarters to the United States with the newly established Hong Kong office as the operational hub for our business in the Asia Pacific\nregion. As a result of the recent operational reorganization, the majority of our operations are currently based in the U.S. while part of our technical and back-office team in\nmainland China.\nInvestors in our securities are purchasing equity interest in MFH Cayman, a holding company incorporated in the Cayman Islands with business operations in China and\nthe U.S. and therefore, investors may never hold equity interests in any of our Chinese operating entities. This operating structure may involve unique risks to investors. There are\nsignificant legal and operational risks associated with being based in or having a portion of business operations in China. Any of such risks and uncertainties could result in\nmaterial changes in our operations and/or the value of our ordinary shares or could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer ordinary shares\nand/or other securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless. The PRC government has significant authority to exert influence\non the ability of a company with operations in China to conduct business. The PRC government has initiated a series of regulatory actions and has made a number of public\nstatements on the regulation of business operations in China with little advance notice, including cracking down on illegal activities in the securities market, enhancing supervision\nover China-based companies listed overseas, adopting new measures to extend the scope of cybersecurity reviews, and expanding efforts in anti-monopoly enforcement and data\nprivacy protection. As of the date of this annual report, as advised by our PRC legal adviser, we do not believe that we are subject to: (i) the cybersecurity review with the\nCyberspace Administration of China, or CAC, as our products and services are not offered to individual users but to our institutional customers, we do not possess a large amount\nof personal information in our business operations, and our business does not involve the collection of data that affects or may affect national security, implicates cybersecurity,\nor involves any type of restricted industry; or (ii) merger control review by China’s anti-monopoly enforcement agency due to the fact that we do not engage in monopolistic\nbehaviors that are subject to these statements or regulatory actions. However, since these statements and regulatory actions are new, it is highly uncertain how soon legislative or\nadministrative regulation making bodies will respond and what existing or new laws or regulations or detailed implementations and interpretations will be modified or promulgated,\nand, if any, the potential impact such modified or new laws and regulations will have on our daily business operation, ability to accept foreign investments and listing of our\nsecurities on a U.S. or other foreign exchange. In addition, changes in the legal, political and economic policies of the Chinese government, the relations between China and the\nUnited States, or Chinese or U.S. regulations may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any such changes could significantly\nlimit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer our securities to investors, and could cause the value of our securities to significantly decline or become\nworthless. The PRC government has significant oversight and discretion over the conduct of our business and may intervene with or influence our operations as the government\ndeems appropriate to further regulatory, political and societal goals. The PRC government has recently published new policies that significantly affected certain industries such as\nthe education and internet industries, and we cannot rule out the possibility that it will in the future release regulations or policies regarding our industry that could adversely\naffect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the PRC government has recently indicated an intent to exert more oversight and control over\noverseas securities offerings and other capital markets activities and foreign investment in China-based companies like us. Any such action, once taken by the PRC government,\ncould significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or in\nextreme cases, become worthless.\n21\nYou may incur additional costs and procedural obstacles in effecting service of legal process, enforcing foreign judgments or bringing actions in Hong Kong against us or\nour management based on Hong Kong laws.\nWe currently have one subsidiary in Hong Kong, being Ucon Capital (HK) Limited, and one of our directors, Hui Cheng, is ordinarily resident in Hong Kong. You may\nincur additional costs and procedural obstacles in effecting service of legal process, enforcing foreign judgments or bringing actions in Hong Kong against us or our management,\nas judgments entered in the U.S. can be enforced in Hong Kong only at common law. If you want to enforce a judgment of the U.S. in Hong Kong, it must be a final judgment\nconclusive upon the merits of the claim, for a liquidated amount in a civil matter and not in respect of taxes, fines, penalties or similar charges, the proceedings in which the\njudgment was obtained were not contrary to natural justice, and the enforcement of the judgment is not contrary to public policy of Hong Kong. Such a judgment must be for a\nfixed sum and must also come from a \"competent” court as determined by the private international law rules applied by the Hong Kong courts.\nFurthermore, foreign judgments of the U.S. courts will not be directly enforced in Hong Kong as there are currently no treaties or other arrangements providing for\nreciprocal enforcement of foreign judgments between Hong Kong and the U.S. However, the common law permits an action to be brought upon a foreign judgment. That is to say,\na foreign judgment itself may form the basis of a cause of action since the judgment may be regarded as creating a debt between the parties to it. In a common law action for\nenforcement of a foreign judgment in Hong Kong, the enforcement is subject to various conditions, including but not limited to, that the foreign judgment is a final judgment\nconclusive upon the merits of the claim, the judgment is for a liquidated amount in civil matter and not in respect of taxes, fines, penalties or similar charges, the proceedings in\nwhich the judgment was obtained were not contrary to natural justice, and the enforcement of the judgment is not contrary to public policy of Hong Kong. Such a judgment must\nbe for a fixed sum and must also come from a \"competent” court as determined by the private international law rules applied by the Hong Kong courts. The defenses that are\navailable to a defendant in a common law action brought on the basis of a foreign judgment include lack of jurisdiction, breach of natural justice, fraud and contrary to public\npolicy. However, a separate legal action for debt must be commenced in Hong Kong in order to recover such debt from the judgment debtor. As a result, subject to the conditions\nwith regard to enforcement of judgments of United States courts being met, including but not limited to the above, a foreign judgment of United States of civil liabilities predicated\nsolely upon the federal securities laws of the United States or the securities laws of any State or territory within the U.S. could be enforceable in Hong Kong.\nYou may experience difficulties in effecting service of legal process, enforcing foreign judgments or bringing actions in China against us or our management based on\nforeign laws.\nWe have one subsidiary in the PRC, being Lianji Future Technology Limited, and many of our managements and directors are PRC nationals. In particular, three of our\ndirectors and officers, Qian Sun, Yukuan Zhang and Cong Huang are ordinarily resident in Mainland China, one of our directors, Hui Cheng, is ordinarily resident in Hong Kong,\nand the remaining three of our directors, Shi Qiu, Alan Curtis and Daniel Kelly Kennedy, are ordinarily resident in the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for you to effect\nservice of process upon us or our management named herein inside mainland China. It may also be difficult for you to enforce in U.S. courts of the judgments obtained in U.S.\ncourts based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws against us and our officers and directors as only a portion of them, Shi Qiu, Alan Curtis and Daniel\nKelly Kennedy, currently resides in the United States. In addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of the Cayman Islands or the PRC would recognize or enforce\njudgments of U.S. courts against us or such persons predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state.\nAs advised by our PRC legal adviser, the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments are provided for under the PRC Civil Procedures Law. PRC courts may\nrecognize and enforce foreign judgments in accordance with the requirements of the PRC Civil Procedures Law and other applicable laws, regulations and interpretations based\neither on treaties between China and the country where the judgment is made or on principles of reciprocity between jurisdictions. In addition, according to the PRC Civil\nProcedures Law, the PRC courts will not enforce a foreign judgment against us or our directors and officers if they decide that the judgment violates the basic principles of PRC\nlaws or national sovereignty, security or public interest. As a result, it is uncertain whether and on what basis a PRC court would enforce a judgment rendered by a court in the\nUnited States. Furthermore, class action lawsuits, which are available in the United States for investors to seek remedies, are generally uncommon in China.\n22\nWe may rely on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by our PRC and Hong Kong subsidiaries to fund any cash and financing requirements we may have, and any\nlimitation on the ability of our PRC and Hong Kong subsidiaries to make payments to us could have a material and adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business.\nWe are a Cayman Islands holding company and we may in the future rely on dividends and other distributions on equity from our PRC and Hong Kong subsidiaries for our\ncash requirements, including the funds necessary to pay dividends and other cash distributions to our shareholders for services of any debt we may incur. If our PRC and Hong\nKong subsidiaries incur debt on its own behalf in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict its ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to us. Under\nPRC laws and regulations, our PRC subsidiaries which are foreign-owned enterprises may pay dividends only out of its respective accumulated profits as determined in accordance\nwith PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, a foreign-owned enterprise, according to the PRC companies law, is required to set aside at least 10% of its\naccumulated after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund a certain statutory reserve fund, until the aggregate amount of such fund reaches 50% of its registered capital. Such reserve\nfunds cannot be distributed to us as dividends.\nOur PRC subsidiaries generate essentially all of their revenue in Renminbi, which is not freely convertible into other currencies. As a result, any restriction on currency\nexchange may limit the ability of our PRC subsidiary to use their Renminbi revenues to pay dividends to us.\nThe PRC government may continue to strengthen its capital controls, and more restrictions and substantial vetting process may be put forward by SAFE for cross-border\ntransactions falling under both the current account and the capital account. Any limitation on the ability of our PRC subsidiary to pay dividends or make other kinds of payments\nto us could materially and adversely limit our ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to our business, pay dividends, or otherwise fund and\nconduct our business.\nIn addition, the Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation rules provide that a withholding tax rate of up to 10% will be applicable to dividends payable by Chinese\ncompanies to non-PRC-resident enterprises unless otherwise exempted or reduced according to treaties or arrangements between the PRC central government and governments of\nother countries or regions where the non-PRC-resident enterprises are incorporated.\nRegulation and censorship of information disseminated over the internet in the PRC could adversely affect our business in China, and we could be liable for information\ndisplayed on, retrieved from or linked to our website.\nChina has enacted laws and regulations governing internet access and the distribution of products, services, news, information and other content through the internet. In the\npast, the PRC government has prohibited the distribution of information through the internet that it deems to violate PRC laws and regulations. If any of our internet content was\ndeemed by the PRC government to violate any content restrictions, we would not be able to continue to display such content and could become subject to penalties, including\nconfiscation of income, fines, suspension of business and revocation of required licenses, which could adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations\nof our China subsidiaries. We could also be subject to potential liability for any unlawful actions of users of our website or for the content we distribute that is deemed\ninappropriate. It could be difficult to determine the type of content that could result in liability to us, and if we are found to be liable, we could be prevented from operating our\nwebsite in China.\nA failure by our shareholders or beneficial owners who are PRC citizens or residents in the PRC to comply with certain PRC foreign exchange regulations could restrict our\nability to distribute profits, restrict our overseas and cross-border investment activities or subject us to liability under PRC laws, which could adversely affect our business\nand financial condition.\nThe State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, issued the Circular Relating to Foreign Exchange Administration of Offshore Investment, Financing and Return\nInvestment by Domestic Residents Utilizing Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular 37, that was promulgated and become effective on July 14, 2014. It requires a PRC natural\nperson or a PRC company, or a PRC Resident, to file a \"Registration Form of Overseas Investments Contributed by PRC Resident” and register with the local SAFE branch before it\ncontributes assets or equity interests in an overseas special purpose vehicle, or SPV, that is directly established and controlled by PRC Resident to conduct investment or\nfinancing. Following the initial registration, the PRC resident is also required to register with the local SAFE branch timely for any major change in respect of SPV, including, among\nother things, any major change of SPV’s PRC Resident shareholder, name of the SPV, term of operation or any increase or reduction of the SPV’s registered capital, share transfer\nor swap, and merger or division. Failure to comply with the registration procedures of Circular 37 could result in the penalties including the imposition of restrictions on the ability\nof SPV’s PRC subsidiaries to dividends to its overseas parent company.\n23\nIt remains unclear how this regulation and any future related legislation will be interpreted, amended and implemented by the relevant PRC government authorities. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, to the best of our knowledge, most of our PRC Resident shareholders with offshore investments had not registered their offshore investments with SAFE\naccording to the predecessor regulation of Circular 37, namely the Notice on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Administration for PRC Residents Engaging in\nFinancing and Roundtrip Investments via Overseas Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular 75, which was replaced by the SAFE Circular 37 but still effective when the relevant\nPRC shareholders made their investments. If the PRC government determined that our PRC Resident shareholders are required to make the registration regarding their offshore\ninvestment under Circular 37, both they and us may be subject to fines by the PRC government.\nWe are committed to complying, and to ensuring that our shareholders and beneficial owners who are PRC citizens or residents comply with SAFE Circular 37 requirements.\nThe rest of our PRC citizen or resident beneficial owners are also applying for registrations under SAFE Circular 37 with the relevant local counterpart of SAFE. However, we might\nnot be fully informed of the identities of all our beneficial owners who are PRC citizens or residents, and we cannot compel our beneficial owners to comply with SAFE Circular 37\nrequirements. As a result, we cannot assure you that all of our shareholders or beneficial owners who are PRC citizens or residents have complied with, or will in the future make or\nobtain the necessary any applicable registrations or approvals as required by, SAFE Circular 37 or other related regulations. Failure by such shareholders or beneficial owners to\ncomply with SAFE Circular 37, or failure by us to amend the foreign exchange registrations of our PRC subsidiary, could subject us to fines or legal sanctions, restrict our overseas\nor cross-border investment activities, limit our subsidiaries’ ability to make distributions or pay dividends or affect our ownership structure, which could adversely affect our\nbusiness and prospects. Failure by us to amend the foreign exchange registrations in compliance with SAFE Circular 37 could subject us to fines or legal sanctions restrict our\noverseas or cross-border ownership structure, which could adversely affect our business and prospects.\nA failure to comply with PRC regulations regarding the registration of shares and share options held by our employees who are PRC citizens could subject such employees or\nus to fines and legal or administrative sanctions.\nPursuant to the Implementation Rules of the Administrative Measures on Individual Foreign Exchange, or the Individual Foreign Exchange Rules, promulgated by SAFE on\nJanuary 5, 2007 and amended on May 2016, a relevant guidance issued by SAFE in March 2007 and Notices on Issues concerning the Foreign Exchange Administration for\nDomestic Individuals Participating in Stock Incentive Plan of Overseas Publicly-Listed Company, or the Stock Option Rules, on February 15, 2012 that replaces the guidance issued\nin March 2007, PRC citizens who are granted shares or share options by an overseas-listed company according to its employee share option or share incentive plan are required,\nthrough the PRC subsidiary of such overseas-listed company or other qualified PRC agents selected by such PRC subsidiary, to register with SAFE and complete certain other\nprocedures related to the share option or other share incentive plan. In addition, the PRC agent is required to amend the SAFE registration with respect to the stock incentive plan\nif there is any material change to the stock incentive plan, the PRC agent or the overseas entrusted institution or other material changes. For participants who had already\nparticipated in an employee share option or share incentive plan before the date of the guidance, the guidance requires their PRC employers or PRC agents to complete the relevant\nformalities within three months of the date of the guidance. We and our PRC citizen employees who have been granted share options, or PRC option holders, are subject to these\nrules. If we or our PRC option holders fail to comply with these rules, we or our PRC option holders could be subject to fines and legal or administrative sanctions.\nIt may be difficult for overseas regulators to conduct investigations or collect evidence within China.\nShareholder claims or regulatory investigation that are common in the United States generally are difficult to pursue as a matter of law or practicality in China. For example,\nin China, there are significant legal and other obstacles to providing information needed for regulatory investigations or litigation initiated outside China. Although the authorities\nin China may establish a regulatory cooperation mechanism with the securities regulatory authorities of another country or region to implement cross-border supervision and\nadministration, such cooperation with the securities regulatory authorities in the Unities States may not be efficient in the absence of mutual and practical cooperation mechanism.\nFurthermore, according to Article 177 of the PRC Securities Law, which became effective in March 2020 (\"Article 177”), no overseas securities regulator is allowed to directly\nconduct investigation or evidence collection activities within the territory of the PRC. In addition, entities or individuals are prohibited from providing documents and information\nin connection with any securities business activities to any organizations and/or persons aboard without the prior consent of the securities regulatory authority of the State\nCouncil and the competent departments of the State Council. Article 26 of the Trial Measures, or the Article 26, which was issued by the CSRC on February 17, 2023 and came into\neffect on March 31, 2023, sets out that where an overseas securities regulatory agency intends to conduct investigation and evidence collection regarding overseas offering and\nlisting activities by a domestic company, and request assistance of the CSRC under relevant cross-border securities regulatory cooperation mechanisms, the CSRC may provide\nnecessary assistance in accordance with law. Any domestic entity or individual providing documents and materials requested by an overseas securities regulatory agency out of\ninvestigative or evidence collection purposes shall not provide such information without prior approval from the CSRC and competent authorities under the State Council. In\naddition, Article 11 of the Provisions on Strengthening Confidentiality and Archives Administration in Respect of Overseas Issuance and Listing of Securities by Domestic\nEnterprises, or the Article 11, which was jointly issued by the CSRC, the Ministry of Finance, the State Secrecy Administration and the State Archives Bureau on February 24, 2023\nand came into effect on March 31, 2023, specifies that, (a) where the overseas securities regulator and the relevant competent authorities request to conduct inspections or\ninvestigations to collect evidence from a domestic enterprise and the domestic securities firms and securities service agencies providing corresponding services regarding the\noverseas offering and listing activities of the domestic enterprise, the inspection or investigation shall be carried out under the cross-border regulatory cooperation mechanism,\nand the CSRC or the relevant authorities shall provide the requisite assistance pursuant to the bilateral and multilateral cooperation mechanism, and (b) relevant domestic\ncompanies, securities firms and securities service agencies shall obtain the consent of the CSRC or the relevant administrative authorities prior to cooperating in the inspection or\ninvestigation carried out by the overseas securities regulator or relevant administrative authorities or providing documents and materials for cooperating in the inspection or\ninvestigation. While detailed interpretation of or implementation rules under Article 177, the Article 26 and the Article 11 have yet to be promulgated, the inability for an overseas\nsecurities regulator to directly conduct investigation or evidence collection activities within China may further increase difficulties faced by you in protecting your interests.\n24\nIt may be difficult for overseas shareholders and/or regulators to conduct investigations or collect evidence within Hong Kong.\nThe Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong (\"SFC”) is a signatory to the International Organization of Securities Commissions Multilateral Memorandum of\nUnderstanding (\"MMOU”), which provides for mutual investigatory and other assistance and exchange of information between securities regulators around the world, including\nthe SEC. This is also reflected in section 186 of the Securities and Futures Ordinance (\"SFO”) which empowers the SFC to exercise its investigatory powers to obtain information\nand documents requested by non-Hong Kong regulators, and section 378 of the SFO which allows the SFC to share confidential information and documents in its possession with\nsuch regulators. However, there is no assurance that such cooperation will materialize, or if it does, whether it will adequately address any efforts to investigate or collect evidence\nto the extent that may be sought by the U.S. regulators.\nRisks Relating to Our Ordinary Shares\nThe trading price of our shares could be volatile, which would result in substantial losses to investors.\nThe trading price of our ordinary shares could be volatile and could fluctuate widely in response to factors relating to our business as well as external factors beyond our\ncontrol. Factors such as variations in our financial results, announcements of new business initiatives by us or by our competitors, recruitment or departure of key personnel,\nchanges in the estimates of our financial results or changes in the recommendations of any securities analysts electing to follow our securities or the securities of our competitors\ncould cause the market price for our shares to change substantially. At the same time, securities markets could from time-to-time experience significant price and volume\nfluctuations that are not related to the operating performance of particular companies.\nThe performance and fluctuation of the market prices of other companies with business operations located mainly in the PRC that have listed their securities in the United\nStates could affect the volatility in the price of and trading volumes for our shares. In recent years, several PRC companies have listed their securities, or are in the process of\npreparing for listing their securities, on U.S. stock markets. Some of these companies have experienced significant volatility, including significant price declines in connection with\ntheir initial public offerings. The trading performances of these PRC companies’ securities at the time of or after their offerings could affect the overall investor sentiment towards\nPRC companies listed in the United States and consequently could affect the trading performance of our shares. These broad market and industry factors could significantly affect\nthe market price and volatility of our shares, regardless of our actual operating performance. Any of these factors could result in large and sudden changes in the trading volume\nand price for our shares.\nSubstantial future sales of our shares in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause our ordinary share price to decline.\nAdditional sales of our ordinary shares in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the market price of our shares to decline. As of\nFebruary 28, 2023, we completed the share consolidation to the authorized share capital (the \"Share Consolidation”) at a ratio of four hundred (400)-for-one (1) with the par value of\neach ordinary share changed to US$0.004 per ordinary share, suspended our ADRs program and commenced trading our ordinary shares. As of April 12, 2024, we had 60,819,897\nordinary shares issued and outstanding. If part or all of these shares are sold in the public market or if any other existing shareholders sell a substantial amount of their shares, the\nprevailing market price for our shares could be adversely affected. Such sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time\nand price that we deem appropriate.\n25\nIf we fail to maintain the Nasdaq minimum market value of publicly held shares, minimum bid requirements or minimum stockholder equity standard, our shares could face\nthe risk of being delisted.\nOn May 13, 2022, we received a deficiency notice from Nasdaq that stated the Company did not comply with Nasdaq’s Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) due to its failure to file its annual\nreport on Form 20-F for the period ended December 31, 2021 (the \"Filing”). Nasdaq informed the Company that it had a period of 14 days until May 27, 2022 to submit a plan (the\n\"Plan”) to Nasdaq detailing how the Company planned to regain compliance with Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements. On June 22, 2022, we received a determination letter\nfrom Nasdaq that we had regained compliance under Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) based on the filing of our annual report on Form 20-F on June 15, 2022 for the period ended December\n31, 2021.\nIf we fail to maintain compliance with Nasdaq’s listing rules, we could be subject to suspension and delisting proceedings. If the Company’s shares lose their listing status on\nThe Nasdaq Capital Market, they would likely trade in the over-the-counter market, and selling such securities could be more difficult because smaller quantities of securities would\nlikely be bought and sold, transactions could be delayed, and security analysts’ coverage may be reduced. In addition, in the event our securities are delisted, broker-dealers have\ncertain regulatory burdens imposed upon them, which may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our securities, further limiting the liquidity of such securities. A\ndetermination that our shares are \"penny stocks” will require brokers trading in our shares to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading\nactivity in the secondary trading market for our common stock. These factors could result in lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for our securities. Any\ndelisting from The Nasdaq Capital Market and continued or further declines in our share price could also greatly impair our ability to raise additional necessary capital through\nequity or debt financing, and could significantly increase the ownership dilution to stockholders caused by our issuing equity in financing or other transactions.\nWe are a foreign private issuer within the meaning of the rules under the Exchange Act, and as such we are exempt from certain provisions applicable to U.S. domestic public\ncompanies.\nBecause we qualify as a foreign private issuer under the Exchange Act, we are exempt from certain provisions of the securities rules and regulations in the United States that\nare applicable to U.S. domestic issuers, including:\n● the rules under the Exchange Act requiring the filing with the SEC of quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or current reports on Form 8-K;\n● the sections of the Exchange Act regulating the solicitation of proxies, consents, or authorizations in respect of a security registered under the Exchange Act;\n● the sections of the Exchange Act requiring insiders to file public reports of their stock ownership and trading activities and liability for insiders who profit from trades\nmade in a short period of time; and\n● the selective disclosure rules by issuers of material nonpublic information under Regulation FD.\n26\nWe are required to file an annual report on Form 20-F within four months of the end of each fiscal year. In addition, press releases relating to financial results and material\nevents will also be furnished to the SEC on Form 6-K. However, the information we are required to file with or furnish to the SEC will be less extensive and less timely compared to\nthat required to be filed with the SEC by U.S. domestic issuers. As a result, you may not be afforded the same protections or information that would be made available to you were\nyou investing in a U.S. domestic issuer.\nAs a foreign private issuer, we are permitted to, and we plan to, rely on exemptions from certain Nasdaq corporate governance standards applicable to U.S. issuers, including\nthe requirement that a majority of an issuer’s directors consist of independent directors. This might afford less protection to holders of our ordinary shares.\nSection 5605(b)(1) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules requires listed companies to have, among other things, a majority of its board members to be independent, and Section 5605(d)\nand 5605(e) require listed companies to have independent director oversight of executive compensation and nomination of directors. As a foreign private issuer, however, we are\npermitted to, and we plan to follow the home country practice in lieu of the above requirements. The corporate governance practice in our home country, the Cayman Islands, does\nnot require a majority of our board to consist of independent directors or the implementation of a nominating and corporate governance committee. We have informed Nasdaq that\nwe will follow home country practice in place of all of the requirements of Rule 5600 other than those rules which we are required to follow pursuant to the provisions of Rule\n5615(a)(3).\n● Rule 5605(b), pursuant to which (i) a majority of the board of directors must be comprised of Independent Directors, and (ii) the Independent Directors must have regularly\nscheduled meetings at which only Independent Directors are present.\n● Rule 5605(c) (other than those parts as to which the home country exemption is not applicable), pursuant to which each company must have, and certify that it has and\nwill continue to have, an audit committee of at least three members, each of whom must meet criteria set forth in Rule 5605(c)(2)(A).\n● Rule 5605(d), pursuant to which each company must (i) certify that it has adopted a formal written compensation committee charter and that the compensation committee\nwill review and reassess the adequacy of the formal written charter on an annual basis, and (ii) have a compensation committee of at least two members, each of whom\nmust be an Independent Director.\n● Rule 5605(e), pursuant to which director nominees must be selected, or recommended for the Board’s selection, either by Independent Directors constituting a majority of\nthe Board’s Independent Directors in a vote in which only Independent Directors participate, or a nominations committee comprised solely of Independent Directors.\n● Rule 5610, pursuant to which each company shall adopt a code of conduct applicable to all directors, officers and employees.\n● Rule 5620(a), pursuant to which each company listing common stock or voting preferred stock, or their equivalents, shall hold an annual meeting of shareholders no later\nthan one year after the end of the issuer’s fiscal year-end.\n● Rule 5620(b), pursuant to which each company shall solicit proxies and provide proxy statements for all meetings of shareholders and shall provide copies of such proxy\nsolicitation to Nasdaq.\n● Rule 5620(c), pursuant to which each company that is not a limited partnership shall provide for a quorum as specified in its by-laws for any meeting of the holders of\ncommon stock; provided, however, that in no case shall such quorum be less than 33% (1/3) of the outstanding shares of the company’s common voting stock.\n● Rule 5630, pursuant to which each company that is not a limited partnership shall conduct an appropriate review and oversight of all related party transactions for\npotential conflict of interest situations on an ongoing basis by the company’s audit committee or another independent body of the board of directors.\n● Rule 5635(a), pursuant to which shareholder approval is required in certain circumstances prior to an issuance of securities in connection with the acquisition of the stock\nor assets of another company.\n● Rule 5635(b), pursuant to which shareholder approval is required prior to the issuance of securities when the issuance or potential issuance will result in a change of\ncontrol of the company.\n27\n● Rule 5635(c), pursuant to which shareholder approval is required prior to the issuance of securities when a stock option or purchase plan is to be established or materially\namended or other equity compensation arrangement made or materially amended, pursuant to which stock may be acquired by officers, directors, employees, or\nconsultants, subject to certain exceptions.\n● Rule 5635(d), pursuant to which shareholder approval is required prior to the issuance of securities in connection with a transaction other than a public offering involving:\n○ the sale, issuance or potential issuance by the company of common stock (or securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock) at a price less than the\ngreater of book or market value which together with sales by officers, directors or Substantial Shareholders of the company equals 20% or more of common stock or\n20% or more of the voting power outstanding before the issuance; or\n○ the sale, issuance or potential issuance by the company of common stock (or securities convertible into or exercisable common stock) equal to 20% or more of the\ncommon stock or 20% or more of the voting power outstanding before the issuance for less than the greater of book or market value of the stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents could discourage a third-party from acquiring us, which could limit our shareholders’ opportunities to sell their shares at\na premium.\nOur fifth amended and restated memorandum and articles of association include provisions that could limit the ability of others to acquire control of us, modify our structure or\ncause us to engage in change-of-control transactions. For example, our board of directors will have the authority, without further action by our shareholders, to issue preferred\nshares in one or more series and to fix the designations, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other rights, if any, and the qualifications, limitations and\nrestrictions thereof, if any, including, without limitation, the number of shares constituting each such class or series, dividend rights, conversion rights, redemption privileges,\nvoting powers, full or limited or no voting powers, and liquidation preferences, any or all of which could be greater than the rights associated with our ordinary shares. Preferred\nshares could thus be issued quickly with terms calculated to delay or prevent a change in control or make removal of management more difficult. In addition, if our board of\ndirectors issues preferred shares, the market price of our ordinary shares could fall and the voting and other rights of the holders of our ordinary shares could be adversely\naffected. These provisions could have the effect of depriving our shareholders of an opportunity to sell their shares at a premium over prevailing market prices by discouraging\nthird parties from seeking to obtain control of us in a tender offer or similar transaction.\nWe are a Cayman Islands company and, because judicial precedent regarding the rights of shareholders is more limited under Cayman Islands law than under U.S. law, you\ncould have less protection of your shareholder rights than you would under U.S. law.\nOur corporate affairs are governed by our fifth amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, the Cayman Islands Companies Act (As Revised), as amended,\nand the common law of the Cayman Islands. The rights of shareholders to take action against the directors, actions by noncontrolling shareholders and the fiduciary\nresponsibilities of our directors to us under Cayman Islands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the Cayman Islands. The common law of the Cayman Islands\nis derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the Cayman Islands as well as from English common law, which has persuasive, but not binding, authority on a\ncourt in the Cayman Islands. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under Cayman Islands law are not as clearly established as they\nwould be under statutes or judicial precedent in some jurisdictions in the United States. In particular, the Cayman Islands has a less developed body of securities laws than the\nUnited States and provides significantly less protection to investors. In addition, some U.S. states, such as Delaware, have more fully developed and judicially interpreted bodies\nof corporate law than the Cayman Islands.\nThere is uncertainty concerning Cayman Islands law related to whether a judgment obtained from the U.S. courts under civil liability provisions of U.S. securities laws will be\ndetermined by the courts of the Cayman Islands as penal or punitive. If such a determination is made, the courts of the Cayman Islands will not recognize or enforce the judgment\nagainst a Cayman Islands company, such as our company. As the courts of the Cayman Islands have yet to rule on making such a determination on judgments obtained from U.S.\ncourts under civil liability provisions of U.S. securities laws, it is uncertain whether such judgments would be enforceable in the Cayman Islands. Our Cayman Islands counsel has\nadvised us that although there is no statutory enforcement in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in the federal or state courts of the United States, a judgment obtained in\nsuch jurisdiction will be recognized and enforced in the courts of the Cayman Islands at common law, without any re-examination of the merits of the underlying dispute, by an\naction commenced on the foreign judgment debt in the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands, provided such judgment:\n● is given by a foreign court of competent jurisdiction;\n28\n● imposes on the judgment debtor a liability to pay a liquidated sum for which the judgment has been given;\n● is final and conclusive;\n● is not in respect of taxes, a fine or a penalty;\n● is not inconsistent with a Cayman Islands judgment in respect of the same matter; and\n● is not impeachable on the grounds of fraud and was not obtained in a manner and is not of a kind the enforcement of which is contrary to natural justice or the public\npolicy of the Cayman Islands\nYou should also read \"Item 10. Additional Information—B. Memorandum and Articles of Association—Differences in Corporate Law” for some of the differences between the\ncorporate and securities laws in the Cayman Islands and the United States.\nYou will have limited ability to bring an action against us or against our directors and officers, or to enforce a judgment against us or them, because we are incorporated in\nthe Cayman Islands, because we conduct parts of our operations in the PRC and Hong Kong and because some of our directors and officers reside outside the United States.\nWe are incorporated in the Cayman Islands and conduct our operations in the United States, the PRC and Hong Kong. A significant part of our assets are located outside the\nUnited States. Some of our officers and directors reside outside the United States and a substantial portion of the assets of those persons are located outside of the United States.\nAs a result, it could be difficult or impossible for you to bring an action against us or against these individuals in the Cayman Islands or in the PRC or in Hong Kong in the event\nthat you believe that your rights have been infringed under the applicable securities laws or otherwise. Even if you are successful in bringing an action of this kind, the laws of the\nCayman Islands, of China and of Hong Kong could render you unable to enforce a judgment against our assets or the assets of our directors and officers. In addition, there is\nuncertainty as to whether the courts of the Cayman Islands or the PRC or Hong Kong would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts against us or such persons predicated\nupon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state, and it is uncertain whether such Cayman Islands or PRC or Hong Kong courts would be\ncompetent to hear original actions brought in the Cayman Islands or China or Hong Kong against us or such persons predicated upon the securities laws of the United States or\nany state.\nShareholders of Cayman Islands exempted companies such as ourselves have no general rights under Cayman Islands law to inspect corporate records and accounts or to\nobtain copies of lists of shareholders of these companies (apart from our memorandum and articles of association, special resolutions of our shareholders and the register of\nmortgages and charges). Our directors have discretion under Cayman Islands law to determine whether or not, and under what conditions, our corporate records could be\ninspected by our shareholders, but are not obliged to make them available to our shareholders. This could make it more difficult for you to obtain the information needed to\nestablish any facts necessary for a shareholder motion or to solicit proxies from other shareholders in connection with a proxy contest.\nAs a result of all of the above, public shareholders might have more difficulty in protecting their interests in the face of actions taken by management, members of the board of\ndirectors or controlling shareholders than they would as public shareholders of a U.S. company.\nCompliance with rules and requirements applicable to public companies could cause us to incur increased costs, which could negatively affect our results of operations.\nAs a public company, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, including costs\nassociated with public company reporting requirements. We ceased to be an \"emerging growth company” on December 31, 2020, and are no longer eligible for reduced disclosure\nrequirements and exemptions applicable to emerging growth companies. We expect that our loss of emerging growth company status will require additional attention from\nmanagement and will result in increased costs to us, which could include higher legal fees, accounting fees and fees associated with investor relations activities, among others. We\nhave also incurred and will continue to incur costs associated with corporate governance requirements, including requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules\nimplemented by the SEC and Nasdaq Capital Market, has requirements in corporate governance practices of public companies. We expect these rules and regulations to continue\nto increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs and to make certain corporate activities more time-consuming and costly. Complying with these rules and\nrequirements could be especially difficult and costly for us because we might have difficulty locating sufficient personnel in China with experience and expertise relating to U.S.\nGAAP and U.S. public company reporting requirements, and such personnel could command higher salaries relative to what similarly experienced personnel would command in the\nUnited States. If we cannot employ sufficient personnel to ensure compliance with these rules and regulations, we might need to rely more on outside legal, accounting and\nfinancial experts, which could be very costly. In addition, we will incur additional costs associated with our public company reporting requirements. We are evaluating and\nmonitoring developments to these rules, and we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we might incur or the timing of such costs.\n29\nITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY\nA. History and Development of the Company\nWe were originally a group buying and B2C e-commerce platform in China under the name of \"Beijing Wowo Tuan Information Technology Co., Ltd.” To facilitate investment\nin our company, we incorporated Wowo Limited in Cayman Islands as a holding company in July 2011.\nIn April 2015, Wowo Limited completed the initial public offering and listed our ADSs on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol \"WOWO.” We raised approximately\n$37.3 million in net proceeds from our initial public offering after deducting underwriting commissions and the offering expenses payable by us.\nIn June 2015, we acquired Join Me Group (HK) Investment Company Limited to establish our food services industry B2B business. We issued 741,422,780 ordinary shares and\npaid $30.0 million as consideration for the acquisition.\nIn September 2015, we divested our group buying and B2C e-commerce businesses to focus our efforts on our food services industry B2B business.\nIn September 2015, we raised $15.0 million in a private placement transaction with Mr. Maodong Xu.\nIn June 2016, we changed the trading symbol for our ADSs listed on the Nasdaq Global Market to \"JMU.” In December 2016, we also changed our company name to JMU\nLimited.\nIn August 2016, TANSH Global Food Group Co., Ltd, which was formerly known as Xiao Nan Guo Restaurants Holdings Limited, a Hong Kong Stock Exchange listed\ncompany (Stock Code: 3666), through its wholly-owned subsidiary, acquired a 9.82% stake in our company via secondary transfers for a total consideration of HK$368 million\n(approximately $47.5 million).\nIn July 2018, we changed the ratio of our ADSs to ordinary shares from one ADS representing 18 ordinary shares to one ADS representing 180 ordinary shares.\nIn May 2019, we acquired Mercurity Limited (previously known as Unicorn Investment Limited) to establish our blockchain-based digital asset infrastructure solutions\nbusiness. We issued 632,660,858 new ordinary shares as consideration for the acquisition.\nIn July 2019, we divested our B2B services to food-industry suppliers and customers by selling all the issued and outstanding shares of New Admiral Limited, or New Admiral,\nour former wholly-owned subsidiary, to Marvel Billion Development Limited, or Marvel Billion, in exchange for $1.0 million in cash. In addition, the buyer and the divested entities\nagreed to waive all the rights and claims with respect to the liabilities owed by us to the divested entities.\nIn January 2020, we transferred the listing of our ADSs from the Nasdaq Global Market to the Nasdaq Capital Market.\n30\nIn February 2020, we changed the trading symbol for our ADSs listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market to \"MFH.”\nIn March 2020, we acquired the entire ownership of NBpay Investment Limited, or NBpay, to further strengthen our capabilities in the blockchain-enabled payment solutions.\nWe issued 761,789,601 new ordinary shares to Mr. Kaiming Hu, our principal shareholder and the sole shareholder of Kuali Yitong, as consideration for the acquisition.\nIn April 2020, we changed our company name to \"Mercurity Fintech Holding Inc.” to align the company name with our new blockchain-based digital asset infrastructure\nsolutions business.\nIn May 2020, we changed the ratio of our ADSs to ordinary shares from one ADS representing 180 ordinary shares to one ADS representing 360 ordinary shares.\nIn August 2021, we added cryptocurrency mining as one of our main businesses going forward. We had entered into cryptocurrency mining pools by executing a business\ncontract with a collective mining service provider on October 22, 2021 to provide computing power to the mining pool and derived USD$664,307 related revenue in 2021 and\nUSD$783,089 related revenue in the first half of 2022.\nOn January 15, 2022, we disposed both of the VIEs, both of which were under the control by Lianji Future, a wholly foreign owned subsidiary of the Company.\nOn February16, 2022, the former acting Chief Financial Officer Wei Zhu, who was also the Company’s former Co-Chief Executive Officer, and a former member and Co-\nChairperson of the Board, was taken away from the Company’s office in Shenzhen, China for personal reasons to cooperate with the investigation from Sheyang County Public\nSecurity Bureau, Yancheng City, Jiangsu Province, People’s Republic of China. At the same time, Sheyang County Public Security Bureau forcibly removed the safe belonging to\nthe Company that stored the digital asset hardware cold wallet, and forcibly destroyed the safe and seized the crypto asset hardware cold wallet and all crypto assets stored in it,\nand we verified that 95.23843 Bitcoins and 2005537.5 USD Coins stored in the out-of-control wallet had been transferred to another unknown wallet. PRC law firm Deheng Law\nOffice (\"Deheng”) has been representing the Company in our efforts to recover the wrongfully seized cold wallet and cryptocurrencies from the Public Security Bureau.\nDue to the dismantling of the VIEs and the cessation of all business related to the digital asset transaction platforms, the temporary difficulties caused by the impoundment of\nour cryptocurrencies and substantial changes of our original technical team in China in 2022, our blockchain technical services business did not generate any revenue in 2022.\nIn July 2022, we added consultation services to our business, providing business consultation services to international corporate clients, especially those in the blockchain\nindustry. Meanwhile, we conducted viability studies about the business models, license requirements and operational costs of online and traditional brokerage services and digital\npayment business. However, due to resource restraints, we have ceased our development plans in digital payment business, including digital payment services and solution\nconsulting, and applications for the required money transmit licenses since March 2024.\nOn July 15, 2022, we incorporated Mercurity Fintech Technology Holding Inc. (\"MFH Tech”) to develop distributed computing and storage services (including\ncryptocurrency mining and providing cloud storage services for distributed application product operators) and consultation services.\nOn December 15, 2022, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Huangtong International Co., Ltd., providing for the acquisition and purchase of Web3 decentralized\nstorage infrastructure, including cryptocurrency mining servers, cables, and other electronic devices, for an aggregate consideration of USD$5,980,000, payable in our ordinary\nshares. The investment was made with an aim to own mining machines capable of gathering, processing, and storing vast amounts of data, to advance the cryptocurrency mining\nbusiness, and to further solidify us as a pioneer in the creation of the Web3 framework. On December 20, 2022, the assets began to be used for Filecoin (\"FIL”) mining operations\nand derived USD$348 related revenue in 2022. In January 2023, we transferred all of the Web3 decentralized storage infrastructure to our US subsidiary MFH Tech, which serves as\nthe operating entity for our business of Filecoin mining and cloud storage services for distributed application product operators.\nOn December 29, 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors approved to proceed with: 1) the share consolidation and simultaneous change of the ADR ratio; 2) the transfer of\nthe register of members of the Company; and 3) the termination of the deposit agreement. The Board approved the proposal on the share consolidation to the authorized share\ncapital (the \"Share Consolidation”) at a ratio of four hundred (400)-for-one (1) with the par value of each ordinary share changed to US$0.004 per ordinary share. Further, as\napproved by the Board, the Company will effect a simultaneous change of the American Depositary Receipts (\"ADRs”) to ordinary share ratio from 1-to-360 to 1-to-1 (the \"ADR\nRatio Change”). The Board approved to terminate the Deposit Agreement, as amended (the \"Deposit Agreement”) effective on February 28, 2023, by and among the Company,\nCitibank, N.A., and the holders and beneficial owners of American Depositary Shares outstanding under the terms of the Deposit Agreement dated as of April 13, 2015 and as\namended.\n31\nOn January 10, 2023, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Jinhe Capital Limited, providing for the purchase of 5,000 Antminer S19 PRO Bitcoin mining machines,\nfor an aggregate consideration of USD$9,000,000. On March 10, 2024, the Company and Jinhe entered into a Cancellation Agreement to cancel such purchase in its entirety. Going\nforward, we currently have no plans to resume Bitcoin mining business.\nOn January 28, 2023, we decided to write off NBpay Investment Limited and its subsidiaries, which had no meaningful assets or business nor employees.\nOn February 28, 2023, when the Share Consolidation was effective, the Company’s outstanding ordinary shares changed from 18,614,900,104 shares with a par value of\n$0.00001 per share to 46,538,116 shares with a par value of $0.004 per share.\nOn April 12, 2023, we completed the incorporation of another U.S. subsidiary, Chaince Securities, which plans to develop financial advisory services, online and traditional\nbrokerage services independently in the future. On May 3, 2023, Chaince Securities entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement for the acquisition of all assets and liabilities of\nJ.V. Delaney & Associates, an investment advisory firm and FINRA licensed broker dealer. The FINRA review process for such acquisition is currently ongoing.\nFrom April to June 2023, our management reassessed the potential adverse effects of changes in the Company’s business environment, and readjusted the Company’s\nbusiness structure and the future development plan. Considering the increasing difficulty of crypto mining and the general losses by top crypto mining enterprises, we have\ndecided to reduce the scale of procurement of Bitcoin miners and reduce the Company’s investment in the crypto mining field. As such, the Company and Jinhe Capital Limited\nentered into an amendment (the \"Amendment”) to the S19 Pro Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which the parties agreed to reduce the purchase order to no more than 2,000\nBitcoin miners for a total amount of no more than $3.6 million.\nAlso considering the enormous uncertainty brought by the cryptocurrency market turmoil in the past two years to the blockchain industry, as well as the regulatory\nuncertainties, despite our ability to quickly reorganize the blockchain technical service team, we have decided not to continue conducting blockchain technology service business\nrelated to the asset trading platform, asset digitalization platform and decentralized finance (DeFi) platform.\nOn October 2, 2023, the Company’s Annual General Meeting approved to increase the authorized share capital of the Company from US$250,000 divided into 62,500,000\nordinary shares with a par value of US$0.004 each, to US$4,000,000 divided into 1,000,000,000 ordinary shares of a par value of US$0.004 each, by the creation of an additional\n937,500,000 ordinary shares with a par value of US$0.004 each.\nOn March 7, 2024, considering the uncertainties in the digital payment industry, the Company decided to suspend its development plan related to its digital payment solutions\nand digital payment services, as well as its application for an MSB (Money Service Business) license. In particular, the Company has obtained the approval of its board of directors\non March 7, 2024 to terminate its \"digital payment solutions” and \"digital payment services” businesses, which did not generate any meaningful revenue in the past.\nAfter the adjustment of our business strategies, the focus of our operating subsidiaries are as follows: (i) MFH Tech acting as the operating entity of distributed storage and\ncomputing services and business consultation services business in North America; (ii) after completing the acquisition of all assets and liabilities of J.V. Delaney & Associates and\nonly after obtaining FINRA approval, Chaince Securities to operate our financial advisory services and online and traditional brokerage services in North America; and (iii) Ucon\nand Lianji Future acting as the operating entities of the business consultation services in the Asia-Pacific region.\nOur principal executive offices are located at 1330 Avenue of Americas, Fl 33, New York, 10019, United States. Our registered office in the Cayman Islands is located at the\noffices of Maples Corporate Services Limited, PO Box 309, Ugland House, Grand Cayman, KY1-1104, Cayman Islands.\nSEC maintains an internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC on\nwww.sec.gov. You can also find information on our investor relationship website https://mercurityfintech.com/. The information on our website should not be deemed a part of this\nannual report.\n32\nB. Business Overview\nOur Principal Business\nIn August 2021, we added cryptocurrency mining as one of our main businesses. We entered into cryptocurrency mining pools by executing a business contract with a\ncollective mining service provider on October 22, 2021 to provide computing power to the mining pool and derived USD$664,307 related revenue in 2021 and USD$783,089 related\nrevenue in the first half of 2022.\nIn July 2022, we added consultation services to our business, providing business consultation services to global corporate clients, especially those in the blockchain industry.\nMeanwhile, we conducted viability studies about the business models, license requirements and operational costs of online and traditional brokerage services and digital payment\nbusiness. However, due to resource restraints, we have ceased our development plans in digital payment business, including digital payment services and solution consulting, and\napplications for the required money transmit licenses since March 2024.\nOn July 15, 2022, we incorporated Mercurity Fintech Technology Holding Inc. (\"MFH Tech”) to develop distributed computing and storage services (including\ncryptocurrency mining and providing cloud storage services for distributed application product operators) and consultation services.\nOn August 23, 2022, MFH Tech signed a Consulting Agreement with a Chinese media company, pursuant to which MFH Tech will serve as a business consultant in order to\nfacilitate the client to establish the entity in the United States and make financing strategy, and the agreed amount of the immutable consideration portion of the agreement is\n$160,000. We recognized consultation services revenue of $80,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022 based on the percentage-of-completion.\nOn December 15, 2022, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Huangtong International Co., Ltd., providing for the acquisition and purchase of Web3 decentralized\nstorage infrastructure, including cryptocurrency mining servers, cables, and other electronic devices, for an aggregate consideration of USD$5,980,000, payable in our ordinary\nshares. The investment was made with the aim to own mining machines capable of gathering, processing, and storing vast amounts of data, to advance the cryptocurrency mining\nbusiness, and to advance the Web3 framework. We started using some of the storage capacity of these devices for Filecoin mining business from December 20, 2022. In January\n2023, we transferred all of the Web3 decentralized storage infrastructure to our US subsidiary MFH Tech, which serves as the operating entity for our business of Filecoin mining\nand cloud storage services for decentralized platform operators. For the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2023, we earned $348 and $285,928 respectively in Filecoin mining\nrevenue from physical mining operations, and did not receive any revenue from providing cloud storage services to decentralized platform operators.\nOn April 12, 2023, we completed the incorporation of another U.S. subsidiary, Chaince Securities, Inc. (\"Chaince Securities”), which plans to develop financial advisory\nservices, online and traditional brokerage services independently in the future. On May 3, 2023, Chaince Securities entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement for the acquisition\nof all assets and liabilities of J.V. Delaney & Associates, an investment advisory firm and FINRA licensed broker dealer. The FINRA review process for such acquisition is\ncurrently ongoing.\nAs of June 30, 2023, all the agreed services under the consulting agreement with the Chinese media signed on August 23, 2022 had been completed, and the Company\nrecognized consultation services revenue of $80,000 for the first half of 2023 based on the percentage-of-completion.\nOn August 1, 2023, the Company signed a supplementary comprehensive service agreement with the Chinese media company. The Company will continue to assist the client\nin providing management consulting services and introducing professional service agency resources.

The Company will serve as a business consultant in order to\nfacilitate introductions between the Company’s clients and esteemed third-party audit firms, legal representatives, and underwriting entities that are crucial for the clients’\nfundraising endeavors within the U.S. capital market. The Company expects to receive $50,000 in revenue from this agreement within the next year.\n33\nOn December 5, 2023, the Company signed an Origin Storage Filecoin Mining Service Contract with Origin Storage PTE. LTD. (\"Origin Storage”). The Company has used the\nOrigin Storage’s technology to re-package the Web3 decentralized storage infrastructure and conduct Filecoin mining business through Origin Storage’s network platform. The\nFilecoin mining services provided by Origin Storage included, but not limited to, storage server services, computing encapsulation server services, and technical services. As of\nApril 15, 2024, by adopting the new technology provided by Origin Storage, we had opened two new nodes (replacing the two old nodes we opened in 2023) with an effective\nstorage capacity of 70 PiB, taking up only 7 PiB original storage capacity (the \"Raw Byte Power”) of our Web3 decentralized storage infrastructure, which means that using the new\ntechnology provided by Origin Storage to occupy the same original storage capacity can achieve 10 times the effective storage capacity, and the Company is expected to achieve\ngreater productivity of the cryptocurrency mining business in the future.\nOn March 7, 2024, considering the many uncertainties in the relevant industry, the Company decided to temporarily abandon its development plan related to digital payment\nsolutions, as well as the application for the MSB (Money Service Business) license.\nAfter the adjustment of our business strategies, the focuses of our respective operating subsidiaries are as follows: (i) MFH Tech acting as the operating entity of distributed\nstorage and computing services and business consultation services in North America; (ii) after completing the acquisition of all assets and liabilities of J.V. Delaney & Associates\nand after obtaining FINRA approval, Chaince Securities to operate our financial advisory services, online and traditional brokerage services in North America; and (iii) Ucon and\nLianji Future acting as the operating entities of the business consultation services in the Asia-Pacific region.\nBusiness Segment 1 – Business consultation services\nWe provide comprehensive business consultation services and industry resource support to global corporate clients based on the resource advantages we have accumulated\nover the years.

Presently, we are in advance negotiations with several Asian clients to provide them with comprehensive business consulting to enter the\nUS market. It is expected that we will reach agreements and sign contracts with one or two clients in the first half of 2024.\n34\nBusiness Segment 2 – Financial advisory services and Brokerage services\nOn May 3, 2023, Chaince Securities entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the \"JV and Chaince Transaction”) for the acquisition of all assets and liabilities of J.V.\nDelaney & Associates, an investment advisory firm and FINRA licensed broker dealer. We commenced the application process for continued membership application of the\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in August 2023. Based on the status of the FINRA review, the Company expects to receive FINRA approval on the JV and\nChaince Transaction in the first half of 2024, although the Company cannot assure that its FINRA application will be approved within such timeframe or at all. With the FINRA\nlicenses, we will be able to provide more comprehensive professional services to corporate clients that want to become publicly traded in the United States, including financial\nadvisory services and brokerage services.\n● Target customers or clients: Our financial advisory services and brokerage services business mainly targets clients from Greater China, Southeast Asia, and North\nAmerica (Canada, the United States, Mexico).\n● Fee structure: Our fees are generally payable by the client by tranches upon reaching certain project milestones, such as upon first filing with the relevant regulator or\nupon completion of a project.\n● Location: Financial advisory services and brokerage services will be based in our offices in Shenzhen, Hong Kong and New York, covering Greater China, Southeast Asia\nand North America, respectively.\n● Milestones or Timetables: Our fees are generally payable by the client by tranches upon reaching certain project milestones, such as upon first filing with the relevant\nregulator or upon completion of a project.\nPending the FINRA approval, we are building a professional team of 7-8 persons in New York to carry out financial advisory services and brokerage services, and we are also\nbuilding a market promotion and customer service team of 3-4 persons in Hong Kong and Shenzhen to attract more potential clients.\n1) Financial advisory services\nOur financial advisory services will focus on providing comprehensive financial services to corporate clients in emerging countries and regions planning to enter the US\ncapital markets, such as providing capital operation plans, private equity financing services, investment consulting services, and mergers and acquisitions services to the clients.\nOur financial advisory services will be based in our offices in Shenzhen, Hong Kong and New York, covering Greater China, Southeast Asia and North America, respectively.\nWe already have a financial advisory service team in New York, and we are establishing our Asian financial advisory service teams in Hong Kong and Shenzhen to seek more new\nclients in the Asia Pacific region and provide better services for these clients in the future.\n2) Brokerage services\nIn addition to our financial advisory business, we may make securities underwriting an important part of our brokerage services business, in order to provide more\ncomprehensive financial services for our corporate clients. We will decide whether to carry out other brokerage services, such as securities brokerage and asset management based\non the Company’s future business development.\nOur brokerage services will mainly be located in our New York office, serving clients in Greater China, Southeast Asia, and North America. We will also promote our brokerage\nservices to clients through our offices in Hong Kong and Shenzhen.\nIt should be emphasized that our financial advisory services and brokerage services (securities underwriting and other brokerage services) can only be carried out after we\nhave completed the acquisition of J.V. Delaney & Associates and obtained the financial license and FINRA approval required for brokerage services business.\nBusiness Segment 3 – Distributed computing and storage services\nOur distributed storage and computing services business includes cryptocurrency mining and cloud storage services for other distributed application product operators.\n35\nIn August 2021, we added cryptocurrency mining as one of our main businesses. Cryptocurrency mining is part of our distributed computing and storage services business.\nFrom October 2021 to April 2022, we obtained the usage rights of a certain number and specific models of Bitcoin mining machines and specific business premises by\nexecuting contracts with the sharing mining service provider, and registered as users on the mining pool website, complying with the general terms and conditions required to join\nthe mining pool published on the mining pool website, to increase computing power to the mining pool. In exchange for providing computing power, we are entitled to a fractional\nshare of the fixed digital asset awards the mining pool operator receives, for successfully adding blocks to the blockchain. Our fractional share is relative to the proportion of\ncomputing power we contribute to the mining pool operator toward the total computing power contributed by all mining pool participants in solving the current algorithm.\nProviding computing power in digital asset transaction verification services is an output of our ordinary activities. The provision of such computing power is the only performance\nobligation in the general terms of the mining pool website. The transaction consideration we receive, if any, is noncash consideration, which we measure at fair value on the date\nreceived, which is not materially different than the fair value at contract inception or the time we have earned the award from the pools. These considerations are all variable. Since\nsignificant reversals of cumulative revenue are possible given the nature of the assets, the consideration is constrained until the mining pool operator successfully places a block\n(by being the first to solve an algorithm) and we receive confirmation of the consideration it will receive, at which time revenue is recognized. There is no significant financing\ncomponent related to these transactions. Fair value of the digital assets award received is determined using the quoted price of the related digital assets at the time of receipt. The\nCompany earned $783,090 in Bitcoin mining revenue from shared mining operations for the year ended December 31, 2022, and $664,307 for the year ended December 31, 2021. We\nhave not operated any Bitcoin mining business since May 2022 and there were no related revenues in the year ended December 31, 2023.\nOn December 15, 2022, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Huangtong International Co., Ltd., providing for the acquisition and purchase of Web3 decentralized\nstorage infrastructure, including cryptocurrency mining servers, cables, and other electronic devices, for an aggregate consideration of USD$5.98 million, payable in our ordinary\nshares. Starting on December 20, 2022, we used some of the storage capacity of these devices for Filecoin mining business, and other storage capacity will be used to provide\ncloud storage services to distributed application product operators. We have rented the Filecoin mining operating premises located in New Jersey, United States from Cologix US,\nInc. and we have entered into the Filecoin mainnet as a miner by registering as a user on the Filecoin mainnet, complying with the general terms and conditions required to become\na miner published on the Filecoin mainnet. The essence of Filecoin mining business is that we utilize our Web3 decentralized storage infrastructure and provide cloud storage\nservices to the end customers through the Filecoin mainnet. In exchange for providing storage capacity, we are entitled to a fractional share of the fixed digital asset awards from\nthe Filecoin mainnet, for successfully adding blocks to the blockchain. Our fractional share is relative to the proportion of storage capacity we contribute to Filecoin mainnet\ntoward the total storage capacity contributed by all the Filecoin mainnet’s participants in solving the current algorithm. Providing storage capacity in digital asset transaction\nverification services is an output of our ordinary activities. The provision of such storage capacity is the only performance obligation in the general terms of the Filecoin mainnet.\nThe transaction consideration we receive, if any, is noncash consideration, which we measure at fair value on the date received, which is not materially different than the fair value\nat contract inception or the time we have earned the award from the Filecoin mainnet. These considerations are all variable. Since significant reversals of cumulative revenue are\npossible given the nature of the assets, the consideration is constrained until the all the miners successfully places a block (by being the first to solve an algorithm) and we receive\nconfirmation of the consideration it will receive, at which time revenue is recognized. There is no significant financing component related to these transactions. Fair value of the\ndigital assets award received is determined using the quoted price of the related digital assets at the time of receipt. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we earned $348 in\nFilecoin mining revenue from physical mining operations. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we earned $285,928 in Filecoin mining revenue from physical mining operations.\nThe Web3 decentralized storage infrastructure, which we acquired through a share offering in December 2022, is expected to achieve a maximum storage capacity of\napproximately 100PiB. We plan to use the storage capacity for Filecoin and other cryptocurrency mining and provide cloud storage services to other distributed application\nproduct operators. However, due to the continued low market prices of Filecoin in 2023, as well as the average return on unit computing power of Filecoin mining business\ndecreasing with the growth of the computing power of the whole network, as of the end of 2023, we had not opened enough nodes to achieve the initial goals of our Filecoin\nmining business. Apart from the Filecoin mining business, we had not utilized the infrastructure for any other cryptocurrency mining business, nor had we provided cloud storage\nservices to any other distributed application product operators. Therefore, the Web3 decentralized storage infrastructure was not fully utilized during fiscal year 2023. However,\nthese Web3 decentralized storage infrastructures were recognized for depreciation costs on a straight-line basis, which resulted in significant losses for our business of providing\ndistributed computing and storage services in 2023.\n36\nOn December 5, 2023, the Company signed an Origin Storage Filecoin Mining Service Contract with Origin Storage PTE. LTD. (\"Origin Storage”). The Company have used\nOrigin Storage’s technology to re package the Web3 decentralized storage infrastructure and conduct Filecoin mining business through Origin Storage’s network platform. The\nFilecoin mining services provided by Origin Storage include but are not limited to storage server services, computing encapsulation server services, and technical services.\nIn January 2024, we repackaged our Web3 decentralized storage infrastructure for Filecoin mining using new technology provided by Origin Storage and began running two\nnew Filecoin mining nodes. As of the date of this annual report, the effective storage capacity of our two new Filecoin mining nodes has reached 64PiB, exceeding our original\ntarget storage capacity of 60.4PiB, and it only take up 6.4PiB of the original storage capacity (the \"Raw Byte Power”) of our Web3 decentralized storage infrastructure. In other\nwords, the effective storage capacity of the Company can be magnified tenfold with Origin Storage’s technologies.\nIn this way, most of the original storage capacity (the \"Raw Byte Power”) of the Company’s Web3 decentralized storage infrastructure will remain available for use, which we\ncan utilize to expand our Filecoin mining business, or engage in other cryptocurrency mining businesses, or provide cloud storage services to other distributed application product\noperators operators. We have not currently determined the other types of cryptocurrencies we may mine or otherwise transact in, and any such decision will be made based on\neconomic return and legal analysis. We will consult our legal advisers and abide by relevant SEC and court guidance on whether such cryptocurrencies constitute securities, but\nwe currently do not have plans to mine any type of cryptocurrency that constitute \"securities” under U.S. law. We expect to decide how these remaining storage capabilities will be\nused by the end of June 2024.\nOn January 10, 2023, we entered into an asset purchase agreement (the \"Original Contract”) with Jinhe Capital Limited (\"Jinhe”), providing for the purchase of 5,000 Antminer\nS19 PRO Bitcoin mining machines, for an aggregate consideration of $9 million. However, from April to June 2023, our management reassessed the potential adverse effects of\nchanges in the Company’s business environment and readjusted the Company’s business structure and the future development plan. Considering the increasing difficulty of\nmining in the mining industry and the general loss of the top mining enterprises, we have decided to reduce the procurement scale of Bitcoin miners and reduce the Company’s\ninvestment in the mining field. As such, the Company and Jinhe Capital Limited entered into an amendment to the S19 Pro Purchase Agreement (the \"Amendment”), pursuant to\nwhich the parties have agreed to reduce the purchase order to no more than 2,000 Bitcoin miners for a total amount of no more than $3.6 million. As the Ant miner S19 Pro Bitcoin\nminer is currently one of the best-selling models in the market and our order is back ordered, our batch of the S19 Pro has not been delivered as of the date of this letter. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, the Company had paid the seller $3 million US dollars. On March 10, 2024, the Company and Jinhe entered into a Cancellation Agreement, as which the Original\nContract and the Amendment were all cancelled and terminated in its entirety. Going forward, we currently have no plans to resume Bitcoin mining business.\nIn January 2023, our U.S. subsidiary, MFH Tech signed a Coinbase Prime Broker Agreement with Coinbase, Inc., a copy of which is appended as Exhibit 99.2 to this annual\nreport. The agreement includes the Coinbase Custody Custodial Services Agreement and the Coinbase Master Trading Agreement. The agreement sets forth the terms and\nconditions pursuant to which the Coinbase entities will open and maintain the prime broker account for us and provide services relating to custody, trade execution, lending or\npost-trade credit (if applicable), and other services for certain digital assets. We do not currently own and/or hold crypto assets on behalf of third parties. Coinbase Custody\nmaintains, at its sole expense, insurance coverage in such types and amounts as commercially reasonable for the Custodial Services provided in the Coinbase Prime Broker\nAgreement. Coinbase maintains a commercial crime insurance policy which encompasses losses due to employee collusion or fraud, physical loss or damage of critical material,\nsecurity breaches or hacks, and fraudulent transfers, including asset theft from both hot and cold storage. Additionally, Coinbase maintains cyber insurance, which covers loss of\nincome and data recovery resulting from security failures leading to business interruptions, covering computer forensic costs, incident response legal fees, notification expenses,\nand privacy claims by regulators. Based on publicly available information, Coinbase maintains a commercial crime insurance policy of up to $320 million. The insurance maintained\nby Coinbase is shared among all of Coinbase’s customers, is not specific to our Company and may not be available or sufficient to protect our Company from all possible losses or\nsources of losses. Coinbase’s insurance may not cover the type of losses experienced by our Company. Alternatively, we may be forced to share such insurance proceeds with\nother clients or customers of Coinbase, which could reduce the amount of such proceeds that are available to us.\nIn May 2023, it was reported that a trust sponsor had requested for withdrawal of its registration statement filed with the SEC in deference to the requests in the SEC Staff’s\nletters, and that the SEC was of the view that Filecoins constituted \"securities” under U.S. securities laws. Additionally, in June 2023, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Binance, and\nnamed Filecoin as, among other cryptocurrencies, constituting \"securities” under U.S. securities laws. Such categorization, as well as further regulatory developments, new\nlegislations and regulations, and changes in regulatory policy, may have materially adverse impacts on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as the\nprice of our shares. Our Filecoin assets constituted less than 2.4% of our consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2023. As such, we believe that such regulatory changes will\nhave minimal impacts on us. We are reviewing the recent legal and regulatory development and we intend to alter our business focus and strategy whenever necessary to remain\ncompliant with all applicable laws and regulations. See also \"Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Certain crypto assets and cryptocurrencies have been\nidentified as a \"security” in certain jurisdictions, and we may be subject to regulatory scrutiny, inquiries, investigations, fines, and other penalties, which may adversely affect our\nbusiness, operating results, and financial condition.”\n37\nIn addition, due to recent developments in the regulations of cryptocurrencies, particularly in the U.S., such as the creation of subcommittees of the House Financial Services\nCommittee, the approval of custodians for digital assets securities, and the Security and Exchange Commission’s crackdown on illegal trading platforms, we have seen increases of\nthe price volatility of various cryptocurrency assets. For instance, the price of Bitcoins experienced sharp volatility in the first seven months of 2023, including a high price of more\nthan $31,000 and a low price of less than $17,000, and the price of Filecoins also experienced sharp volatility in the first seven months of 2023, including a high price of more than $9\nand a low price of less than $3. Our total cryptocurrency asset (excluding the Bitcoins and USD Coins out of control, which have been fully recognized as impairment losses)\nholdings constituted less than 2.4% of our consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2023. As such, we believe that the immediate impact of such regulatory changes will be\nlimited to us. We are closely monitoring the changes and trends in prices of cryptocurrencies, and we may make changes to our business focus and strategies in the future should\nthe need arise. See also \"Risk Factors— Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Our operating results may fluctuate and continue to fluctuate, including due to the highly\nvolatile nature of crypto.”\nSimilarly, due to the increased price volatility of cryptocurrencies in general, individualized management failures, failures of internal control and oversight, as well as other\nmacroeconomic or other factors, a string of bankruptcies have occurred in the crypto asset industry, including those of Genesis Global Capital, FTX, BlockFi, Celsuis Network,\nVoyager Digital and Three Arrows Capital. Such bankruptcies and adverse developments in the crypto asset industry and have not impacted and is not expected to materially and\nadversely impact our business, financial condition, customers, and counterparties, either directly or indirectly, as the Company is not a direct counterparty to such entities. We do\nnot have any material assets that may not be recovered due to the bankruptcies of those named companies or may otherwise be lost or misappropriated. We are also not aware of\nany material direct or indirect exposures to other counterparties, customers, custodians, or other participants in crypto asset markets that have filed for bankruptcy, that have been\ndecreed insolvent or bankrupt, that have made any assignment for the benefit of creditors, or have had a receiver appointed for them, that have experienced excessive redemptions\nor suspended redemptions or withdrawals of crypto assets, that have the crypto assets of their customers unaccounted for; or that have experienced material corporate compliance\nfailures. However, it is possible that these recent bankruptcies may have exacerbated the further pricing decline of certain cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, in 2023 which may\nhave imposed adverse impacts to our mining losses and/or value of the cryptocurrencies we hold.\nInvestors in our securities should be aware that engaging in cryptocurrency mining may result in certain environmental harms and transition risks related to climate change\nthat may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, as mining operations consume a substantial amount of power, which may contribute to increased carbon\nemissions. Recent policy and regulatory changes relating to limiting carbon emissions could impose additional operational and compliance burdens on our cryptocurrency mining\noperations, such as more stringent reporting requirements or higher compliance fees. There have also been recent market trends that may alter business opportunities for our\nindustry, stemming from recent regulatory and policy changes in the jurisdictions in which we operate, where regulators have come out to state that certain cryptocurrencies\nconstitute \"securities” and that there would be increased regulation and oversight over businesses engaged in cryptocurrencies, which is highly power-consuming and poses\nenvironmental risks. These may lead to increased credit risks, which may lead to financiers and lenders being less willing to enter into business relationships with us, as well as\nincreased litigation risks related to climate change in the jurisdictions in which we carry out mining operations, Some businesses as well as some investors may have also ceased\naccepting cryptocurrencies for certain types of purchases, and stopped investing in businesses involved in cryptocurrencies businesses, due to environmental concerns\nassociated with cryptocurrencies mining, which may have adverse impacts on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. See \"Risk Factors— Risks Relating to\nOur Business and Industry—Environmental concerns associated with cryptocurrencies mining could have adverse impacts on our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.”\n38\nOur clients\nBusiness consultation services\nOur business consultation services mainly serves clients from Greater China, Southeast Asia, and North America. As of December 31, 2023, we have obtained two clients, one\nfrom China and the other from the United States. We have plans to invest more into promotion and brand awareness to attract more clients in the future.\nFinancial advisory services and Brokerage services\nOur financial advisory services and brokerage services business mainly targets clients from Greater China, Southeast Asia, and North America. Our financial advisory services\nand brokerage services (securities underwriting and other brokerage services) can only be carried out after we have completed the acquisition of J.V. Delaney & Associates and\nobtained the financial license and FINRA approval required for brokerage services business. Therefore, as of December 31, 2023, we have not yet obtained the corresponding\nclients.\nDistributed storage and computing services\nFrom 2021 to 2023, our distributed storage and computing business only includes cryptocurrency mining. Our clients in the Bitcoin mining business we conducted from\nOctober 2021 to April 2022 were F2Pool mining pool operators. We provided computing power to the mining pool and received Bitcoin rewards as compensation for our services.\nSince December 2022, our clients for Filecoin mining business have been the end users (storage demanders) on the Filecoin Mainnet. We have been providing storage services to\nthese end users and receiving Filecoin rewards as compensation for our services.\nMarketing\nWe engage various marketing channels to promote our business to more business partners and individual customers. We also provide various incentives to our customers to\nincrease their spending and loyalty, and we send e-mails to our customers periodically with product recommendations and/or promotions. To enhance our brand awareness, we\nalso have engaged in brand promotion activities.\nIn addition to the online marketing activities, we also utilize offline activities to attract more users and promote our brand recognition. For example, we attended offline\nmeetings to enhance our brand awareness and promote our presence in the industry.\nAs our business continues to evolve and expand into different areas, we have plans to steadily increase our marketing and promotional investment and efforts alongside the\nprojected growth relative to these investments.\nCompetition\nFor our business consultation services, there are many business, management and financial consulting companies in the United States that will become our competitors, and\ntheir team members may come from some well-known consulting firms, investment banks and broker dealers. For our distributed storage and computing services, the digital asset\nindustry is intensely competitive and is densely populated by global competitors, including Marathon (MARA), Riot (RIOT), Bit Digital (BTBT), BIT Mining (BTCM), The9\n(NCTY), among others.\nOur competitors may have entered the industry much earlier than us. They may be better capitalized, may have more industry connections, may have a stronger team, and may\nbe able to adapt more quickly to new technologies or may be able to devote greater resources to the development, marketing and sale of their products and services than we can.\nWe anticipate that the demand for global business consulting will continue to increase, and the digital asset market will continually evolve and will continue to experience\nrapid technological change, evolving industry standards, shifting customer requirements, and frequent innovation. We must continually innovate to remain competitive. We\nbelieve that the principal competitive factors in our industry are:\n● brand recognition and reputation;\n39\n● service quality;\n● pricing;\n● ecosystem integration;\n● customer service.\nWe believe that we are well-positioned to effectively compete on the basis of the factors listed above and that our Company benefits from many advantages over the\ncompetition. However, some of our current or future competitors have or may provide higher quality services or introduce new technology that are superior to ours.\nSeasonality\nWe have not experienced seasoned fluctuations in our current principal business. Due to our limited operating history in our current core business, the seasonal trends that\nwe experienced are not necessarily indicative of the seasonal trends that we may experience in the future.\nIntellectual Property\nWe regard trademarks, copyrights, domain names, know-how, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and from time to time we rely\non copyright and trademark law and confidentiality, invention assignment and non-compete agreements with our employees and others to protect our proprietary rights. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, we have registered a generic top-level domain name. Our registered domain name is www.mercurityfintech.com.\nRegulations\nThis section sets forth a summary of the most significant rules and regulations that affect our business activities in the PRC. Although our sources of revenue have been\noutside the Chinese mainland since 2021, we still have office and staff teams in China to seek more Chinese customers for our business consulting services, and we do not rule out\nthe possibility of continuing to develop new business in China in the future.\nRegulations Relating to Foreign Investment\nIndustry Catalogue Relating to Foreign Investment. Investment activities in the PRC by foreign investors are principally governed by the Guidance Catalogue of Industries\nfor Foreign Investment, or the Catalogue, which was promulgated and is amended from time to time by the Ministry of Commerce and the National Development and Reform\nCommission. Industries listed in the Catalogue are divided into three categories: encouraged, restricted and prohibited. Industries not listed in the Catalogue are generally deemed\nas constituting a fourth \"permitted” category. The current Special Administrative Measures (Negative List) for Admission of Foreign Investment (Year 2021) was promulgated in\nDecember 2021 and Industry Guidelines on Encouraged Foreign Investment (Year 2022) was promulgated in December 2022. Establishment of wholly foreign-owned enterprises is\ngenerally allowed in encouraged and permitted industries. Some restricted industries are limited to equity or contractual joint ventures, while in some cases Chinese partners are\nrequired to hold the majority interests in such joint ventures. In addition, restricted category projects are subject to higher-level government approvals. Foreign investors are not\nallowed to invest in industries in the prohibited category. Industries not listed in the Catalogue are generally open to foreign investment unless specifically restricted by other PRC\nregulations.\nThrough our WFOE and the previous VIEs, we were engaged in certain industries that are classified as \"restricted” under the Catalogue. We engage in the development of\ncomputer network technology, technical consultancy and technical services, which belong to the permitted category. Under PRC law, the establishment of a wholly foreign owned\nenterprise is subject to the approval of, or the requirement for record filing with, the Ministry of Commerce or its local counterparts and the wholly foreign owned enterprise must\nregister with the competent industry and commerce bureau. We have duly obtained the approvals from the Ministry of Commerce or its local counterparts for our interest in our\nwholly owned PRC subsidiaries and completed the registration of these PRC subsidiaries with the competent industry and commerce bureau.\n40\nThe Ministry of Commerce issued the Interim Measures for Record-filing Administration of the Establishment and Change of Foreign-invested Enterprises, as amended in June\n2018, which was replaced by Measures on Reporting of Foreign Investment Information promulgated in December 2019. According to Measures on Reporting of Foreign\nInvestment Information, foreign investors carrying out investment activities in the PRC directly shall submit investment information to the Ministry of Commerce or its local\ncounterparts. Pursuant to the Announcement [2016] No. 22 of the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Commerce dated October 8, 2016, the special\nentry administration measures for foreign investment apply to restricted and prohibited categories specified in the Catalogue, and the encouraged categories are subject to certain\nrequirements relating to equity ownership and senior management under the special entry administration measures.\nOn January 1, 2020, Foreign Investment Law of the People’s Republic of China became effective. For foreign-invested enterprises established after the Foreign Investment\nLaw, the organization form, institution and activity requirement shall be governed by the PRC Company Law and PRC Partnership Law. The established foreign-invested\nenterprises have a five-year transition period. During the transition period, the enterprises could retain the original organization form. Specific implementation measures will be\nfurther formulated by the State Council.\nOn August 5, 2020, the opinions of the general office of the State Council on further stabilizing foreign trade and foreign investment came into effect. The rules put forward\nrequirements on expanding the online channels of foreign trade and improving the convenience of foreign business personnel to come to the PRC, which is of great benefit to the\nfield of foreign investment.\nForeign Investment in Value-Added Telecommunications Businesses. The Regulations for Administration of Foreign-invested Telecommunications Enterprises promulgated\nby the PRC State Council in December 2001 and subsequently amended in September 2008, February 2016 and March 2022 set forth detailed requirements with respect to\ncapitalization, investor qualifications and application procedures in connection with the establishment of a foreign-invested telecommunications enterprise. These regulations\nprohibit a foreign entity from owning more than 50% of the total equity interest in any value-added telecommunications service business in the PRC and require the major foreign\ninvestor in any value-added telecommunications service business in the PRC have a good and profitable record and operating experience in this industry.\nRegulations Relating to Blockchain Technology\nSince May 2019, we started to engage in blockchain-enabled digital asset infrastructure solutions business. The PRC has promulgated laws and restrictions against illegal\nactivities conducted through blockchain technologies.\nIn January 2019, the Cyberspace Administration of China promulgated the Administrative Regulation on Blockchain Information Services, which regulates the information\nservices provided to the public through internet sites, applications, etc. based on blockchain technology or systems. It states that blockchain information services suppliers shall\nimplement the responsibility for information content security management, establish and improve management systems such as user registration, information review, emergency\nresponse, and security protection, they shall also have the technical conditions suitable for their services, establish and disclose management rules and platform conventions, sign\nservice agreements with blockchain information services users, etc. This is the first time China conducted compliance supervision on the blockchain.\nThe PRC Cryptography Law, which entered into force on January 1, 2020, is the latest normative legal document that regulates the blockchain industry. The term\n\"cryptography” refers to products, technologies and services that use specific transformations to carry out encryption protection or security authentication for information, etc.\nThe use of blockchain technology to encrypt and protect the information it collects is a \"cryptography” under PRC law and shall be regulated by the PRC Cryptography Law.\nUnder PRC criminal law, the illegal use of blockchain technology may involves four types of crimes: crime of refusing to perform network security management obligations,\ncrime of helping information network criminal activities, crime of violating citizens’ information and crime of endangering public safety. Among them, the crime of refusing to\nperform network security management obligations may cause the mass dissemination of illegal information, the leakage of user information and leads to a serious consequence, the\nloss of evidence in criminal cases in a serious circumstance and other serious circumstance. Refusing to make corrections after being ordered by the regulatory authority to make\ncorrective measures is subject to imprisonment of up to three years, detention or control and a fine.\n41\nIn September 2021, ten PRC governmental authorities, including the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), jointly issued the \"Notice on Further Preventing and Resolving the Risks\nof Virtual Currency Trading and Speculation” to clarify that cryptocurrency is not a legal tender in the PRC. Additionally, in September 2021, eleven governmental authorities,\nincluding the National Development and Reform Commission and the People’s Bank of China jointly issued the \"Notice of Rectifying Virtual Currency Mining Activities” to strictly\nprohibit the virtual currency mining activities in the PRC. As of the date of this annual report, all cryptocurrency transactions in the PRC are considered illegal, including offshore\nexchanges to provide services to Chinese citizens. In response to such rapid and adverse regulatory changes in the PRC, we had to remodel our business plans and shift the\nbusiness focus outside of the PRC.\nRegulations Relating to E-Commerce\nPrior to July 22, 2019, our principal business was food-industry B2B services and we were subject to regulations relating to e-commerce. As a result of the divestiture of the\nprevious food business, we are no longer subject to E-commerce related rules and regulations.\nRegulations Relating to Internet Content and Information Security\nThe Administrative Measures on Internet Information Services specify that internet information services regarding news, publications, education, medical and health care,\npharmacy and medical appliances, among other things, are to be examined, approved and regulated by the relevant authorities. Internet information providers are prohibited from\nproviding services beyond those included in the scope of their ICP licenses or filings. Furthermore, these measures clearly specify a list of prohibited content. Internet information\nproviders are prohibited from producing, copying, publishing or distributing information that is humiliating or defamatory to others or that infringes the lawful rights and interests\nof others. Internet information providers that violate the prohibition may face criminal charges or administrative sanctions by the PRC authorities. Internet information providers\nmust monitor and control the information posted on their websites. If any prohibited content is found, they must remove the offending content immediately, keep a record of it and\nreport to the relevant authorities.\nInternet information in the PRC is also regulated and restricted from a national security standpoint. The National People’s Congress, the PRC’s national legislative body, has\nenacted the Decisions on Maintaining Internet Security, which may subject violators to criminal punishment in the PRC for any effort to: (i) gain improper entry into a computer or\nsystem of strategic importance; (ii) disseminate politically disruptive information; (iii) leak state secrets; (iv) spread false commercial information; or (v) infringe intellectual property\nrights. The Ministry of Public Security has promulgated measures that prohibit use of the internet in ways which, among other things, result in a leakage of state secrets or a\nspread of socially destabilizing content.\nIn July 2019, the Cyberspace Administration of the PRC promulgated The Measures for Credit Information Management of Internet Untrustworthy Subjects (draft) to credit\nconstruction in the field of internet information services and strengthen credit information management of internet information service untrustworthy subjects. The draft lists four\nspecific cases of serious untrustworthy activities and stipulates the subject of the above-mentioned acts shall be included in the blacklist of serious untrustworthy of internet\ninformation service. The validity period is three years, during which the subject will be restricted to engage in internet information service. Relatively minor behaviors which\ncommitted several times but have not reached the blacklist determination criteria will be included in the focus list.\nIn January 2021, the state Internet Information Office issued the administrative measures for Internet information services (Revised Draft for comments). The PRC has set up a\nblacklist system for Internet information services. Organizations and individuals whose licenses or records have been revoked by the competent authorities shall not re apply for\nrelevant licenses or records within three years; organizations and individuals whose accounts have been cancelled or websites have been shut down by the competent authorities\nshall not re provide similar services for them within three years.\nOn July 10, 2021, the PRC State Internet Information Office issued the Measures of Cybersecurity Review, which requires cyberspace companies with personal information of\nmore than one (1) million users that want to list their securities on a non-Chinese stock exchange to file a cybersecurity review with the Office of Cybersecurity Review of China. On\nDecember 28, 2021, a total of thirteen governmental departments of the PRC, including the PRC State Internet Information Office issued the Measures of Cybersecurity Review,\nwhich will become effective on February 15, 2022.\n42\nWe (1) are not required to obtain permissions from any PRC authorities to offer to sell or issue our ordinary shares to non-Chinese investors, (2) are not covered by the\npermission requirements from the China Securities Regulatory Commission (the \"CSRC”) and Cyberspace Administration of China (the \"CAC”) or any other entity that is required\nto approve of the operations of ours and our subsidiaries, and (3) have not received nor been denied such permissions by any PRC authorities. Nevertheless, the General Office of\nthe Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the General Office of the State Council jointly issued the \"Opinions on Severely Cracking Down on Illegal Securities\nActivities According to Law,” or the July 6, 2021 Opinions, which were made available to the public on July 6, 2021. The July 6, 2021 Opinions emphasized the need to strengthen\nthe administration over illegal securities activities, and the need to strengthen the supervision over overseas listings by Chinese companies. Given the current PRC regulatory\nenvironment, it is uncertain whether and when we or our subsidiaries will be required to obtain any permission from the PRC government to list on a U.S. stock exchanges in the\nfuture, and even when we obtain such permission, whether it will be denied or rescinded.\nRegulations Relating to Internet Privacy\nIn recent years, PRC government authorities have enacted laws and regulations on internet use to protect personal information from any unauthorized disclosure. The\nAdministrative Measures on Internet Information Services prohibit ICP service operators from insulting or slandering a third-party or infringing upon the lawful rights and interests\nof a third-party. Under the Several Provisions on Regulating the Market Order of Internet Information Services, issued by the MIIT in 2011, an ICP operator may not collect any\nuser personal information or provide any such information to third parties without the consent of a user. An ICP service operator must expressly inform the users of the method,\ncontent and purpose of the collection and processing of such user personal information and may only collect such information necessary for the provision of its services. An ICP\nservice operator is also required to properly keep the user personal information, and in case of any leak or likely leak of the user personal information, the ICP service operator must\ntake immediate remedial measures and, in severe circumstances, to make an immediate report to the telecommunications regulatory authority. In addition, pursuant to the Decision\non Strengthening the Protection of Online Information issued by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress in December 2012 and the Order for the Protection of\nTelecommunication and Internet User Personal Information issued by the MIIT in July 2013, any collection and use of user personal information must be subject to the consent of\nthe user, abide by the principles of legality, rationality and necessity and be within the specified purposes, methods and scopes. An ICP service operator must also keep such\ninformation strictly confidential, and is further prohibited from divulging, tampering or destroying of any such information, or selling or proving such information to other parties.\nAny violation of the above decision or order may subject the ICP service operator to warnings, fines, confiscation of illegal gains, revocation of licenses, cancellation of filings,\nclosedown of websites or even criminal liabilities. Furthermore, in June 2016, the State Internet Information Office issued the Administrative Provisions on Mobile Internet\nApplications Information Services, which became effective on August 1, 2016, to further strengthen the regulation of the mobile application information services. Pursuant to these\nprovisions, owners or operators of mobile internet applications that provide information services are required to be responsible for information security management, establish and\nimprove the protective mechanism for user information, observe the principles of legality, rightfulness and necessity, and expressly state the purpose, method and scope of, and\nobtain user consent to, the collection and use of users’ personal information. In addition, the new Cyber Security Law, which became effective on June 1, 2017, also requires\nnetwork operators to strictly keep confidential users’ personal information that they have collected and to establish and improve user information protective mechanism. We have\nrequired our users to consent to our collecting and using their personal information, and established information security systems to protect user’s privacy.\nOn May 24, 2019, the Cyberspace Administration of the PRC promulgated the Cybersecurity Review Measures (Exposure Draft), which, together with the Article 35 of the\nCybersecurity Law, focuses on the cyber security review. It has clear and detailed provisions on the review object, review scope and review process, and provides guidance for\nlaw enforcement agencies.\nOn May 28, 2019, the Cyberspace Administration of the PRC promulgated the Administrative Measures on Data Security, which further stipulates the network security\nprotection obligations that network operators should perform under the PRC Cybersecurity Law, clarifies the standards for the collection, processing, using and security\nsupervision of personal information and important data, and states that network operators shall make a filing with the local cyberspace administration when they collect important\ndata or sensitive personal information for the purposes of business operations, any network operator that collects and uses personal information through products such as\nwebsites and applications shall develop and disclose the rules for collection and use separately.\nIn October 2019, the Information Security Technology - Personal Information Security Specification (Exposure Draft) was published to seek comments from the general public.\nAlthough the draft is a national recommended standard but not legally enforceable, from a practical point of view, existing internet companies were inquired by the Cyberspace\nAdministration of the PRC for not conforming to the draft’s spirit and ordered to make rectification. In January 2020, National Information Security Standardization Technical\nCommittee promulgated Information Security Technology - Basic Specification for the Collection of Personal Information by Mobile Internet Application (App) (Exposure Draft).\nThis draft clarifies the basic requirements that mobile Internet applications should meet to collect personal information, which means that APP developers and operators who\ncollect user’s personal information shall strictly comply with the requirement.\n43\nIn December 2019, the Cyberspace Administration of China promulgated Provisions on the Ecological Governance of Network Information Contents, which took effect on\nMarch 1, 2020. Its goal is to meet the requirement of a network comprehensive management system and promote and create a good network ecology and network space. It specifies\nthe obligations of network information content producers, network information content service platforms and network information content service users regarding related\necological governance.\nRegulations Relating to Intellectual Property Rights\nThe PRC has adopted comprehensive legislation governing intellectual property rights, including copyrights, patents, trademarks and domain names.\nCopyright. Pursuant to the Copyright Law and its implementation rules, creators of protected works enjoy personal and property rights, including, among others, the right of\ndisseminating the works through information networks. Pursuant to the relevant PRC regulations, rules and interpretations, internet service providers will be jointly liable with the\ninfringer if they (a) participate in, assist in or abet infringing activities committed by any other person through the internet, (b) are or should be aware of the infringing activities\ncommitted by their website users through the internet, or (c) fail to remove infringing content or take other action to eliminate infringing consequences after receiving a warning\nwith evidence of such infringing activities from the copyright holder. To comply with these laws and regulations, we have implemented internal procedures to monitor and review\nthe content we have licensed from content providers before releasing on our website and remove any infringing content promptly after we receive notice of infringement from the\nlegitimate rights holder.\nTrademark. The Trademark Law and its implementation rules protect registered trademarks. The PRC Trademark Office of State Administration of Industry and Commerce is\nresponsible for the registration and administration of trademarks throughout the PRC. The Trademark Law has adopted a \"first-to-file” principle with respect to trademark\nregistration. As of December 31, 2023, we had no trademark applications in China.\nDomain Name. Domain names are protected under the Administrative Measures on the Internet Domain Names promulgated by the MIIT on November 1, 2017. The MIIT is\nthe major regulatory body responsible for the administration of the PRC internet domain names, under supervision of which the CNNIC is responsible for the daily administration of\n.cn domain names and Chinese domain names. CNNIC adopts the \"first to file” principle with respect to the registration of domain names. We have registered www.mercurity.com.\nOn November 27, 2017, the MITT issued the Notice of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology on Regulating the Use of Domain Names in Providing Internet-\nbased Information Services. Pursuant to this notice, internet access service providers shall, via the Record-filing System, regularly check the use of domain names by Internet-\nbased information service providers, and shall, in the case that a domain name does not exist or is expired or has no real identity information, cease the provision of access services\nfor the Internet-based information service provider concerned.\nRegulations Relating to Employment\nThe Labor Contract Law and its implementation rules provide requirements concerning employment contracts between an employer and its employees. If an employer fails to\nenter into a written employment contract with an employee within one year from the date on which the employment relationship is established, the employer must rectify the\nsituation by entering into a written employment contract with the employee and pay the employee twice the employee’s salary for the period from the day following the lapse of\none month from the date of establishment of the employment relationship to the day prior to the execution of the written employment contract. The Labor Contract Law and its\nimplementation rules also require compensation to be paid upon certain terminations, which significantly affects the cost of reducing workforce for employers. In addition, if an\nemployer intends to enforce a non-compete provision with an employee in an employment contract or non-competition agreement, it has to compensate the employee on a monthly\nbasis during the term of the restriction period after the termination or ending of the labor contract. Employers in most cases are also required to provide a severance payment to\ntheir employees after their employment relationships are terminated.\nEnterprises in the PRC are required by PRC laws and regulations to participate in certain employee benefit plans, including social insurance funds, namely a pension plan, a\nmedical insurance plan, an unemployment insurance plan, a work-related injury insurance plan and a maternity insurance plan, and a housing provident fund, and contribute to the\nplans or funds in amounts equal to certain percentages of salaries, including bonuses and allowances, of the employees as specified by the local government from time to time at\nlocations where they operate their businesses or where they are located. According to the Social Insurance Law, an employer that fails to make social insurance contributions may\nbe ordered to pay the required contributions within a stipulated deadline and be subject to a late fee. If the employer still fails to rectify the failure to make social insurance\ncontributions within the stipulated deadline, it may be subject to a fine ranging from one to three times the amount overdue. According to the Regulations on Management of\nHousing Fund, an enterprise that fails to make housing fund contributions may be ordered to rectify the noncompliance and pay the required contributions within a stipulated\ndeadline; otherwise, an application may be made to a local court for compulsory enforcement. We have not made adequate contributions to employee benefit plans, as required by\napplicable PRC laws and regulations.\n44\nRegulations Relating to Dividend Withholding Tax\nPursuant to the Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation rules, if a non-resident enterprise has not set up an organization or establishment in the PRC, or has set up\nan organization or establishment but the income derived has no actual connection with such organization or establishment, it will be subject to a withholding tax on its PRC-\nsourced income at a rate of 10%. Pursuant to the Arrangement between Mainland China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for the Avoidance of Double Taxation\nand Tax Evasion on Income, the withholding tax rate in respect to the payment of dividends by a PRC enterprise to a Hong Kong enterprise is reduced to 5% from a standard rate\nof 10% if the Hong Kong enterprise directly holds at least 25% of the PRC enterprise. Pursuant to the Notice of the State Administration of Taxation on the Issues concerning the\nApplication of the Dividend Clauses of Tax Agreements, or Circular 81, a Hong Kong resident enterprise must meet the following conditions, among others, in order to enjoy the\nreduced withholding tax: (i) it must directly own the required percentage of equity interests and voting rights in the PRC resident enterprise; and (ii) it must have directly owned\nsuch percentage in the PRC resident enterprise throughout the 12 months prior to receiving the dividends. Furthermore, the Administrative Measures for Non-Resident Enterprises\nto Enjoy Treatments under Tax Treaties (For Trial Implementation), which became effective in October 2009, require that non-resident enterprises must obtain approval from the\nrelevant tax authority in order to enjoy the reduced withholding tax rate. There are also other conditions for enjoying the reduced withholding tax rate according to other relevant\ntax rules and regulations. In November 2015, the Administrative Measures for Non-Resident Enterprises to Enjoy Treatments under Tax Treaties became effective and repealed the\nTrial Implementation, which was later replaced by the Administrative Measures on Non-resident Taxpayers Enjoying Treaty Benefits promulgated by State Taxation Administration\nin October 2019. Pursuant to the new Measures, non-resident taxpayers claiming treaty benefits shall be handled in accordance with the principles of \"self-assessment, claiming\nbenefits, retention of the relevant materials for future inspection.” Non-resident taxpayers who satisfy the criteria for entitlement to tax treaty benefits may, at the time of tax\ndeclaration or withholding declaration through a withholding agent, enjoy the tax treaty benefits, instead of being subject to approvals, simultaneously gather and retain the\nrelevant materials pursuant to the provisions of these measures for future inspection and be subject to follow-up administration by the tax authorities.\nPursuant to the Notice of the Ministry of Finance, the State Administration of Taxation, the National Development and Reform Commission, and the Ministry of Commerce on\nthe Applicable Scope of the Policy of Temporary Exemption of Withholding Taxes on the Direct Investment Made by Overseas Investors with Distributed Profits, or Circular 102,\nwhich became effective in January 2018, where an overseas investor uses profits distributed by a resident enterprise in the PRC for direct investment in an encouraged investment\nproject, deferred tax payment policy shall apply if the stipulated criteria is satisfied, and withholding of income tax shall be waived in the interim.\nRegulations Relating to Foreign Exchange\nThe principal regulations governing foreign currency exchange in the PRC are the Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations, most recently amended in August 2008.\nUnder the PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, such as profit distributions and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, can be\nmade in foreign currencies without prior approval from SAFE by complying with certain procedural requirements. By contrast, approval from or registration with appropriate\ngovernment authorities is required where RMB is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of the PRC to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of foreign\ncurrency-denominated loans.\nIn August 2008, SAFE issued the Circular on the Relevant Operating Issues Concerning the Improvement of the Administration of the Payment and Settlement of Foreign\nCurrency Capital of Foreign-Invested Enterprises, or SAFE Circular No. 142, regulating the conversion by a foreign-invested enterprise of foreign currency-registered capital into\nRMB by restricting how the converted RMB may be used. SAFE Circular No. 142 provides that the RMB capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of a foreign-\ninvested enterprise may only be used for purposes within the business scope approved by the applicable government authority and may not be used for equity investments within\nthe PRC. SAFE also strengthened its oversight of the flow and use of the RMB capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of foreign-invested enterprises. The use\nof such RMB capital may not be changed without SAFE’s approval, and such RMB capital may not in any case be used to repay RMB loans if the proceeds of such loans have not\nbeen used. In March 2015, SAFE issued SAFE Circular No.19, which took effect and replaced SAFE Circular No. 142 from June 1, 2015. Although SAFE Circular No.19 allows for the\nuse of RMB converted from the foreign currency-denominated capital for equity investments in the PRC, the restrictions continue to apply as to foreign-invested enterprises’ use\nof the converted RMB for purposes beyond the business scope, for entrusted loans or for inter-company RMB loans. The sixth article of SAFE Circular No.19 relating to the\nadministration of the exchange settlement and use of the capital in the foreign exchange account under other direct investments has been abolished by SAFE Circular No.39 in\n2019.\n45\nIn November 2012, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Further Improving and Adjusting Foreign Exchange Administration Policies on Foreign Direct Investment, and amended\nit in May 2015, which substantially amends and simplifies the current foreign exchange procedure. Pursuant to this circular, the opening of various special purpose foreign\nexchange accounts (e.g. pre-establishment expenses account, foreign exchange capital account, guarantee account), the reinvestment of lawful incomes derived by foreign\ninvestors in the PRC (e.g. profit, proceeds of equity transfer, capital reduction, liquidation and early repatriation of investment), and purchase and remittance of foreign exchange as\na result of capital reduction, liquidation, early repatriation or share transfer in a foreign-invested enterprise no longer require SAFE approval, and multiple capital accounts for the\nsame entity may be opened in different provinces, which was not possible before. The Appendix 1 and 2 have been abolished by SAFE Circular No.39 in 2019. In addition, SAFE\npromulgated the Circular on Printing and Distributing the Provisions on Foreign Exchange Administration over Domestic Direct Investment by Foreign Investors and the\nSupporting Documents in May 2013, which specifies that the administration by SAFE or its local branches over direct investment by foreign investors in the PRC shall be\nconducted by way of registration and banks shall process foreign exchange business relating to the direct investment in the PRC based on the registration information provided by\nSAFE and its branches. The Appendix 3 and Article 11 in the Appendix 1 which stipulates that the foreign exchange bureaus shall implement annual inspection on foreign\ninvestment enterprises pursuant to the relevant provisions of the State have been abolished by SAFE Circular No.39 in 2019.\nIn February 2015, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Further Simplifying and Improving the Policies Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Direct Investment, or SAFE\nCircular No. 13, which took effect on June 1, 2015. SAFE Circular No. 13 delegates the authority to enforce the foreign exchange registration in connection with the inbound and\noutbound direct investment under relevant SAFE rules to certain banks and therefore further simplifies the foreign exchange registration procedures for inbound and outbound\ndirect investment. SAFE Circular No.13 has been partially abolished by SAFE Circular No.39 in 2019.\nThe Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act and the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act\nOur ordinary shares may be prohibited from trading on a national exchange or \"over-the-counter” markets under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (the\n\"HFCAA”) if the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (\"PCAOB”) determines that it is unable to inspect or fully investigate our auditor and as a result the exchange\nwhere our securities are traded may delist our securities. Furthermore, on June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (the\n\"AHFCAA”), which was signed into law on December 29, 2022, amending the HFCAA and requiring the SEC to prohibit an issuer’s securities from trading on any U.S. stock\nexchange if its auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspections for two consecutive years instead of three consecutive years. Pursuant to the HFCAA, the PCAOB issued a\nDetermination Report on December 16, 2021, which found that the PCAOB was unable to inspect or investigate completely certain named registered public accounting firms\nheadquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm is headquartered in Singapore and has been inspected by the PCAOB on a regular basis and as such, it is not affected by or\nsubject to the PCAOB’s 2021 Determination Report. On August 26, 2022, the SEC issued a statement announcing that the PCAOB signed a Statement of Protocol with the CSRC\nand the Ministry of Finance of the People’s Republic of China governing inspections and investigations of audit firms based in China and Hong Kong, jointly agreeing on the need\nfor a framework. On December 15, 2022, the PCAOB announced that it has secured complete access to inspect and investigate registered public accounting firms headquartered in\nmainland China and Hong Kong and voted to vacate the previous 2021 Determination Report to the contrary. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the future, if there is any\nregulatory change or step taken by regulators that does not permit our auditor to provide audit documentations to the PCAOB for inspection or investigation, shareholders may be\ndeprived of the benefits of such inspection which could result in limitation or restriction to our access to the U.S. capital markets and trading of our securities, including trading on\nthe national exchange and trading on \"over-the-counter” markets, may be prohibited under the HFCAA and AHFCAA and/or PCAOB may consider the need to issue new\ndeterminations consistent with the HFCAA and Rule 6100. See \"Risk Factors - Risks Relating to Doing Business in China.”\n46\nC.

Property, Plants and Equipment\nOn December 15, 2022, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement with Huangtong International Co., Ltd., providing for the acquisition and purchase of Web3\ndecentralized storage infrastructure (the \"Equipment”), including cryptocurrency mining servers, cables, and other electronic devices. Starting on December 20, 2022, we use some\nof the storage capacity of these devices for Filecoin mining business. We have rented the Filecoin mining operating premises located in New Jersey, United States from Cologix US,\nInc. for the storage of the Equipment.\nOur executive office is located at 1330 Avenue of Americas, Fl 33, New York, 10019, United States. Our headquarters occupy a total of 5,730 square feet. The lease of our\nheadquarter office has a term of three calendar year, from November 1, 2022 to September 29, 2025, with an annual rent cost of $358,044 for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nOur Shenzhen office (the \"Shenzhen Office”) is located at Room 1215, Xin’nan Block No.2, Yuehai Street, Nanshan District, Shenzhen City, 518000, Guangdong Province,\nPeople’s Republic of China. The Shenzhen Office has the office space of approximately 195 square meters (approximately 2,099 square feet), an 18-months lease, for an annual base\nrent of RMB360,000, approximately equal to $50,841 in 2023. The lease for the Shenzhen Office commenced in June 2022 and shall expire in the end of April 2024. We are seeking to\nlease a new office in Shenzhen for our China operations and have identified certain office space, with the execution of the lease agreement pending as of the date of this report.\n47\nOur Hong Kong office (the \"Hong Kong Office”) is located at Office Room 12, Smart-Space FinTech 1, Unit 617 - 620, Level 6, Core E, Cyberport 3, No. 100 Cyberport Road,\nHong Kong. The Hong Kong Office has a flexible monthly lease, subject to auto-renewal each month. The rent cost of the Hong Kong Office for the year ended December 31, 2023\nwas approximately $6,780.\nWe believe that we will be able to obtain adequate facilities, principally through leasing, to accommodate our future expansion plans. We believe that our current property\nrights are sufficient for our current operations.\nITEM 4A. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNot applicable.\nITEM 5. OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and\nthe related notes included elsewhere in this annual report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and the\ntiming of selected events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under \"Item 3.\nKey Information—D. Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this annual report on Form 20-F.\nExplanatory Note.\nWe have amended and restated our consolidated statement of cash flows for the financial year ended December 31, 2022, by reclassifying the net cash provided by disposal of\ndigital assets from operating activities to investment activities. Please refer to our consolidated statement of cash flows for the financial year ended December 31, 2022 at page F-12\nof this annual report, and Note 2 at page F-15 of this annual report.\nA. Operating Results\nOverview\nIn the first half of 2023, we decided not to continue conducting blockchain technology service business related to the asset trading platform, asset digitalization platform and\ndecentralized finance (DeFi) platform. As of December 31, 2023, our business line included two parts: providing distributed storage and computing services, and business\nconsultation services. At the same time, we are acquiring an investment advisory firm and FINRA licensed broker dealer, and after completing this acquisition, our business line\nwill add two new parts: financial advisory services and securities brokerage services.\nDistributed storage and computing services\nIn August 2021, we added cryptocurrency mining as one of our main businesses going forward. We entered into cryptocurrency mining pools by executing a business\ncontract with a collective mining service provider on October 22, 2021 to provide computing power to the mining pool and derived USD$664,307 related revenue in 2021 and\nUSD$783,089 related revenue in the first half of 2022. However, the management did not anticipate the Bitcoin market crash that would begin in December 2021, causing our Bitcoin\nmining business to suffer a great loss. From May 2022, we have not engaged in any Bitcoin mining business.\nOn December 15, 2022, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Huangtong International Co., Ltd., providing for the acquisition and purchase of Web3 decentralized\nstorage infrastructure (the \"equipment”), including cryptocurrency mining servers, cables, and other electronic devices, for an aggregate consideration of USD$5,980,000, payable\nin our ordinary shares. We started using some of the storage capacity of the equipment for Filecoin mining business from December 20, 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2022\nand 2023, we earned $348 and $ $285,928 respectively in Filecoin mining revenue from physical mining operations. However, due to our lack of sufficient Filecoins to meet the\ncollateral requirements for conducting Filecoin mining business, we have not fully utilized our equipment, while the depreciation of the equipment was based on the expected\nuseful life using the straight-line method, which resulted in depreciation costs far exceeding Filecoin mining revenue in 2023, causing our Filecoin mining business to suffer a great\nloss.\n48\nOn December 5, 2023, the Company signed an Origin Storage Filecoin Mining Service Contract with Origin Storage PTE. LTD. (\"Origin Storage”). The Company will use Origin\nStorage’s technology to re package the Web3 decentralized storage infrastructure and conduct Filecoin mining business through Origin Storage’s network platform. The Filecoin\nmining services provided by Origin Storage include but are not limited to storage server services, computing encapsulation server services, and technical services. As of April 15,\n2024, by adopting the new technology provided by Origin Storage, we have opened two new nodes (replacing the two old nodes we opened in 2023) with an effective storage\ncapacity of 70 PiB, taking up only 7 PiB original storage capacity (the \"Raw Byte Power”)of our Web3 decentralized storage infrastructure, which means that using the new\ntechnology provided by Origin Storage to occupy the same original storage capacity can achieve 10 times the effective storage capacity, and the Company is expected to achieve\ngreater productivity of the cryptocurrency mining business in the future.\nBusiness consultation services\nIn July 2022, we added consultation services to our business, providing business consulting services to global corporate clients, especially those in the blockchain industry.\nMeanwhile, we conducted viability studies about the business models, license requirements and operational costs of online and traditional brokerage services and digital payment\nbusiness and have been expanding our business into those two sectors, such as building up client base and acquiring the necessary licenses. However, due to resource restraints,\nwe have ceased our development plans in digital payment business, including digital payment services and solution consulting, and applications for the required money transmit\nlicenses since March 2024.\nOn August 23, 2022, we signed a Consulting Agreement with a Chinese media company, pursuant to which MFH Tech will serve as a business consultant in order to facilitate\nthe client to establish the entity in the United States and make financing strategy, and the agreed amount of the immutable consideration portion of the agreement is $160,000. We\nrecognized consultation services revenue of $80,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022 based on the percentage-of-completion. As of June 30, 2023, all the agreed services\nunder the consulting agreement with the Chinese media signed on August 23, 2022 had been completed, and the Company recognized consultation services revenue of $80,000 for\nthe first half of 2023 based on the percentage-of-completion.\nOn August 1, 2023, we signed a supplementary comprehensive service agreement with the Chinese media company. The Company will continue to assist the client in\nproviding management consulting services and introducing professional service agency resources. The Company expects to receive no less than $150,000 in revenue from this new\nagreement within the next year.\nOn November 1, 2023, the Company signed a financial consulting agreement with an American logistics company. The Company will serve as a business consultant in order to\nfacilitate introductions between the Company’s clients and esteemed third-party audit firms, legal representatives, and underwriting entities that are crucial for the clients’\nfundraising endeavors within the U.S. capital market. The Company expects to receive $50,000 in revenue from this agreement within the next year.\nFinancial advisory services and securities brokerage services\nOn April 12, 2023, we completed the incorporation of another U.S. subsidiary, Chaince Securities, Inc. (\"Chaince Securities”), which plans to develop financial advisory\nservices, online and traditional brokerage services independently in the future. On May 3, 2023, Chaince Securities entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement for the acquisition\nof all assets and liabilities of J.V. Delaney & Associates, an investment advisory firm and FINRA licensed broker dealer. The FINRA review procedure for such acquisition is\ncurrently still ongoing. As of December 31, 2023, we have not received any income from financial advisory and securities brokerage services as we have not yet obtained relevant\nfinancial license.\n49\nKey Components of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nThe table below sets forth our Revenue in aggregate and by service type therein for the three years:\nFor the year Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nUS$ US$ US$\nRevenue:\nBusiness consultation services 160,000 80,000 —\nDistributed storage and computing services 285,928 783,438 664,307\nTechnical services — — 5,864\nTotal Revenue $ 445,928 $ 863,438 $ 670,171\nBusiness consultation services\nIn July 2022, the new management of the Company fully considered the huge uncertainty caused by the volatility of the cryptocurrency market, and decided to add\nconsultation services as one of our main businesses, providing business consulting services to global corporate clients, especially those in the blockchain industry. Meanwhile,\nwe conducted viability studies about the business models, license requirements and operational costs of online and traditional brokerage services and have been setting up the\nfoundation for such brokerage services, such as building up client base and acquiring the necessary licenses.\nOn August 23, 2022, the Company signed a Consulting Agreement with a Chinese media company, pursuant to which the Company will serve as a business consultant in\norder to facilitate the client to establish its operating entity in the United States and related financing strategy, and the agreed amount of the immutable consideration portion of the\nagreement is $160,000. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 50% of the agreed services had been completed as scheduled, and the Company recognized consultation services\nrevenue of $80,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022 based on the percentage-of-completion. As of December 31, 2023, all the agreed services under this agreement have been\ncompleted, and the Company recognized consultation services revenue of $80,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023 based on the percentage-of-completion.\nOn August 1, 2023, the Company signed a supplementary comprehensive service agreement with the Chinese media company. The Company will continue to assist the client\nin providing management consulting services and introducing professional service agency resources. The Company expects to receive no less than $150,000 in revenue from this\nnew agreement within the next year. As of December 31, 2023, approximately 40% of the agreed services had been completed as scheduled, and the Company recognized\nconsultation services revenue of $60,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023 based on the percentage-of-completion.\nOn November 1, 2023, the Company signed a financial consulting agreement with an American logistics company. The Company will serve as a business consultant in order to\nfacilitate introductions between the Company’s clients and esteemed third-party audit firms, legal representatives, and underwriting entities that are crucial for the clients’\nfundraising endeavors within the U.S. capital market. The Company expects to receive $50,000 in revenue from this agreement within the next year. As of December 31, 2023,\napproximately 40% of the agreed services had been completed as scheduled, and the Company recognized consultation services revenue of $20,000 for the year ended December\n31, 2023 based on the percentage-of-completion.\nDistributed storage and computing services\nThe Company’s distributed storage and computing services business includes cryptocurrency mining and cloud storage services for other decentralized platform operators.\nFrom October 2021 to April 2022, the Company obtained the usage rights of a certain number and specific models of Bitcoin mining machines and specific business premises\nby executing contracts with the sharing mining service provider, and registered as users on the mining pool website, complying with the general terms and conditions required to\njoin the mining pool published on the mining pool website, to increase computing power to the mining pool. In exchange for providing computing power, the Company was entitled\nto a fractional share of the fixed digital asset awards the mining pool operator receives, for successfully adding blocks to the blockchain. The Company’s fractional share was\nrelative to the proportion of computing power the Company contributed to the mining pool operator toward the total computing power contributed by all mining pool participants\nin solving the current algorithm. Providing computing power in digital asset transaction verification services was an output of the Company’s ordinary activities. The provision of\nsuch computing power was the only performance obligation in the general terms of the mining pool website. The transaction consideration the Company received, if any, was\nnoncash consideration, which the Company measured at fair value on the date received, which was not materially different than the fair value at contract inception or the time the\nCompany had earned the award from the pools. These considerations were all variable. Since significant reversals of cumulative revenue were possible given the nature of the\nassets, the consideration was constrained until the mining pool operator successfully places a block (by being the first to solve an algorithm) and the Company received\nconfirmation of the consideration it would receive, at which time revenue was recognized. There was no significant financing component related to these transactions. Fair value of\nthe digital assets award received was determined using the quoted price of the related digital assets at the time of receipt. The Company earned $783,090 in Bitcoin mining revenue\nfrom shared mining operations for the year ended December 31, 2022, and $664,307 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Due to the sharp fluctuations in the price of Bitcoin over\nthe past two years, from May 2022 to the end of 2023, the Company did not carry out any business related to Bitcoin mining. Going forward, we currently have no plan to continue\nour Bitcoin mining operation.\n50\nOn December 15, 2022, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement with Huangtong International Co., Ltd., providing for the acquisition and purchase of Web3\ndecentralized storage infrastructure, including cryptocurrency mining servers, cables, and other electronic devices, for an aggregate consideration of USD$5.98 million, payable in\nthe Company’s ordinary shares. Starting on December 20, 2022, the Company uses some of the storage capacity of these devices for Filecoin mining business, and other storage\ncapacity will be used to provide cloud storage services to distributed application product operators. The Company has rented the Filecoin mining operating premises located in\nNew Jersey, United States from Cologix US, Inc. and the Company has entered into the Filecoin mainnet as a miner by registering as a user on the Filecoin mainnet, complying with\nthe general terms and conditions required to become a miner published on the Filecoin mainnet. The essence of Filecoin mining business is that the Company utilizes its Web3\ndecentralized storage infrastructure and provide cloud storage services to the end customers through the Filecoin mainnet. In exchange for providing storage capacity, the\nCompany is entitled to a fractional share of the fixed digital asset awards from the Filecoin mainnet, for successfully adding blocks to the blockchain. The Company’s fractional\nshare is relative to the proportion of storage capacity we contribute to Filecoin mainnet toward the total storage capacity contributed by all the Filecoin mainnet’s participants in\nsolving the current algorithm. Providing storage capacity in digital asset transaction verification services is an output of the Company’s ordinary activities. The provision of such\nstorage capacity is the only performance obligation in the general terms of the Filecoin mainnet. The transaction consideration the Company receives, if any, is noncash\nconsideration, which the Company measures at fair value on the date received, which is not materially different than the fair value at contract inception or the time the Company\nhas earned the award from the Filecoin mainnet. These considerations are all variable. Since significant reversals of cumulative revenue are possible given the nature of the assets,\nthe consideration is constrained until the all the miners successfully places a block (by being the first to solve an algorithm) and the Company receives confirmation of the\nconsideration it will receive, at which time revenue is recognized. There is no significant financing component related to these transactions. Fair value of the digital assets award\nreceived is determined using the quoted price of the related digital assets at the time of receipt. For the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2023, we earned $348 and $285,928\nrespectively in Filecoin mining revenue from physical mining operations, and did not receive any revenue from providing cloud storage services to decentralized platform\noperators.\nOn December 5, 2023, the Company signed an Origin Storage Filecoin Mining Service Contract with Origin Storage PTE. LTD. (\"Origin Storage”). The Company will use Origin\nStorage’s technology to repackage the Web3 decentralized storage infrastructure and conduct Filecoin mining business through Origin Storage’s network platform. The Filecoin\nmining services provided by Origin Storage include but are not limited to storage server services, computing encapsulation server services, and technical services. Through Origin\nStorage’s new technology in the Filecoin mining field, the Company is expected to improve the output efficiency of the Filecoin mining business.\nTechnical services\nFrom April to June 2023, our management reassessed the potential adverse effects of changes in the Company’s business environment, and readjusted the Company’s\nbusiness structure and the future development plan. Considering the enormous uncertainty brought by the cryptocurrency market turmoil in the past two years to the blockchain\nindustry, as well as the regulatory uncertainties, despite our ability to quickly reorganize the blockchain technical service team, we have decided not to continue conducting\nblockchain technology service business related to the asset trading platform, asset digitalization platform and decentralized finance (DeFi) platform.\nDue to the dismantling of the VIEs and the cessation of all business related to the digital asset transaction platforms, as well as the temporary difficulties brought to us by the\nincident that our cryptocurrencies were out of control, the original Chinese technical team left in the first half of 2022 and we failed to rebuild the technical service team in the\nsecond half of 2022. As a result, our blockchain technical services business did not generate any revenue in 2022 and 2023.\nDue to the change of the management and technical team in 2021, the original business contract discontinued, resulting in the blockchain technical services revenue of only\n$128,207 for the year ended December 31, 2021, of which $122,343 revenue generated by the VIE entities subject to divestment is shown as Loss/income from discontinued\noperations in the consolidated income statement, and $5,864 is shown as Revenue in the consolidated income statement.\n51\nCost of Revenue\nThe table below sets forth our cost of Revenue in aggregate and by service type therein for the three years:\nFor the year Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nUS$ US$ US$\nCost of Revenue:\nBusiness consultation services (138,092) (19,000) —\nDistributed storage and computing services (1,286,220) (1,361,600) (702,679)\nTechnical services — — —\nTotal cost of Revenue $ (1,424,312) $ (1,380,600) $ (702,679)\nBusiness consultation services\nIn 2023, the Company only implemented two business consultation projects. The direct costs of the Company’s business consultation services included office space\nexpenses, team salaries, travel expenses, printing fees, and the fees required to acquire clients. The cost of consultation services was recognized in the amount of $19,000 and\n$138,092 respectively for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2023.\nDistributed storage and computing services\na) Bitcoin mining\nThe cost of the Bitcoin shared mining operation includes the rental fee of the mining machine and the mine site, electricity and other possible operation and maintenance\nexpenses. There were no Bitcoin mining operations in the year ended December 31, 2023. The cost of Bitcoin shared mining operations was recognized in the year ended December\n31, 2022 in the amount of $1,291,784, including $1,036,741 for mining machines and mine leases and $255,043 for electricity. The cost of Bitcoin shared mining operations was\nrecognized in the year ended December 31, 2021 in the amount of $702,679, including $563,955 for mining machines and mine leases and $138,724 for electricity.\nThe Company carried out Bitcoin mining from October 2021 to April 2022. The Company’s computing power during this period was 35,000TH/s, the average daily output\nduring this period was 0.17011136 BTC, and the revenue per unit of computing power was 0.000004860 BTC/TH/day. For this Bitcoin mining business, the Company essentially\nleased the Bitcoin mining machines instead of owning them, while the cost of renting the mining machines proved to be very high. The average daily operating cost (including the\ncost of renting the mining machines) of the Company’s Bitcoin mining was $110,80.51, so the Company would not make a profit until the average price of Bitcoin exceeds $65,137.\nHowever, back in October 2021, the management did not anticipate the Bitcoin market crash that would begin in December 2021. In December 2021, the price of Bitcoin suddenly\nplummeted from the price range of $60,000 per coin and during 2022 and 2023 such price lingered around the range of $15,000 to $49,000, causing our Bitcoin mining business to\nsuffer a great loss. Due to the sharp fluctuations in the price of Bitcoin over the past two years, from May 2022 to the end of 2023, we did not carry out any business related to\nBitcoin mining. Going forward, we currently have no plans to resume Bitcoin mining business.\nb) Filecoin mining\nThe cost of the Filecoin physical mining operation includes mining machine depreciation costs, mine site lease costs (including electricity), direct labor costs and software\nlicensing costs. The cost of Filecoin physical mining operations was recognized in the year ended December 31, 2023 in the amount of $1,286,220, including mining machine\ndepreciation costs of $897,435, mine lease costs (including electricity) of $291,347, direct labor costs of $4,000, and software licensing costs of $93,438. The cost of Filecoin physical\nmining operations was recognized in the year ended December 31, 2022 in the amount of $69,816, including mining machine depreciation costs of $$28,950, mine lease costs\n(including electricity) of $22,075, direct labor costs of $4,000, and software licensing costs of $14,791.\n52\nThe Company carried out Filecoin mining business from December 2022. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has opened two nodes on the Filecoin blockchain with the\ntotal effective storage capacity of 19.04PiB. The operating costs of Filecoin mining business currently include depreciation costs of equipment, site fees, electricity fees, network\nfees and software deployment costs. Due to the fact that the number of nodes in the Company’s Filecoin mining business and the storage capacity of each node have not yet\nreached the set maximum level, the Company still receives relatively few Filecoin rewards, and the corresponding revenue recognized by the Company is also relatively low.\nHowever, the Web3 decentralized storage infrastructure used by the Company for Filecoin mining are depreciated based on the expected useful life using the straight-line method,\nwhich resulted in depreciation costs far exceeding Filecoin mining revenue in 2023.\nTechnical services\nWe did not generate any blockchain technical services revenue in 2022 and 2023, nor did we incur any technical services costs.\nOur cost of blockchain technical services revenue consist of the payroll of technical personnel. Our cost of blockchain technical services Revenue was $nil in the consolidated\nincome statement for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nOperating Expenses\nThe table below sets forth our operating expenses from continuing operations for the three years:\nFor the year Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nOperating expenses:\nSales and marketing (449,900) (35,000) —\nGeneral and administrative (2,515,291) (2,156,063) (10,351,357)\nProvision for doubtful accounts — (3,138) (1,750,909)\n(Loss)/income on disposal of intangible assets — (29,968) 121,020\nImpairment loss of property and equipment (307,733) — —\nImpairment loss of intangible assets (4,248,085) (3,144,053) (1,292,568)\nTotal operating expenses $ (7,521,009) $ (5,368,222) $ (13,273,814)\nOur operating expenses consist of sales and marketing expenses, general and administrative expenses, provision for doubtful accounts, (loss)/income on disposal of intangible\nassets and impairment loss of intangible assets. Our total operating expenses were $7,521,009, $5,368,222 and $13,273,814 for the year ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nSales and marketing expenses\nOn January 13, 2023, the Company’s US subsidiary MFH Tech signed a Consulting Agreement with Dato Ai Technology Corporation (\"Dato”), pursuant to which Dato will\nprovide sales and marketing services as an independent contractor in order to search for and identify potential clients of the Company’s business consultation services. In 2023,\nMFH Tech paid Dato $250,000 as the consulting fees.\nOn June 12, 2023, the Company’s US subsidiary MFH Tech signed a Referral Agreement with Global Innovation Wisdom Consultant, Inc (the \"Global Innovation Wisdom”),\npursuant to which Global Innovation Wisdom will use its best efforts to introduce a bank to MFH Tech, and MFH Tech intended to carry out digital banking services by acquiring\nthis bank. MFH Tech paid Global Innovation Wisdom $100,000 as consulting fees in 2023, although MFH Tech did not ultimately complete the acquisition of the bank.\nOn August 23, 2022, our US subsidiary MFH Tech signed a Consulting Agreement with a Chinese media company, pursuant to which MFH Tech will serve as an independent\ncontractor in order to facilitate the Client to conduct its initial public offering. We paid $35,000 to the client’s referral agent and we recognized it as sales and marketing expenses in\nthe consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nOn August 1, 2023, the Company signed a supplementary comprehensive service agreement with the Chinese media company. The Company will continue to assist the client\nin providing management consulting services and introducing professional service agency resources. We totally paid $85,000 to the client’s referral agent in 2023 and we\nrecognized it as sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n53\nIn addition, other marketing fees of $2,400 were recognized for MFH Tech’s business promotion for 2023.\nThe definition of our main business has undergone some restructuring in recent years, and as it becomes more well-defined, and as current structural business investments\nmature and begin to yield revenue, we have plans to steadily increase our marketing and promotional investment and efforts.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nOur general and administrative expenses consist primarily of (i) salaries and benefits for employees, which are the salaries and benefits for our management, merchant service\nrepresentatives and general administrative staff, (ii) office expenses, which consist primarily of office rental, maintenance and utilities expenses, depreciation of office equipment\nand other office expenses, and (iii) professional expenses, which consist primarily of legal expense and audit fees.\nOur general and administrative expenses were $2,515,291 for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $2,156,063 and $10,351,357 in the same period of 2022 and 2021.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for 2023 consisted primarily of $549,042 in employment costs, $1,271,174 in professional fees, and $695,076 in other office expenses.\nWe restructured the board of directors in May 2022 and again in October 2022, and our management had undergone significant changes. The total salaries and benefits for\nemployees for 2022 are $1,374,839, with $816,444 paid in cash and $558,395 in stock. The total professional expenses for 2022 are $581,557, including $367,524 legal expenses. The\ntotal other office expenses are $199,667.\nIn 2021, due to the changes in our core management and business teams, many employees participating in our stock incentive plan were allowed to accelerate the vesting of\ntheir shares that have not yet reached the vesting period. Combined with the impact of the implementation of the additional stock incentive plan in 2021, our stock incentive\nexpenses recognized in 2021 were $8,349,862. In addition, as a result of these changes, our professional expenses such as lawyers and financial consultants were $1,156,125 in 2021.\nThe total general and administrative expenses of 2021 were $10,351,357.\nWhile our operating expenses currently remain relatively low, we expect, as our recent investments in future business lines capture increasing revenues, to apply major\nreinvestments into the operations of all of our promising current investments and core business including R&D, hiring expert staff, and efforts to support the further global\nexpansion of our business.\nProvision for doubtful accounts\nOur losses from provision for doubtful accounts for 2022 were all due to other receivables that could not be collected.\nDue to the changes of our management and business team in the second half of 2021, we failed to collect the blockchain technical services receivable $1,092,208 from BGA\nFOUNDATION LTD and $54,923 from Beijing Qichi Trading Ltd. in a timely manner. Our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 includes a full\nprovision for doubtful accounts from the above accounts receivable.\n(Loss)/income on disposal of intangible assets\nIn January 2022, we sold 1,000,000 USD Coins to finance our daily operations and generated a loss of $29,968.\nIn October 2021, we sold 10 Bitcoins to finance our daily operations and generated an income of $121,001. We sold other cryptocurrencies and generated an income of $19 in\n2021.\nImpairment loss of property and equipment\nDuring 2023, approximately 20 machines of the Web3 decentralized storage infrastructure experienced severe malfunctions that prevented them from continuing operations.\nThe Company scrapped the machines and recognized an impairment loss of $307,734 for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nImpairment loss of intangible assets\nDue to the price crash of Bitcoin in 2022, we, out of caution, decided to change the impairment test method of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies from testing once or twice a\nyear by calculating the fair value based on the average daily closing price of the past 12 months to testing every day by calculating the fair value based on the intraday low price.\nBecause the intraday low price of cryptocurrencies to be utilized in calculating impairment of our cryptocurrencies held as that metric is the most accurate indicator of whether it is\nmore likely than not that the asset is impaired.\n54\nWe estimated the fair values of the Filecoins based on the intraday low price of the Coinbase platform every day and recognized $303,276 impairment loss of Filecoins for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company has not made positive progress in recovering its crypto assets out of control. Although it is considered inappropriate from a legal\nperspective for the Sheyang County Public Security Bureau to implement seizure procedures on the Company’s crypto assets, the Company still cannot estimate the time it may\ntake to recover those crypto assets. Therefore, the Company has decided to make a provision for impairment of all the crypto assets out of control, with the amount of $3,944,809,\nto eliminate the potential significant uncertainty on the financial statements.\nWe estimated the fair values of the cryptocurrencies based on the intraday low price every day and recognized $3,144,053 impairment loss for the year ended December 31,\n2022, including $3,111,232 impairment loss of Bitcoins, $26,957 impairment loss of Filecoins and $5,864 impairment loss of Tether USDs. We wrote off the original value of the $5,864\ncryptocurrencies and the $5,864 impairment in 2022 due to the platform where the wallet of the $5,864 cryptocurrencies was stored had gone out of business, we had been no longer\nable to withdraw the cryptocurrencies as of December 31, 2022.\nAs of April 25, 2023, we had not been able to communicate effectively with the Sheyang County Public Security Bureau. The Sheyang County Public Security Bureau did not\nprovide a written response to the appeal materials submitted by the Company in accordance with regulations. We had not been informed of any information that may prevent the\nCompany from recovering these crypto assets out of control. Therefore, in our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022, we did not recognize any impairment\nlosses related to the loss of control over these crypto assets.\nWe estimated the fair values of the cryptocurrencies based on the intraday low price every day and recognized $1,292,568 impairment loss for the year ended December 31,\n2021, including $908,453 impairment loss of Bitcoins, $11,120 impairment loss of USD Coins and $372,995 impairment loss of FFcoins and other cryptocurrencies. We wrote off the\noriginal value of the $1,208,339 FFcoins and other cryptocurrencies and the $1,208,339 impairment in 2021 due to the FFcoin platform had gone out of business, these FFcoins and\nother cryptocurrencies no longer had any market value as of December 31, 2021.\nInterest (expenses)/income, net\nOur interest (expenses)/income, net consists primarily of: 1) the interest income from cash and short-term deposits with banks, providing loans to external parties; 2) the\ninterest expenses for our Convertible Promissory Note, and Filecoin borrowed as initial pledge for Filecoin mining business.\nThe table below sets forth our interest (expenses)/income, net for the year ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021:\nFor the year Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nInterest (expenses)/income, net:\nConvertible note interest expenses (i) (410,548) — —\nInterest income from cash and short-term deposits 214,482 5,118 1,083\nInterest expenses for Filecoin borrowed as initial pledge (12,583) — —\nInterest income from providing loans to external parties 12,594 — —\nInterest (expenses)/income, net $ (196,055) $ 5,118 $ 1,083\n(i) Convertible note interest expenses\nThe Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (\"SPA”) with a non-U.S. investor (the \"Purchaser”). Pursuant to the SPA dated January 31, 2023, the Company\nissued the Purchaser an Unsecured Convertible Promissory Note (the \"Note”) with a face value of $9 million (the \"Proceeds”) upon receiving the Proceeds from the Purchaser on\nFebruary 2, 2023. The Note shall bear non-compounding interest at a rate per annum equal to 5% from the date of issuance until repayment of the Note unless the Purchaser elects\nto convert the Note into ordinary shares. If the Purchaser does not elect to convert the Note, then the outstanding principal amount and all accrued but unpaid interest on the Note\nshall be due and payable upon the one-year anniversary of the Issuance Date of the Note (the \"Maturity Date”). For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized\n$410,548 interest expenses for the Note.\n55\nThe Purchaser has the right to convert the outstanding balance (excluding any and all accrued but unpaid interest on the Note as of the date of such notice) under the Note\ninto the Company’s ordinary shares (the \"Conversion Shares”) at a per share price equal to $0.00172, (70% of the average closing price of the American Depositary Receipts\ndivided by 360 during the 30-consecutive trading day period immediately preceding the date of the Securities Purchase Agreement, equivalent to $0.688 per ordinary share after the\nshare consolidation effected on February 28, 2023) according to the terms and conditions of the Note. Prior to repayment of the Note, the Holder may, in its sole discretion, elect to\nconvert this Note during two select periods before the Maturity Date, including the fifteen days period preceding the calendar date six months after the date of issuance of the\nNote (the \"First Election Period”), as well as the fifteen days period preceding the Maturity Date (the \"Second Election Period”).\nPursuant to the Accounting Standards Update 2020-06, for convertible instruments, the instruments primarily affected are those issued with beneficial conversion features or\ncash conversion features because the accounting models for those specific features are removed. However, all entities that issue convertible instruments are affected by the\namendments to the disclosure requirements in this Update. Under the amendments in Accounting Standards Update 2020-06, the embedded conversion features no longer are\nseparated from the host contract for convertible instruments with conversion features that are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 815, Derivatives and\nHedging, or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital. Consequently, a convertible debt instrument will be accounted for as a single liability\nmeasured at its amortized cost and a convertible preferred stock will be accounted for as a single equity instrument measured at its historical cost, as long as no other features\nrequire bifurcation and recognition as derivatives. Therefore, when the Company received the convertible note financing of $9 million, we recognized the debt (note payable) of $9\nmillion based on the principal and calculated interest according to the coupon interest agreed upon in the contract.\nFinancing costs\nThe table below sets forth our financing costs recognized in current expenses for the six months ended 2022 and 2023:\nFor the year Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nFinancing costs:\nFinancial advisory fees for Unsecured Convertible Promissory Note (450,000) — —\nTotal financing costs $ (450,000) $ — $ —\nIn February 2023, according to the agreement with the financial advisor for the Company’s Unsecured Convertible Promissory Note with a financing amount of $9 million, the\nCompany paid a financial advisor fee of 5% of the financing amount to the financial advisor in 2023. No related costs occurred in the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements. These financial statements are prepared\nin accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities and revenues and\nexpenses, to disclose contingent assets and liabilities on the dates of the consolidated financial statements, and to disclose the reported amounts of revenues and expenses\nincurred during the financial reporting periods. The most significant estimates and assumptions include the valuation of digital assets and other current assets, useful lives of\nproperty and equipment, the recoverability of long-lived assets, provision necessary for realization of deferred tax assets. We continue to evaluate these estimates and\nassumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We rely on these evaluations as the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and\nliabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from\nthose estimates as a result of changes in our estimates. Some of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. We believe critical\naccounting policies as disclosed in this release reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\n56\nRecently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Company has evaluated all other recently issued accounting pronouncements and believes such pronouncements do not have a material effect on the Company’s\nfinancial statements. See Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023.\nResults of Operations\nResults of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\nThe following table summarizes the results of our operations during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and provides information regarding the dollar\nincrease or (decrease) during period.\nFor the year Ended December 31, Variance in\n2023 2022 Amount\n(US$, except share and share related data)\nRevenue $ 445,928 $ 863,438 $ (417,510)\nBusiness consultation services 160,000 80,000 80,000\nDistributed storage and computing services 285,928 783,438 (497,510)\nTechnical services — — —\nCost of Revenue $ (1,424,312) $ (1,380,600) $ (43,712)\nBusiness consultation services (138,092) (19,000) (119,092)\nDistributed storage and computing services (1,286,220) (1,361,600) 75,380\nTechnical services — — —\nGross profit $ (978,384) $ (517,162) $ (461,222)\nSales and marketing (449,900) (35,000) (414,900)\nGeneral and administrative (2,515,291) (2,156,063) (359,228)\nProvision for doubtful accounts — (3,138) 3,138\n(Loss)/income on disposal of intangible assets — (29,968) 29,968\nImpairment loss of property and equipment (307,733) — (307,733)\nImpairment loss of intangible assets (4,248,085) (3,144,053) (1,104,032)\nOperating loss from continuing operations $ (8,499,393) $ (5,885,384) $ (2,614,009)\nInterest (expenses)/income, net (196,055) 5,118 (201,173)\nFinancing costs (450,000) — (450,000)\nOther (expenses)/income, net 2,379 1,248 1,131\nLoss on market price of short-term investment (226,210) — (226,210)\nLoss from selling short-term investments (78,693) — (78,693)\nLoss from disposal of subsidiaries — (4,664) 4,664\nLoss before provision for income taxes $ (9,447,972) $ (5,883,682) $ (3,564,290)\nIncome tax benefits 90,776 248,711 (157,935)\nLoss from continuing operations $ (9,357,196) $ (5,634,971) $ (3,722,225)\nLoss from discontinued operations — — —\nNet loss $ (9,357,196) $ (5,634,971) $ (3,722,225)\nRevenue\nWe generate revenues from business consultation services and distributed storage and computing services.\nWe generated total revenue on a consolidated basis in the amounts of $445,928 for the year ended December 31, 2023, and $863,438 for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nOur revenues from business consultation services increased by $80,000, or 100%, to $160,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023 from $80,000 for the year ended December\n31, 2022. This growth is mainly due to an increase in the number of our business consultation service clients for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n57\nOur revenues from distributed storage and computing services, or cryptocurrency mining business decreased by $497,510, or 63.5%, to $285,928 for the year ended December\n31, 2023 from $783,438 for the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease is mainly due to changes in the type of our cryptocurrency mining business for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023. Our revenue for 2023 mainly came from the Filecoin physical mining business, which is relatively small in scale as of December 31, 2023, while our revenue for\n2022 mainly came from the Bitcoin shared mining business in the first four months of 2022.\nCost of Revenue\nWe generated total cost of revenue on a consolidated basis in the amounts of $1,424,312 for the year ended December 31, 2023, and $1,380,600 for the year ended December 31,\n2022.\nThe direct costs of the Company’s business consultation services included office space expenses, team salaries, travel expenses, printing fees, and the fees required to acquire\nclients.

The PIPE financing proceeds were received on December 4, 2023.\nIf there is any change in business conditions or other future developments, including any investments we may decide to pursue, we may also seek to sell additional equity\nsecurities or debt securities or borrow from lending institutions. Financing may be unavailable in the amounts we need or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. The sale of additional\nequity securities, including convertible debt securities, would dilute our earnings per share. The incurrence of debt would divert cash for working capital and capital expenditures\nto service debt obligations and could result in operating and financial covenants that restrict our operations and our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders. If we are unable\nto obtain additional equity or debt financing as required, our business operations and prospects may suffer.\n65\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\n(as restated)\n(in US$)\nNet cash used in operating activities (2,789,415) (1,551,357) (1,411,029)\nNet cash (used in)/provided by investing activities (7,839,004) 936,712 —\nNet cash provided by financing activities 19,300,000 7,720,425 1,676,203\nEffect of exchange rate changes (505) (8,543) 3,356\nIncrease/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 8,671,076 7,097,237 268,530\nCash at the beginning of the period 7,537,873 440,636 174,783\nCash at the end of the period 16,208,949 7,537,873 443,313\nNote: We have amended and restated our consolidated statement of cash flows for the financial year ended December 31, 2022, by reclassifying the net cash provided by disposal\nof digital assets from operating activities to investment activities.

The investment is made with an aim to own mining machines capable of gathering, processing, and storing vast amounts of data, to advance the cryptocurrency mining\nbusiness, and to further solidify us as a pioneer in the creation of the Web3 framework.

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the year-over-year percent\nchanges in the consumer price index for December 2021, 2022 and 2023 were increases of 7% and 6.4%, and 3.2%, respectively.\nAlthough we have not been materially affected by inflation in the past, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience upward pressure on our operating expenses.\nC. Research and Development\nPlease refer to \"Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business Overview—Intellectual Property.”\nD. Trend Information\nIn late February 2022, the former acting Chief Financial Officer Wei Zhu, who was also the Company’s former Co-Chief Executive Officer, and a former member and Co-\nChairperson of the Board, was taken away from the Company’s office in Shenzhen, China for personal reasons to cooperate with the investigation conducted by Sheyang County\nPublic Security Bureau, Yancheng City, Jiangsu Province, People’s Republic of China. At the same time, Sheyang County Public Security Bureau forcibly took away the safe\nbelonged to the Company that stored the digital asset hardware cold wallet, and forcibly opened the safe by destroying the lock thereto and seized the digital asset hardware cold\nwallet and all cryptocurrencies stored therein.\n67\nThe book value of the Bitcoins and USD Coins stored in the out-of-control wallet was $3,944,808 on December 31, 2022, and we verified that Bitcoins and USD Coins with a\nbook value of $3,469,762 as of December 31, 2022 stored in the out-of-control wallet had been transferred to another unknown wallet.\nThe Company’s PRC law firm Deheng Law Office (\"Deheng”) has been representing the Company in our efforts to recover the wrongfully seized cold wallet and\ncryptocurrencies from the PRC’s Public Security Bureau. On November 21, 2022, Deheng submitted the complaint and evidentiary materials to the Public Security Bureau according\nto the Criminal Procedure Law and the Provisions on Procedures of Handling Criminal Cases by Public Security Organs (the \"PRC Criminal Law”). As of December 31, 2022, we and\nDeheng had not received any definitive response from the Public Security Bureau.\nOn behalf of the Company, Deheng went to Sheyang Public Security Bureau several times to communicate with the police officer in charge of Wei Zhu’s case, and Deheng\nlearned that Sheyang Public Security Bureau suspected that the cryptocurrencies belonged to the Company was related to Wei Zhu’s case without any evidence and because Wei\nZhu’s case is still in the stage of investigation, they insisted on continuing to implement temporary measures to retain the seized assets.\nAccording to the legal opinion issued by Deheng, the ownership of the cryptocurrencies seized by Sheyang Public Security Bureau is clear and can be verified as belonging\nto the Company, and the seizure of the Company’s cryptocurrencies by Sheyang Public Security Bureau is improper. If Sheyang Public Security Bureau does not release the\nCompany’s seized cryptocurrencies, they should issue a written decision in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.\nOn November 21, 2022, Deheng submitted the complaint and evidentiary materials to the Public Security Bureau of Sheyang County according to the Criminal Procedure Law\nand the Provisions on Procedures of Handling Criminal Cases by Public Security Organs (the \"PRC Criminal Law”).\nOn October 12, 2023, the Company submitted the \"Application for State Compensation” to the Public Security Bureau of Sheyang County. At the same time, the Company filed\na complaint and submitted the \"Information and Supervision Application” with Public Security Bureau of Yancheng City (the superior department of Public Security Bureau of\nSheyang County), urging the Public Security Bureau of Yancheng City to compel the Public Security Bureau of Sheyang County to make a decision as to the seized digital\ncurrencies. On November 22, 2023, the Company received a response from the Public Security Bureau of Sheyang County, rejecting the Company’s \"Application for State\nCompensation”. The Public Security Bureau of Sheyang County claimed that the criminal responsibility for the relevant case has not been terminated, and the Company should\nsubmit the \"Application for State Compensation” after the criminal responsibility for the relevant case has been terminated. In view of the response from the Public Security Bureau\nof Sheyang County, the Company submitted the administrative reconsideration by mail to the Public Security Bureau of Yancheng City, the higher-level organ of the Public\nSecurity Bureau of Sheyang County, on December 19, 2023.\nOn February 4, 2024, the Yancheng Public Security Bureau replied to us with a \"Criminal Compensation Review Decision”, supporting the actions of the Sheyang County\nPublic Security Bureau and rejecting the Company’s national compensation application. Yancheng Public Security Bureau also believes that because they suspect that the crypto\nassets owned by the Company may be related to the suspect of the case they are investigating, and the Company can only apply for the national compensation after the relevant\ncase is ended. Therefore, in accordance with the national compensation procedure, the Company mailed the relevant materials to the National Compensation Commission of\nYancheng Intermediate People’s Court on March 1, 2024, and applied to the National Compensation Commission of Yancheng Intermediate People’s Court for a compensation\ndecision.\nAs of now, the Company is still attempting to recover those lost crypto assets through administrative appeals.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company’s net assets were $16,828,864, of which cash and cash equivalents accounted for 44% and the Bitcoins and USD Coins out-of-control\naccounted for 23%. As of December 31, 2023, the Company’s net assets were $17,832,767, of which cash and cash equivalents accounted for 90%, and the Bitcoins and USD Coins\nout-of-control were fully recognized impairment losses to eliminate the potential significant uncertainty on the financial statements.\n68\nAfter the Wei Zhu incident, the Company’s board of directors and management underwent significant changes in 2022. From March 2022 to April 2023, the new management\nmade significant adjustments to the Company’s business strategy and development focus.\nAfter the adjustment of our business strategies, the focus of our operating subsidiaries are as follows: (i) MFH Tech acting as the operating entity of distributed storage and\ncomputing services and business consultation services business in North America; (ii) after completing the acquisition of all assets and liabilities of J.V. Delaney & Associates and\nonly after obtaining FINRA approval, Chaince Securities to operate our financial advisory services and online and traditional brokerage services in North America; and (iii) Ucon\nand Lianji Future acting as the operating entities of the business consultation services in the Asia-Pacific region.\na) From July 2022, we have designated business consultation services as one of our main businesses.\nIn July 2022, we added business consultation services as one of our main businesses going forward, providing business consulting services and digital payment solutions to\nglobal corporate clients, especially those in the blockchain industry, and continued our planned expansion into online and traditional brokerage services. We incorporated MFH\nTech to develop distributed computing and storage services (including cryptocurrency mining and providing cloud storage services for decentralized platform operators) and\nbusiness consultation services. We expect the Company to get more clients in the consultation services business in the next two years, thereby generating more revenue, and the\nproportion of the revenue from consultation services to total revenue will gradually increase.\nb) From December 2022, we started our Filecoin mining business, and we have decided not to expand the scale of our crypto assets mining business to avoid related\nindustry risks.\nIn the first half of 2022, the Company’s revenue came entirely from the Bitcoin shared mining business, which began in October 2021 and ended in April 2022. During the same\nperiod, the Wei Zhu incident caused the Company to temporarily lose control of most of its cryptocurrencies, and the Company’s daily operations also faced temporary difficulties,\nresulting in the Company’s original expansion plan for cryptocurrency mining business not being implemented. The revenue from Bitcoin shared mining business in 2022\naccounted for 90.7% of the total revenue. Going forward, we currently have no plans to resume Bitcoin mining business.\nOn December 15, 2022, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Huangtong International Co., Ltd., providing for the acquisition and purchase of Web3 decentralized\nstorage infrastructure, including cryptocurrency mining servers, cables, and other electronic devices, for an aggregate consideration of USD$5,980,000, payable in our ordinary\nshares.\nOn December 5, 2023, the Company signed an Origin Storage Filecoin Mining Service Contract with Origin Storage. The Company has used Origin Storage’s technology to\nrepackage the Web3 decentralized storage infrastructure and conduct Filecoin mining business through Origin Storage’s network platform. The Filecoin mining services provided\nby Origin Storage include but are not limited to storage server services, computing encapsulation server services, and technical services.\nIn January 2024, we repackaged our Web3 decentralized storage infrastructure for Filecoin mining using new technology provided by Origin Storage and began running two\nnew Filecoin mining nodes. As of the date of this annual report, the effective storage capacity of our two new Filecoin mining nodes has reached 64PiB, exceeding our original\ntarget storage capacity of 60.4PiB, and only takes up\n6.4PiB of the original storage capacity (the \"Raw Byte Power”) of our Web3 decentralized storage infrastructure. In other words, the effective storage capacity of the Company can\nbe magnified tenfold with Origin Storage’s technologies.\nWe expect that the revenue from distributed computing and storage services (including Filecoin mining and providing cloud storage services to other decentralized platform\noperators) will become the main source of revenue in 2024, although our consultation business will continue to grow.\nc) We have decided not to continue conducting blockchain technology service business related to the asset trading platform, asset digitalization platform and\ndecentralized finance (DeFi) platform.\nOn January 28, 2023, we decided to write off NBpay Investment Limited and its subsidiaries, which had no meaningful assets or business nor employees. Also considering the\nenormous uncertainty brought by the cryptocurrency market turmoil in the past two years to the blockchain industry, as well as the regulatory uncertainties, although we have the\nability to quickly reorganize the blockchain technical service team, we have decided not to continue conducting blockchain technology service business related to the asset\ntrading platform, asset digitalization platform and decentralized finance (DeFi) platform in the next two years.\n69\nd) We have decided to increase the financial advisory services, online and traditional brokerage services as one of our future main\nbusinesses.\nOn April 12, 2023, we completed the incorporation of another U.S. subsidiary, Chaince Securities, for which we plan to develop financial advisory services, online and\ntraditional brokerage services independently in the future, but only after we obtain the required FINRA approval. We expect the financial advisory, online, and traditional\nbrokerage services to become one of the Company’s main businesses by 2024.\nOther than as described elsewhere in this annual report, we are not aware of any trends, uncertainties, demands, commitments or events that are reasonably likely to have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our revenue, income from continuing operations, profitability, liquidity or capital resources, or that would cause our reported financial information not\nnecessarily to be indicative of future operating results or financial condition.\nE. Critical Accounting Estimates\nImpairment of intangible assets with indefinite useful life\nWe classify the cryptocurrencies the Company hold as indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nIntangible assets with indefinite useful life are not amortized and are tested for impairment annually or more frequently, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they\nmight be impaired in accordance with ASC Subtopic 350-30, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other: General Intangibles Other than Goodwill (\"ASC 350-30”).\nThe intangible assets of the Company are cryptocurrencies which are measured at cost less impairment. The cryptocurrencies received from cryptocurrency mining operations\nrecognize the cost of intangible assets based on the market price at the time of acquisition.\nDue to the price crash of Bitcoin in 2022, the Company, out of caution, decided to change the impairment test method of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies from testing once\nor twice a year by calculating the fair value based on the average daily closing price of the past 12 months to testing every day by calculating the fair value based on the intraday\nlow price. ASC 350-30-35-18 and ASC 350- 30-35-19 call for us to consider all circumstances that could lead to impairment of the intangible assets, take a more cautious method to\ntest whether impairment of the intangible assets is likely to occur, and test more frequently. The intraday low price of cryptocurrencies to be utilized in calculating impairment of our\ncryptocurrencies held as that metric is the most accurate indicator of whether it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired.\nWe estimated the fair values of the Filecoins based on the intraday low price of the Coinbase platform every day, and we recognized $303,276 impairment loss of intangible\nassets for the year ended December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has not made positive progress in recovering its crypto assets out of control. Although it is\nconsidered inappropriate from a legal perspective for the Sheyang County Public Security Bureau to implement seizure procedures on the Company’s crypto assets, the Company\nstill cannot estimate the time it may take to recover those crypto assets. Therefore, the Company has decided to make a provision for impairment of all the crypto assets out of\ncontrol, to eliminate the potential significant uncertainty on the financial statements. The amount of the impairment of the crypto assets out of control (all of the Company’s\nBitcoins and USD Coins) for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $3,944,809.\nWe estimated the fair values of the cryptocurrencies based on the intraday low price of the Feixiaohao platform every day, and we recognized $3,144,053 impairment loss of\nintangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2022. As of April 25, 2023, we had not been able to communicate effectively with the Sheyang County Public Security Bureau.\nThe Sheyang County Public Security Bureau did not provide a written response to the appeal materials submitted by the Company in accordance with regulations. We had not\nbeen informed of any information that may prevent the Company from recovering these crypto assets out of control. Therefore, in our consolidated financial statements as of\nDecember 31, 2022, we did not recognize any impairment losses related to the loss of control over these crypto assets.\n70\nWe recognized $1,292,568 impairment loss of intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2021 in the consolidated financial statements.\nITEM 6.

Financial Statements” for our audited consolidated financial statements filed as part of this annual report.\nLegal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, we may become a party to various legal or administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business, including actions with respect to\nintellectual property infringement, breach of contract and labor and employment claims. Excepts as otherwise disclosed in this annual report, we are currently not a party to, and we\nare not aware of any threat of, any legal or administrative proceedings that, in the opinion of our management, are likely to have any material and adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition, cash flows or results of operations.\nPlease also refer to certain updates on our crypto assets which were wrongfully seized in the section \"Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—D. Trend\nInformation.”\nDividend Policy\nSince our inception, we have not declared or paid any dividends on our ordinary shares. We have no present plan to pay any dividends on our ordinary shares in the\nforeseeable future. We intend to retain most, if not all, of our available funds and any future earnings to operate and expand our business.\nAny future determination to pay dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors subject to certain restrictions under Cayman Islands law, namely that our\ncompany may only pay dividends out of profits or share premium, and provided always that in no circumstances may a dividend be paid if this would result in our company being\nunable to pay its debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business. Our board of directors’ decision to declare and pay dividends may be based on a number of factors,\nincluding our future operations and earnings, capital requirements and surplus, the amount of distributions, if any, received by us from our US, Hong Kong and PRC subsidiaries,\nour general financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors that the board of directors may deem relevant. Cash dividends on our ordinary shares, if any, will be paid\nin U.S. dollars.\nWe are a holding company incorporated in the Cayman Islands. In order for us to distribute any dividends to our shareholders, we will rely on dividends distributed by our\nUS, Hong Kong and PRC subsidiaries. Certain payments from our PRC subsidiary to us are subject to PRC taxes, such as withholding income tax. In addition, regulations in China\ncurrently permit payment of dividends of a PRC company only out of accumulated distributable after-tax profits as determined in accordance with its articles of association and the\naccounting standards and regulations in China. Our PRC subsidiary is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profit based on PRC accounting standards every year to a\nstatutory common reserve fund until the aggregate amount of such reserve fund reaches 50% of the registered capital of such subsidiary. Such statutory reserves are not\ndistributable as loans, advances or cash dividends. Our PRC subsidiary may set aside a certain amount of its after-tax profits to other funds at its discretion. These reserve funds\ncan only be used for specific purposes and are not transferable to the company’s parent in the form of loans, advances or dividends. See \"Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk\nFactors—Risks Relating to Doing Business in the PRC—We may rely on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by our PRC and Hong Kong subsidiaries to fund any\ncash and financing requirements we may have, and any limitation on the ability of our PRC and Hong Kong subsidiaries to make payments to us could have a material and adverse\neffect on our ability to conduct our business.”\n84\nB. Significant Changes\nIn May 2022, we opened the US office in New York and moved our corporate headquarter from Shenzhen to New York.\nOn July 15, 2022, we incorporated Mercurity Fintech Technology Holding Inc.(the \"MFH Tech”) in New York to develop distributed storage and computing services\n(including cryptocurrency mining) and business consultation services. We started business consultation services operation in New York since August 2022 and started Filecoin\nmining operations in the United States since December 2022.\nOn January 28, 2023, we decided to write off NBpay Investment Limited and its subsidiaries, which are all shell companies without any assets, employees or business.\nOn April 12, 2023, we completed the incorporation of a U.S. subsidiary, Chaince Securities, Inc. (\"Chaince Securities”), which plans to develop financial advisory services,\nonline and traditional brokerage services independently in the future. On May 3, 2023, Chaince Securities entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement for the acquisition of all\nassets and liabilities of J.V. Delaney & Associates, an investment advisory firm and FINRA licensed broker dealer.\nFrom April to June 2023, our management reassessed the potential adverse effects of changes in the Company’s business environment, and readjusted the Company’s\nbusiness structure and the future development plan. Considering the increasing difficulty of mining in the crypto mining industry and the general losses by top crypto mining\nenterprises, we have decided to reduce the Company’s investment in the crypto mining field. Also considering the enormous uncertainty brought by the cryptocurrency market\nturmoil in the past two years to the blockchain industry, as well as the regulatory uncertainties, although we have the ability to quickly reorganize the blockchain technical service\nteam, we have still decided not to continue conducting blockchain technology service business related to the asset trading platform, asset digitalization platform and decentralized\nfinance (DeFi) platform.\nAfter the adjustment of our business strategies, the focuses of our respective operating subsidiaries are as follows: (i) MFH Tech acting as the operating entity of distributed\nstorage and computing services and business and business consultation services in North America; (ii) after completing the acquisition of all assets and liabilities of J.V. Delaney\n& Associates with FINRA approval, Chaince Securities to operate our financial advisory services, online and traditional brokerage services in North America; and (iii) Ucon and\nLianji Future acting as the operating entities of the business consultation services in the Asia-Pacific region.\nExcept as disclosed in this Item 8B or elsewhere in this annual report, we have not experienced any significant changes since the date of our audited consolidated financial\nstatements included in this annual report.\nITEM 9.

The following are summaries of material provisions of our fifth amended and restated\nmemorandum and articles of association and the Companies Act insofar as they relate to the material terms of our ordinary shares.\nRegistered Office and Objects\nOur registered office in the Cayman Islands is at Maples Corporate Services Limited, PO Box 309, Ugland House, Grand Cayman KY1-1104, Cayman Islands. The objects for\nwhich our company is established are unrestricted and we have full power and authority to carry out any object not prohibited by the Companies Act, as amended from time to\ntime, or any other law of the Cayman Islands.\nBoard of Directors\nA director is not required to hold any shares in our company by way of qualification. A director who to his knowledge is in any way, whether directly or indirectly, interested\nin a contract or arrangement or proposed contract or arrangement with us shall declare the nature of his interest at the meeting of the board of directors at which the question of\nentering into the contract or arrangement is first considered, if he knows his interest then exists, or in any other case at the first meeting of the board of directors after he knows\nthat he is or has become so interested. Subject to any separate requirement for the approval of the audit committee of the board of directors under applicable law or the listing rules\nof Nasdaq, and unless disqualified by the chairman of the relevant board meeting, such director may vote with respect to any contract, proposed contract or arrangement in which\nhe is so interested. A director may exercise all the powers of our company to raise or borrow money, and to mortgage or charge all or any part of its undertaking, property and\nassets (present and future) and uncalled capital, and issue debentures, bonds or other securities, whether outright or as collateral security for any debt, liability or obligation of our\ncompany or of any third-party. The directors may receive such remuneration as our board may from time to time determine. There is no age limit requirement with respect to the\nretirement or non-retirement of a director. See also \"Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees—C. Board Practices.”\nOrdinary Shares\nGeneral\nAll of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares are fully paid and non-assessable. Our ordinary shares are issued in registered form and are issued when registered in our\nregister of members. Our shareholders who are non-residents of the Cayman Islands may freely hold and vote their ordinary shares. Our fifth amended and restated memorandum\nand articles of association do not permit us to issue bearer shares.\n86\nDividends\nThe holders of our ordinary shares are entitled to such dividends as may be declared by our board of directors subject to the Companies Act and to the fifth amended and\nrestated articles of association. Under Cayman Islands law, dividends may be declared and paid only out of funds legally available therefor, namely out of either profit or our share\npremium account, and provided further that a dividend may not be paid if this would result in our company being unable to pay its debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of\nbusiness.\nVoting Rights\nEach ordinary share is entitled to one vote on all matters upon which the ordinary shares are entitled to vote. Voting at any meeting of shareholders is by show of hands\nunless a poll is required by the rules of NASDAQ or demanded, on or before the declaration of the result of the show of hands or on the withdrawal of any other demand for a poll.\nA poll may be demanded by the chairman of such meeting or any one shareholder present in person or by proxy.\nAn ordinary resolution to be passed by the shareholders requires the affirmative vote of a simple majority of votes attached to the ordinary shares cast in a general meeting,\nwhile a special resolution requires the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of votes cast attached to the ordinary shares in a meeting. A special resolution will be required for\nimportant matters such as a change of name or making changes to our memorandum and articles of association.\nGeneral Meetings of Shareholders\nShareholders’ meetings may be convened by our board of directors. Cayman Islands law provides shareholders with only limited rights to requisition a general meeting, and\ndoes not provide shareholders with any right to put any proposal before a general meeting. However, these rights may be provided in a company’s articles of association. Our fifth\namended and restated articles of association allow our shareholders holding shares representing in aggregate not less than 30% of our voting share capital in issue, to requisition\nan extraordinary general meeting of our shareholders, in which case our directors are obliged to call such meeting and to put the resolutions so requisitioned to a vote at such\nmeeting; however, our fifth amended and restated articles of association do not provide our shareholders with any right to put any proposals before annual general meetings or\nextraordinary general meetings not called by such shareholders. Advance notice in writing of at least ten clear days is required for the convening of our annual general\nshareholders’ meeting and any other general meeting of our shareholders. A quorum required for a meeting of shareholders consists of at least two shareholders present or by\nproxy, representing not less than one-third in nominal value of the total issued voting shares in our company.\nTransfer of Ordinary Shares\nSubject to the restrictions contained in our fifth amended and restated articles of association, as applicable, any of our shareholders may transfer all or any of his or her\nordinary shares by an instrument of transfer in the usual or common form or any other form approved by our board of directors.\nOur board of directors may, in its absolute discretion, decline to register any transfer of any ordinary share which is not fully paid up to a person of whom it does not approve,\nor any share issued under any share incentive scheme for employees upon which a restriction on transfer imposed thereby still subsists. Our board of directors may also decline to\nregister any transfer of any ordinary share unless (a) the instrument of transfer is lodged with us or such other place at which the register of members is kept in accordance with\nCayman Islands law, accompanied by the certificate for the ordinary shares to which it relates and such other evidence as our board of directors may reasonably require to show\nthe right of the transferor to make the transfer; (b) the instrument of transfer is in respect of only one class of shares; (c) the instrument of transfer is properly stamped, if required\nand; (e) a fee of such maximum sum as the Nasdaq Capital Market may determine to be payable or such lesser sum as the board may from time to time require is paid to us in respect\nthereof.\nIf our directors refuse to register a transfer they are required, within three months after the date on which the instrument of transfer was lodged, to send to each of the\ntransferor and the transferee notice of such refusal.\nThe registration of transfers may, after compliance with any notice requirement of the Nasdaq Capital Market, be suspended and the register closed at such times and for such\nperiods as our directors may from time to time determine; provided, however, that the registration of transfers shall not be suspended nor the register closed for more than 30 days\nin any year as our directors may determine.\nLiquidation\nOn a return of capital on winding up or otherwise (other than on redemption or purchase of ordinary shares), assets available for distribution among the holders of ordinary\nshares will be distributed among the holders of the ordinary shares on a pro rata basis. If our assets available for distribution are insufficient to repay all of the paid-up capital, the\nassets will be distributed so that the losses are borne by our shareholders proportionately.\n87\nCalls on Ordinary Shares and Forfeiture of Ordinary Shares\nOur board of directors may from time to time make calls upon shareholders for any amounts unpaid on their ordinary shares in a notice served to such shareholders at least 14\nclear days prior to the specified time of payment. The ordinary shares that have been called upon and remain unpaid are subject to forfeiture.\nShare Repurchases\nWe are empowered under our fifth amended and restated memorandum of association to purchase our shares subject to the Companies Act and our fifth amended and restated\narticles of association. Our fifth amended and restated articles of association provide that this power is exercisable by our board of directors in such manner, upon such terms and\nsubject to such conditions as it in its absolute discretion thinks fit subject to the Companies Act and, where applicable, the rules of the Nasdaq Capital Market and the applicable\nregulatory authority.\nVariations of Rights of Shares\nIf at any time our share capital is divided into different classes of shares, all or any of the special rights attached to any class of shares may, subject to the provisions of the\nCompanies Act, be varied, modified or abrogated with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate general meeting of the holders of the shares of that class.\nConsequently, the rights of any class of shares cannot be detrimentally altered without a majority of two-thirds of the vote of all of the shares in that class. The special rights\nconferred upon the holders of the shares of any class issued with preferred or other rights will not, unless otherwise expressly provided by the terms of issue of the shares of that\nclass, be deemed to be varied, modified or abrogated by the creation or issue of further shares ranking pari passu with such existing class of shares.\nInspection of Books and Records\nHolders of our ordinary shares will have no general right under Cayman Islands law to inspect or obtain copies of our list of shareholders or our corporate records (except for\nour memorandum and articles of association, special resolutions of our shareholders and our register of mortgages and charges). However, our fifth amended and restated articles\nof association provide our shareholders with the right to inspect our list of shareholders (on such days as our board of directors shall determine) and to receive annual audited\nfinancial statements.\nChanges in Capital\nWe may from time to time by ordinary resolution: (a) increase the share capital by such sum, to be divided into shares of such classes and amount, as the resolution shall\nprescribe; (b) consolidate and divide all or any of our share capital into shares of a larger amount than our existing shares; (c) without prejudice to the powers of the board of\ndirectors under our articles of association, divide our shares into several classes and without prejudice to any special rights previously conferred on the holders of existing shares\nattach thereto respectively and preferential, deferred, qualified or special rights, privileges, conditions or such restrictions which in the absence of any such determination by the\nCompany in general meeting, as the board of directors may determine (d) sub-divide our existing shares, or any of them into shares of a smaller amount; or (e) cancel any shares\nwhich, at the date of the passing of the resolution, have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person and diminish the amount of our share capital by the amount of the\nshares so cancelled. We may by special resolution reduce our share capital or any capital redemption reserve in any manner permitted by law.\nRegister of Members\nUnder Cayman Islands law, we must keep a register of members and there should be entered therein: (a) the names and addresses of the members, together with a statement of\nthe shares held by each member, and such statement shall confirm (i) the amount paid or agreed to be considered as paid, on the shares of each member; (ii) the number and\ncategory of shares held by each member, and (iii) whether each relevant category of shares held by a member carries voting rights under the articles of association of the company,\nand if so, whether such voting rights are conditional; (b) the date on which the name of any person was entered on the register as a member; and (c) the date on which any person\nceased to be a member.\nUnder Cayman Islands law, the register of members of our company is prima facie evidence of the matters set out therein (i.e. the register of members will raise a presumption of\nfact on the matters referred to above unless rebutted) and a member registered in the register of members should be deemed as a matter of Cayman Islands law to have legal title to\nthe shares as set against its name in the register of members. Once our register of members has been updated, the shareholders recorded in the register of members will be deemed\nto have legal title to the shares set against their name.\n88\nIf the name of any person is incorrectly entered in or omitted from our register of members, or if there is any default or unnecessary delay in entering on the register the fact of\nany person having ceased to be a member of our company, the person or member aggrieved (or any member of our company or our company itself) may apply to the Cayman\nIslands Grand Court for an order that the register be rectified, and the Court may either refuse such application or it may, if satisfied of the justice of the case, make an order for the\nrectification of the register.\nDifferences in Corporate Law\nThe Companies Act is derived, to a large extent, from the older Companies Acts of England but does not follow recent statutory enactments in England. In addition, the\nCompanies Act differs from laws applicable to United States corporations and their shareholders. Set forth below is a summary of the significant differences between the\nprovisions of the Companies Act applicable to us and the laws applicable to companies incorporated in the United States.\nMergers and Similar Arrangements\nThe Companies Act permits mergers and consolidations between Cayman Islands companies and between Cayman Islands companies and non-Cayman Islands companies.\nFor these purposes, (a) \"merger” means the merging of two or more constituent companies and the vesting of their undertaking, property and liabilities in one of such companies\nas the surviving company and (b) a \"consolidation” means the combination of two or more constituent companies into a combined company and the vesting of the undertaking,\nproperty and liabilities of such companies to the consolidated company. In order to effect such a merger or consolidation, the directors of each constituent company must approve\na written plan of merger or consolidation, which must then be authorized by (a) a special resolution of the shareholders of each constituent company, and (b) such other\nauthorization, if any, as may be specified in such constituent company’s articles of association.\nThe written plan of merger or consolidation must be filed with the Registrar of Companies together with a declaration as to the solvency of the consolidated or surviving\ncompany, a list of the assets and liabilities of each constituent company and an undertaking that a copy of the certificate of merger or consolidation will be given to the members\nand creditors of each constituent company and that notification of the merger or consolidation will be published in the Cayman Islands Gazette. Dissenting shareholders have the\nright to be paid the fair value of their shares (which, if not agreed between the parties, will be determined by the Cayman Islands court) if they follow the required procedures,\nsubject to certain exceptions. Court approval is not required for a merger or consolidation which is effected in compliance with these statutory procedures.\nIn addition, there are statutory provisions that facilitate the reconstruction and amalgamation of companies, provided that the arrangement is approved by (a) 75% in value of\nthe shareholders or class of shareholders, as the case may be, or (b) a majority in number representing 75% in value of the creditors or each class of creditors, as the case may be,\nwith whom the arrangement is to be made, that are, in each case, present and voting either in person or by proxy at a meeting, or meetings, convened for that purpose. The\nconvening of the meetings and subsequently the arrangement must be sanctioned by the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands. While a dissenting shareholder has the right to\nexpress to the court the view that the transaction ought not to be approved, the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands can be expected to approve the arrangement if it determines\nthat (a) the statutory provisions as to the required majority vote have been met; (b) the shareholders have been fairly represented at the meeting in question and the statutory\nmajority are acting bona fide without coercion of the minority to promote interests adverse to those of the class; (c) the arrangement is such that may be reasonably approved by\nan intelligent and honest man of that class acting in respect of his interest; and (d) the arrangement is not one that would more properly be sanctioned under some other provision\nof the Companies Act .\nIf an arrangement and reconstruction is thus approved, the dissenting shareholder would have no rights comparable to appraisal rights, which would otherwise ordinarily be\navailable to dissenting shareholders of Delaware corporations, providing rights to receive payment in cash for the judicially determined value of the shares.\nWhen a takeover offer is made and accepted by holders of 90% of the shares affected within four months, the offeror may, within a two-month period commencing on the\nexpiration of such four month period, require the holders of the remaining shares to transfer such shares on the terms of the offer. An objection can be made to the Grand Court of\nthe Cayman Islands but this is unlikely to succeed in the case of an offer which has been so approved unless there is evidence of fraud, bad faith or collusion.\n89\nShareholders’ Suits\nIn principle, we will normally be the proper plaintiff and as a general rule a derivative action may not be brought by a minority shareholder. However, based on English\nauthorities, which would in all likelihood be of persuasive authority in the Cayman Islands, there are exceptions to the foregoing principle, including when (a) a company acts or\nproposes to act illegally or ultra vires; (b) the act complained of, although not ultra vires, could only be effected duly if authorized by more than a simple majority vote that has not\nbeen obtained; and (c) those who control the company are perpetrating a \"fraud on the minority.”\nIndemnification of Directors and Executive Officers and Limitation of Liability\nCayman Islands law does not limit the extent to which a company’s articles of association may provide for indemnification of officers and directors, except to the extent any\nsuch provision may be held by the Cayman Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such as to provide indemnification against civil fraud or the consequences of committing\na crime. Our fifth amended and restated memorandum and articles of association permit indemnification of officers and directors against costs, charges, losses, damages, and\nexpenses which are incurred or sustained by or by reason of any act done, concurred in or omitted in or about the execution of their duty, or supposed duty, in their respective\noffices or trusts; and none of them shall be answerable for the acts, receipts, neglects or defaults of the other or others of them or for joining in any receipts for the sake of\nconformity, or for any bankers or other persons with whom any moneys or effects belonging to us shall or may be lodged or deposited for safe custody, or for insufficiency or\ndeficiency of any security upon which any moneys of or belonging to us shall be placed out on or invested, or for any other loss, misfortune or damage which may happen in the\nexecution of their respective offices of trusts, or in relation thereto, provided that the indemnity shall not extend to any matter in respect of any fraud or dishonesty which may\nattach to any of said persons. This standard of conduct is generally the same as permitted under the Delaware General Corporation Law for a Delaware corporation. In addition, we\nintend to enter into indemnification agreements with our directors and senior executive officers that will provide such persons with additional indemnification beyond that provided\nin our fifth amended and restated memorandum and articles of association.\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers or persons controlling us under the foregoing provisions, we\nhave been informed that, in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.\nAnti-Takeover Provisions in the Memorandum and Articles of Association\nSome provisions of our fifth amended and restated memorandum and articles of association may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or\nmanagement that shareholders may consider favorable, including provisions that authorize our board of directors to issue preference shares in one or more series and to designate\nthe price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of such preference shares without any further vote or action by our shareholders.\nHowever, under Cayman Islands law, our directors may only exercise the rights and powers granted to them under our memorandum and articles of association, as amended\nand restated from time to time, for what they believe in good faith to be in the best interests of our company.\nDirectors’ Fiduciary Duties\nAs a matter of Cayman Islands law, a director of a Cayman Islands company is in the position of a fiduciary with respect to the company and therefore it is considered that he\nowes the following duties to the company—a duty to act bona fide in the best interests of the company, a duty not to make a profit based on his or her position as director (unless\nthe company permits him to do so) and a duty not to put himself in a position where the interests of the company conflict with his or her personal interest or his or her duty to a\nthird-party. A director of a Cayman Islands company owes to the company a duty to act with skill and care. It was previously considered that a director need not exhibit in the\nperformance of his or her duties a greater degree of skill than may reasonably be expected from a person of his or her knowledge and experience. However, English courts have\nmoved towards an objective standard with regard to the required skill and care and these authorities are likely to be followed in the Cayman Islands.\nIn addition, directors of a Cayman Islands company must not place themselves in a position in which there is a conflict between their duty to the company and their personal\ninterests. However, this obligation may be varied by the company’s articles of association, which may permit a director to vote on a matter in which he has a personal interest\nprovided that he has disclosed that nature of his interest to the board. Our fifth amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that a director with an\ninterest (direct or indirect) in a contract or arrangement or proposed contract or arrangement with the company must declare the nature of his interest at the meeting of the board of\ndirectors at which the question of entering into the contract or arrangement is first considered, if he knows his interest then exists, or in any other case at the first meeting of the\nboard of directors after he is or has become so interested.\n90\nA general notice may be given at a meeting of the board of directors to the effect that (i) the director is a member/officer of a specified company or firm and is to be regarded as\ninterested in any contract or arrangement which may after the date of the notice in writing be made with that company or firm; or (ii) he is to be regarded as interested in any\ncontract or arrangement which may after the date of the notice in writing to the board of directors be made with a specified person who is connected with him, will be deemed\nsufficient declaration of interest. Following the disclosure being made pursuant to our fifth amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and subject to any\nseparate requirement for audit committee approval under applicable law or the listing rules of Nasdaq, and unless disqualified by the chairman of the relevant board meeting, a\ndirector may vote in respect of any contract or arrangement in which such director is interested and may be counted in the quorum at such meeting. However, even if a director\ndiscloses his interest and is therefore permitted to vote, he must still comply with his duty to act bona fide in the best interest of our company.\nIn comparison, under Delaware corporate law, a director of a Delaware corporation has a fiduciary duty to the corporation and its shareholders. This duty has two\ncomponents: the duty of care and the duty of loyalty. The duty of care requires that a director act in good faith, with the care that an ordinarily prudent person would exercise\nunder similar circumstances. Under this duty, a director must inform himself of, and disclose to shareholders, all material information reasonably available regarding a significant\ntransaction. The duty of loyalty requires that a director act in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation. He or she must not use his or\nher corporate position for personal gain or advantage. This duty prohibits self-dealing by a director and mandates that the best interest of the corporation and its shareholders take\nprecedence over any interest possessed by a director, officer or controlling shareholder and not shared by the shareholders generally. In general, actions of a director are\npresumed to have been made on an informed basis, in good faith and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the corporation. However, this\npresumption may be rebutted by evidence of a breach of one of the fiduciary duties. Should such evidence be presented concerning a transaction by a director, a director must\nprove the procedural fairness of the transaction, and that the transaction was of fair value to the corporation.\nShareholder Proposals\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, a shareholder has the right to put any proposal before the annual meeting of shareholders, provided it complies with the notice\nprovisions in the governing documents. The Delaware General Corporation Law does not provide shareholders an express right to put any proposal before the annual meeting of\nshareholders, but in keeping with common law, Delaware corporations generally afford shareholders an opportunity to make proposals and nominations provided that they comply\nwith the notice provisions in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws. A special meeting may be called by the board of directors or any other person authorized to do so in the\ngoverning documents, but shareholders may be precluded from calling special meetings.\nThere are no statutory requirements under Cayman Islands law allowing our shareholders to requisition a shareholders’ meeting. However, under our fifth amended and\nrestated articles of association, on the requisition of shareholders representing not less than 30% of the voting rights entitled to vote at general meetings, the board shall convene\nan extraordinary general meeting. As an exempted Cayman Islands company, we are not obliged by law to call shareholders’ annual general meetings. Our fifth amended and\nrestated articles of association provide that we may (but shall not be obliged to) in each calendar year hold a general meeting as our annual general meeting.\nCumulative Voting\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, cumulative voting for elections of directors is not permitted unless the corporation’s certificate of incorporation specifically\nprovides for it. Cumulative voting potentially facilitates the representation of minority shareholders on a board of directors since it permits the minority shareholder to cast all the\nvotes to which the shareholder is entitled on a single director, which increases the shareholder’s voting power with respect to electing such director. As permitted under Cayman\nIslands law, our fifth amended and restated articles of association do not provide for cumulative voting. As a result, our shareholders are not afforded any less protections or\nrights on this issue than shareholders of a Delaware corporation.\n91\nRemoval of Directors\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, a director of a corporation with a classified board may be removed only for cause with the approval of a majority of the\noutstanding shares entitled to vote, unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. Under our fifth amended and restated articles of association, directors may be\nremoved by an ordinary resolution of shareholders.\nTransactions with Interested Shareholders\nThe Delaware General Corporation Law contains a business combination statute applicable to Delaware public corporations whereby, unless the corporation has specifically\nelected not to be governed by such statute by amendment to its certificate of incorporation or bylaws that is approved by its shareholders, it is prohibited from engaging in certain\nbusiness combinations with an \"interested shareholder” for three years following the date that such person becomes an interested shareholder. An interested shareholder\ngenerally is a person or a group who or which owns or owned 15% or more of the target’s outstanding voting stock or who or which is an affiliate or associate of the corporation\nand owned 15% or more of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock within the past three years. This has the effect of limiting the ability of a potential acquirer to make a two-\ntiered bid for the target in which all shareholders would not be treated equally. The statute does not apply if, among other things, prior to the date on which such shareholder\nbecomes an interested shareholder, the board of directors approves either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the person becoming an interested\nshareholder. This encourages any potential acquirer of a Delaware corporation to negotiate the terms of any acquisition transaction with the target’s board of directors.\nCayman Islands law has no comparable statute. As a result, we cannot avail ourselves of the types of protections afforded by the Delaware business combination statute.\nHowever, although Cayman Islands law does not regulate transactions between a company and its significant shareholders, it does provide that such transactions must be entered\ninto bona fide in the best interests of the company and for a proper corporate purpose and not with the effect of constituting a fraud on the minority shareholders.\nDissolution; Winding Up\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, unless the board of directors approves the proposal to dissolve, dissolution must be approved by shareholders holding 100% of\nthe total voting power of the corporation. Only if the dissolution is initiated by the board of directors may it be approved by a simple majority of the corporation’s outstanding\nshares. Delaware law allows a Delaware corporation to include in its certificate of incorporation a supermajority voting requirement in connection with dissolutions initiated by the\nboard. Under Cayman Islands law, a company may be wound up by either an order of the courts of the Cayman Islands or by a special resolution of its members or, if the company\nis unable to pay its debts as they fall due, by an ordinary resolution of its members. The court has authority to order winding up in a number of specified circumstances including\nwhere it is, in the opinion of the court, just and equitable to do so.\nUnder the Companies Act of the Cayman Islands and our fifth amended and restated articles of association, our company may be dissolved, liquidated or wound up by a\nspecial resolution of our shareholders, or by an ordinary resolution on the basis that we are unable to pay our debts as they become due. The court has authority to order winding\nup in a number of specified circumstances including where it is, in the opinion of the court, just and equitable to do so.\nVariation of Rights of Shares\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, a corporation may vary the rights of a class of shares with the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares of such class,\nunless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. Under Cayman Islands law and our fifth amended and restated articles of association, if our share capital is divided into\nmore than one class of shares, we may vary the rights attached to any class only with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares\nof that class.\nAmendment of Governing Documents\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, a corporation’s certificate of incorporation may be amended only if adopted and declared advisable by the board of directors\nand approved by a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote, and the bylaws may be amended with the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote\nand may, if so provided in the certificate of incorporation, also be amended by the board of directors. Under Cayman Islands law, our fifth amended and restated memorandum and\narticles of association may only be amended by a special resolution of our shareholders.\n92\nRights of Non-Resident or Foreign Shareholders\nThere are no limitations imposed by our fifth amended and restated memorandum and articles of association on the rights of non-resident or foreign shareholders to hold or\nexercise voting rights on our shares. In addition, there are no provisions in our fifth amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that require our company to\ndisclose shareholder ownership above any particular ownership threshold.\nDirectors’ Power to Issue Shares\nSubject to applicable law, our board of directors is empowered to issue or allot shares or grant options and warrants with or without preferred, deferred, qualified or other\nspecial rights or restrictions.\nC. Material Contracts\nWe have not entered into any material contracts other than in the ordinary course of business and other than those described in \"Item 4. Information on the Company,”\nelsewhere in this annual report or below.\nD. Exchange Controls\nThe Cayman Islands currently has no exchange control regulations or currency restrictions. See \"Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business Overview—Regulation—\nRegulations Relating to Foreign Exchange.”\nE. Taxation\nThe following is a general summary of the material Cayman Islands, People’s Republic of China and U.S. federal income tax consequences relevant to an investment in our\nordinary shares. The discussion is not intended to be, nor should it be construed as, legal or tax advice to any particular prospective purchaser. The discussion is based on\nlaws and relevant interpretations thereof as of the date of this annual report, all of which are subject to change or different interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect. The\ndiscussion does not address U.S. state or local tax laws, or tax laws of jurisdictions other than the Cayman Islands, the People’s Republic of China and the United States. You\nshould consult your own tax advisors with respect to the consequences of acquisition, ownership and disposition of our ordinary shares.\nCayman Islands Taxation\nThe Cayman Islands currently levies no taxes on individuals or corporations based upon profits, income, gains or appreciation and there is no taxation in the nature of\ninheritance tax or estate duty. There are no other taxes likely to be material to us levied by the government of the Cayman Islands except for stamp duties which may be applicable\non instruments executed in, or after execution, brought within the jurisdiction of the Cayman Islands. The Cayman Islands is not party to any double tax treaties that are applicable\nto any payments made to or by our company. There are no exchange control regulations or currency restrictions in the Cayman Islands.\nPayments of dividends and capital in respect of the shares will not be subject to taxation in the Cayman Islands and no withholding will be required on the payment of a\ndividend or capital to any holder of the Shares, nor will gains derived from the disposal of the shares be subject to Cayman Islands income or corporation tax.\n93\nPeople’s Republic of China Taxation\nUnder the Enterprise Income Tax Law and the Regulations on the Implementation of the Enterprise Income Tax Law of the People’s Republic of China, enterprises established\noutside of China but whose \"de facto management body” is located in China are considered \"resident enterprises” for PRC tax purposes. Under the applicable implementation\nregulations, \"de facto management body” is defined as the organizational body that effectively exercises overall management and control over production and business\noperations, personnel, finance and accounting, and properties of the enterprise. Substantially all of our management is currently based in China, and may remain in China in the\nfuture. If we are treated as a \"resident enterprise” for PRC tax purposes, foreign enterprise holders of our ordinary shares may be subject to a 10% PRC income tax upon dividends\npayable by us and on gains realized on their sales or other dispositions of our ordinary shares. See \"Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Doing Business\nin China—Under the PRC enterprise income tax law, we could be classified as a ‘resident enterprise’ of China. Such classification could result in unfavorable tax consequences to\nus and our non-PRC shareholders.” In addition, gains derived by our non-PRC individual shareholders from the sale of our shares may be subject to a 20% PRC withholding tax. It\nis unclear whether our non-PRC individual shareholders (including our ADS holders) would be subject to any PRC tax on dividends obtained by such non-PRC individual\nshareholders in the event we are determined to be a PRC resident enterprise. If any PRC tax were to apply to dividends realized by non-PRC individuals, it would generally apply at\na rate of 20% unless a reduced rate is available under an applicable tax treaty. However, it is unclear either whether our non-PRC shareholders would be able to claim the benefits of\nany tax treaties between their country of tax residence and the PRC in the event that we are treated as a PRC resident enterprise.\nMaterial United States Federal Income Tax Considerations\nThe following summary describes the material U.S. federal income tax consequences generally applicable to U.S. Holders (as defined below) of the ownership of our ordinary\nshares as of the date hereof. Except where noted, this summary deals only with ordinary shares held as capital assets for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As used herein, the term\n\"United States Holder” or \"U.S. Holders” means a beneficial owner of our ordinary share or ADS that is for United States federal income tax purposes:\n● an individual citizen or resident of the United States;\n● a corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof\nor the District of Columbia;\n● an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source; or\n● a trust if it (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more United States persons have the authority to control all substantial\ndecisions of the trust or (2) has a valid election in effect under applicable United States Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person.\nThis summary does not represent a detailed description of all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences, including those that may be applicable to U.S. Holders if you are\nsubject to special treatment under the United States federal income tax laws, such as:\n● a broker-dealer in securities or currencies;\n● a bank or other financial institution;\n● a regulated investment company;\n● a real estate investment trust;\n● an insurance company;\n● a pension plan;\n● a cooperative;\n● a tax-exempt organization (including a private foundation);\n● Certain former U.S. citizens or long-term residents;\n● a person holding our ordinary shares as part of a hedging, integrated or conversion transaction, a constructive or wash sale or a straddle;\n● a dealer or trader in securities that use the mark-to-market method of accounting;\n94\n● a person who owns or is deemed to own 10% or more of our stock (by voter or value);\n● a partnership or other pass-through entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or an investor therein);\n● a person whose \"functional currency” for U.S. federal income tax purposes is not the United States dollar;\n● a person who acquires our ordinary shares through the exercise of an employee share option or otherwise as compensation; or\n● persons holding our ordinary shares in connection with a trade or business, permanent establishment, or fixed place of business outside the United States.\nIn addition, this discussion does not address any state, local, estate, gift, alternative minimum or non-United States tax considerations, special accounting rules under Section\n451(b) of the Code or the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income. Each U.S. Holder is urged to consult its tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal, state, local and non-\nUnited States income and other tax considerations of an investment in our ordinary shares.\nThe discussion below is based upon the provisions of the Code, final, temporary and proposed Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, rulings, administrative\npronouncements and judicial decisions as of the date hereof. Such authorities may be interpreted differently, replaced, revoked or modified, possibly with retroactive effect, so as\nto result in U.S. federal income tax consequences different from those discussed below. No ruling has been sought from the Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, with respect to\nany U.S. federal income tax consequences described below, and there can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will not take a contrary position. In addition, this summary is\nbased, in part, upon representations made by the depositary to us and assumes that the deposit agreement, and all other related agreements, will be performed in accordance with\ntheir terms.\nIf a partnership (or other entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds our ordinary shares, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will\ngenerally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Such partnership or their partners should consult their tax advisors regarding an investment in\nour ordinary shares.\nThis summary does not contain a detailed description of all the United States federal income tax consequences that may be applicable to you in light of your particular\ncircumstances and, except as set forth below with respect to PRC tax considerations, does not address the effects of any state, local or non-United States tax laws. If you are\nconsidering the purchase, ownership or disposition of our ordinary shares, you should consult your own tax advisors concerning the United States federal income tax\nconsequences to you in light of your particular situation as well as any consequences arising under the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction.\nTaxation of Dividends and Other Distributions on our ordinary shares\nSubject to the discussion under \"—Passive Foreign Investment Company” below, the gross amount of any distributions on our ordinary shares (including any amounts\nwithheld to reflect PRC withholding taxes) will be taxable as dividends, to the extent paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under United States\nfederal income tax principles. Such income (including withheld taxes) will be includable in a U.S Holder’s gross income as ordinary income on the day actually or constructively\nreceived by the U.S Holder, in the case of the ordinary shares. Such dividends will not be eligible for the dividends received-deduction allowed to corporations under the Code.\nDividends paid to certain non-corporate United States Holders may be taxable at preferential rates applicable to long-term capital gain if we are treated as a \"qualified foreign\ncorporation,” provided certain holding period requirements are met (as discussed below).A foreign corporation is treated as a qualified foreign corporation with respect to\ndividends received from that corporation on ordinary shares that are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States. Our ordinary shares are listed on the\nNasdaq Capital Market, and thus, pursuant to the United States Treasury Department guidance, our ordinary shares are treated as readily tradable on an established securities\nmarket in the United States. Thus, we believe that dividends we pay on our ordinary shares will meet the conditions required for the reduced tax rate.\n95\nA qualified foreign corporation also includes a foreign corporation that is eligible for the benefits of certain income tax treaties with the United States. In the event that we are\ndeemed to be a PRC resident enterprise under the PRC tax law, we believe that we would be eligible for the benefits of the income tax treaty between the United States and the PRC\n(including any protocol thereunder), or the Treaty, and if we are eligible for such benefits, dividends we pay on our ordinary shares, regardless of whether such shares are readily\ntradable on an established securities market in the United States, would be eligible for the reduced tax rates. For a discussion regarding whether we may be classified as a PRC\nresident enterprise, see \"Item 10. Additional Information—E. Taxation—People’s Republic of China Taxation.”\nEven if dividends we pay on our ordinary shares would be treated as paid by a qualified foreign corporation, non-corporate U.S. Holders will not be eligible for the reduced tax\nrates if they do not hold our ordinary shares for more than 60 days during the 121-day period beginning 60 days before the ex-dividend date or to the extent that such U.S. Holders\nelect to treat the dividend income as \"investment income” under the Code. In addition, the tax rate reduction will not apply if the recipient of a dividend is obligated to make related\npayments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property. This disallowance applies even if the minimum holding period has been met. The U.S Holders should\nconsult their tax advisors regarding the application of these rules in their particular circumstances.\nNon-corporate U.S. Holders will not be eligible for the reduced tax rate on any dividends received from us if we are a PFIC for the taxable year in which such dividends are paid\nor for the preceding taxable year.\nIn the event that we are deemed to be a PRC resident enterprise under the PRC tax law, a U.S. Holder may be subject to PRC withholding taxes on dividends paid to the U.S.\nHolder with respect to our ordinary shares. See \"Item 10. Additional Information—E. Taxation—People’s Republic of China Taxation.” In that case, PRC withholding taxes on\ndividends (limited, in the case of a U.S. holder who qualifies for the benefits of the Treaty, to the extent not exceeding the applicable dividend withholding rate under the Treaty)\ngenerally will be treated as foreign taxes eligible for credit against the U.S. Holder’s United States federal income tax liability. For purposes of calculating the foreign tax credit,\ndividends paid on the ordinary shares will be treated as foreign-source income and generally will constitute passive category income. The rules governing the foreign tax credit are\ncomplex. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of the foreign tax credit under their particular circumstances.\nTo the extent that the amount of any distribution exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits for a taxable year, as determined under United States federal\nincome tax principles, the distribution will first be treated as a tax-free return of capital, causing a reduction in the adjusted basis of the ordinary shares (thereby increasing the\namount of gain, or decreasing the amount of loss, to be recognized by a U.S. Holder on a subsequent disposition of the ordinary shares), and the balance in excess of adjusted\nbasis will be taxed as capital gain recognized on a sale or exchange. However, we do not expect to calculate our earnings and profits in accordance with United States federal\nincome tax principles. Therefore, U.S. Holders should expect that a distribution generally will be treated as a dividend (as discussed above).\nPassive Foreign Investment Company\nIf we are a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. Holder holds our ordinary shares, the U.S. Holder will generally be subject to the special tax rules discussed below,\nregardless of whether we remain a PFIC, except if the U.S. Holder makes a timely mark-to-market election discussed below.\nThese special tax rules generally apply to any \"excess distribution” (generally any distribution paid during a taxable year to a U.S. Holder which is greater than 125% of the\naverage annual distributions paid in the three preceding taxable years or, if shorter, the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the ordinary shares) we make to the U.S. Holder and any\ngain realized from a sale or other disposition of our ordinary shares. Distributions received in a taxable year that are greater than 125% of the average annual distributions received\nduring the shorter of the three preceding taxable years or your holding period for the ordinary shares will be treated as excess distributions. Under these special tax rules:\n● the excess distribution or gain will be allocated ratably over the U.S Holder’s holding period for the ordinary shares,\n● the amount allocated to the current taxable year, and any taxable year prior to the first taxable year in which we were a PFIC with respect to the U.S. Holder (each, a \"pre-\nPFIC year”), will be treated as ordinary income, and\n● the amount allocated to each prior taxable year, other than a pre-PFIC year, will be subject to tax at the highest tax rate in effect for individuals or corporations, as\nappropriate, for that taxable year; and.\n96\n● the interest charge generally applicable to underpayments of tax will be imposed on the resulting tax attributable to each prior taxable year, other than a pre-PFIC year.\nIf we are a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. Holder holds our ordinary shares and any of our non-United States subsidiaries, including our VIEs, is also a PFIC,\nthe U.S. Holder would be treated as owning a proportionate amount (by value) of the shares of the lower-tier PFIC for purposes of the application of these rules. U.S. Holders are\nurged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the PFIC rules to any of our subsidiaries, including our VIEs\nAs an alternative to the excess distribution rules discussed above, a U.S. Holder of \"marketable stock” in a PFIC may make a mark-to-market election with respect to such\nstock. \"Marketable stock” is generally stock that is regularly traded on a qualified exchange.\nIf the U.S. Holder makes an effective mark-to-market election, which is generally effective for the taxable year for which the election is made and all subsequent taxable years,\nthe U.S. Holder will generally (i) include as ordinary income for each taxable year that we are a PFIC the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the ordinary shares held at the end\nof the taxable year over the adjusted tax basis in the ordinary shares, and (ii) deduct as an ordinary loss in each such taxable year the excess, if any, of the adjusted tax basis in the\nordinary shares over their fair market value at the end of the taxable year, but only to the extent of the net amount previously included in income as a result of the mark-to-market\nelection. The U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the ordinary shares would be adjusted to reflect any income or loss resulting from the mark-to-market election. Any gain the U.S.\nHolder recognizes upon the sale or other disposition of its ordinary shares in a year when we are a PFIC will be treated as ordinary income and any loss will be treated as ordinary\nloss, but only to the extent of the net amount previously included in income as a result of the mark-to-market election. If we cease to be a PFIC, the U.S. Holder will not be required\nto take into account the gain or loss described above during any period that we are not a PFIC. Because a mark-to-market election cannot technically be made for any lower-tier\nPFICs that we may own, a U.S. Holder may continue to be subject to the PFIC rules with respect to such U.S. Holder’s indirect interest in any investments held by us that are\ntreated as an equity interest in a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors about the availability of the mark-to-market election,\nand whether making the election would be advisable in their particular circumstances.\nInstead of making a mark-to-market election, a U.S. investor in a PFIC may generally mitigate the adverse consequences of the excess distribution rules described above by\nelecting to treat the PFIC as a \"qualified electing fund” under the Code. However, we do not intend to provide the information necessary for U.S. Holders to make such an election.\nWe expect to file annual reports on Form 20-F with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in which we will indicate whether we believe we were a PFIC for the relevant\ntaxable year. We do not intend to make any other annual determination or otherwise notify U.S. Holders regarding our status as a PFIC for any taxable year. U.S. Holders are urged\nto consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of holding our ordinary shares if we are a PFIC in any taxable year.\nIf a U.S. Holder owns (or is deemed to own) our ordinary shares during any taxable year that we are a PFIC, the U.S. Holder must generally file an annual IRS Form 8621 or\nsuch other form as is required by the United States Treasury Department with respect to us. Taxation of Capital Gains\nFor U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. Holder will generally recognize gain or loss on any sale or exchange of our ordinary shares in an amount equal to the difference\nbetween the amount realized for the ordinary shares and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the ordinary shares. Subject to the discussion under \"—Passive Foreign\nInvestment Company” above, such gain or loss will generally be capital gain or loss. Any capital gain or loss will be long-term if the ordinary shares have been held for more than\none year. The deductibility of capital losses may be subject to limitations.\nAny such gain or loss the U.S. Holder recognizes will generally be treated as United States source income or loss for foreign tax credit limitation purposes, which will generally\nlimit the availability of foreign tax credits. However, if we are treated as a PRC resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes and PRC tax were imposed on any gain, and if the U.S.\nHolder is eligible for the benefits of the Treaty, the U.S. Holder may elect to treat such gain as PRC source gain under the Treaty and, accordingly, the U.S. Holder may be able to\ncredit the PRC tax against the U.S. Holder’s United States federal income tax liability. If the U.S. Holder is not eligible for the benefits of the Treaty or fails to make the election to\ntreat any gain as PRC source, then the U.S. Holder generally would not be able to use the foreign tax credit arising from any PRC tax imposed on the disposition of our ordinary\nshares unless such credit can be applied (subject to applicable limitations) against tax due on other income treated as derived from foreign sources. The U.S. Holder will be eligible\nfor the benefits of the Treaty if, for purposes of the Treaty, the U.S. Holder is a resident of the United States, and the U.S. Holder meets other factual requirements specified in the\nTreaty. Because qualification for the benefits of the Treaty is a fact-intensive inquiry which depends upon the particular circumstances of each investor, U.S. Holders are\nspecifically urged to consult their tax advisors regarding their eligibility for the benefits of the Treaty and the availability of the foreign tax credit and the election to treat any gain\nas PRC source under their particular circumstances.\n97\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nPayments of dividends and sales proceeds that are made within the United States or through certain U.S.-related financial intermediaries generally are subject to information\nreporting, and may be subject to backup withholding, unless (i) the U.S. Holder is a corporation or other exempt recipient or (ii) in the case of backup withholding, the U.S. Holder\nprovides a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that it is not subject to backup withholding.\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a U.S. Holder will be allowed as a credit against the U.S. holder’s U.S.\nfederal income tax liability and may entitle it to a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.\nForeign Asset Reporting\nCertain U.S. Holders who are individuals (and under proposed regulations, certain entities) may be required to report information relating to an interest in our ordinary shares,\nsubject to certain exceptions (including an exception for shares held in accounts maintained by U.S. financial institutions) on IRS Form 8938. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their\ntax advisors regarding their information reporting obligations, if any, with respect to their ownership and disposition of our ordinary shares.\nF. Dividends and Paying Agents\nNot applicable.\nG. Statement by Experts\nNot applicable.\nH. Documents on Display\nWe are subject to periodic reporting and other informational requirements of the Exchange Act as applicable to foreign private issuers. Accordingly, we are required to file\nreports, including annual reports on Form 20-F, and other information with the SEC. As a foreign private issuer, we are exempt from the rules of the Exchange Act prescribing the\nfurnishing and content of proxy statements to shareholders, and our executive officers, directors and principal shareholders are not subject to the insider short-swing profit\ndisclosure and recovery provisions of Section 16 of the Exchange Act.\nAll information that we have filed with the SEC can be accessed through the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. This information can also be inspected and copied at the public\nreference facilities maintained by the SEC at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nFinancial instruments that expose us to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of cash and short-term investment. The maximum amount of loss due to credit risk in the\nevent of other parties failing to perform their obligations is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset as stated in our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe are exposed to various types of market risks, including changes in foreign exchange rates, service prices and inflation in the normal course of business.\nMarket price risk of digital assets\nThe price of Filecoin has experienced significant fluctuations over its existence and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future. The price of Filecoin has likewise\nexperienced significant fluctuation over its existence since we started the Filecoin mining business in December 2022.\nWe expect our results of operations to continue to be affected by the Filecoin price as most of our revenue is from Filecoin mining production as of the date of this report.\nAny future significant reductions in the price of Filecoin will likely have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We cannot assure you\nthat the Filecoin price will remain high enough to sustain our operation or that the Filecoin price will not decline significantly in the future. Furthermore, Filecoin price can have an\nimmediate impact on the trading price of our Ordinary Shares even before our financial performance is affected, if at all. Various factors, mostly beyond our control, could impact\nthe Filecoin price.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nOur contractual agreements are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, which serves as our functional currency for financial reporting. However, we incur certain operational\nexpenses in the local currencies of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including Hong Kong and the PRC. Consequently, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may\nimpact our financial performance. Historically, foreign currency transaction gains and losses have not been material to our financial statements.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are subject to risks resulting from fluctuations in interest rates on our bank balances. To the extent that we may need to raise debt financing in the future, upward\nfluctuations in interest rates would increase the cost of new debt. We do not currently use any derivative instruments to manage our interest rate risk.\nInflation risk\nInflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our services and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results. A high rate of inflation may have an adverse\neffect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues if the selling prices of our services\ndo not increase proportionately with these increased costs.\nITEM 12.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file and\nfurnish under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time period specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that the information required to\nbe disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and\nchief financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nOur management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure and\nprocedures (as defined in Rule 13a 1I) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report, as required by Rule 13a 15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based\nupon that evaluation, our management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, due to the material weakness\nidentified by us, which is described below under \"Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.”\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange\nAct. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial\nstatements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail\naccurately and fairly reflect our transactions; (2) provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations; and (3)\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our\nfinancial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness\nof our internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.\n100\nUnder the supervision of and with the participation of our management, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023,\nusing the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). As part of our\nassessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, management identified the following material weakness:\n● The Company did not adequately design and implement effective controls to ensure a high security of the Company’s hardware cold wallets for cryptocurrency assets.\n● The Company did not adequately design and implement controls over the assessment of the appropriateness of its accounting policies regarding certain cryptocurrency\ntransactions.\n● The Company did not develop a detailed cryptocurrency investment strategy, which had resulted in a lack of specific operational standards for many internal controls\nrelated to crypto assets.\n● The current scale of the Company’s business is relatively small, and the new businesses are still in the early stages. Certain team members of the Company are responsible\nfor multiple functions, including accounting, business development and operations. Some of the holding company’s officers and employees also hold various positions at some of\nthe Company’s subsidiaries.\n● The Company’s financial management function is yet to be improved in various aspects, including but not limited to that: a) our supervision and approval procedures in\nfinancial accounting and financial statement disclosure are not rigorous enough, b) we lack a comprehensive and effective internal audit system, and c) we do not have sufficient\nnumber of skilled financial and accounting personnel and have yet to provide periodic professional and business training to our current financial personnel.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material\nmisstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nThis material weakness did not result in any identified material misstatements to the financial statements, but resulted in revision of previously issued financial statements.\nBased on this material weaknesses, management concluded that at December 31, 2023, internal control over financial reporting was not effective.\nRemediation\nOur Board of Directors, Audit Committee and management take internal control over financial reporting and the integrity of our financial statements seriously.\nOur management is responsible for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting and is committed to improving its controls related to the\nmaterial weaknesses described above, such that these controls are designed, implemented, and operating effectively.\nFollowing the identification of this material weakness described above, our management commenced implementation of a remediation plan. The remediation plan includes the\nfollowing steps to improve our internal control over financial reporting:\n● We are engaging a third-party specialist to assist our management to assess the appropriateness of its accounting policies regarding certain key business transactions to\naddress significant risks.\n● We are taking some improvements to strengthen our internal control over the asset management.\n● We are providing additional appropriate U.S. GAAP accounting and financial reporting training for financial reporting and accounting personnel, especially training related\nto accounting policies and accounting estimates applicable to cryptocurrency business.\n● We will further promote the independence of each business entity and function to improve the internal control system of the Group’s business structure. With the\ndevelopment of our business, we will continuously improve the organizational structure, enhance the functions of various departments, expand the workforce, and on this basis,\nimprove the various internal control systems and processes of the Company.\n101\n● We will add an accounting manager in 2024, responsible for supervising accounting work, reviewing financial accounting content, and specifically responsible for preparing\nthe Company’s financial statements, as well as assisting the CFO in the disclosure of financial reports. With the continuous expansion of the Company’s future business scale, we\nmay recruit more financial personnel to meet more accounting and financial management needs.\n● As the Company’s business develops, we will fill the role of the internal audit manager. The internal audit manager will be responsible for regularly evaluating the integrity of\nthe Company’s internal controls, supervising the effective implementation of internal control systems, and reporting directly to the Audit Committee.\nWhile we intend to fully address the material weakness and significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting by the end of 2024, the foregoing remediation\nmeasures may not be sufficient and we may need to implement additional measures and enhance their implementation. We are not able to estimate with reasonable certainty the\ncosts that we will need to incur to implement these and other measures designed to improve our internal control over financial reporting. The process of designing and\nimplementing an effective financial reporting system is a continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in our business and the economic and regulatory\nenvironments and to expend significant resources to maintain a financial reporting system that is adequate to satisfy our reporting obligations. See \"Item 3. Key Information—D.\nRisk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry — We have failed to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may be unable to\naccurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, and investor confidence and the market price of our shares may be adversely impacted.”\nAttestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm\nThis annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting, because we are neither a\n\"large accelerated filer” nor an \"accelerated filer” as such terms are defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have established our U.S. subsidiary Mercurity Fintech Technology Holding Inc. as one of our main business entities. Our business and management have undergone\nsignificant changes and are distributed in different regions such as New York, Hong Kong, and Shenzhen. We have designed and implemented new internal control processes and\nsystems based on changes in the Company’s business and personnel. Except for the material weakness identified as of December 31, 2023, the remedial measures and except for the\nchanges described above, there have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that\noccurred during the period covered by this annual report on Form 20-F that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control\nover financial reporting.\nITEM 16.

MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURE\nNot applicable.\nITEM 16I. DISCLOSURE REGARDING FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS THAT PREVENT INSPECTIONS\nIn July 2022, we were conclusively listed by the SEC as an SEC-Identified Issuer under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act following the filing of our annual\nreport on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. Our auditor Shanghai Perfect C.P.A. Partnership, a registered public accounting firm that the PCAOB was unable\nto inspect or investigate completely in 2021, issued the audit report for us for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021.\nAs of the date of this annual report and to the best of our knowledge, we note that:\n1. On December 15, 2022, the PCAOB issued a report that vacated its December 16, 2021 determination and removed the mainland of China and Hong Kong from the list\nof jurisdictions where it is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms. In addition, on January 27, 2023, we dismissed Shanghai\nPerfect C.P.A. Partnership as our independent registered public accounting firm. Effective from January 27, 2023, we appointed Onestop Assurance PAC, or Onestop,\nas our new independent registered public accounting firm. Onestop is an independent public accounting firm headquartered in Singapore and registered with the\nPCAOB and is subject to U.S. laws pursuant to which the PCAOB conducts regular inspections to assess its compliance with the applicable professional standards.\nOur auditor Onestop is subject to inspection by the PCAOB, the most recent inspection was in 2023. For these reasons, we do not expect to be identified as an SEC-\nIdentified Issuer under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act for future filings of our annual report on Form 20-F.\n2. No governmental entities in the PRC, the Cayman Islands, the British Virgin Islands, Hong Kong, Singapore or the United States owns any shares of our Company or\nany of our operating entities;\n3.

Please refer to Exhibit 11.2 of this Annual Report.\nITEM 16K. CYBERSECURITY\nWe understand the critical necessity of establishing robust cybersecurity measures to protect our information systems and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and\navailability of our data. Our company has put in place policies and procedures to assess, identify, and manage cybersecurity risks effectively. We regularly evaluate potential\nthreats to our information systems and conduct both scheduled and spontaneous assessments to identify vulnerabilities. Based on these assessments, we determine the need to\nenhance or adjust our safeguards to mitigate risks and address any existing gaps. The responsibility for overseeing this risk assessment and mitigation process lies with our IT\nleadership, who reports directly to our CEO.\nTo ensure the effectiveness of our safeguards, we continuously monitor and test them, while also providing training to our employees in collaboration with HR, IT, and\nmanagement, fostering a company-wide culture of cybersecurity risk management. During the financial year ended December 31, 2023, we did not encounter any risks from\ncybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company,\nincluding our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.\nOur board of directors holds the responsibility for monitoring and evaluating strategic risk exposure, including cybersecurity risks. They oversee this function both\ncollectively and through the audit committee. Additionally, our executive management team regularly updates the Audit Committee on cybersecurity risks, with at least an annual\nfrequency. Our cybersecurity coordinator, working closely with the IT team, assesses and manages cybersecurity risks, reporting directly to the CEO. This ensures that senior\nmanagement remains well-informed about our cybersecurity posture and any potential risks facing the company.\n105\nPART III\nITEM 17.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material\nrespects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in period ended\nDecember 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nRestatement of 2021 and 2022 Financial Statements\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the 2021 and 2022 financial statements have been restated to correct certain misstatements.\nGoing Concern Uncertainty\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the\nCompany has incurred recurring operating losses and negative cash flows from operating activities and has an accumulated deficit, which raise substantial doubt about its ability\nto continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might\nresult from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our\naudit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect\nto the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about\nwhether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of\nits internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of\nexpressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included\nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe\nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be\ncommunicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as\na whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which they\nrelate.\nGoing Concern\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company has incurred recurring operating losses of $9.4 million and negative cash flows from operating activities of $2.8 million and has an accumulated\ndeficit of $677 million, which raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management plans to expand business and financial consultation services,\nfinancial advisory services and brokerage services and distributed storage and computing services.\nWe determined that Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is a critical matter due to the estimation and uncertainty regarding the risk of bias in management’s\njudgement and assumptions in their determination.\nOur principal audit procedures relating to the going concern:\n● Obtaining an understanding, and evaluating management’s assessment on whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to\ncontinue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time;\n● Assessing the management’s plans and obtaining sufficient appropriate audit evidence to determine whether or not substantial doubt can be alleviated or still exists;\n● Review the relevant disclosures to the consolidated financial statements.\nImpairment of Intangible Assets\nAs noted in Note 10 of the financial statements, the Company has recorded its digital currencies as intangible assets, with a carrying amount of $0.7 million. As of December 31,\n2023, the Company has impaired its intangible assets by $4.2 million, which includes an impairment loss of $3.9 million incurred on December 31, 2023, for Bitcoin and USDC, both\nof which the Company no longer controls. The Company estimated the fair values of the Filecoin based on the intraday low prices daily and recognized an impairment loss of $0.3\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe principal consideration for our determination that auditing impairment of intangible assets is a critical audit matter is due to the degree of complexity and judgment used by\nmanagement in developing the fair value measurement, which led to a high degree of audit judgment and subjectivity and significant effort in performing procedures relating to fair\nvalue measurement. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements. These procedures included (1) reviewing procedures of management’s impairment assessment, (2) evaluating the reasonableness of the valuation\nmethodology used by management and (3) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used by the management.\nLegal Proceeding of Intangible Assets Stored in the Out-of -control Cold Wallets\nAs disclosed in Note 10 of the financial statements, the book value of Bitcoins and USD Coins stored in the Company’s out-of-control wallets as of December 31, 2023, which\ntotaled $3.9 million, has been fully impaired. This is due to significant uncertainty regarding the recovery of these assets. As of the date of this report, the recovery proceedings\nhave not yet concluded and the digital assets are held temporarily by the Public Security Bureau.\nWe determined that the legal proceeding is a critical audit matter as there was significant judgment made by management when assessing the likelihood of a loss being incurred\nand when estimating the loss or range of loss for each claim, which in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating\nmanagement’s assessment of the liabilities and disclosures related to legal proceedings contingencies.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.\nThese procedures included (1) obtaining and evaluating the legal opinion provided by external legal counsel；(2) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assessment\nregarding whether an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible or probable and reasonably estimable; (3) evaluating the sufficiency of the Company’s disclosures related to\nlegal proceedings.\n/s/ Onestop Assurance PAC\nWe have

ORGANIZATION AND PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES\nMercurity Fintech Holding Inc. (the \"Company”), was incorporated in Cayman Islands on July 13, 2011. On December 28, 2016, the Company changed its name from Wowo\nLimited to JMU Limited. On April 30, 2020, the Company changed its name from JMU Limited to Mercurity Fintech Holding Inc., The Company completed its initial public offering\n(\"IPO”) on NASDAQ on April 8, 2015.\nPrior to March 1, 2020, the Company and its subsidiaries, variable interest entities (\"VIEs”) and VIEs’ subsidiaries were primarily engaged in the sale of rice, flavor, bean oil,\nseafood, wine and some other types of generic food and beverage products through its website www.ccjoin.com though operating a business-to-business (\"B2B”) online e-\ncommerce platform that provides integrated services to suppliers and consumers in the catering industry in the People’s Republic of China (\"PRC”).\nOn May 21, 2019, the Company acquired Unicorn Investment Limited (\"Unicorn”) and its subsidiaries and a VIE (\"the Acquisition of Unicorn”). Pursuant to a share\npurchase agreement, the Company purchased all the issued and outstanding shares of Unicorn from its shareholder for the consideration of 632,660,858 newly issued ordinary\nshares of the Company. On that date, Unicorn, a developer of asset transaction platform products based on blockchain technologies, became a wholly owned subsidiary of the\nCompany. On December 28, 2020, Unicorn changed its name from Unicorn Investment Limited to Mercurity Limited.\nOn July 22, 2019, the Company sold all of its equity interests in New Admiral Limited, a subsidiary of the Company, together with all of its subsidiaries and consolidated\nVIEs and their respective subsidiaries (collectively, the \"Food Supply Chain Entities”), which were engaged in the Company’s food supply chain business. The sale was pursuant\nto a definitive agreement entered into between the Company and Marvel Billion Development Limited, company with limited liability incorporated under the laws of Hong Kong\n(the \"Buyer”), in exchange for the Buyer’s payment of $1,000,000 and the assumption of $4,521,053 of net liabilities of the Food Supply Chain Entities. This disposal represents a\nstrategic shift and has a major effect on the Company’s results of operations. Accordingly, assets and liabilities, Revenue and expenses, and cash flows related to the Food Supply\nChain Entities have been reclassified in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods presented.\nOn March 1, 2020, the Company acquired NBpay Investment Limited (\"NBpay”) and its subsidiaries and a VIE (\"the Acquisition of NBpay”). Pursuant to a share purchase\nagreement, the Company purchased all the issued and outstanding shares of Unicorn from its shareholder for the consideration of 761,789,601 newly issued ordinary shares of the\nCompany. On that date, NBpay, a developer of asset transaction platform products based on blockchain technologies, became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.\nAfter the Acquisition of Unicorn and the Acquisition of NBpay, blockchain technical services became the principal business of the Company, which to design and develop\ndigital asset transaction platforms based on blockchain technologies for customers to facilitate asset trading, asset digitalization and cross-border payments and provide\nsupplemental services for such platforms, such as customized software development services, maintenance services and compliance support services.\nIn August 2021, the board and the management of the Company changed and the future business plan was recalibrated. The Company added cryptocurrency mining as one\nof the main businesses going forward. The Company entered into cryptocurrency mining pools by executing a business contract with a collective mining service provider on\nOctober 22, 2021 to provide computing power to the mining pool and derived USD$664,307 related revenue in 2021 and USD$783,089 related revenue in the first half of 2022.\nDue to the extremely adverse regulatory measures taken by the Chinese government in 2021 in the field of digital currency production and transaction, the Company’s\nboard of Directors decided on December 10, 2021 to divest the Chinese companies of the related business controlled through VIE agreements, and the divestiture was completed\non January 15, 2022.\nIn July 2022, we added consultation services to our business, providing business consultation services to global corporate clients, especially those in the blockchain\nindustry. Meanwhile, we conducted viability studies about the business models, license requirements and operational costs of online and traditional brokerage services and digital\npayment business and have been expanding our business into the brokerage services, such as building up client base and acquiring the necessary licenses. However, due to\nresource restraints, we have ceased our development plans in digital payment business, including digital payment services and solution consulting, and applications for the\nrequired money transmit licenses since March 2024.\nF-13\nIn July 2022, we incorporated Mercurity Fintech Technology Holding Inc. (\"MFH Tech”) to develop Distributed storage and computing services (including cryptocurrency\nmining and providing cloud storage services for decentralized platform operators), and business and financial consultation services.\nOn August 23, 2022, MFH Tech signed a Consulting Agreement with a Chinese media company, pursuant to which MFH Tech will serve as a business consultant in order\nto facilitate the client to establish the entity in the United States and make financing strategy, and the agreed amount of the immutable consideration portion of the agreement is\n$160,000. We recognized consultation services revenue of $80,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022 based on the percentage-of-completion.\nOn December 15, 2022, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Huangtong International Co., Ltd., providing for the acquisition and purchase of Web3\ndecentralized storage infrastructure, including cryptocurrency mining servers, cables, and other electronic devices, for an aggregate consideration of USD$5,980,000, payable in our\nordinary shares. The investment was made with the aim to own mining machines capable of gathering, processing, and storing vast amounts of data, to advance the\ncryptocurrency mining business, and to advance the Web3 framework. Starting on December 20, 2022, we use some of the storage capacity of these devices for Filecoin mining\nbusiness, and other storage capacity will be used to provide cloud storage services to distributed application product operators. In January 2023, we transferred all of the Web3\ndecentralized storage infrastructure to our US subsidiary MFH Tech, which serves as the operating entity for our business of Filecoin mining and cloud storage services for\ndecentralized platform operators. For the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2023, we earned $348 and $ $285,928 respectively in Filecoin mining revenue from physical mining\noperations, and did not receive any revenue from providing cloud storage services to decentralized platform operators.\nOn January 10, 2023, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Jinhe Capital Limited, providing for the purchase of 5,000 Antminer S19 PRO Bitcoin mining\nmachines, for an aggregate consideration of $9 million.\nOn January 28, 2023, we decided to write off NBpay Investment Limited and its subsidiaries, which had no meaningful assets or business nor employees.\nOn April 12, 2023, we completed the incorporation of another U.S. subsidiary, Chaince Securities, Inc. (\"Chaince Securities”), which plans to develop financial advisory\nservices, online and traditional brokerage services independently in the future. On May 3, 2023, Chaince Securities entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement for the acquisition\nof all assets and liabilities of J.V. Delaney & Associates, an investment advisory firm and FINRA licensed broker dealer.\nFrom April to June 2023, our management reassessed the potential adverse effects of changes in the Company’s business environment, and readjusted the Company’s\nbusiness structure and the future development plan.\nConsidering the increasing difficulty of mining in the crypto mining industry and the general losses by top crypto mining enterprises, we have decided to reduce the scale\nof procurement of Bitcoin miners and reduce the Company’s investment in the crypto mining field. As such, the Company and Jinhe Capital Limited entered into an amendment (the\n\"Amendment”) to the S19 Pro Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which the parties agreed to reduce the purchase order to no more than 2,000 Bitcoin miners for a total amount of no\nmore than $3.6 million.\nAlso considering the enormous uncertainty brought by the cryptocurrency market turmoil in the past two years to the blockchain industry, as well as the regulatory\nuncertainties, although we have the ability to quickly reorganize the blockchain technical service team, we have still decided not to continue conducting blockchain technology\nservice business related to the asset trading platform, asset digitalization platform and decentralized finance (DeFi) platform.\nAs of June 30, 2023, all the agreed services under the consulting agreement with the Chinese media signed on August 23, 2022 had been completed, and the Company\nrecognized consultation services revenue of $80,000 for the first half of 2023 based on the percentage-of-completion.\nOn August 1, 2023, the Company signed a supplementary comprehensive service agreement with the Chinese media company. The Company will continue to assist the\nclient in providing management consulting services and introducing professional service agency resources. The Company expects to receive no less than $150,000 in revenue from\nthis new agreement within the next year.\nOn November 1, 2023, the Company signed a financial consulting agreement with an American logistics company. The Company will serve as a business consultant in order\nto facilitate introductions between the Company’s clients and esteemed third-party audit firms, legal representatives, and underwriting entities that are crucial for the clients’\nfundraising endeavors within the U.S. capital market. The Company expects to receive $50,000 in revenue from this agreement within the next year.\nF-14\nOn December 5, 2023, the Company signed an Origin Storage Filecoin Mining Service Contract with Origin Storage PTE. LTD. (\"Origin Storage”). The Company will use\nOrigin Storage’s technology to re package the Web3 decentralized storage infrastructure and conduct Filecoin mining business through Origin Storage’s network platform. The\nFilecoin mining services provided by Origin Storage include but are not limited to storage server services, computing encapsulation server services, and technical services.\nThrough Origin Storage’s new technology in the cryptocurrency mining field, the Company is expected to significantly improve the output efficiency of the cryptocurrency mining\nbusiness, thereby generating more revenue.\nOn March 7, 2024, considering the many uncertainties in the relevant industry, the Company decided to temporarily abandon its development plan related to digital\npayment solutions, as well as the application for the MSB (Money Service Business) license.\nAfter the adjustment of our business strategies, the focuses of our respective operating subsidiaries are as follows: (i) MFH Tech acting as the operating entity of\ndistributed storage and computing services and business and business consultation services in North America; (ii) after completing the acquisition of all assets and liabilities of\nJ.V. Delaney & Associates with FINRA approval, Chaince Securities to operate our financial advisory services, online and traditional brokerage services in North America; and (iii)\nUcon and Lianji Future acting as the operating entities of the business consultation services in the Asia-Pacific region.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company’s subsidiaries are as follows:\nDate of Place of Percentage\nacquisition/ establishment/ of legal\nregistration incorporation ownership\nSubsidiaries:\nMercurity Fintech Technology Holding Inc.

RECLASSIFICATION AND RESTATEMENT OF PREVIOUSLY ISSUED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nReclassification of the cash flows from selling digital assets in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the previous years.\nIn the previously issued consolidated statement of cash flow, we inappropriately classified the cash received from selling digital assets as cash flows generated from operating\nactivities, as we did not distinguish in detail our intention to hold different digital assets, and therefore broadly classified the cash flows generated from digital asset transactions\nas cash flows generated from operating activities. From a specific perspective, the digital assets we previously sold belong to general investment digital assets, and the cash flow\ngenerated from this transaction is more appropriately classified as cash flow generated from investment activities. We have reclassified the cash flows from selling digital assets in\nthe revised consolidated statements of cash flows.\nThe following tables present the effects of correcting these changes on the Company’s financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022\nAs previously\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows reported Adjustment As restated\nAdjustments to reconcile net (loss)/income to net cash used in operating activities:\nDisposal of digital assets 998,902 (998,902) —\nLoss from disposal of intangible assets — 29,968 29,968\nNet cash (used in)/provided by continuing operations (582,423) (968,934) (1,551,357)\nNet cash (used in)/provided by operations activities (582,423) (968,934) (1,551,357)\nCash flows from investing activities:\nDisposal of digital assets — 968,934 968,934\nNet cash (used in)/provided by continuing operations (32,222) 968,934 936,712\nNet cash (used in)/provided by investing activities (32,222) 968,934 936,712\nF-15\nRestatement of the number of ordinary shares amounts in consolidated statements of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity to retroactively present our 1-for-400 share\nconsolidation in February 2023 back to the earliest period presented as stipulated in SAB 4C.\nOn December 29, 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the proposal on the share consolidation to the authorized share capital (the \"Share Consolidation”) at a ratio of\nfour hundred (400)-for-one (1) with the par value of each ordinary share changed to US$0.004 per ordinary share, which has been effective on February 28, 2023.\nAs SAB 4C, changes to a stock dividend, stock split or reverse split in the capital structure must be given retroactive effect in the balance sheet. An appropriately cross-referenced\nnote should disclose the retroactive treatment, explain the change made and state the date the change became effective.\nWe have revised the number of ordinary shares amounts in the revised consolidated statements of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity for the year ended December 31, 2022 and\n2021, to retroactively present our 1-for-400 share consolidation in February 2023 back to the earliest period presented as stipulated in SAB 4C.\nCorrection of the impact of the disposal of subsidiaries on cumulative other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity for the year\nended December 31, 2022.\nIn the previously issued Consolidated Statements of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity for the year ended December 31, 2022, we did not accurately separately disclose the impact\nof selling subsidiaries on cumulative other comprehensive loss. Therefore, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, we have made corrections to this. Please see Page 7, the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations, and Page F-9, the Company’s Consolidated\nStatements of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nGoing concern\nThe Company had an accumulated deficit of approximately $677 million as of December 31, 2023, and had a net loss of approximately $9.4 million and negative cash flows from\noperating activities of approximately $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. In connection with the Company’s assessment of going concern considerations in\naccordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board’s Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU”) 2014-15. \"Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a\nGoing Concern”, the Company has incurred recurring operating losses and negative cash flows from operating activities and has an accumulated deficit, management has\ndetermined that these conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.\nWith the restructuring of the board and management in the second half of 2022, the Company secured new financing and clarified new business plans. The Company received\n$3.15 million, $5 million and $5 million from three PIPEs in November 2022, December 2022 and January 2023 and then received $9 million from an unsecured convertible promissory\nnote issued on February 2023. In the first half of 2023, the Company further adjusted and optimized its business structure. The Company decided to reduce the scale of high-risk\ncryptocurrency related businesses and sought to make good progress in new business areas. In December 2023, the Company received $6 million from another PIPE.\nThe current and anticipated future businesses of the Company include:\n1) Business and financial consultation services: We provide comprehensive business and financial consulting services and industry resource support to global corporate clients\nbased on the resource advantages we have accumulated over the years. From August 2022 to the end of 2023, we have signed two clients and generated accumulated revenue\nof $240,000. We are establishing business and financial consulting service teams in New York, Shenzhen, and Hong Kong to seek more clients, and we expect to generate more\nrelated revenue in 2024.\n2) Financial advisory services and Brokerage services: a) Financial advisory services, focus on providing comprehensive professional services to corporate clients in emerging\ncountries and regions planning to enter the US capital markets, such as helping the clients improve operations and compliance, achieving market entry and expansion,\nintroducing and coordinating professional service institutions, and providing capital operation plans, private equity financing services, investment consulting services, and\nmergers and acquisitions services. b) Brokerage services, including securities underwriting, securities brokerage, asset management, etc. It should be emphasized that our\nfinancial advisory services businesses (excluding business consultation services such as introducing professional service institutions to the clients who want to become\npublicly traded in the United States, and helping them coordinate the progress of each professional service institution’s work.) and brokerage services (securities underwriting\nand other brokerage services) can only be carried out after we have completed the acquisition of J.V. Delaney & Associates and obtained the financial license required for\nbrokerage services business. In August 2023, we entered the Continued Membership Application process with FINRA. Ideally, we anticipate receiving approval in the first\nhalf of 2024.\nF-16\n3) Distributed storage and computing services, including cryptocurrency mining and cloud storage services for other decentralized platform operators. In December 2022, the\nCompany purchased a series of Web3 decentralized storage infrastructure, including cryptocurrency mining servers, cables, and other electronic devices, for an aggregate\nconsideration of USD$5,980,000, payable in our ordinary shares, and the assets is expected to achieve a maximum storage capacity of approximately 100PiB. We have used a\nportion of the storage capacity for the Filecoin mining business and have generated accumulated revenue of $286,276. Due to insufficient utilization of the Web3 decentralized\nstorage infrastructure, we incurred significant losses in our Filecoin mining business in 2023. While in December 2023, the Company began adopting new technologies to carry\nout Filecoin mining business, and it is expected that the mining output efficiency of Filecoin will be significantly improved in 2024.\nAlthough the Company did not achieve ideal results in 2023, the management believes that the Company is about to embark on a period of improvement. As a result, the\nconsolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not reflect\nany adjustments relating to the recoverability and reclassification of assets and liabilities as that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.\nBasis of presentation and use of estimates\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"U.S. GAAP”).\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and the reported amounts of Revenue and expenses during the reporting periods.\nSignificant estimates and assumptions reflected in the Group’s consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, allowance for credit losses, useful lives of property\nand equipment and intangible assets, impairment of long-lived assets, long-term investments and goodwill, the valuation of cryptocurrencies, realization of deferred tax assets,\nuncertain income tax positions, share-based compensation, valuation of contingent consideration from business combination and purchase price allocation for business\ncombinations and assets acquisition. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.\nPrinciple of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group include the financial statements of the Company, its subsidiaries and VIEs in which it has a controlling financial interest. The\nresults of the subsidiaries and VIEs are consolidated from the date on which the Group obtained control and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases. A\ncontrolling financial interest is typically determined when a company holds a majority of the voting equity interest in an entity. Furthermore, if the Company demonstrates that it\nhas ability to control the VIEs through its rights to all the residual benefits of the VIEs and its obligation to fund losses of the VIEs then the entity is consolidated. All significant\nintercompany balances and transactions among the Company, its subsidiaries and VIEs have been eliminated on consolidation.\nReclassification\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on net earnings and financial position.\nBusiness combinations\nThe Group accounts for its business combinations using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805 (\"ASC 805”), \"Business Combinations”. The purchase\nmethod of accounting requires that the consideration transferred to be allocated to the assets, including separately identifiable assets and liabilities the Group acquired, based on\ntheir estimated fair values. The consideration transferred in an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the fair values at the date of exchange of the assets given, liabilities\nincurred, and equity instruments issued as well as the contingent considerations and all contractual contingencies as of the acquisition date. Contingent consideration is\nrecognized at its fair value on the acquisition date. A liability resulting from contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value as of each reporting date until the contingency is\nresolved, and subsequent changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. The costs directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets, liabilities\nand contingent liabilities acquired or assumed are measured separately at their fair value as of the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interests. The\nexcess of (i) the total of cost of acquisition, fair value of the non-controlling interests and acquisition date fair value of any previously held equity interest in the acquiree over, (ii)\nthe fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquiree, is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired,\nthe difference is recognized directly in earnings.\nF-17\nIf investment involves the acquisition of an asset or group of assets that does not meet the definition of a business, the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition. An\nasset acquisition is recorded at cost, which includes capitalized transaction costs, and does not result in the recognition of goodwill. The cost of the acquisition is allocated to the\nassets acquired on the basis of relative fair values.\nDiscontinued operations\nA disposal of a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity shall be reported in discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has (or\nwill have) a major effect on an entity’s operations. Classification as a discontinued operation occurs upon disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held\nfor sale, if earlier. Where an operation is classified as discontinued, a single amount is presented on the face of the consolidated statements of operations. The amount of total\ncurrent assets, total non-current assets, total current liabilities and total noncurrent liabilities are presented separately on the consolidated balance sheets.\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and\nliabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of Revenue and expenses during the\nperiod. Areas where management uses subjective judgment include, but are not limited to, provision for other receivables, estimating useful lives and impairment for intangible\nassets, impairment of goodwill, valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and share-based compensation. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates.\nActual results could differ from those estimates, and as such, differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements.\nForeign currency\nThe functional and reporting currency of the Company is the United States dollar (\"U.S. dollars”, \"US$” or \"$”). The functional currency of the Company’s subsidiary, Mercurity\nLimited, is U.S. dollars. The functional currency of the Company’s HK subsidiaries, Ucon, is the United States dollar (\"U.S. dollars”, \"US$” or \"$”). The functional currency of\nNBPay Investment limited is the United States dollar (\"U.S. dollars”, \"US$” or \"$”). The functional currency of NBPay Fintech Pte Ltd is the United States dollar (\"U.S. dollars”,\n\"US$” or \"$”). The financial records of the Group’s subsidiary and VIE located in the PRC are maintained in their local currencies, the Renminbi (\"RMB”), respectively, which are\nalso the functional currencies of these entities.\nTransactions denominated in currencies other than the respective entities’ functional currencies are re-measured into the functional currencies, in accordance with Accounting\nStandards Codification (\"ASC”) 830 (\"ASC 830”) Foreign Currency Matters, at the exchange rates prevailing on the transaction dates. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated\nin foreign currencies are re-measured into the functional currencies at the exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. All foreign exchange gains or losses are included in\nthe consolidated statements of operations.\nAssets and liabilities are translated to the reporting currency at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date, equity accounts are translated at historical exchange rates and\nRevenue, expenses, gains and losses are translated using the average rate for the year. Translation adjustments are reported as cumulative translation adjustments and are shown\nas a separate component of consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions which are unrestricted as to withdrawal and use and\nhave original maturities less than three months.\nF-18\nSecurity Deposit\nSecurity deposit is money that is given to a landlord, lender, or seller of a home or apartment as proof of intent to move in and care for the domicile.\nThe security deposits of the Company on the balance sheet for the year ended December 31, 2022 are the frozen funds deposited in the Company’s bank account in accordance\nwith the office rental contract, including $33,909 which can be lifted within one year and $57,300 which can be lifted in the second and third years.\nShort-term Investment\nShort-term investment represents certificates of deposits and fixed coupon notes with original maturities of greater than three months but less than a year, as well as stocks and\nETFs held in the short term and readily available for sale.\nAccounts receivable, net of allowance\nSince January 1, 2020, the company adopted the new Current Expected Credit loss rule (\"CECL” standard) and recognizes its estimate of expected credit losses as an allowance to\nits account receivable.\nThe Company adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2020, with no material impact on its consolidated financial statements. The Company maintains the allowance for\nestimated losses resulting from the inability of the Company’s customers to make required payments. The allowance represents the current estimate of lifetime expected credit\nlosses over the remaining duration of existing accounts receivable considering current market conditions and supportable forecasts when appropriate. The estimate is a result of\nthe Company’s ongoing evaluation of collectability, customer creditworthiness, historical levels of credit losses, and future expectations. Changes in the allowance for credit\nlosses are recognized in general and administrative expenses. Accounts receivable are written-off against the allowance for credit losses when management deems the accounts are\nno longer collectible.\nAllowance for credit losses related to the Company’s accounts receivable was $1,147,131 as of December 31, 2021. Due to the changes of the company’s management and business\nteam in the second half of 2021, the Company failed to collect the blockchain technical services receivable $1,092,208 from BGA FOUNDATION LTD and $54,923 from Beijing Qichi\nTrading Ltd. in a timely manner. At the end of 2021, the Company made provision for doubtful accounts. Meanwhile, the company is also taking legal action to recover the money.\nProperty and equipment, net\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows:\nCategory Estimated Useful Life Estimated Residual\nMachinery and equipment 6 years 10%\nElectronics and office equipment 5 years 5%\nRepair and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred, whereas the cost of renewals and betterment that extend the useful lives of property and equipment are\ncapitalized as additions to the related assets. Retirements, sales and disposals of assets are recorded by removing the cost and accumulated depreciation from the asset and\naccumulated depreciation accounts with any resulting gain or loss reflected in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.\nIntangible Assets\nWe classify the cryptocurrencies the Company hold as indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nIntangible assets with indefinite useful life are not amortized and are tested for impairment annually or more frequently, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they\nmight be impaired in accordance with ASC Subtopic 350-30, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other: General Intangibles Other than Goodwill (\"ASC 350-30”).\nThe intangible assets of the Company are cryptocurrencies which are measured at cost less impairment. The cryptocurrencies received from cryptocurrency mining operations\nrecognize the cost of intangible assets based on the market price at the time of acquisition.\nF-19\nDue to the price crash of Bitcoin in 2022, the Company, out of caution, decided to change the impairment test method of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies from testing once or\ntwice a year by calculating the fair value based on the average daily closing price of the past 12 months to testing every day by calculating the fair value based on the intraday low\nprice. ASC 350-30-35-18 and ASC 350-30-35-19 call for us to consider all circumstances that could lead to impairment of the intangible assets, take a more cautious method to test\nwhether impairment of the intangible assets is likely to occur, and test more frequently. The intraday low price of cryptocurrencies to be utilized in calculating impairment of our\ncryptocurrencies held as that metric is the most accurate indicator of whether it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired.\nWe estimated the fair values of the Filecoins based on the intraday low price of the Coinbase platform every day, and we recognized $303,276 impairment loss of intangible assets\nfor the year ended December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has not made positive progress in recovering its crypto assets out of control. Although it is\nconsidered inappropriate from a legal perspective for the Sheyang County Public Security Bureau to implement seizure procedures on the Company’s crypto assets, the Company\nstill cannot estimate the time it may take to recover those crypto assets. Therefore, the Company has decided to make a provision for impairment of all the crypto assets out of\ncontrol, to eliminate the potential significant uncertainty on the financial statements. The amount of the impairment of the crypto assets out of control (all of the Company’s\nBitcoins and USD Coins) for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $3,944,809.\nWe estimated the fair values of the cryptocurrencies based on the intraday low price of the Feixiaohao platform every day, and we recognized $3,144,053 impairment loss of\nintangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2022. As of April 25, 2023, we had not been able to communicate effectively with the Sheyang County Public Security Bureau.\nThe Sheyang County Public Security Bureau did not provide a written response to the appeal materials submitted by the Company in accordance with regulations. We had not\nbeen informed of any information that may prevent the Company from recovering these crypto assets out of control. Therefore, in our consolidated financial statements as of\nDecember 31, 2022, we did not recognize any impairment losses related to the loss of control over these crypto assets.\nWe recognized $1,292,568 impairment loss of intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2021 in the consolidated financial statements.\nImpairment of goodwill\nThe Company annually, or more frequently if the Company believes indicators of impairment exist, reviews the carrying value of goodwill to determine whether impairment may\nexist.\nSpecifically, goodwill impairment is determined using a two-step process. The first step compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If\nthe fair value of each reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step will not be required. If the carrying amount of a\nreporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step compares the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit’s goodwill to the carrying value of that goodwill. The implied fair\nvalue of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to accounting for a business combination with the allocation of the assessed fair value determined in the first step to the assets\nand liabilities of the reporting unit. The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to the assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. An\nimpairment loss is recognized for any excess in the carrying value of goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill. Estimating fair value is performed by utilizing various\nvaluation techniques, with the primary technique being a discounted cash flow.\nThe Company has determined to perform the annual impairment tests on December 31 of each year. All of the $8,107,014 goodwill as of December 31, 2020 was attributable to the\nacquisition of Mercurity Limited and NBPay business. Because the entire business team and core technology of Mercurity Limited and NBPay were affiliated with their China\nsubsidiaries, the Company allocated all the goodwill to the China subsidiaries.\nDue to the extremely adverse regulatory measures taken by the Chinese government in 2021 in the field of digital currency production and transaction, the Company’s board of\nDirectors decided on December 10, 2021 to divest the China subsidiaries of Mercurity Limited and NBPay controlled through VIE agreements, and the divestiture was completed on\nJanuary 15, 2022.\nThe Company considered that Mercurity Limited and NBPay would no longer be able to carry on their original businesses after the divestiture of these China subsidiaries, and the\npresent value of Mercurity Limited and NBPay’s reestimated future operating cash flows would be nil. The Company recognized that all of the $8,107,014 goodwill attributed to the\nacquisition of Mercurity Limited and NBPay had no value as of December 31, 2021.\nAs a result, the Company recognized the impairment loss of goodwill of $8,107,014 for the year ended December 31, 2021, which is shown as loss from discontinued operations in\nthe consolidated income statement.\nF-20\nRevenue recognition\nOn January 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\"ASC 606”), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC\nTopic 605, Revenue Recognition (\"ASC 605”), using the modified retrospective transition method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2019.\nResults for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2019 are presented under ASC 606, while prior period amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported in\naccordance with historic accounting under ASC 605. The impact of adopting the new revenue standard was not material to consolidated financial statements and there was no\nadjustment to beginning retained earnings on January 1, 2019.\nUnder ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue as the Company satisfies a performance obligation when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount\nthat reflects the consideration that the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity\ndetermines are within the scope of ASC 606, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the\ncontract; (iii) determine the transaction price, including variable consideration, if any; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v)\nrecognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will\ncollect the consideration to which it is entitled in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer.\nOnce a contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606 at contract inception, the Company reviews the contract to determine which performance obligations it must\ndeliver and which of these performance obligations are distinct. The Company recognizes revenue based on the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to each\nperformance obligation when that performance obligation is satisfied or as it is satisfied.\nThe Company generates revenue primarily from business consultation services and distributed storage and computing services in the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe Company’s revenue recognition policies effective on the adoption date of ASC 606 are as follows:\nBusiness consultation services\nThe Company recognized the realization of the consultation service revenue by using Output Methods. According to ASC 606-10-55-17, Output methods recognize revenue on the\nbasis of direct measurements of the value to the customer of the goods or services transferred to date relative to the remaining goods or services promised under the contract.\nOutput methods include methods such as surveys of performance completed to date, appraisals of results achieved, milestones reached, time elapsed, and units produced or units\ndelivered. When an entity evaluates whether to apply an output method to measure its progress, the entity should consider whether the output selected would faithfully depict the\nentity’s performance toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation. An output method would not provide a faithful depiction of the entity’s performance if the output\nselected would fail to measure some of the goods or services for which control has transferred to the customer. For example, output methods based on units produced or units\ndelivered would not faithfully depict an entity’s performance in satisfying a performance obligation if, at the end of the reporting period, the entity’s performance has produced\nwork in process or finished goods controlled by the customer that are not included in the measurement of the output. The Company calculates the output value and recognizes\nrevenue by evaluating the percentage-of-completion of the contract at the end of each month.\nOn August 23, 2022, the Company signed a Consulting Agreement with a Chinese media company, pursuant to which the Company will serve as a business consultant in order to\nfacilitate the client to establish its operating entity in the United States and related financing strategy, and the agreed amount of the immutable consideration portion of the\nagreement is $160,000. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 50% of the agreed services had been completed as scheduled, and the Company recognized consultation services\nrevenue of $80,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022 based on the percentage-of-completion. As of December 31, 2023, all the agreed services under this agreement have been\ncompleted, and the Company recognized consultation services revenue of $80,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023 based on the percentage-of-completion.\nOn August 1, 2023, the Company signed a supplementary comprehensive service agreement with the Chinese media company. The Company will continue to assist the client in\nproviding management consulting services and introducing professional service agency resources. The Company expects to receive no less than $150,000 in revenue from this new\nagreement within the next year. As of December 31, 2023, approximately 40% of the agreed services had been completed as scheduled, and the Company recognized consultation\nservices revenue of $60,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023 based on the percentage-of-completion.\nF-21\nOn November 1, 2023, the Company signed a financial consulting agreement with a American logistics company. The Company will serve as a business consultant in order to\nfacilitate introductions between the Company’s clients and esteemed third-party audit firms, legal representatives, and underwriting entities that are crucial for the clients’\nfundraising endeavors within the U.S. capital market. The Company expects to receive $50,000 in revenue from this agreement within the next year. As of December 31, 2023,\napproximately 40% of the agreed services had been completed as scheduled, and the Company recognized consultation services revenue of $20,000 for the year ended December\n31, 2023 based on the percentage-of-completion.\nDistributed storage and computing services\nThe Company’s distributed storage and computing services business includes cryptocurrency mining and cloud storage services for other decentralized platform operators.\nFrom October 2021 to April 2022, the Company obtained the usage rights of a certain number and specific models of Bitcoin mining machines and specific business premises by\nexecuting contracts with the sharing mining service provider, and registered as users on the mining pool website, complying with the general terms and conditions required to join\nthe mining pool published on the mining pool website, to increase computing power to the mining pool. In exchange for providing computing power, the Company was entitled to a\nfractional share of the fixed digital asset awards the mining pool operator receives, for successfully adding blocks to the blockchain. The Company’s fractional share was relative to\nthe proportion of computing power the Company contributed to the mining pool operator toward the total computing power contributed by all mining pool participants in solving\nthe current algorithm. Providing computing power in digital asset transaction verification services was an output of the Company’s ordinary activities. The provision of such\ncomputing power was the only performance obligation in the general terms of the mining pool website. The transaction consideration the Company received, if any, was noncash\nconsideration, which the Company measured at fair value on the date received, which was not materially different than the fair value at contract inception or the time the Company\nhad earned the award from the pools. These considerations were all variable. Since significant reversals of cumulative revenue were possible given the nature of the assets, the\nconsideration was constrained until the mining pool operator successfully places a block (by being the first to solve an algorithm) and the Company received confirmation of the\nconsideration it would receive, at which time revenue was recognized. There was no significant financing component related to these transactions. Fair value of the digital assets\naward received was determined using the quoted price of the related digital assets at the time of receipt. The Company earned $783,090 in Bitcoin mining revenue from shared\nmining operations for the year ended December 31, 2022, and $664,307 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Due to the sharp fluctuations in the price of Bitcoin over the past two\nyears, from May 2022 to the end of 2023, the Company did not carry out any business related to Bitcoin mining.\nOn December 15, 2022, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement with Huangtong International Co., Ltd., providing for the acquisition and purchase of Web3\ndecentralized storage infrastructure, including cryptocurrency mining servers, cables, and other electronic devices, for an aggregate consideration of USD$5.98 million, payable in\nthe Company’s ordinary shares. Starting on December 20, 2022, the Company uses some of the storage capacity of these devices for Filecoin mining business, and other storage\ncapacity will be used to provide cloud storage services to distributed application product operators. The Company has rented the Filecoin mining operating premises located in\nNew Jersey, United States from Cologix US, Inc. and the Company has entered into the Filecoin mainnet as a miner by registering as a user on the Filecoin mainnet, complying with\nthe general terms and conditions required to become a miner published on the Filecoin mainnet. The essence of Filecoin mining business is that the Company utilizes its Web3\ndecentralized storage infrastructure and provide cloud storage services to the end customers through the Filecoin mainnet. In exchange for providing storage capacity, the\nCompany is entitled to a fractional share of the fixed digital asset awards from the Filecoin mainnet, for successfully adding blocks to the blockchain. The Company’s fractional\nshare is relative to the proportion of storage capacity we contribute to Filecoin mainnet toward the total storage capacity contributed by all the Filecoin mainnet’s participants in\nsolving the current algorithm. Providing storage capacity in digital asset transaction verification services is an output of the Company’s ordinary activities. The provision of such\nstorage capacity is the only performance obligation in the general terms of the Filecoin mainnet. The transaction consideration the Company receives, if any, is noncash\nconsideration, which the Company measures at fair value on the date received, which is not materially different than the fair value at contract inception or the time the Company\nhas earned the award from the Filecoin mainnet. These considerations are all variable. Since significant reversals of cumulative revenue are possible given the nature of the assets,\nthe consideration is constrained until the all the miners successfully places a block (by being the first to solve an algorithm) and the Company receives confirmation of the\nconsideration it will receive, at which time revenue is recognized. There is no significant financing component related to these transactions. Fair value of the digital assets award\nreceived is determined using the quoted price of the related digital assets at the time of receipt. For the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2023, we earned $348 and $285,928\nrespectively in Filecoin mining revenue from physical mining operations, and did not receive any revenue from providing cloud storage services to decentralized platform\noperators.\nF-22\nCost of revenue\nBusiness consultation services\nThe cost of consultation services consists primarily of payroll of the consultation project team. The cost of consultation services was recognized in the amount of $19,000 and\n$138,092 respectively for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2023.\nDistributed storage and computing services\nThe cost of the Bitcoin shared mining operation includes the rental fee of the mining machine and the mine site, electricity and other possible operation and maintenance expenses.\nThere were no Bitcoin mining operations in the year ended December 31, 2023. The cost of Bitcoin shared mining operations was recognized in the year ended December 31, 2022 in\nthe amount of $1,291,784, including $1,036,741 for mining machines and mine leases and $255,043 for electricity.\nThe cost of the Filecoin physical mining operation includes mining machine depreciation costs, mine site lease costs (including electricity), direct labor costs and software\nlicensing costs. The cost of Filecoin physical mining operations was recognized in the year ended December 31, 2023 in the amount of $1,286,220, including mining machine\ndepreciation costs of $897,435, mine lease costs (including electricity) of $291,347, direct labor costs of $4,000, and software licensing costs of $93,438. The cost of Filecoin physical\nmining operations was recognized in the year ended December 31, 2022 in the amount of $69,817, including mining machine depreciation costs of $$28,950, mine lease costs\n(including electricity) of $22,075, direct labor costs of $4,000, and software licensing costs of $14,792.\nSales and marketing expenses\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of project referral fees for consultation services business. These costs are expensed as incurred.\nOperating leases\nThe Company determines whether an arrangement contains a lease at the inception of the arrangement. If a lease is determined to exist, the term of such lease is assessed based on\nthe date on which the underlying asset is made available for the Company’s use by the lessor. The Company’s assessment of the lease term reflects the non-cancelable term of the\nlease, inclusive of any rent-free periods and/or periods covered by early-termination options which the Company is reasonably certain of not exercising, as well as periods covered\nby renewal options which the Company is reasonably certain of exercising. The Company also determines lease classification as either operating or finance at lease commencement,\nwhich governs the pattern of expense recognition and the presentation reflected in the consolidated statements of operations over the lease term.\nFor leases with a term exceeding 12 months, an operating lease liability is recorded on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet at lease commencement reflecting the present\nvalue of its fixed minimum payment obligations over the lease term. A corresponding operating lease right-of-use asset equal to the initial lease liability is also recorded, adjusted\nfor any prepaid rent and/or initial direct costs incurred in connection with execution of the lease and reduced by any lease incentives received. For purposes of measuring the\npresent value of its fixed payment obligations for a given lease, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate, determined based on information available at lease\ncommencement, as rates implicit in its leasing arrangements are typically not readily determinable. The Company’s incremental borrowing rate reflects the rate it would pay to\nborrow on a secured basis and incorporates the term and economic environment of the associated lease.\nFor the Company’s operating leases, fixed lease payments are recognized as lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For leases with a term of 12 months or less,\nany fixed lease payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and are not recognized on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as an accounting policy\nelection. Leases qualifying for the short-term lease exception were insignificant. Variable lease costs are recognized as incurred and primarily consist of common area maintenance\nand utility charges not included in the measurement of right of use assets and operating lease liabilities.\nThe leasing activities of the Company during 2022 and 2023 are all for the Company to lease the office as the lessee and the Company classified them as operating leases, among\nwhich, the Company signed a long-term lease contract with a term of about 35 months for the New York office. The Company recognized right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on\nthe consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022 and 2023.\nF-23\nIncome taxes\nThe Company follows the liability method in accounting for income taxes in accordance to ASC topic 740 (\"ASC 740”), Income Taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and\nliabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect in the period in\nwhich the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-\nlikely-than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nThe Company applies the provision of ASC 740 to account for uncertainty in income taxes. ASC 740 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing the\nrecognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company has elected to classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if and when required, as part of income tax expense in the consolidated statements\nof operations.\nShare-based payments\nIn the second quarter of 2017, the Company elected to early adopt ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation Stock Compensation (\"ASC 718”): Improvement to Employee Share based\nPayment Accounting.\nShare options and restricted shares granted to employees and directors are accounted for under ASC 718, \"Compensation – Stock compensation”. In accordance with ASC 718, the\nCompany determines whether a share option or restricted shares should be classified and accounted for as an equity award. All grants of share options and restricted shares to\nemployees and directors classified as equity awards are recognized in the financial statements based on their grant date fair values.\nShare-based payment awards with employees are measured based on the grant date fair value of the equity instrument issued, and recognized as compensation costs using the\nstraight-line method over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the options, with a corresponding impact reflected in additional paid-in capital.\nThe total amount of compensation cost recognized at the end of the requisite service period for an award of share-based compensation shall be based on the number of\ninstruments for which the requisite service has been rendered (that is, for which the requisite service period has been completed). Previously recognized compensation cost shall\nnot be reversed if an employee share option (or share unit) for which the requisite service has been rendered expires unexercised (or unconverted). To determine the amount of\ncompensation cost to be recognized in each period, the Company shall make an entity wide accounting policy for all employee share-based payment awards to do the following:\nRecognize the effect of awards for which the requisite service is not rendered when the award is forfeited (that is, recognize the effect of forfeitures in compensation cost when\nthey occur). Previously recognized compensation cost for an award shall be reversed in the period that the award is forfeited.\nFor share-based payment awards with market conditions, such market conditions are included in the determination of the estimated grant-date fair value. If the incentivized\nemployee does not meet the agreed market conditions on the grant-date, then the corresponding shares will be forfeited or the corresponding percentage of the proposed shares\nwill be forfeited in proportion to the failure to meet the market conditions. The fair value of the shares granted to employees at the grant-date is the consideration adjusted for the\nsatisfaction of market conditions.\nSome awards contain a market condition. The effect of a market condition is reflected in the grant-date fair value of an award. Compensation cost thus is recognized for an award\nwith a market condition provided that the good is delivered or the service is rendered, regardless of when, if ever, the market condition is satisfied.\nA change in any of the terms or conditions of share-based payment awards is accounted for as a modification of awards. The Company measures the incremental compensation\ncost of a modification as the excess of the fair value of the modified awards over the fair value of the original awards immediately before its terms are modified, based on the share\nprice and other pertinent factors at the modification date. For vested awards, the Company recognizes incremental compensation cost in the period the modification occurred. For\nunvested awards, the Company recognizes, over the remaining requisite service period, the sum of the incremental compensation cost and the remaining unrecognized\ncompensation cost for the original award on the modification date.\nF-24\nNet loss per share\nBasic loss per ordinary share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the\nperiod.\nDiluted loss per ordinary share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities were exercised or converted into ordinary shares. The Company had stock options and\nrestricted share units, which could potentially dilute basic loss per share in the future. To calculate the number of shares for diluted loss per ordinary share, the effect of the stock\noptions and restricted share units is computed using the treasury stock method. Potential ordinary shares in the diluted net loss per share computation are excluded in periods of\nlosses from operations, as their effect would be anti-dilutive.\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share (\"ASC 260”), basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted\naverage number of unrestricted ordinary shares outstanding during the year. Diluted loss per share is calculated by dividing net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders as\nadjusted for the effect of dilutive ordinary equivalent shares, if any, by the weighted average number of ordinary and dilutive ordinary equivalent shares outstanding during the\nperiod. Contingently issuable shares, including performance-based share awards and contingent considerations to be settled in shares, are included in the computation of basic\nearnings per share only when there is no circumstance under which those shares would not be issued. Contingently issuable shares are included in the denominator of the diluted\nloss per share calculation as of the beginning of the period or as of the inception date of the contingent share arrangement, if later, only when dilutive and when all the necessary\nconditions have been satisfied as of the reporting period end.\nFor contracts that may be settled in ordinary shares or in cash at the election of the Company, share settlement is presumed, pursuant to which incremental shares relating to the\nnumber of shares that would be required to settle the contract are included in the denominator of diluted loss per share calculation if the effect is more dilutive. For the contracts\nthat may be settled in ordinary shares or in cash at the election of the counterparty, the more dilutive option of cash or share settlement is used for the purposes of diluted loss per\nshare calculation, pursuant to which share settlement requires the number of shares that would be required to settle the contract be included in the denominator whereas cash\nsettlement requires an adjustment to be made to the numerator for any changes in income or loss that would result as if the contract had been classified as an asset or a liability for\naccounting purposes during the period for a contract that is classified as equity for accounting purposes, if the effect is more dilutive. Ordinary equivalent shares consist of the\nordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of the share options, using the treasury stock method. Ordinary share equivalents are excluded from the computation of diluted loss per\nshare if their effects would be anti-dilutive.\nComprehensive income (loss)\nComprehensive income (loss) is defined as the decrease in equity of the Company during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances excluding transactions\nresulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. Comprehensive gain (loss) is reported in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss, including net loss\nand foreign currency translation adjustments, presented net of tax.\nSegment reporting\nThe Company follows ASC 280, Segment Reporting. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer or chief operating decision-maker reviews the consolidated financial results when\nmaking decisions about allocating resources and assessing the performance of the Company as a whole and hence, the Company has only one reportable segment. Almost all of\nthe Company’s revenue in 2023 came from its US subsidiary MFH Tech, but as of December 31, 2023, due to the Company’s business being still in the adjustment stage, the\nCompany has not yet divided into geographical divisions for independent business development and management. The Company’s future revenue will mainly come from three\ndifferent business entities, including MFH Tech, Chaince Securities and Ucon Capital. The Company will add segment reports for different geographies and businesses after the\ncompletion of business architecture adjustments.\nFair value\nFair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nWhen determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most\nadvantageous market in which it would transact and it considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.\nF-25\nAuthoritative literature provides a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The level in the\nhierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement as follows:\nLevel 1 - inputs are based upon quoted prices for instruments traded in active markets.\nLevel 2 - inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-\nbased calculation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of\nthe assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 - inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair\nvalues are therefore determined using model-based techniques that include option pricing models, cash flow models, and similar techniques.\nFair value of financial instruments\nFinancial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, amounts due from a related party and accounts receivable. The carrying values of cash, amounts due from a related party\nand accounts receivable approximate their fair values reported in the consolidated balance sheets due to the short-term maturities.\nFinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis include acquired assets and liabilities and goodwill based on Level 3 inputs in connection with\nbusiness acquisitions.\nRecent accounting pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. This standard requires\na financial asset (or group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The allowance for credit losses is a\nvaluation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset(s) to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial\nassets. This standard is effective tor the Company on January 1, 2023.\n4. CONCENTRATION OF RISK\nCredit risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents. The Company places its cash and cash\nequivalents with financial institutions with high-credit ratings and quality.\nVulnerability due to change of regulations or policies\nThe blockchain and cryptocurrency mining business could be significantly affected by, among other things, the regulatory and policy developments in international markets where\nthe Company operates. Governmental authorities are likely to continue to issue new laws, rules and regulations governing the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry in and\nenhance enforcement of existing laws, rules and regulations.\nF-26\nOn January 15, 2022, the Company completed to dismantle the VIE structure and divest Beijing Lianji Technology Co. and Mercurity (Beijing) Technology Co., Ltd., which were\ncontrolled by the VIE agreement, due to the impact of the adverse policies issued by the Chinese government on the original business. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s\nmain business related to cryptocurrencies has moved to the United States.\nCurrency convertibility risk\nFrom time to time, the Company’s businesses may be transacted in RMB, which is not freely convertible into foreign currencies. All foreign exchange transactions take place either\nthrough Bank of China or other banks authorized to buy and sell foreign currencies at the exchange rates quoted by the People’s Bank of China. Approval of foreign currency\npayments by the People’s Bank of China or other regulatory institutions requires submitting a payment application form together with suppliers’ invoices, shipping documents and\nsigned contracts. After the strategic shift mentioned above, the Company’s business is mainly transacted in U.S. dollar resulting minor exposure to currency convertibility risk.\nForeign currency exchange rate risk\nFrom July 21, 2005, the RMB is permitted to fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket of certain foreign currencies. For RMB against U.S. dollar, there was\ndepreciation of approximately 7.6% and 2.9% in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023 respectively. It is difficult to predict how market forces or PRC or U.S. government\npolicy may impact the exchange rate between the RMB and the U.S. dollar in the future.\nTo the extent that the Company needs to convert U.S. dollar into RMB for capital expenditures and working capital and other business purposes, appreciation of RMB against U.S.\ndollar would have an adverse effect on the RMB amount the Company would receive from the conversion. Conversely, if the Company decides to convert RMB into U.S. dollar for\nthe purpose of making payments for dividends on ordinary shares, strategic acquisitions or investments or other business purposes, appreciation of U.S. dollar against RMB\nwould have a negative effect on the U.S. dollar amount available to the Company. In addition, a significant depreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar may significantly reduce\nthe U.S. dollar equivalent of the Company’s earnings or losses.\nAs the Company does not mainly carry out business in China in 2022 and 2023, the impact of foreign currency exchange is not significant.\n5.

On behalf of the Company, Deheng went to Sheyang Public Security Bureau several times to communicate with the police officer in charge of Wei Zhu’s case, and\nDeheng learned that Sheyang Public Security Bureau suspected that the cryptocurrencies belonged to the Company was related to Wei Zhu’s case without any evidence and\nbecause Wei Zhu’s case was still in the stage of investigation, they insisted on continuing to implement temporary measures to retain the seized assets. According to the legal\nopinion issued by Deheng Law Firm, the ownership of the cryptocurrencies seized by Sheyang Public Security Bureau is clear and can be verified as belonging to the Company,\nand the seizure of the Company’s cryptocurrencies by Sheyang Public Security Bureau is improper. If Public Security Bureau of Sheyang does not release the seizure of the\nCompany’s cryptocurrencies, Sheyang Public Security Bureau should issue a written decision in accordance with laws and regulations.\nF-32\nOn November 21, 2022, Deheng submitted the complaint and evidentiary materials to the Public Security Bureau of Sheyang County according to the Criminal Procedure Law and\nthe Provisions on Procedures of Handling Criminal Cases by Public Security Organs (the \"PRC Criminal Law”).

On November 22, 2023, the Company received a response from the Public Security Bureau of Sheyang County, rejecting the Company’s \"Application for State\nCompensation”. The Public Security Bureau of Sheyang County claimed that the criminal responsibility for the relevant case has not been terminated, and the Company should\nsubmit the \"Application for State Compensation” after the criminal responsibility for the relevant case has been terminated. In view of the unreasonable response from the Public\nSecurity Bureau of Sheyang County, the Company submitted the administrative reconsideration by mail to the Public Security Bureau of Yancheng City, the higher-level organ of\nthe Public Security Bureau of Sheyang County, on December 19, 2023.\nThe Company is currently still attempting to recover the wrongfully seized cold wallet and cryptocurrencies through administrative appeals. Considering the special situation of\nChina’s public security and judicial system, the Company has not considered directly filing a lawsuit against the Public Security Bureau of Sheyang County. Once the wrongfully\nseized cold wallet and cryptocurrencies cannot be recovered through administrative appeals, the Company will have to resort to litigation to confront the Public Security Bureau of\nSheyang County and the relevant responsible persons. We together with Deheng will continue to vigorously pursue the Recovery Proceeding, attempting to regain its cold wallet\nand cryptocurrencies contained therein, which we believe were wrongfully seized and impounded by the Public Security Bureau.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company has not made more positive progress in recovering its crypto assets out of control. Although it is considered inappropriate from a legal\nperspective for the Sheyang County Public Security Bureau to implement seizure procedures on the Company’s crypto assets, the Company still cannot estimate the time it may\ntake to recover those crypto assets. Therefore, the Company has decided to make a provision for impairment of all the crypto assets out of control, to eliminate the potential\nsignificant uncertainty on the financial statements.\n(C) The impairment loss of intangible assets\nDue to the price crash of Bitcoin in 2022, the Company, out of caution, decided to change the impairment test method of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies from testing once or\ntwice a year by calculating the fair value based on the average daily closing price of the past 12 months to testing every day by calculating the fair value based on the intraday low\nprice.\nIn addition, considering that we are still unable to estimate when the Company will be able to recover the Bitcoins and USD Coins that were improperly seized by the Sheyang\nCounty Public Security Bureau, in order to eliminate the uncertainty caused by this incident to the Company’s consolidated financial statements, we have decided to make\nimpairment provisions for all those crypto assets out of control.\nThe impairment loss of intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 is detailed as follows:\nFor the year ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nUS$ US$\nBitcoin (i) 1,952,598 3,111,232\nUSD Coin (ii) 1,992,211 —\nFilecoin (iii) 303,276 26,957\nTether USDs (\"USDT”) (iv) — 5,864\nTotal impairment loss of intangible assets 4,248,085 3,144,053\n(i) As of April 19, 2024, the Company has not made positive progress in recovering its crypto assets out of control.

STATUTORY RESERVES AND RESTRICTED NET ASSETS\nIn accordance with the Regulations on Enterprises with Foreign Investment of China and their articles of association, the Company’s subsidiary located in the PRC, being foreign\ninvested enterprises established in the PRC, are required to provide for certain statutory reserves. These statutory reserve funds include one or more of the following: (i) a general\nreserve, (ii) an enterprise expansion fund or discretionary reserve fund, and (iii) a staff bonus and welfare fund. Subject to certain cumulative limits, the general reserve fund\nrequires a minimum annual appropriation of 10% of after-tax profit (as determined under accounting principles generally accepted in China at each year-end); the other fund\nappropriations are at the subsidiaries’ or the affiliated PRC entities’ discretion. These statutory reserve funds can only be used for specific purposes of enterprise expansion, staff\nbonus and welfare, and are not distributable as cash dividends except in the event of liquidation of our subsidiaries, our affiliated PRC entities and their respective subsidiaries.\nThe Company’s subsidiaries are required to allocate at least 10% of their after-tax profits to the general reserve until such reserve has reached 50% of their respective registered\ncapital. As of December 31, 2023, the Company’s PRC subsidiary did not have a general reserve that reached 50% of their registered capital threshold and therefore they will\ncontinue to allocate at least 10% of their after-tax profits to the general reserve fund.\nAppropriations to the enterprise expansion reserve and the staff welfare and bonus reserve are to be made at the discretion of the Board of Directors of each of the Company’s\nsubsidiaries.\nAs the Company’s PRC subsidiaries have been operating at a loss, they have yet to set aside any certain statutory reserves as of December 31, 2023, and the appropriation to\nthese reserves by the Company’s PRC subsidiary was $nil for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nAs a result of these PRC laws and regulations and the requirement that distributions by the PRC entities can only be paid out of distributable profits computed in accordance with\nthe PRC GAAP, the PRC entities are restricted from transferring a portion of their net assets to the Company. Amounts restricted include paid-in capital and the statutory reserves\nof the Company’s PRC subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2023, the net assets of the Company’s PRC subsidiary were negative.\n23. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nEfforts to recover the Company’s misplaced digital assets (the \"Recovery Proceeding”)\nOn February 4, 2024, the Yancheng Public Security Bureau replied to us with a \"Criminal Compensation Review Decision”, supporting the actions of the Sheyang County Public\nSecurity Bureau and rejecting the Company’s national compensation application. Yancheng Public Security Bureau also believes that because they suspect that the crypto assets\nowned by the Company may be related to the suspect of the case they are investigating, and the Company can only apply for the national compensation after the relevant case is\nended.\nIt is obvious that the Yancheng Public Security Bureau has ignored the fact that the Sheyang County Public Security Bureau’s seizure of the Company’s crypto assets lacks legal\nbasis. Therefore, in accordance with the national compensation procedure, the Company mailed the relevant materials to the National Compensation Commission of Yancheng\nIntermediate People’s Court on March 1, 2024, and applied to the National Compensation Commission of Yancheng Intermediate People’s Court for a compensation decision.\nAs of now, the Company is still attempting to recover those lost crypto assets through administrative appeals.\nThe amendment of the Securities Purchase Agreement for the Unsecured Convertible Promissory Note of $9 million\nThe Company and the Viner Total Investments Fund (the \"Holder”) have entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement dated January 31, 2023, pursuant to which the Company\nissued an Unsecured Convertible Promissory Note with issuance dated February 2, 2023 (the \"Note”, as amended in accordance with this Agreement) to the Holder.\nOn February 2, 2024, the Company and the Holder entered into an amendment agreement of the Securities Purchase Agreement. The Company and the Holder desire to amend the\nterms of the Note, pursuant to which the Company shall repay $1,500,000 of the original U.S.$9,000,000 principal amount to the Holder in consideration of amending certain terms of\nthe Note. The Adjusted Principal Amount of U.S.$7,500,000 from February 2, 2024 to February 1, 2025 (the \"Maturity Date”), both at an annual rate of 5%, until the repayment of the\nNote unless converted into ordinary shares of the Company in accordance with the agreed conversion conditions. Interest on this Note shall be computed on the basis of a 365-\nday year and actual days elapsed. Interest accrued on this Note shall be payable in arrears on the Maturity Date of this Note and shall be forgiven and waived by the Holder upon\nconversion of the Note. No more interest shall accrue on the Accrued Interest of the Original Note from the date hereof until the Maturity Date.\nAs of February 29, 2024, we have paid the interest of $450,000 for the period from February 2, 2023 to February 1, 2024, and repaid the principal of $1.5 million.\nThe cancellation of the Mining Machine Sale Contract between the Company and Jinhe Capital Limited\nOn March 10, 2024, the Company and Jinhe Capital Limited (\"Jinhe”) entered into a Cancellation Agreement. According to the Cancellation Agreement, the original contract (under\nwhich Jinhe agreed to sell and the Company agreed to purchase 5,000 pieces of Antminer S19 PRO for a total amount of $9 million) and the amendment (reducing the quantity from\n5,000 pieces to 2,000 pieces of Antminer S19 PRO), were cancelled and terminated in its entirety.

(1) Subject to the Act, these Articles and, where applicable, the rules of the Designated Stock Exchange and without prejudice to any special rights or restrictions for the\ntime being attached to any shares or any class of shares, the unissued shares of the Company (whether forming part of the original or any increased capital) shall be at the\ndisposal of the Board, which may offer, allot, grant options over or otherwise dispose of them to such persons, at such times and for such consideration and upon such\nterms and conditions and for any reason including, without limitation, in response to a perceived undervalued offer in a tender offer of the Company’s securities, or as the\nBoard may in its absolute discretion determine, but so that no shares shall be issued at a discount to par value.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the resolution or resolutions providing\nfor the establishment of any class or series of preferred shares may, to the extent permitted by the Act, provide that such class or series shall be superior to, rank equally\nwith or be junior to the preferred shares of any other class or series.\nwww.verify.gov.ky File#: 259316\n-16-\n(2) Neither the Company nor the Board shall be obliged, when making or granting any allotment of, offer of, option over or disposal of shares, to make, or make available,\nany such allotment, offer, option or shares to Members or others with registered addresses in any particular territory or territories being a territory or territories where, in\nthe absence of a registration statement or other special formalities, this would or might, in the opinion of the Board, be unlawful or impracticable. Members affected as a\nresult of the foregoing sentence shall not be, or be deemed to be, a separate class of members for any purpose whatsoever. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the\nresolution or resolutions providing for the establishment of any class or series of preferred shares, no vote of the holders of preferred shares or ordinary shares shall be a\nprerequisite to the issuance of any shares of any class or series of the preferred shares authorized by and complying with the conditions of the Memorandum and Articles\nof Association.\n(3) The Board may issue options, warrants or convertible securities or securities of similar nature conferring the right upon the holders thereof to subscribe for, purchase\nor receive any class of shares or securities in the capital of the Company on such terms as it may from time to time determine.\n13. The Company may in connection with the issue of any shares exercise all powers of paying commission and brokerage conferred or permitted by the Act. Subject to the\nAct, the commission may be satisfied by the payment of cash or by the allotment of fully or partly paid shares or partly in one and partly in the other.\n14. Except as required by the Act, no person shall be recognised by the Company as holding any share upon any trust and the Company shall not be bound by or required in\nany way to recognise (even when having notice thereof) any equitable, contingent, future or partial interest in any share or any fractional part of a share or (except only as\notherwise provided by these Articles or by the Act any other rights in respect of any share except an absolute right to the entirety thereof in the registered holder.\nwww.verify.gov.ky File#: 259316\n-17-\n15. Subject to the Act and these Articles, the Board may at any time after the allotment of shares but before any person has been entered in the Register as a Member,\nrecognise a renunciation thereof by the allottee in favour of some other person and may accord to any allottee of a share a right to effect such renunciation upon and\nsubject to such terms and conditions as the Board considers fit to impose.\nSHARE CERTIFICATES\n16. Every share certificate shall be issued under the Seal or a facsimile thereof and shall specify the number and class and distinguishing numbers (if any) of the shares to\nwhich it relates, and the amount paid up thereon and may otherwise be in such form as the Board may from time to time determine. No certificate shall be issued\nrepresenting shares of more than one class. The Board may by resolution determine, either generally or in any particular case or cases, that any signatures on any such\ncertificates (or certificates in respect of other securities) need not be autographic but may be affixed to such certificates by some mechanical means or may be printed\nthereon.\n17. (1) In the case of a share held jointly by several persons, the Company shall not be bound to issue more than one certificate therefor and delivery of a certificate to one of\nseveral joint holders shall be sufficient delivery to all such holders.\n(2) Where a share stands in the names of two or more persons, the person first named in the Register shall as regards service of notices and, subject to the provisions of\nthese Articles, all or any other matters connected with the Company, except the transfer of the shares, be deemed the sole holder thereof.\n18. Every person whose name is entered, upon an allotment of shares, as a Member in the Register shall be entitled, without payment, to receive one certificate for all such\nshares of any one class or several certificates each for one or more of such shares of such class upon payment for every certificate after the payment of such reasonable\nout-of-pocket expenses as the Board from time to time determines.\n19. Share certificates shall be issued within the relevant time limit as prescribed by the Act or as the Designated Stock Exchange may from time to time determine, whichever is\nthe shorter, after allotment or, except in the case of a transfer which the Company is for the time being entitled to refuse to register and does not register, after lodgment of\na transfer with the Company.\nwww.verify.gov.ky File#: 259316\n-18-\n20.

If any of the shares included in the\ncertificate so given up shall be retained by the transferor a new certificate for the balance shall be issued to him at the aforesaid fee payable by the transferor to the\nCompany in respect thereof.\n(2) The fee referred to in paragraph (1) above shall be an amount not exceeding the relevant maximum amount as the Designated Stock Exchange may from time to time\ndetermine provided that the Board may at any time determine a lower amount for such fee.\n21. If a share certificate shall be damaged or defaced or alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed a new certificate representing the same shares may be issued to the\nrelevant Member upon request and on payment of such fee as the Board may determine and, subject to compliance with such terms (if any) as to evidence and indemnity\nand to payment of the costs and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Company in investigating such evidence and preparing such indemnity as the Board may think\nfit and, in case of damage or defacement, on delivery of the old certificate to the Company provided always that where share warrants have been issued, no new share\nwarrant shall be issued to replace one that has been lost unless the Board has determined that the original has been destroyed.\nLIEN\n22. The Company shall have a first and paramount lien on every share that is not a fully paid share, for all moneys (whether presently payable or not) called or payable at a\nfixed time in respect of that share. The Company shall also have a first and paramount lien on every share that is not a fully paid share registered in the name of a Member\n(whether or not jointly with other Members) for all amounts of money presently payable by such Member or his estate to the Company whether the same shall have been\nincurred before or after notice to the Company of any equitable or other interest of any person other than such member, and whether the payment or discharge of the same\nshall have actually become due or not, and notwithstanding that the same are joint debts or liabilities of such Member or his estate and any other person, whether a\nMember of the Company or not. The Company’s lien on a share shall extend to all dividends or other moneys payable thereon or in respect thereof. The Board may at any\ntime, generally or in any particular case, waive any lien that has arisen or declare any share exempt in whole or in part, from the provisions of this Article 22.\nwww.verify.gov.ky File#: 259316\n-19-\n23. Subject to these Articles, the Company may sell in such manner as the Board determines any share on which the Company has a lien, but no sale shall be made unless\nsome sum in respect of which the lien exists is presently payable, or the liability or engagement in respect of which such lien exists is liable to be presently fulfilled or\ndischarged nor until the expiration of fourteen (14) clear days after a notice in writing, stating and demanding payment of the sum presently payable, or specifying the\nliability or engagement and demanding fulfilment or discharge thereof and giving notice of the intention to sell in default, has been served on the registered holder for the\ntime being of the share or the person entitled thereto by reason of his death or bankruptcy.\n24. The net proceeds of the sale shall be received by the Company and applied in or towards payment or discharge of the debt or liability in respect of which the lien exists, so\nfar as the same is presently payable, and any residue shall, subject to a like lien for debts or liabilities not presently payable as existed upon the share prior to the sale, be\npaid to the person entitled to the share at the time of the sale. To give effect to any such sale the Board may authorise some person to transfer the shares sold to the\npurchaser thereof. The purchaser shall be registered as the holder of the shares so transferred and he shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money,\nnor shall his title to the shares be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings relating to the sale.\nCALLS ON SHARES\n25. Subject to these Articles and to the terms of allotment, the Board may from time to time make calls upon the Members in respect of any moneys unpaid on their shares\n(whether on account of the nominal value of the shares or by way of premium), and each Member shall (subject to being given at least fourteen (14) clear days’ notice in\nwriting specifying the time and place of payment) pay to the Company as required by such notice the amount called on his shares. A call may be extended, postponed or\nrevoked in whole or in part as the Board determines but no Member shall be entitled to any such extension, postponement or revocation except as a matter of grace and\nfavour.\n26. A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution of the Board authorising the call was passed and may be made payable either in one lump sum or\nby instalments.\n27. A person upon whom a call is made shall remain liable for calls made upon him notwithstanding the subsequent transfer of the shares in respect of which the call was\nmade. The joint holders of a share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay all calls and instalments due in respect thereof or other moneys due in respect thereof.\nwww.verify.gov.ky File#: 259316\n-20-\n28. If a sum called in respect of a share is not paid before or on the day appointed for payment thereof, the person from whom the sum is due shall pay interest on the amount\nunpaid from the day appointed for payment thereof to the time of actual payment at such rate (not exceeding twenty per cent. (20%) per annum) as the Board may\ndetermine, but the Board may in its absolute discretion waive payment of such interest in whole or in part.\n29. No Member shall be entitled to receive any dividend or bonus or to be present and vote (save as proxy for another Member) at any general meeting either personally or by\nproxy, or be reckoned in a quorum, or exercise any other privilege as a Member until all calls or instalments due by him to the Company, whether alone or jointly with any\nother person, together with interest and expenses (if any) shall have been paid.\n30. On the trial or hearing of any action or other proceedings for the recovery of any money due for any call, it shall be sufficient to prove that the name of the Member sued\nis entered in the Register as the holder, or one of the holders, of the shares in respect of which such debt accrued, that the resolution making the call is duly recorded in\nthe minute book, and that notice of such call was duly given to the Member sued, in pursuance of these Articles; and it shall not be necessary to prove the appointment\nof the Directors who made such call, nor any other matters whatsoever, but the proof of the matters aforesaid shall be conclusive evidence of the debt.\n31. Any amount payable in respect of a share upon allotment or at any fixed date, whether in respect of nominal value or premium or as an instalment of a call, shall be deemed\nto be a call duly made and payable on the date fixed for payment and if it is not paid the provisions of these Articles shall apply as if that amount had become due and\npayable by virtue of a call duly made and notified.\n32. On the issue of shares the Board may differentiate between the allottees or holders as to the amount of calls to be paid and the times of payment.\n33. The Board may, if it thinks fit, receive from any Member willing to advance the same, and either in money or money’s worth, all or any part of the moneys uncalled and\nunpaid or instalments payable upon any shares held by him and upon all or any of the moneys so advanced (until the same would, but for such advance, become\npresently payable) pay interest at such rate (if any) as the Board may decide. The Board may at any time repay the amount so advanced upon giving to such Member not\nless than one month’s notice in writing of its intention in that behalf, unless before the expiration of such notice the amount so advanced shall have been called up on the\nshares in respect of which it was advanced. Such payment in advance shall not entitle the holder of such share or shares to participate in respect thereof in a dividend\nsubsequently declared.\nwww.verify.gov.ky File#: 259316\n-21-\nFORFEITURE OF SHARES\n34. (1) If a call remains unpaid after it has become due and payable the Board may give to the person from whom it is due not less than fourteen (14) clear days’ notice in\nwriting:\n(a) requiring payment of the amount unpaid together with any interest which may have accrued and which may still accrue up to the date of actual payment; and\n(b) stating that if the notice in writing is not complied with the shares on which the call was made will be liable to be forfeited.\n(2) If the requirements of any such notice are not complied with, any share in respect of which such notice has been given may at any time thereafter, before payment of all\ncalls and interest due in respect thereof has been made, be forfeited by a resolution of the Board to that effect, and such forfeiture shall include all dividends and bonuses\ndeclared in respect of the forfeited share but not actually paid before the forfeiture.\n35. When any share has been forfeited, notice of the forfeiture shall be served upon the person who was before forfeiture the holder of the share. No forfeiture shall be\ninvalidated by any omission or neglect to give such notice.\n36. The Board may accept the surrender of any share liable to be forfeited hereunder and, in such case, references in these Articles to forfeiture will include surrender.\n37. Any share so forfeited shall be deemed the property of the Company and may be sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of to such person, upon such terms and in such\nmanner as the Board determines, and at any time before a sale, re-allotment or disposition the forfeiture may be annulled by the Board on such terms as the Board\ndetermines.\n38. A person whose shares have been forfeited shall cease to be a Member in respect of the forfeited shares but nevertheless shall remain liable to pay the Company all\nmoneys which at the date of forfeiture were presently payable by him to the Company in respect of the shares, with, if the Board shall in its discretion so requires, interest\nthereon from the date of forfeiture until payment at such rate (not exceeding twenty per cent. (20%) per annum) as the Board determines. The Board may enforce payment\nthereof if it thinks fit, and without any deduction or allowance for the value of the forfeited shares, at the date of forfeiture, but his liability shall cease if and when the\nCompany shall have received payment in full of all such moneys in respect of the shares. For the purposes of this Article 38 any sum which, by the terms of issue of a\nshare, is payable thereon at a fixed time which is subsequent to the date of forfeiture, whether on account of the nominal value of the share or by way of premium, shall\nnotwithstanding that time has not yet arrived be deemed to be payable at the date of forfeiture, and the same shall become due and payable immediately upon the\nforfeiture, but interest thereon shall only be payable in respect of any period between the said fixed time and the date of actual payment.\nwww.verify.gov.ky File#: 259316\n-22-\n39. A declaration by a Director or the Secretary that a share has been forfeited on a specified date shall be conclusive evidence of the facts therein stated as against all\npersons claiming to be entitled to the share, and such declaration shall (subject to the execution of an instrument of transfer by the Company if necessary) constitute a\ngood title to the share, and the person to whom the share is disposed of shall be registered as the holder of the share and shall not be bound to see to the application of\nthe consideration (if any), nor shall his title to the share be affected by any irregularity in or invalidity of the proceedings in reference to the forfeiture, sale or disposal of\nthe share. When any share shall have been forfeited, notice of the declaration shall be given to the Member in whose name it stood immediately prior to the forfeiture, and\nan entry of the forfeiture, with the date thereof, shall forthwith be made in the Register, but no forfeiture shall be in any manner invalidated by any omission or neglect to\ngive such notice or make any such entry.\n40. Notwithstanding any such forfeiture as aforesaid the Board may at any time, before any shares so forfeited shall have been sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of,\npermit the shares forfeited to be bought back upon the terms of payment of all calls and interest due upon and expenses incurred in respect of the share, and upon such\nfurther terms (if any) as it thinks fit.\n41. The forfeiture of a share shall not prejudice the right of the Company to any call already made or instalment payable thereon.\n42. The provisions of these Articles as to forfeiture shall apply in the case of non-payment of any sum which, by the terms of issue of a share, becomes payable at a fixed\ntime, whether on account of the nominal value of the share or by way of premium, as if the same had been payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified.\nwww.verify.gov.ky File#: 259316\n-23-\nREGISTER OF MEMBERS\n43.

Subject to these Articles, any Member may transfer all or any of his shares by an instrument of transfer in the usual or common form or in a form prescribed by the\nDesignated Stock Exchange or in any other form approved by the Board and may be under hand or, if the transferor or transferee is a clearing house or a central\ndepository house or its nominee(s), by hand or by machine imprinted signature or by such other manner of execution as the Board may approve from time to time.\n47. The instrument of transfer shall be executed by or on behalf of the transferor and the transferee provided that the Board may dispense with the execution of the\ninstrument of transfer by the transferee in any case which it thinks fit in its discretion to do so. Without prejudice to Article 46, the Board may also resolve, either\ngenerally or in any particular case, upon request by either the transferor or transferee, to accept mechanically executed transfers. The transferor shall be deemed to remain\nthe holder of the share until the name of the transferee is entered in the Register in respect thereof. Nothing in these Articles shall preclude the Board from recognising a\nrenunciation of the allotment or provisional allotment of any share by the allottee in favour of some other person.\n48. (1) The Board may, in its absolute discretion, and without giving any reason therefor, refuse to register a transfer of any share that is not a fully paid up share to a person\nof whom it does not approve, or any share issued under any share incentive scheme for employees upon which a restriction on transfer imposed thereby still subsists,\nand it may also, without prejudice to the foregoing generality, refuse to register a transfer of any share to more than four joint holders or a transfer of any share that is not\na fully paid up share on which the Company has a lien.\n(2) The Board in so far as permitted by any applicable law may, in its absolute discretion, at any time and from time to time transfer any share upon the Register to any\nbranch register or any share on any branch register to the Register or any other branch register. In the event of any such transfer, the Member requesting such transfer\nshall bear the cost of effecting the transfer unless the Board otherwise determines.\nwww.verify.gov.ky File#: 259316\n-25-\n(3) Unless the Board otherwise agrees (which agreement may be on such terms and subject to such conditions as the Board in its absolute discretion may from time to\ntime determine, and which agreement the Board shall, without giving any reason therefor, be entitled in its absolute discretion to give or withhold), no shares upon the\nRegister shall be transferred to any branch register nor shall shares on any branch register be transferred to the Register or any other branch register and all transfers and\nother documents of title shall be lodged for registration, and registered, in the case of any shares on a branch register, at the relevant Registration Office, and, in the case\nof any shares on the Register, at the Office or such other place at which the Register is kept in accordance with the Act.\n49. Without limiting the generality of Article 48, the Board may decline to recognise any instrument of transfer unless:-\n(a) a fee of such maximum sum as the Designated Stock Exchange may determine to be payable or such lesser sum as the Board may from time to time require is paid\nto the Company in respect thereof;\n(b) the instrument of transfer is in respect of only one class of shares;\n(c) the instrument of transfer is lodged at the Office or such other place at which the Register is kept in accordance with the Act or the Registration Office (as the\ncase may be) accompanied by the relevant share certificate(s) and such other evidence as the Board may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to\nmake the transfer (and, if the instrument of transfer is executed by some other person on his behalf, the authority of that person so to do); and\n(d) if applicable, the instrument of transfer is duly and properly stamped.\n50. If the Board refuses to register a transfer of any share, it shall, within three months after the date on which the transfer was lodged with the Company, send to each of the\ntransferor and transferee notice of the refusal.\n51. The registration of transfers of shares or of any class of shares may, after compliance with any notice requirement of the Designated Stock Exchange, be suspended and\nthe register of members be closed at such times and for such periods (not exceeding in the whole thirty (30) days in any year) as the Board may determine.\nwww.verify.gov.ky File#: 259316\n-26-\nTRANSMISSION OF SHARES\n52. If a Member dies, the survivor or survivors where the deceased was a joint holder, and his legal personal representatives where he was a sole or only surviving holder, will\nbe the only persons recognised by the Company as having any title to his interest in the shares; but nothing in this Article will release the estate of a deceased Member\n(whether sole or joint) from any liability in respect of any share which had been solely or jointly held by him.\n53. Any person becoming entitled to a share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy or winding-up of a Member may, upon such evidence as to his title being produced\nas may be required by the Board, elect either to become the holder of the share or to have some person nominated by him registered as the transferee thereof. If he elects\nto become the holder he shall notify the Company in writing either at the Registration Office or the Office, as the case may be, to that effect. If he elects to have another\nperson registered he shall execute a transfer of the share in favour of that person. The provisions of these Articles relating to the transfer and registration of transfers of\nshares shall apply to such notice or transfer as aforesaid as if the death or bankruptcy of the Member had not occurred and the notice or transfer were a transfer signed by\nsuch Member.\n54. A person becoming entitled to a share by reason of the death or bankruptcy or winding-up of a Member shall be entitled to the same dividends and other advantages to\nwhich he would be entitled if he were the registered holder of the share. However, the Board may, if it thinks fit, withhold the payment of any dividend payable or other\nadvantages in respect of such share until such person shall become the registered holder of the share or shall have effectually transferred such share, but, subject to the\nrequirements of Article 75(2) being met, such a person may vote at meetings.\nUNTRACEABLE MEMBERS\n55. (1) Without prejudice to the rights of the Company under paragraph (2) of this Article 55, the Company may cease sending cheques for dividend entitlements or dividend\nwarrants by post if such cheques or warrants have been left uncashed on two consecutive occasions. However, the Company may exercise the power to cease sending\ncheques for dividend entitlements or dividend warrants after the first occasion on which such a cheque or warrant is returned undelivered.\nwww.verify.gov.ky File#: 259316\n-27-\n(2) The Company shall have the power to sell, in such manner as the Board thinks fit, any shares of a Member who is untraceable, but no such sale shall be made unless:\n(a) all cheques or warrants in respect of dividends of the shares in question, being not less than three in total number, for any sum payable in cash to the holder of\nsuch shares sent during the relevant period in the manner authorised by these Articles have remained uncashed;\n(b) so far as it is aware at the end of the relevant period, the Company has not at any time during the relevant period received any indication of the existence of the\nMember who is the holder of such shares or of a person entitled to such shares by death, bankruptcy or operation of law; and\n(c) the Company, if so required by the rules governing the listing of shares on the Designated Stock Exchange, has given notice to, and caused advertisement in\nnewspapers to be made in accordance with the requirements of the Designated Stock Exchange of its intention to sell such shares in the manner required by the\nDesignated Stock Exchange, and a period of three months or such shorter period as may be allowed by the Designated Stock Exchange has elapsed since the\ndate of such advertisement.\nFor the purpose of the foregoing, the “relevant period” means the period commencing twelve (12) years before the date of publication of the advertisement\nreferred to in paragraph (c) of this Article and ending at the expiry of the period referred to in that paragraph.\n(3) To give effect to any such sale the Board may authorise some person to transfer the said shares and an instrument of transfer signed or otherwise executed by or on\nbehalf of such person shall be as effective as if it had been executed by the registered holder or the person entitled by transmission to such shares, and the purchaser\nshall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money nor shall his title to the shares be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings relating\nto the sale. The net proceeds of the sale will belong to the Company and upon receipt by the Company of such net proceeds it shall become indebted to the former\nMember for an amount equal to such net proceeds. No trust shall be created in respect of such debt and no interest shall be payable in respect of it and the Company shall\nnot be required to account for any money earned from the net proceeds which may be employed in the business of the Company or as it thinks fit. Any sale under this\nArticle 55 shall be valid and effective notwithstanding that the Member holding the shares sold is dead, bankrupt or otherwise under any legal disability or incapacity.\nwww.verify.gov.ky File#: 259316\n-28-\nGENERAL MEETINGS\n56. The Company may (but shall not be obliged to) in each calendar year hold a general meeting as its annual general meeting and shall specify the meeting as such in the\nnotices calling it.\n57. Each general meeting, other than an annual general meeting, shall be called an extraordinary general meeting. General meetings may be held at such times and in any\nlocation in the world as may be determined by the Board.\n58. The Board may call general meetings, and they shall on a Members requisition forthwith proceed to convene an extraordinary general meeting of the Company.\n(a) A Members requisition is a requisition of Members of the Company holding at the date of deposit of the requisition not less than 30% of the share capital of the\nCompany as at that date carries the right of voting at general meetings of the Company.\n(b) The requisition must state the objects of the meeting and must be signed by the requisitionists and deposited at the principal place of business of the Company\n(with a copy forwarded to the registered office), and may consist of several documents in like form each signed by one or more requisitionists.\n(c) If the Directors do not within 21 calendar days from the date of the deposit of the requisition duly proceed to convene a general meeting to be held within a\nfurther 21 calendar days, the requisitionists, or any of them representing more than one half of the total voting rights of all of them, may themselves convene a\ngeneral meeting, but any meeting so convened shall not be held after the expiration of three months after the expiration of the second said 21 calendar days.\n(d) A general meeting convened as aforesaid by requisitionists shall be convened in the same manner as nearly as possible as that in which general meetings are to\nbe convened by Directors.\nwww.verify.gov.ky File#: 259316\n-29-\nNOTICE OF GENERAL MEETINGS\n59. (1) An annual general meeting and any extraordinary general meeting may be called by not less than ten (10) clear days’ notice in writing but a general meeting may be\ncalled by shorter notice, subject to the Act, if it is so agreed:\n(a) in the case of a meeting called as an annual general meeting, by all the Members entitled to attend and vote thereat; and\n(b) in the case of any other meeting, by a majority in number of the Members having the right to attend and vote at the meeting, being a majority together holding\nnot less than ninety-five per cent.

The accidental omission to give notice in writing of a meeting or (in cases where instruments of proxy are sent out with the notice) to send such instrument of proxy to, or\nthe non-receipt of such notice or such instrument of proxy by, any person entitled to receive such notice shall not invalidate any resolution passed or the proceedings at\nthat meeting.\nPROCEEDINGS AT GENERAL MEETINGS\n61.

If within thirty (30) minutes (or such longer time not exceeding one hour as the chairman of the meeting may determine to wait) after the time appointed for the meeting a\nquorum is not present, the meeting shall stand adjourned to the same day in the next week at the same time and place or to such time and place as the Board may\ndetermine. If at such adjourned meeting a quorum is not present within half an hour from the time appointed for holding the meeting, the meeting shall be dissolved.\n63. The Chairman of the Board shall preside as chairman at every general meeting. If at any meeting the chairman is not present within fifteen (15) minutes after the time\nappointed for holding the meeting, or is not willing to act as chairman, the Directors present shall choose one of their number to act, or if one Director only is present he\nshall preside as chairman if willing to act.

The chairman may adjourn the meeting from time to time and from place to place, but no business shall be transacted at any adjourned meeting other than the business\nwhich might lawfully have been transacted at the meeting had the adjournment not taken place. When a meeting is adjourned for fourteen (14) days or more, at least seven\n(7) clear days’ notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given specifying the time and place of the adjourned meeting but it shall not be necessary to specify in such notice\nthe nature of the business to be transacted at the adjourned meeting and the general nature of the business to be transacted. Save as aforesaid, it shall be unnecessary to\ngive notice of an adjournment.\nwww.verify.gov.ky File#: 259316\n-31-\n65. If an amendment is proposed to any resolution under consideration but is in good faith ruled out of order by the chairman of the meeting, the proceedings on the\nsubstantive resolution shall not be invalidated by any error in such ruling. In the case of a resolution duly proposed as a special resolution, no amendment thereto (other\nthan a mere clerical amendment to correct a patent error) may in any event be considered or voted upon.\nVOTING\n66. Subject to any special rights or restrictions as to voting for the time being attached to any shares by or in accordance with these Articles, at any general meeting on a\nshow of hands every Member present in person (or being a corporation, is present by a duly authorised representative), or by proxy shall have one vote and on a poll\nevery Member present in person or by proxy or, in the case of a Member being a corporation, by its duly authorised representative shall have one vote for every fully paid\nshare of which he is the holder but so that no amount paid up or credited as paid up on a share in advance of calls or instalments is treated for the foregoing purposes as\npaid up on the share. Notwithstanding anything contained in these Articles, where more than one proxy is appointed by a Member which is a clearing house or a central\ndepository house (or its nominee(s)), each such proxy shall have one vote on a show of hands. A resolution put to the vote of a meeting shall be decided on a show of\nhands unless voting by way of a poll is required by the rules of the Designated Stock Exchange or, before or on the declaration of the result of the show of hands or on\nthe withdrawal of any other demand for a poll, a poll is demanded by the chairman of such meeting or by any one Member present in person or in the case of a Member\nbeing a corporation by its duly authorised representative or by proxy for the time being entitled to vote at the meeting. A demand by a person as proxy for a Member or in\nthe case of a Member being a corporation by its duly authorised representative shall be deemed to be the same as a demand by a Member.\n67. Unless a poll is duly demanded and the demand is not withdrawn, a declaration by the chairman that a resolution has been carried, or carried unanimously, or by a\nparticular majority, or not carried by a particular majority, or lost, and an entry to that effect made in the minute book of the Company, shall be conclusive evidence of the\nfacts without proof of the number or proportion of the votes recorded for or against the resolution.\n68. If a poll is duly demanded the result of the poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the meeting at which the poll was demanded. There shall be no requirement for the\nchairman to disclose the voting figures on a poll.\nwww.verify.gov.ky File#: 259316\n-32-\n69. A poll demanded on the election of a chairman, or on a question of adjournment, shall be taken forthwith. A poll demanded on any other question shall be taken in such\nmanner (including the use of ballot or voting papers or tickets) either forthwith or at such time (being not later than thirty (30) days after the date of the demand) and place\nas the chairman directs. It shall not be necessary (unless the chairman otherwise directs) for notice to be given of a poll not taken immediately.\n70. The demand for a poll shall not prevent the continuance of a meeting or the transaction of any business other than the question on which the poll has been demanded,\nand, with the consent of the chairman, it may be withdrawn at any time before the close of the meeting or the taking of the poll, whichever is the earlier.\n71. On a poll votes may be given either personally or by proxy.\n72. A person entitled to more than one vote on a poll need not use all his votes or cast all the votes he uses in the same way.\n73. All questions submitted to a meeting shall be decided by a simple majority of votes except where a greater majority is required by these Articles or by the Act. In the case\nof an equality of votes, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, the chairman of such meeting shall be entitled to a second or casting vote in addition to any other vote\nhe may have.\n74. Where there are joint holders of any share any one of such joint holder may vote, either in person or by proxy, in respect of such share as if he were solely entitled\nthereto, but if more than one of such joint holders be present at any meeting the vote of the senior who tenders a vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be accepted to\nthe exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders, and for this purpose seniority shall be determined by the order in which the names stand in the Register in respect of\nthe joint holding. Several executors or administrators of a deceased Member in whose name any share stands shall for the purposes of this Article be deemed joint holders\nthereof.\n75. (1) A Member who is a patient for any purpose relating to mental health or in respect of whom an order has been made by any court having jurisdiction for the protection\nor management of the affairs of persons incapable of managing their own affairs may vote, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, by his receiver, committee, curator\nbonis or other person in the nature of a receiver, committee or curator bonis appointed by such court, and such receiver, committee, curator bonis or other person may\nvote on a poll by proxy, and may otherwise act and be treated as if he were the registered holder of such shares for the purposes of general meetings, provided that such\nevidence as the Board may require of the authority of the person claiming to vote shall have been deposited at the Office, head office or Registration Office, as\nappropriate, not less than forty-eight (48) hours before the time appointed for holding the meeting, or adjourned meeting or poll, as the case may be.\nwww.verify.gov.ky File#: 259316\n-33-\n(2) Any person entitled under Article 53 to be registered as the holder of any shares may vote at any general meeting in respect thereof in the same manner as if he were\nthe registered holder of such shares, provided that forty-eight (48) hours at least before the time of the holding of the meeting or adjourned meeting, as the case may be, at\nwhich he proposes to vote, he shall satisfy the Board of his entitlement to such shares, or the Board shall have previously admitted his right to vote at such meeting in\nrespect thereof.\n76. No Member shall, unless the Board otherwise determines, be entitled to attend and vote and to be reckoned in a quorum at any general meeting unless he is duly\nregistered and all calls or other sums presently payable by him in respect of shares in the Company have been paid.\n77. If:\n(a) any objection shall be raised to the qualification of any voter; or\n(b) any votes have been counted which ought not to have been counted or which might have been rejected; or\n(c) any votes are not counted which ought to have been counted;\nthe objection or error shall not vitiate the decision of the meeting or adjourned meeting on any resolution unless the same is raised or pointed out at the meeting\nor, as the case may be, the adjourned meeting at which the vote objected to is given or tendered or at which the error occurs. Any objection or error shall be\nreferred to the chairman of the meeting and shall only vitiate the decision of the meeting on any resolution if the chairman decides that the same may have\naffected the decision of the meeting. The decision of the chairman on such matters shall be final and conclusive.\nPROXIES\n78. Any Member entitled to attend and vote at a general meeting of the Company shall be entitled to appoint another person as his proxy to attend and vote instead of him. A\nMember who is the holder of two or more shares may appoint more than one proxy to represent him and vote on his behalf at a general meeting of the Company or at a\nclass meeting. A proxy need not be a Member. In addition, a proxy or proxies representing either a Member who is an individual or a Member which is a corporation shall\nbe entitled to exercise the same powers on behalf of the Member which he or they represent as such Member could exercise.\nwww.verify.gov.ky File#: 259316\n-34-\n79. The instrument appointing a proxy shall be in writing under the hand of the appointor or of his attorney duly authorised in writing or, if the appointor is a corporation,\neither under its seal or under the hand of an officer, attorney or other person authorised to sign the same. In the case of an instrument of proxy purporting to be signed on\nbehalf of a corporation by an officer thereof it shall be assumed, unless the contrary appears, that such officer was duly authorised to sign such instrument of proxy on\nbehalf of the corporation without further evidence of the facts.\n80. The instrument appointing a proxy and, if required by the Board, the power of attorney or other authority, if any, under which it is signed, or a certified copy of such\npower or authority, shall be delivered to such place or one of such places, if any, as may be specified for that purpose in or by way of note to or in any document\naccompanying the notice convening the meeting or, if no place is so specified at the Registration Office or the Office, as may be appropriate, not less than forty-eight (48)\nhours before the time appointed for holding the meeting or adjourned meeting at which the person named in the instrument proposes to vote or, in the case of a poll taken\nsubsequently to the date of a meeting or adjourned meeting, not less than twenty-four (24) hours before the time appointed for the taking of the poll and in default the\ninstrument of proxy shall not be treated as valid. No instrument appointing a proxy shall be valid after the expiration of twelve (12) months from the date named in it as the\ndate of its execution, except at an adjourned meeting or on a poll demanded at a meeting or an adjourned meeting in cases where the meeting was originally held within\ntwelve (12) months from such date. Delivery of an instrument appointing a proxy shall not preclude a Member from attending and voting in person at the meeting\nconvened and in such event, the instrument appointing a proxy shall be deemed to be revoked.\n81. Instruments of proxy shall be in any common form or in such other form as the Board may approve (provided that this shall not preclude the use of the two-way form) and\nthe Board may, if it thinks fit, send out with the notice of any meeting forms of instrument of proxy for use at the meeting. The instrument of proxy shall be deemed to\nconfer authority to demand or join in demanding a poll and to vote on any amendment of a resolution put to the meeting for which it is given as the proxy thinks fit. The\ninstrument of proxy shall, unless the contrary is stated therein, be valid as well for any adjournment of the meeting as for the meeting to which it relates.\nwww.verify.gov.ky File#: 259316\n-35-\n82. A vote given in accordance with the terms of an instrument of proxy shall be valid notwithstanding the previous death or insanity of the principal, or revocation of the\ninstrument of proxy or of the authority under which it was executed, provided that no intimation in writing of such death, insanity or revocation shall have been received\nby the Company at the Office or the Registration Office (or such other place as may be specified for the delivery of instruments of proxy in the notice convening the\nmeeting or other document sent therewith) two (2) hours at least before the commencement of the meeting or adjourned meeting, or the taking of the poll, at which the\ninstrument of proxy is used.\n83.

The person so authorised shall be entitled to exercise the same powers on behalf of such corporation\nas the corporation could exercise if it were an individual Member and such corporation shall for the purposes of these Articles be deemed to be present in person at any\nsuch meeting if a person so authorised is present thereat.\n(2) If a clearing house (or its nominee(s)) or a central depository entity, being a corporation, is a Member, it may authorise such persons as it thinks fit to act as its\nrepresentatives at any meeting of the Company or at any meeting of any class of Members provided that the authorisation shall specify the number and class of shares in\nrespect of which each such representative is so authorised. Each person so authorised under the provisions of this Article shall be deemed to have been duly authorised\nwithout further evidence of the facts and be entitled to exercise the same rights and powers on behalf of the clearing house or central depository entity (or its nominee(s))\nas if such person was the registered holder of the shares of the Company held by the clearing house or a central depository entity (or its nominee(s)) including the right to\nvote individually on a show of hands.\n(3) Any reference in these Articles to a duly authorised representative of a Member being a corporation shall mean a representative authorised under the provisions of\nthis Article.\nwww.verify.gov.ky File#: 259316\n-36-\nNO ACTION BY WRITTEN RESOLUTIONS OF MEMBERS\n85.

This Policy is divided into two parts: the first part prohibits\ntrading in certain circumstances and applies to all directors, officers and employees and their respective immediate family members of the Company, and the second part imposes\nspecial additional trading restrictions and applies to all (i) directors of the Company, (ii) executive officers of the Company (together with the directors, “Company Insiders”), (iii)\nthe employees listed on Appendix A (collectively, “Covered Persons”) and (iv) certain other employees that the Company may designate from time to time as “Covered Persons”\nbecause of their position, responsibilities or their actual or potential access to material information.\nOne of the principal purposes of the federal securities laws is to prohibit so-called “insider trading.” Simply stated, insider trading occurs when a person uses material nonpublic\ninformation obtained through involvement with the Company to make decisions to purchase, sell, give away or otherwise trade the Company’s securities or the securities of certain\nother companies or to provide that information to others outside the Company. The prohibitions against insider trading apply to trades, tips and recommendations by virtually any\nperson, including all persons associated with the Company, if the information involved is “material” and “nonpublic.” These terms are defined in this Policy under Part I, Section 3\nbelow. The prohibitions would apply to any director, officer or employee who buys or sells securities on the basis of material nonpublic information that he or she obtained about\nthe Company, its customers, suppliers, partners, competitors or other companies with which the Company has contractual relationships or may be negotiating transactions.\nPART I\n1. Applicability\nThis Policy applies to all trading or other transactions in (i) the Company’s securities, including common stock, options and any other securities that the Company may issue, such\nas preferred stock, notes, bonds and convertible securities, as well as to derivative securities relating to any of the Company’s securities, whether or not issued by the Company\nand (ii) the securities of certain other companies, including common stock, options and other securities issued by those companies as well as derivative securities relating to any of\nthose companies’ securities, where the person trading used information obtained while working for the Company.\nThis Policy applies to all employees and officers of the Company and to all members of the Company’s board of directors and their respective family members.\n2. General Policy: No Trading or Causing Trading While in Possession of Material Nonpublic Information\n(a) No director, officer or employee or any of their immediate family members may purchase or sell, or offer to purchase or sell, any Company security, whether or not issued by the\nCompany, while in possession of material nonpublic information about the Company. (The terms “material” and “nonpublic” are defined in Part I, Section 3(a) and (b) below.)\n(b) No director, officer or employee or any of their immediate family members who knows of any material nonpublic information about the Company may communicate that\ninformation to (“tip”) any other person, including family members and friends, or otherwise disclose such information without the Company’s authorization.\n(c) No director, officer or employee or any of their immediate family members may purchase or sell any security of any other publicly traded company while in possession of\nmaterial nonpublic information that was obtained in the course of his or her involvement with the Company. No director, officer or employee or any of their immediate family\nmembers who knows of any such material nonpublic information may communicate that information to, or tip, any other person, including family members and friends, or otherwise\ndisclose such information without the Company’s authorization.\n(d) For compliance purposes, you should never trade, tip or recommend securities (or otherwise cause the purchase or sale of securities) while in possession of information that\nyou have reason to believe is material and nonpublic unless you first consult with, and obtain the advance approval of, the Compliance Officer (which is defined in Part I, Section\n3(c) below).\n(e) Covered Persons must “pre-clear” all trading in securities of the Company in accordance with the procedures set forth in Part II, Section 3 below.\n3. Definitions\n(a) Material. Insider trading restrictions come into play only if the information you possess is “material.” Materiality, however, involves a relatively low threshold. Information is\ngenerally regarded as “material” if it has market significance, that is, if its public dissemination is likely to affect the market price of securities, or if it otherwise is information that a\nreasonable investor would want to know before making an investment decision.\nInformation dealing with the following subjects is reasonably likely to be found material in particular situations:\n(i) significant changes in the Company’s prospects;\n(ii) significant write-downs in assets or increases in reserves;\n(iii) developments regarding significant litigation or government agency investigations;\n(iv) liquidity problems;\n(v) changes in earnings estimates or unusual gains or losses in major operations;\n(vi) major changes in the Company’s management or the board of directors;\n(vii) changes in dividends;\n(viii) extraordinary borrowings;\n(ix) major changes in accounting methods or policies;\n(x) award or loss of a significant contract;\n(xi) cybersecurity risks and incidents, including vulnerabilities and breaches;\n(xii) changes in debt ratings;\n2\n(xiii) proposals, plans or agreements, even if preliminary in nature, involving mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, recapitalizations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements, or\npurchases or sales of substantial assets; and\n(xiv) offerings of Company securities.\nMaterial information is not limited to historical facts but may also include projections and forecasts. With respect to a future event, such as a merger, acquisition or introduction of\na new product, the point at which negotiations or product development are determined to be material is determined by balancing the probability that the event will occur against\nthe magnitude of the effect the event would have on a company’s operations or stock price should it occur. Thus, information concerning an event that would have a large effect\non stock price, such as a merger, may be material even if the possibility that the event will occur is relatively small. When in doubt about whether particular nonpublic information\nis material, you should presume it is material. If you are unsure whether information is material, you should either consult the Compliance Officer before making any decision to\ndisclose such information (other than to persons who need to know it) or to trade in or recommend securities to which that information relates or assume that the information is\nmaterial.\n(b) Nonpublic. Insider trading prohibitions come into play only when you possess information that is material and “nonpublic.” The fact that information has been disclosed to a\nfew members of the public does not make it public for insider trading purposes. To be “public” the information must have been disseminated in a manner designed to reach\ninvestors generally, and the investors must be given the opportunity to absorb the information. Even after public disclosure of information about the Company, you must wait until\nthe close of business on the second trading day after the information was publicly disclosed before you can treat the information as public.\nNonpublic information may include:\n(i) information available to a select group of analysts or brokers or institutional investors;\n(ii) undisclosed facts that are the subject of rumors, even if the rumors are widely circulated; and\n(iii) information that has been entrusted to the Company on a confidential basis until a public announcement of the information has been made and enough time has elapsed for the\nmarket to respond to a public announcement of the information (normally two trading days).\nAs with questions of materiality, if you are not sure whether information is considered public, you should either consult with the Compliance Officer or assume that the\ninformation is nonpublic and treat it as confidential.\n(c) Compliance Officer. The Company has appointed the Chief Financial Officer as the Compliance Officer for this Policy. The duties of the Compliance Officer include, but are not\nlimited to, the following:\n(i) assisting with implementation and enforcement of this Policy;\n(ii) circulating this Policy to all employees and ensuring that this Policy is amended as necessary to remain up-to-date with insider trading laws;\n(iii) pre-clearing all trading in securities of the Company by Covered Persons in accordance with the procedures set forth in Part II, Section 3 below; and\n3\n(iv) providing approval of any Rule 10b5-1 plans under Part II, Section 1(c) below and any prohibited transactions under Part II, Section 4 below.\n(v) providing a reporting system with an effective whistleblower protection mechanism.\n4. Exceptions\nThe trading restrictions of this Policy do not apply to the following:\n(a) 401(k) Plan. Investing 401(k) plan contributions in a Company stock fund in accordance with the terms of the Company’s 401(k) plan. However, any changes in your\ninvestment election regarding the Company’s stock are subject to trading restrictions under this Policy.\n(b) ESPP. Purchasing Company stock through periodic, automatic payroll contributions to the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”). However, electing to enroll in\nthe ESPP, making any changes in your elections under the ESPP and selling any Company stock acquired under the ESPP are subject to trading restrictions under this Policy.\n(c) Options. Exercising stock options granted under the Company’s equity incentive plan for cash or the delivery of previously owned Company stock. However, the sale of any\nshares issued on the exercise of Company-granted stock options and any cashless exercise of Company-granted stock options are subject to trading restrictions under this Policy.\n5. Violations of Insider Trading Laws\nPenalties for trading on or communicating material nonpublic information can be severe, both for individuals involved in such unlawful conduct and their employers and\nsupervisors, and may include jail terms, criminal fines, civil penalties and civil enforcement injunctions. Given the severity of the potential penalties, compliance with this Policy is\nabsolutely mandatory.\n(a) Legal Penalties. A person who violates insider trading laws by engaging in transactions in a company’s securities when he or she has material nonpublic information can be\nsentenced to a substantial jail term and required to pay a criminal penalty of several times the amount of profits gained or losses avoided.\nIn addition, a person who tips others may also be liable for transactions by the tippees to whom he or she has disclosed material nonpublic information. Tippers can be subject to\nthe same penalties and sanctions as the tippees, and the SEC has imposed large penalties even when the tipper did not profit from the transaction.\nThe SEC can also seek substantial civil penalties from any person who, at the time of an insider trading violation, “directly or indirectly controlled the person who committed such\nviolation,” which would apply to the Company and/or management and supervisory personnel. These control persons may be held liable for up to the greater of $2,301,065 or three\ntimes the amount of the profits gained or losses avoided. Even for violations that result in a small or no profit, the SEC can seek penalties from a company and/or its management\nand supervisory personnel as control persons.\n(b) Company-Imposed Penalties. Employees who violate this Policy may be subject to disciplinary action by the Company, including dismissal for cause. Any exceptions to the\nPolicy, if permitted, may only be granted by the Compliance Officer and must be provided before any activity contrary to the above requirements takes place.\n4\n6. Inquiries\nIf you have any questions regarding any of the provisions of this Policy, please contact the Compliance Officer.\nPART II\n1. Blackout Periods\nAll Covered Persons are prohibited from trading in the Company’s securities during blackout periods as defined below.\n(a) Blackout Periods. Trading in the Company’s securities is prohibited during the period beginning at the close of the market on two weeks before the end of each fiscal interim\nperiod and fiscal year and ending at the close of business on the second trading day following the date the Company’s financial results are publicly disclosed and Form 10-Q or\nForm 10-K is filed/and Form 6-K or Form 20-F is filed. During these periods, Covered Persons generally possess or are presumed to possess material nonpublic information about\nthe Company’s financial results.\n(b) Other Blackout Periods. From time to time, other types of material nonpublic information regarding the Company (such as negotiation of mergers, acquisitions or dispositions,\ninvestigation and assessment of cybersecurity incidents or new product developments) may be pending and not be publicly disclosed. While such material nonpublic information\nis pending, the Company may impose special blackout periods during which Covered Persons are prohibited from trading in the Company’s securities. If the Company imposes a\nspecial blackout period, it will notify the Covered Persons affected.\n(c) Exception. These trading restrictions do not apply to transactions under a pre-existing written plan, contract, instruction, or arrangement under Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934 (an “Approved 10b5-1 Plan”) that meet the following requirements:\n(i) it has been reviewed and approved by the Compliance Officer at least five days in advance of being entered into (or, if revised or amended, such proposed revisions or\namendments have been reviewed and approved by the Compliance Officer at least five days in advance of being entered into);\n(ii) it provides that no trades may occur thereunder until expiration of the applicable cooling-off period specified in Rule 10b5-1(c)(ii)(B), and no trades occur until after that time.\nThe appropriate cooling-off period will vary based on the status of the Covered Person. For directors and officers, the cooling-off period ends on the later of (x) ninety days after\nadoption or certain modifications of the 10b5-1 plan; or (y) two business days following disclosure of the Company’s financial results in a Form 10-Q or Form 10-K/Form 20-F or\nForm 6-K for the quarter in which the 10b5-1 plan was adopted. For all other Covered Persons, the cooling-off period ends 30 days after adoption or modification of the 10b5-1 plan.\nThis required cooling-off period will apply to the entry into a new 10b5-1 plan and any revision or modification of a 10b5-1 plan;\n(iii) it is entered into in good faith by the Covered Person, and not as part of a plan or scheme to evade the prohibitions of Rule 10b5-1, at a time when the Covered Person is not in\npossession of material nonpublic information about the Company; and, if the Covered Person is a director or officer, the 10b5-1 plan must include representations by the Covered\nPerson certifying to that effect;\n5\n(iv) it gives a third party the discretionary authority to execute such purchases and sales, outside the control of the Covered Person, so long as such third party does not possess\nany material nonpublic information about the Company; or explicitly specifies the security or securities to be purchased or sold, the number of shares, the prices and/or dates of\ntransactions, or other formula(s) describing such transactions; and\n(iv) it is the only outstanding Approved 10b5-1 Plan entered into by the Covered Person (subject to the exceptions set out in Rule 10b5-1(c)(ii)(D)).\nNo Approved 10b5-1 Plan may be adopted during a blackout period.\nIf you are considering entering into, modifying or terminating an Approved 10b5-1 Plan or have any questions regarding Approved Rule 10b5-1 Plans, please contact the\nCompliance Officer. You should consult your own legal and tax advisors before entering into, or modifying or terminating, an Approved 10b5-1 Plan. A trading plan, contract,\ninstruction or arrangement will not qualify as an Approved 10b5-1 Plan without the prior review and approval of the Compliance Officer as described above.\n2. Trading Window\nCovered Persons are permitted to trade in the Company’s securities when no blackout period is in effect. However, even during this trading window, a Covered Person who is in\npossession of any material nonpublic information should not trade in the Company’s securities until the information has been made publicly available or is no longer material. In\naddition, the Company may close this trading window if a special blackout period under Part II, Section 1(b) above is imposed and will re-open the trading window once the special\nblackout period has ended.\n3. Pre-Clearance of Securities Transactions\n(a) Because Company Insiders are likely to obtain material nonpublic information on a regular basis, the Company requires all such persons to refrain from trading, even during a\ntrading window under Part II, Section 2 above, without first pre-clearing all transactions in the Company’s securities.\n(b) Subject to the exemption in subsection (d) below, no Company Insider may, directly or indirectly, purchase or sell (or otherwise make any transfer, gift, pledge or loan of) any\nCompany security at any time without first obtaining prior approval from the Compliance Officer. These procedures also apply to transactions by such person’s spouse, other\npersons living in such person’s household and minor children and to transactions by entities over which such person exercises control.\n(c) The Compliance Officer shall record the date each request is received and the date and time each request is approved or disapproved. Unless revoked, a grant of permission will\nnormally remain valid until the close of trading two business days following the day on which it was granted. If the transaction does not occur during the two-day period, pre-\nclearance of the transaction must be re-requested.\n(d) Pre-clearance is not required for purchases and sales of securities under an Approved 10b5-1 Plan once the applicable cooling-off period has expired. No trades may be made\nunder an Approved 10b5-1 Plan until expiration of the applicable cooling-off period. With respect to any purchase or sale under an Approved 10b5-1 Plan, the third party effecting\ntransactions on behalf of the Company Insider should be instructed to send duplicate confirmations of all such transactions to the Compliance Officer.\n6\n4. Prohibited Transactions\n(a) Company Insiders are prohibited from trading in the Company’s equity securities during a blackout period imposed under an “individual account” retirement or pension plan of\nthe Company, during which at least 50% of the plan participants are unable to purchase, sell or otherwise acquire or transfer an interest in equity securities of the Company, due to\na temporary suspension of trading by the Company or the plan fiduciary.\n(b) Covered Persons, including any person’s spouse, other persons living in such person’s household and minor children and entities over which such person exercises control,\nare prohibited from engaging in the following transactions in the Company’s securities unless advance approval is obtained from the Compliance Officer:\n(i) Short-term trading. Company Insiders who purchase Company securities may not sell any Company securities of the same class for at least six months after the purchase;\n(ii) Short sales. Company Insiders and Covered Persons may not sell the Company’s securities short;\n(iii) Options trading. Covered Persons may not buy or sell puts or calls or other derivative securities on the Company’s securities;\n(iv) Trading on margin or pledging. Covered Persons may not hold Company securities in a margin account or pledge Company securities as collateral for a loan; and\n(v) Hedging. Covered Persons may not enter into hedging or monetization transactions or similar arrangements with respect to Company securities.\n5.

If any amounts cannot be included within the Net Payment, such amounts shall be excluded but may still be netted against any other similarly excluded amounts.\nUpon the occurrence of a Setoff Event, each Coinbase Entity may also (a) liquidate, apply and set off any or all Client Assets (as such term is defined in the MTA) against any Net\nPayment, unpaid trade credits, or any other obligation owed by Client to any Coinbase Entity and (b) set off and net any Net Payment or any other obligation owed to the Client by\nany Coinbase Entity against (i) any or all collateral or margin posted by any Coinbase Entity to Client (or the U.S. dollar value thereof, determined by Coinbase in its sole discretion\non the basis of a recent price at which the relevant Digital Asset was sold to customers on the Trading Platform); and (ii) any Net Payment, unpaid trade credits or any other\nobligation owed by Client to any Coinbase Entity (in each case, whether matured or unmatured, fixed or contingent, or liquidated or unliquidated).

Client\nTo the extent Client is a natural person over 18 years of age, if Coinbase receives legal documentation confirming Client’s death or other information leading Coinbase to believe\nClient is deceased, Coinbase will freeze Client’s Prime Broker Account (“Freeze Period”). During the Freeze Period, no transactions may be completed until: (i) Client’s designated\nfiduciary has opened a new Prime Broker Account, as further described below, and the entirety of Client’s Prime Broker Account has been transferred to such new Prime Broker\nAccount, or (ii) Client has received proof in a form satisfactory to Coinbase that Client is not deceased. If Coinbase has reason to believe Client is deceased but Coinbase does not\nhave proof of Client’s death in a form satisfactory to Coinbase, Client authorizes Coinbase to make inquiries, whether directly or through third parties, that Coinbase considers\nnecessary to ascertain whether Client is deceased. Upon receipt by Coinbase of proof satisfactory to Coinbase that Client is deceased, the fiduciary Client designated in a valid will\nor similar testamentary document will be required to open a new Prime Broker Account. If Client has not designated a fiduciary, then Coinbase reserves the right to (i) treat as\nClient’s fiduciary any person entitled to inherit Client’s Prime Broker Account, as determined by Coinbase upon receipt and review of the documentation Coinbase, in its sole and\nabsolute discretion, deems necessary or appropriate, including (but not limited to) a will, a living trust or a Small Estate Affidavit, or (ii) require an order designating a fiduciary from\na court having competent jurisdiction over Client’s estate. In the event Coinbase determines, in its sole and absolute discretion, that there is uncertainty regarding the validity of\nthe fiduciary designation, Coinbase reserves the right to require an order resolving such issue from a court of competent jurisdiction before taking any action relating to Client’s\nPrime Broker Account. Pursuant to the above, the opening of a new Prime Broker Account by a designated fiduciary is mandatory following the death of Client, and Client hereby\nagrees that its fiduciary shall be required to open a new Prime Broker Account and provide required account opening information to gain access to the contents of Client’s Prime\nBroker Account.\n35. Counterparts\nThis Coinbase Prime Broker Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, including by facsimile or email of .pdf signatures or DocuSign (or similar electronic signature\nsoftware), each of which shall be deemed to be an original document, but all such separate counterparts shall constitute only one and the same Coinbase Prime Broker Agreement.\n[Signatures on following page]\n13\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have caused this Coinbase Prime Broker Agreement, including the Custody Agreement and MTA, to be duly executed and delivered as of\nthe date below.\nCOINBASE, INC. For itself and as agent for the Coinbase Entities\nBy: /s/ Alejandra Ugarte\nName: Alejandra Ugarte\nTitle: Authorized Signatory\nDate: January 6, 2023\nCLIENT: Mercurity Fintech Technology Holding Inc.\nBy: /s/ Shi Qiu\nName: Shi Qiu\nTitle: CEO\nDate: January 3, 2023\nAddress:1330 avenue of Americas Fl33, New York 10019\nE-Mail:\n14\nEXHIBIT A\nto the Coinbase Prime Broker Agreement\nCOINBASE CUSTODY CUSTODIAL SERVICES AGREEMENT\nThis Custody Agreement is entered into between Client and Coinbase Custody and forms a part of the Coinbase Prime Broker Agreement between the Client and the Coinbase\nEntities. Capitalized terms used in this Custody Agreement that are not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the other parts of the Coinbase Prime Broker\nAgreement.\n1. Custodial Services.\nCoinbase Custody shall provide Client with a segregated custody account controlled and secured by Coinbase Custody (“Custodial Account”) to store certain Digital Assets\nsupported by Coinbase Custody, on Client’s behalf (“Custodial Services”). Coinbase Custody is a fiduciary under § 100 of the New York Banking Law and a qualified custodian for\npurposes of Rule 206(4)-2(d)(6) under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and is licensed to custody Client’s Digital Assets in trust on Client’s behalf. Digital\nAssets in Client’s Custodial Account shall (i) be segregated from the assets held by Coinbase Custody as principal and the assets of other customers of Coinbase Custody, (ii) not\nbe treated as general assets of Coinbase Custody, and except as otherwise provided herein, Coinbase Custody shall have no right, title or interest in such Digital Assets, (iii)\nconstitute custodial assets and Client’s property. In addition, Coinbase Custody shall maintain adequate capital and reserves to the extent required by applicable law and shall not,\ndirectly or indirectly, lend, pledge, hypothecate or re-hypothecate any Digital Assets in the Custodial Account.\n2. Custodial Account.\n2.1 In General. The Custodial Services shall permit the Client (i) to hold its Vault Balance in its Custodial Account and transfer Digital Assets to and from its Trading Balance,\n(ii) to deposit supported Digital Assets from a public blockchain address controlled by Client into its Custodial Account, (iii) withdraw supported Digital Assets from its\nCustodial Account to a public blockchain address controlled by Client and (iv) certain additional services as may be agreed to between the Client and Coinbase Custody\nfrom time to time. Each such deposit or withdrawal shall be referred to as a “Custody Transaction” and shall conform to Instructions provided by Client through the\nCoinbase Prime Broker Site. Client shall only withdraw or deposit Digital Assets to public blockchain addresses and accounts owned by Client or an address for which\nClient has conducted the necessary Know Your Customer (“KYC”) and anti-money laundering (“AML”) due diligence. Digital Assets shall be held in Client’s Custodial\nAccount in accordance with the terms of this Custody Agreement and shall not be commingled with other clients’ Digital Assets. Coinbase Custody reserves the right to\nrefuse to process or to cancel any pending Custody Transaction to comply with applicable law or in response to a subpoena, court order or other binding government\norder, or to enforce transaction, threshold and condition limits, or if Coinbase Custody reasonably believes that the Custody Transaction may violate or facilitate the\nviolation of an applicable law, regulation or rule of a governmental authority or self-regulatory organization.\n2.2 Digital Asset Deposits and Withdrawals. Coinbase Custody will process supported Digital Asset Custody Transaction according to the Instruction received from Client\nor Client’s Authorized Representatives, and Coinbase Custody does not guarantee the identity of any user, receiver, requestee or other party. Client must verify all\ndeposit and withdrawal information prior to submitting Instructions to Coinbase Custody regarding a Custody Transaction. Coinbase Custody shall have no liability,\nobligation, or responsibility whatsoever for Client Digital Asset transfers sent to or received from a wrong party or sent or received with inaccurate Instructions. Coinbase\nCustody reserves the right to charge network fees (including miner fees) to process a Custody Transaction on Client’s behalf. Coinbase Custody will calculate the\nnetwork fee, if any, in its sole and absolute discretion, although Coinbase Custody will always notify Client of the network fee at or before the time Client authorizes the\nCustody Transaction. Coinbase Custody reserves the right to delay any Custody Transaction if it perceives a risk of fraud or illegal activity.\n15\n2.3 Digital Asset Storage and Transmission Delays. Coinbase Custody requires up to twenty-four (24) hours between any request to withdraw Digital Assets from Client’s\nCustodial Account and submission of Client’s withdrawal to the applicable Digital Asset network. Since Coinbase Custody securely stores all Digital Asset private keys\nin offline storage, it may be necessary to retrieve certain information from offline storage in order to facilitate a withdrawal in accordance with Client’s Instructions, which\nmay delay the initiation or crediting of such withdrawal. Client acknowledges and agrees that a Custody Transaction may be delayed, and that Digital Assets shall not be\ndeposited or withdrawn upon less than twenty-four (24) hours’ notice initiated from Client’s Custodial Account. The time of such request shall be the time such notice is\ntransmitted from Client’s Custodial Account. Coinbase Custody makes no representations or warranties with respect to the availability and/or accessibility of (1) the\nDigital Assets, (2) a Custody Transaction, (3) the Custodial Account, or (4) the Custodial Services. While Coinbase Custody will make reasonable efforts to process Client\ninitiated deposits in a timely manner, Coinbase Custody makes no representations or warranties regarding the amount of time needed to complete processing as such\nprocessing is dependent upon many factors outside of Coinbase Custody’s control.\n2.4 Supported Digital Assets. The Custodial Services are available only in connection with those Digital Assets that Coinbase Custody, in its sole discretion, decides to\nsupport, which may change from time to time. Prior to initiating a deposit of Digital Asset to Coinbase Custody, Client must confirm that Coinbase Custody offers\nCustodial Services for that specific Digital Asset. By initiating a deposit of any Digital Asset to a Custodial Account, Client attests that Client has confirmed that the\nDigital Asset being transferred is a supported Digital Asset offered by Coinbase Custody. Under no circumstances should Client attempt to use the Custodial Services to\ndeposit or store Digital Assets in any forms that are not supported by Coinbase Custody. Depositing or attempting to deposit Digital Assets that are not supported by\nCoinbase Custody may result in such Digital Asset being irretrievable by Client and Coinbase Custody. Client shall be fully responsible and liable, and Coinbase Custody\nshall have no liability, obligation, or responsibility whatsoever, regarding any unsupported Digital Asset sent or attempted to be sent to it, or regarding any attempt to use\nthe Custodial Services for Digital Assets that Coinbase Custody does not support. Digital Assets supported by Coinbase Custody shall be listed on the Coinbase Prime\nBroker Site. Coinbase Custody recommends that Client deposit a small amount of supported Digital Asset as a test prior to initiating a deposit of a significant amount of\nsupported Digital Asset. Coinbase Custody shall provide Client with thirty (30) days’ written notice before ceasing to support a Digital Asset, unless Coinbase Custody\nis required to cease such support by court order, statute, law, rule (including a self-regulatory organization rule), regulation, code, or other similar requirement.\n2.5 Use of the Custodial Services. Client acknowledges and agrees that Coinbase Custody may monitor use of the Custodial Account and the Custodial Services and the\nresulting information may be utilized, reviewed, retained and or disclosed by Coinbase Custody for its internal purposes or in accordance with the rules of any applicable\nlegal, regulatory or self-regulatory organization or as otherwise may be required to comply with relevant law, sanctions programs, legal process or government request.\n2.6 Independent Verification. If Client is subject to Rule 206(4)-2 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, Coinbase Custody shall, upon written request, provide Client’s\nauthorized independent public accountant confirmation of or access to information sufficient to confirm (i) Client’s Digital Assets as of the date of an examination\nconducted pursuant to Rule 206(4)-2(a)(4), and (ii) Client’s Digital Assets are held either in a separate account under Client’s name or in accounts under Client’s name as\nagent or trustee for Client’s clients.\n16\n2.7 Third Party Payments. The Custodial Services are not intended to facilitate third party payments of any kind. As such, Coinbase Custody has no control over, or liability\nfor, the delivery, quality, safety, legality or any other aspect of any goods or services that Client may purchase or sell to or from a third party (including other users of\nCustodial Services) involving Digital Assets that Client intends to store, or have stored, in Client’s Custodial Account.\n2.8 Termination, and Cancellation. If Coinbase Custody closes Client’s Custodial Account or terminates Client’s use of the Custodial Services, Client will be permitted to\nwithdraw Digital Assets associated with Client’s Custodial Account for a period of up to ninety (90) days following the date of deactivation or cancellation to the extent\nnot prohibited (i) under applicable law, including applicable sanctions programs, or (ii) by a facially valid subpoena, court order, or binding order of a government\nauthority.\n3. Coinbase Custody Obligations\n3.1 Bookkeeping. Coinbase Custody shall keep timely and accurate records as to the deposit, disbursement, investment and reinvestment of the Digital Assets, as required\nby applicable law and in accordance with Coinbase Custody’s internal document retention policies.\n3.2 Insurance. Coinbase Custody shall obtain and maintain, at its sole expense, insurance coverage in such types and amounts as shall be commercially reasonable for the\nCustodial Services provided hereunder.\n4. Additional Matters\nIn addition to any additional service providers that may be described in an addendum or attachment hereto, Client acknowledges and agrees that the Custodial Services may be\nprovided from time to time by, through or with the assistance of affiliates of, or vendors to, Coinbase Custody. Client shall receive notice of any material change in the entities that\nprovide the Custodial Services.\n[Remainder of page intentionally left blank]\n17\nEXHIBIT B\nto the Coinbase Prime Broker Agreement\nCOINBASE MASTER TRADING AGREEMENT\nClient should carefully consider whether trading or holding Digital Assets is suitable for its purpose, including in relation to Client’s knowledge of Digital Assets and Digital Asset\nmarkets and Client’s financial condition. All investments involve risk, and the past performance of a financial product does not guarantee future results or returns.\nThis Master Trading Agreement (“MTA”) sets forth the terms and conditions for clients to trade Digital Assets through the Coinbase prime broker execution platform (“Trading\nPlatform”) and forms a part of the Coinbase Prime Broker Agreement between Client and the Coinbase Entities. Pursuant to this MTA, Coinbase shall open a Trading Account for\nthe Client on the Trading Platform consisting of linked accounts at Coinbase and Coinbase Custody, each accessible via the Trading Platform (“Trading Account”). The Trading\nPlatform shall provide Client with access to trade execution and automated trade routing services and Coinbase Execution Services (as defined below) to enable Clients to submit\norders (“Orders”) to purchase and sell specified Digital Assets in accordance with this MTA and the Coinbase Trading Rules set forth at\nhttps://www.coinbase.com/legal/trading_rules or a successor website (as amended and updated from time to time, the “Coinbase Trading Rules”) (such services, the “Trading\nServices”). Capitalized terms used in this MTA that are not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the other parts of the Coinbase Prime Broker Agreement.\n1. Order Routing and Connected Trading Venue\n1.1 The Trading Platform operates a trade execution service through which Client may submit Orders to purchase or sell Digital Assets. After Client submits an Order, the\nTrading Platform will automatically route the Order (or a portion of the Order) to one of the trading venues to which the Trading Platform has established connections\n(each such venue, a “Connected Trading Venue”). Each Order will be sent, processed and settled at each Connected Trading Venue to which it is routed. Once an Order\nto purchase Digital Assets has been placed, the associated Client Assets (as defined below) used to fund the Order will be placed on hold and will generally not be\neligible for other use or withdrawal.\n1.2 With each Connected Trading Venue, Coinbase shall establish an account in its name, or in its name for the benefit of clients, to trade on behalf of its clients, and the\nestablishment of a Trading Account will not cause Client to have a direct legal relationship, or account with, any Connected Trading Venue. The Trading Platform will not\nintentionally match the buy and sell orders of its clients against each other and will not intentionally settle Orders against or otherwise trade with Coinbase’s principal\nfunds. Client acknowledges that Coinbase and its other clients may trade in their own interests on the Connected Trading Venues and could, therefore, be the\ncounterparty to a Client Order on a Connected Trading Venue.\n1.3 Client acknowledges that Coinbase has sole discretion to determine the Connected Trading Venues with which it will establish connections. Coinbase will direct Orders to\nthe Connected Trading Venues on an automated basis and generally will not manually route orders. In designing algorithms that determine an Order’s routing logic,\nCoinbase considers a variety of factors relating to the Order and the Connected Trading Venues, including the speed of execution, whether the venue is able to\nconsummate off-chain transactions, the availability of efficient and reliable systems, the level of service provided, and the cost of executing orders. Coinbase may receive\ncash payments or other financial incentives (such as reciprocal business arrangements) from Connected Trading Venues.\n18\n1.4 Coinbase makes no representation or warranty of any kind regarding any Connected Trading Venue, including as to its financial condition, data, security or quality of its\nexecution services, and shall have no liability, obligation, or responsibility whatsoever for the selection or performance of any Connected Trading Venue. Digital Assets\nmay trade at different prices on different trading venues, and other Connected Trading Venues and/or trading venues not used by Coinbase may offer better prices and/or\nlower costs than the Connected Trading Venue used to execute Client’s Order.\n1.5 Coinbase acts in an agency capacity for purposes of certain Orders, and may also act in a principal capacity for certain other Orders, as specified in the Coinbase Trading\nRules. In the Request For Quotation (“RFQ”) service, Coinbase may act as principal to fill Orders by providing indicative firm pricing in accordance with a variety of\nmarket factors, at its sole discretion. Each Client should independently evaluate whether such services are appropriate given its own investing profile and sophistication,\namong other considerations.\n2. Client Trading Balance and Vault Balance\n2.1 For purposes of this MTA, Client’s Digital Assets are referred to as “Client Digital Assets,” Client’s cash is referred to as “Client Cash,” and Client Digital Assets and\nClient Cash are together referred to as “Client Assets.”\n2.2 Within the Trading Platform, Coinbase provides access to two types of accounts with balances relating to Client Assets: (1) the “Trading Balance” (as described below in\nSection 2.3) and (2) the “Vault Balance” (as described below in Section 2.5). The Trading Account provides a record of both the Trading Balance and the Vault Balance.\nClient determines the allocation of its Client Digital Assets between the Trading Balance and the Vault Balance. Maintenance of the Vault Balance shall be subject to the\nterms of the Custody Agreement; provided, however, Client’s Trading Balance is separate from any Digital Assets Client maintains directly with Coinbase Custody.\n2.3 Client Digital Assets credited to the Trading Balance are immediately available to Client for purposes of submitting an Order. Coinbase holds Digital Assets credited to the\nTrading Balance in one of three ways: (i) in omnibus hot wallets (each, an “Omnibus Hot Wallet”); (ii) in omnibus cold wallets (each, an “Omnibus Cold Wallet”); and (iii)\nin Coinbase’s accounts with the Connected Trading Venues (“Coinbase Connected Trading Venue Digital Asset Balance”). Client agrees that Coinbase has sole\ndiscretion in determining the allocation of Digital Assets credited to the Trading Balance. Because Digital Assets credited to the Trading Balance are held on an omnibus\nbasis and because of the nature of certain Digital Assets, Client does not have an identifiable claim to any particular Digital Asset. Instead, Client’s Trading Balance\nrepresents an entitlement to a pro rata share of the Digital Assets Coinbase has allocated to the Omnibus Hot Wallets, Omnibus Cold Wallets and Coinbase Connected\nTrading Venue Digital Asset Balance. Coinbase relies on the Connected Trading Venues for the Coinbase Connected Trading Venue Digital Asset Balance, and Client has\nno contractual relationship with the Connected Trading Venues with respect to Digital Assets credited to the Trading Balance.\n2.4 Client may maintain Client Cash in the Trading Balance but not in the Vault Balance. Coinbase holds Client Cash credited to the Trading Balance in one of two ways: (i) in\none or more omnibus accounts in Coinbase’s name for the benefit of customers at one or more U.S. insured depository institutions (each, an “FBO account”) and (ii) in\nCoinbase’s omnibus accounts at Connected Trading Venues. Coinbase will title the FBO accounts it maintains with U.S. depository institutions and maintain records of\nClient’s interest in a manner designed to enable receipt of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) deposit insurance, where applicable and up to the deposit\ninsurance limits applicable under FDIC regulations and guidance, on Client Cash for the Client’s benefit on a pass-through basis. Coinbase does not guarantee that pass-\nthrough FDIC deposit insurance will apply to Client Cash, since such insurance is dependent in part on compliance of the depository institutions. Coinbase may also title\nits accounts at some or all Connected Trading Venues and maintain records of Client interests in those accounts in a manner consistent with FDIC requirements for pass-\nthrough deposit insurance, but availability of pass-through deposit insurance, up to the deposit insurance limits applicable under FDIC regulations and guidance, is also\ndependent on the actions of the Connected Trading Venues and any depository institutions they use, which may not be structured to provide pass-through deposit\ninsurance. FDIC insurance applies to cash deposits at banks and other insured depository institutions in the event of a failure of that institution, and does not apply to\nany Coinbase Entity or to any Digital Asset held by a Coinbase Entity on Client’s behalf. Client Cash is immediately available to Client for purposes of submitting an\nOrder, unless a restriction applies.\n19\n2.5 At Client’s election, all or a portion of Client Digital Assets may also be allocated to the Vault Balance which is held in a Custodial Account in Client’s name at Coinbase\nCustody pursuant to the Custody Agreement. Such Vault Balance will be divided between segregated hot storage in Client’s name (“Hot Vault Balance”) and segregated\ncold storage in Client’s name (“Cold Vault Balance”). Client shall have sole discretion to allocate Digital Assets between the Hot Vault Balance and Cold Vault Balance.\nDigital Assets in the Hot Vault Balance may be transferred immediately to Client’s Trading Balance unless a restriction applies. A transfer of Digital Assets in the Cold\nVault Balance to Client’s Trading Balance will be subject to Coinbase Custody’s standard cold storage withdrawal procedures. Client hereby appoints Coinbase as\nClient’s agent for purposes of instructing Coinbase Custody to transfer Client Digital Assets between Client’s Vault Balance and Client’s Trading Balance. Client agrees\nthat an Instruction to Coinbase to settle an Order to or from Client’s Vault Balance constitutes authorization to Coinbase to transfer Client Digital Assets to or from\nClient’s Vault Balance as necessary or appropriate to consummate such settlement.\n2.6 In all circumstances and consistent with laws and regulations applicable to Coinbase, Coinbase will keep an internal ledger that specifies the Client Assets credited to\nClient’s Trading Balance and enables Coinbase and its auditors and regulators to identify Client and the Client Assets.\n2.7 Coinbase treats all Client Assets as custodial assets held for the benefit of Client. No Client Assets credited to the Trading Balance shall be considered to be the property\nof, or loaned to, Coinbase, except as provided in any loan agreement between Client and any Coinbase Entity. Neither Coinbase nor any Coinbase Entity will sell, transfer,\nloan, rehypothecate or otherwise alienate Client’s Assets credited to Client’s Trading Balance unless instructed by Client pursuant to an agreement between Client and a\nCoinbase Entity.\n3. Role of Coinbase Custody\n3.1 To facilitate the Trading Services, Coinbase may at its sole discretion maintain portions of the Omnibus Hot Wallet and the Omnibus Cold Wallet in one or more custodial\nFBO accounts with its affiliate, Coinbase Custody. In such circumstances, although the Omnibus Hot Wallet and the Omnibus Cold Wallet are held in Coinbase’s FBO\naccounts with Coinbase Custody, Client’s legal relationship for purposes of Digital Assets held in the Omnibus Hot Wallet and the Omnibus Cold Wallet will not be,\ndirectly or indirectly, with Coinbase Custody and the terms, conditions and agreements relating to those wallets are to be governed by this MTA.\n3.2 Client Digital Assets held in the Hot Vault Balance and Cold Vault Balance are maintained directly between Client and Coinbase Custody in Client’s name and are subject\nto the terms of the Client’s Custody Agreement.\n20\n4. Cash and Digital Asset Deposits and Withdrawals\n4.1 To deposit Client Cash, Client must initiate a transfer from a linked bank account, a wire transfer, a SWIFT transfer, a Silvergate Exchange Network deposit or other form of\nelectronic payment approved by Coinbase from time to time to Coinbase’s bank account, the instructions for which are available on the Coinbase Prime Broker Site.\nCoinbase will credit the Trading Balance with Client Cash once the associated cash is delivered to Coinbase.\n4.2 To withdraw Client Cash, Client may also initiate a withdrawal of Client Cash from the Trading Balance at any time using the withdrawal function on the Trading Platform.\n4.3 To deposit Client Digital Assets, Clients may transfer Client Digital Assets directly to the Omnibus Hot Wallet or Omnibus Cold Wallet, the instructions for which are\navailable on the Coinbase Prime Broker Site. Client may transfer funds to and among its Hot Vault Balance or Cold Vault Balance. When Client transfers Digital Assets to\nCoinbase or Coinbase Custody, it delivers custody and control of the Digital Assets to Coinbase, Coinbase Custody or Coinbase’s designee, as applicable. Client\nrepresents and warrants that any Digital Asset so transferred shall be free and clear of all liens, claims and encumbrances.\n4.4 To withdraw Client Digital Assets, Client must provide applicable Instructions via the Coinbase Prime Broker Site (“Withdrawal Transfer”). Once Client has initiated a\nWithdrawal Transfer, the associated Client Digital Assets will be in a pending state and will not be included in the Client’s Trading Balance or Vault Balance. Client\nacknowledges that Coinbase may not be able to reverse a Withdrawal Transfer once initiated. Client may withdraw Client Digital Assets at any time, subject to delays for\nDigital Assets held in Cold Vault Balance, and any applicable account restrictions.\n4.5 Client must verify all transaction information prior to submitting withdrawal Instructions to Coinbase, as Coinbase cannot and does not guarantee the identity of the\nwallet owner or bank account to which Client is sending Client Digital Assets or Client Cash, as applicable. Coinbase shall have no liability, obligation, or responsibility\nwhatsoever for Client Cash or Client Digital Asset transfers sent to or received from an incorrect party or sent or received via inaccurate Instructions.\n5. Disruption to Trading Platform\n5.1 Client acknowledges that electronic facilities and systems such as the Trading Platform are vulnerable to disruption, delay or failure and, consequently, such facilities and\nsystems may be unavailable to Client as a result of foreseeable and unforeseeable events. Client understands and agrees that Coinbase does not guarantee uninterrupted\naccess to the Trading Platform or all features of the Trading Services. Client acknowledges that although Coinbase will attempt to provide notice of any scheduled or\nunscheduled unavailability that would result in Client being unable to access the Trading Platform or the Trading Services, Coinbase cannot guarantee advanced notice to\nClient.\n5.2 Coinbase may, in its sole discretion, take any of the following actions, and in the case of clause (i), shall use reasonable efforts to provide Client with as much prior notice\nas is practicable: (i) halt or suspend Trading Services, including trading on the Trading Platform or the trading of any Digital Assets or currency, or (ii) impose limits on the\namount or size of Client’s Orders. Coinbase shall have no liability, obligation, or responsibility to Client as a result of making any changes to or suspending the Trading\nPlatform.\n21\n6. Coinbase Trading Rules and Order Types\n6.1 Client agrees to comply with the Coinbase Trading Rules in effect at the time of any Order. Client agrees to review and become familiar with the terms of the various types\nof Orders (each an “Order Type”) available through the Trading Service. A detailed description of the terms of all Orders is contained in the Coinbase Trading Rules.\nCoinbase reserves the right to modify the terms of any Order Type and the Coinbase Trading Rules at any time and without prior notice to Client, and Client\nacknowledges that it is solely responsible for ensuring knowledge of applicable Order Types and Coinbase Trading Rules prior to placing an Order.\n6.2 Coinbase may modify the terms of, or cancel, any Order executed on Trading Platform if Coinbase determines in its sole reasonable discretion that the Order was clearly\nerroneous according to the Coinbase Trading Rules. Coinbase shall have no liability, obligation, or responsibility to Client as a result of exercising its rights under this\nSection 6.\n7. Coinbase Supported Digital Assets\nCoinbase determines in its sole discretion which Digital Assets to support for use with the Trading Services, as specified on the Coinbase Prime Broker Site. Not all Digital Assets\nsupported for Custodial Services are also supported for Trading Services.\n8. Coinbase Execution Services\n8.1 At Coinbase’s sole discretion, Client may elect to submit Orders to Coinbase Execution Services (“CES”), a Trading Service through which CES personnel will execute\nOrders on behalf of Client. CES will execute Orders by using automated trade routing services through Client’s Prime Broker Account or by filling Orders on Coinbase’s\nover-the-counter (“OTC”) trading service (“OTC Services”). Coinbase has sole and absolute discretion to accept or reject any Order. Coinbase and Client may\ncommunicate regarding Instructions related to Orders on a mutually agreed communication medium, including instant messaging, email, and telephone.\n8.2 CES brokers Orders on a commercially reasonable basis as Client’s agent and may exercise discretion in executing Orders. Client must pre-fund its Trading Balance and/or\nestablish a credit arrangement with Coinbase prior to submitting Orders. By electing to use CES, Client agrees that it is authorizing CES personnel to access its Prime\nBroker Account to initiate and execute Orders. Client acknowledges that CES personnel will retain access to the Client Prime Broker Account until Client provides\nCoinbase with Instructions to terminate such access. Absent express written agreement between the Parties, Coinbase will accept Orders only from Authorized\nRepresentatives that are designated in the Client’s Prime Broker Account as having trading authority with respect to the Prime Broker Account.\n8.3 For OTC Services, CES personnel will confirm the terms of an Order (which terms shall include asset, quantity, price, settlement timing and fees) with Client prior to\nexecuting the Order. Coinbase has policies and procedures in place that are reasonably designed to prevent the disclosure of any Client identity to its OTC counterparty.\nCoinbase may, in its sole and absolute discretion, accept the following statements (or similar or analogous statements) as Client’s final and binding agreement to the terms\nof an Order: “done,” “I buy,” “bought,” “I sell,” or “sold.” A completed, executed and settled Order will be reflected in Client’s Prime Broker Account.\n22\n8.4 For Orders fulfilled via OTC Services (“OTC Orders”), each of Client’s and its OTC counterparty’s confirmations of the terms of the OTC Order deems such OTC Order as\nbinding and final, and thereby executed. Client’s failure to timely settle an executed OTC Order in accordance with the settlement terms will constitute a default under the\nCoinbase Prime Brokerage Agreement. Upon Client’s default of an OTC Order:\n(a) In addition to all rights under this Coinbase Prime Broker Agreement, Coinbase may exercise any rights of a secured creditor with respect to its interests in\nClient’s assets, and may exercise all other rights under agreements between Client and any of the Coinbase Entities. The Coinbase Entities agree that they will\nexercise their secured creditor rights, including rights to setoff under Section 17 of the General Terms, with respect to Client’s Trading Balance before exercising\ntheir secured creditor rights with respect to the Vault Balance in the Client’s Custodial Account.\n(b) Client hereby grants to Coinbase a continuing first priority security interest in, lien on and right of set off against all of Client’s right, title and interest, whether\nnow owned or existing or hereafter acquired or arising, in Client’s Trading Balance and Vault Balance in the Client’s Custodial Account together with proceeds\nthereof, in order to secure repayment of costs, fees, and all other obligations of Client to Coinbase arising hereunder from time to time. Client shall execute such\ndocuments and take such other actions as Coinbase shall reasonably request in order to perfect and maintain the priority of the Coinbase’s security interest with\nrespect to Client’s Trading Balance and Vault Balance in Client’s Custodial Account.\n(c) Client hereby authorizes Coinbase Custody, as securities intermediary with respect to the Custodial Account, to comply with all instructions and entitlement\norders from Coinbase, as secured party, with respect to the disposition of assets in Client’s Vault Balance in the Custodial Account as contemplated herein\nwithout further consent or direction from Client or any other party. Coinbase Custody agrees to follow such instructions and entitlement orders without further\nconsent or direction from Client or any other party.\n(d) Without prior notice to Client, Coinbase shall have the right to: (i) transfer Client Assets from Client’s Trading Balance to Coinbase to settle the OTC Order\nsubject to default, and/or (ii) liquidate or cancel outstanding OTC Orders (including OTC Orders that have been submitted or are in the process of being fulfilled).\n(e) Without prior notice to Client, Coinbase may suspend or terminate the Client’s ability to receive extensions of credit from Coinbase Credit, regardless of whether\nClient has cured the default.\nIf the above actions are not sufficient to satisfy all obligations of Client to Coinbase in respect of OTC Orders subject to default, Coinbase shall have the right to liquidate any and\nall of Client’s assets and positions held with Coinbase or Coinbase Custody, including the Trading Balance and Vault Balance in Client’s Custodial Account, to cover any Losses\nincurred by Client’s failure to settle the OTC Order. In connection with liquidating such assets, Client authorizes Coinbase, in Coinbase’s sole discretion, to liquidate any of\nClient’s Digital Assets in a commercially reasonable sale at the market price that otherwise applies to such Digital Assets at the time of liquidation, without regard to whether Client\nwould recognize a gain or loss on such sale or would recognize a greater or lesser gain or loss if different Digital Assets were sold. Client understands that the value of Digital\nAssets may rise or fall quickly, and Coinbase has no obligation to liquidate Client’s Digital Assets at a time that provides the best price for Client. Client agrees that Digital Assets\nheld in its Trading Balance and the Vault Balance in Client’s Custodial Account are of a kind or type customarily sold on recognized markets, subject to standard price quotations\nand may decline speedily in value. Client agrees that if Coinbase exercises its setoff rights or secured party remedies against Client’s Digital Assets, that Coinbase may value such\nDigital Assets using the same valuation method and same process that is otherwise used when Digital Assets are sold on the Trading Platform or any other commercially\nreasonable valuation method. A sale by Coinbase of Client’s Digital Assets, without notice, at a private sale using the valuation and method described above shall be a\ncommercially reasonable method of disposition.\n23\n9. Determination of Suitability; All Risks Not Disclosed\nCoinbase’s provision of the Trading Services is neither a recommendation that Client enter into a particular Order nor a representation that any product described on the Trading\nPlatform is suitable or appropriate for Client. Many of the Trading Services described on Trading Platform involve significant risks, and Client should not use the Trading Services\nunless it has fully understood all such risks and has independently determined that such Orders are appropriate. Any discussion of the risks contained in this MTA or on the\nTrading Platform should not be considered to be a disclosure of all risks or a complete discussion of the applicable risks.\n10. Characterization of Trading Services; Not a Registered Broker-Dealer or Investment Adviser\nClient understands and acknowledges that no transactions executed in connection with Client’s Trading Account or the Trading Services are securities transactions, and Coinbase\nis not registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as a broker-dealer or an investment adviser or licensed under any state securities laws. Coinbase is not acting\nas a fiduciary in respect of Client (including in connection with its rights under this MTA) and does not have any responsibility under the standards governing the conduct of\nbroker-dealers, fiduciaries, investment advisers or investment managers. Client agrees and acknowledges that any information or advice provided by Coinbase or any other\nCoinbase Entity does not and will not serve as the basis of any investment decision by Client.\n11. Coinbase Corporate Accounts\nCoinbase and its affiliates may transact through Trading Accounts on the Trading Platform (“Coinbase Corporate Accounts”) for purposes including inventory management, to\nfacilitate Client Orders, and for other corporate purposes. To the extent that a Coinbase Corporate Account transacts on the Trading Platform, the Coinbase Corporate Account (i)\nwill not have any special priority vis-a-vis Client Orders and will be subject to the Coinbase Trading Rules, (ii) will trade only on Market Data available to all Clients, and (iii) will not\naccess any non-public data of other Clients. Coinbase’s internal ledger will indicate the amount of each Digital Asset held for each client and each such Coinbase Corporate\nAccount.\n12. Term, Termination and Suspension\n12.1 Regardless of any other provision of this MTA, Coinbase may, in its sole discretion, suspend, restrict or terminate the Client’s Trading Services, including by suspending,\nrestricting or closing the Client’s Trading Account, in accordance with the General Terms.\n12.2 If Client is subject to termination, Client agrees to transfer any Client Assets off the Trading Platform within thirty (30) days of receipt of the termination notice unless\nsuch transfer is otherwise prohibited (i) under applicable law, including any sanctions programs, or (ii) by a facially valid subpoena or court order. Client agrees to\npromptly provide Coinbase with Instructions as to where its Client Assets should be transferred, and agrees that failure to do so within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice\nof termination may result in Client Assets being transferred to the Client’s linked bank account or Digital Asset wallet on file, in each case subject to off-set for any\noutstanding obligations to any Coinbase Entity in accordance with the General Terms. Final disbursement of assets may be delayed until any remaining obligations or\nindebtedness have been satisfied. Client is responsible for all debits, costs, commissions, and losses arising from any actions Coinbase must take to liquidate or close\ntransactions in the Client’s Trading Account.\n13. Unclaimed Property\nIf Coinbase is holding Client Assets in the Trading Balance, has no record of Client’s use of the Trading Services for an extended period, and is otherwise unable to contact Client,\nCoinbase may be required under applicable laws, rules or regulations to report these assets as unclaimed property and to deliver such unclaimed property to the applicable\nauthority. Coinbase may deduct a dormancy fee or other administrative charge from such unclaimed funds, as permitted by applicable laws, rules or regulations.\n24"
