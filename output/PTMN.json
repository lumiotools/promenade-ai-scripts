Additionally, the reinvestment period was extended from April 29, 2025 to August 29, 2026, and the maturity date was extended from April 29, 2026 to August 29, 2027. Finally, using the amended JPM Credit Facility, the Company refinanced the remaining $85.0 million of the Senior Secured Notes, due November 20, 2029 and issued by Portman Ridge Funding 2018-2 LLC (the “2018-2 Secured Notes”), on August 20, 2024.\n\n\n\n**Subsequent Events**\n\n  * On November 7, 2024, the Company declared a cash distribution of $0.69 per share of common stock. The distribution is payable on November 29, 2024 to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 19, 2024.\n\n\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n**Ted Goldthorpe , Chief Executive Officer of Portman Ridge**, stated, “Following the strong earnings we saw in the first half of 2024, the Company’s third quarter earnings were temporarily impacted by prudent cash and portfolio management initiatives prior to successfully refinancing the 2018-2 Secured Notes. However, I am very pleased with the work we did on the right-side of the balance sheet and the substantial improvements we made to the Company’s debt capital structure. Specifically, the Company upsized and termed out the JPM Credit Facility, while also reducing the spread by a full 30 basis points. Further, using the upsized and lower cost JPM Credit Facility, the Company refinanced the remaining $85.0 million of 2018-2 Secured Notes at the end of August, which resulted in further net spread savings of approximately 28 basis points. These savings are significant, and the Company’s new lower cost of financing positions the Company well for the future.\n\nWith that in mind, we continue to believe our stock remains undervalued and thus we continued repurchasing shares during the third quarter of 2024 under our Rule 10b-5 stock repurchase program. Specifically, during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 33,429 shares in the open market for an aggregate cost of approximately $0.6 million, which was accretive to NAV by $0.01 per share and reinforces our commitment to increasing shareholder value.\n\nLooking ahead to the final quarter of 2024 and the beginning of 2025, with the Company’s balance sheet fortified by the amended lower cost JPM Credit Facility, we expect to be active in the market and net deployers of the Company’s capital which we believe will restore net investment income back in line with more normalized levels. Above all, despite the current economic uncertainty and a dynamic interest rate environment, we remain confident in our prudent investment strategy, strong pipeline, and experienced management team, and believe the Company remains well positioned with strong spillover earnings to continue to deliver positive returns to our shareholders.”\n\n**Selected Financial Highlights**\n\n  * **Total investment income** for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, was $15.2 million, of which $12.7 million was attributable to interest income, inclusive of payment-in-kind income, from the Debt Securities Portfolio. This compares to total investment income of $18.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, of which $15.8 million was attributable to interest income, inclusive of payment-in-kind income, from the Debt Securities Portfolio.\n  * **Core investment income** for the third quarter of 2024, excluding the impact of purchase discount accretion, was $15.2 million, a decrease of $3.1 million as compared to core investment income of $18.3 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * **Net investment income (“NII”)** for the third quarter of 2024 was $5.8 million ($0.63 per share) as compared to $7.2 million ($0.75 per share) for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * **Non-accruals on debt investments** , as of September 30, 2024, were nine debt investments representing 1.6% and 4.5% of the Company’s investment portfolio at fair value and amortized cost, respectively. This compares to nine debt investments representing 0.5% and 4.5% of the Company’s investment portfolio at fair value and amortized cost, respectively, as of June 30, 2024.\n  * **Total investments at fair value** as of September 30, 2024, were $429.0 million and consisted of investments in 95 portfolio companies. The debt investment portfolio at fair value as of September 30, 2024 was $347.0 million, which excludes CLO Funds and Joint Ventures, and was comprised of 72 different portfolio companies across 28 different industries with an average par balance per entity of approximately $2.7 million. This compares to total investments of $444.4 million at fair value as of June 30, 2024 and consisted of investments in 92 portfolio companies.

On a net basis, leverage as of September 30, 2024 was 1.3x² compared to net leverage of 1.3x² as of June 30, 2024.\n\n\n\n**Results of Operations**\n\nOperating results for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, were as follows:\n\n**For the Three Months Ended****September 30 ,**  \n---  \n**($ in thousands, except share and per share amounts)** | **2024** | **2023**  \nTotal investment income | $ | 15,177 | $ | 18,574  \nTotal expenses | 9,375 | 11,408  \n**Net Investment Income** | 5,802 | 7,166  \nNet realized gain (loss) on investments | (11,419 | ) | (1,636 | )  \nNet change in unrealized gain (loss) on investments | 4,511 | 1,708  \nTax (provision) benefit on realized and unrealized gains (losses) on investments | — | 264  \nNet realized and unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments, net of taxes | (6,908 | ) | 336  \nNet realized gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt | (403 | ) | (57 | )  \n**Net Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets Resulting from Operations** | $ | (1,509 | ) | $ | 7,445  \nNet Increase (Decrease) In Net Assets Resulting from Operations per Common Share:  \nBasic and Diluted: | $ | (0.16 | ) | $ | 0.78  \nNet Investment Income Per Common Share:  \nBasic and Diluted: | $ | 0.63 | $ | 0.75  \nWeighted Average Shares of Common Stock Outstanding — Basic and Diluted | 9,244,033 | 9,505,172  \n  \n**Investment Income**\n\nThe composition of our investment income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, was as follows:\n\n**For the Three Months Ended****September 30 ,** | **For the Nine Months Ended****September 30 ,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \nInterest income, excluding CLO income and purchase discount accretion | $ | 11,434 | $ | 13,174 | $ | 35,109 | $ | 41,436  \nPurchase discount accretion | 25 | 238 | 210 | 1,706  \nPIK income | 1,552 | 2,421 | 5,759 | 4,987  \nCLO income | 254 | 502 | 1,335 | 1,879  \nJV income | 1,669 | 2,073 | 5,122 | 6,861  \nFees and other income | 243 | 166 | 505 | 1,658  \n**Investment Income** | $ | 15,177 | $ | 18,574 | $ | 48,040 | $ | 58,527  \nLess: Purchase discount accretion | $ | (25 | ) | $ | (238 | ) | $ | (210 | ) | $ | (1,706 | )  \n**Core Investment Income** | $ | 15,152 | $ | 18,336 | $ | 47,830 | $ | 56,821  \n  \n**Fair Value of Investments**\n\nThe composition of our investment portfolio as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, at cost and fair value was as follows:\n\n**($ in thousands)** | **September 30, 2024** | **December 31, 2023**  \n---|---|---  \n**Security Type** | **Cost/Amortized****Cost** | **Fair Value** | **Fair Value Percentage of Total Portfolio** | **Cost/Amortized****Cost** | **Fair Value** | **Fair Value Percentage of Total Portfolio**  \nFirst Lien Debt | $ | 338,616 | $ | 316,444 | 73.8 | % | $ | 351,858 | $ | 336,599 | 71.9 | %  \nSecond Lien Debt | 36,758 | 28,885 | 6.7 | % | 50,814 | 41,254 | 8.8 | %  \nSubordinated Debt | 8,056 | 1,696 | 0.4 | % | 7,990 | 1,224 | 0.3 | %  \nCollateralized Loan Obligations | 7,881 | 6,786 | 1.6 | % | 9,103 | 8,968 | 1.9 | %  \nJoint Ventures | 64,153 | 52,288 | 12.2 | % | 71,415 | 59,287 | 12.7 | %  \nEquity | 29,493 | 22,879 | 5.3 | % | 31,280 | 20,533 | 4.4 | %  \nAsset Manager Affiliates(1) | 17,791 | — | — | 17,791 | — | —  \nDerivatives | 31 | — | — | 31 | — | —  \nTotal | $ | 502,779 | $ | 428,978 | 100.0 | % | $ | 540,282 | $ | 467,865 | 100.0 | %  \n  \n(1) Represents the equity investment in the Asset Manager Affiliates.\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had $267.5 million (par value) of borrowings outstanding at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.7%, of which $108.0 million par value had a fixed rate and $159.5 million par value had a floating rate. This balance was comprised of $159.5 million of outstanding borrowings under the JPM Credit Facility, and $108.0 million of 4.875% Notes due 2026. On August 20, 2024, an optional redemption of the CLO occurred, and all rated notes were repaid in full. As of September 30, 2024, no 2018-2 Secured Notes were outstanding.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the fair value of investments and cash were as follows:\n\n**($ in thousands)**  \n---  \n**Security Type** | **September 30, 2024** | **December 31, 2023**  \nCash and cash equivalents | $ | 13,736 | $ | 26,912  \nRestricted Cash | 13,039 | 44,652  \nFirst Lien Debt | 316,444 | 336,599  \nSecond Lien Debt | 28,885 | 41,254  \nSubordinated Debt | 1,696 | 1,224  \nEquity | 22,879 | 20,533  \nCollateralized Loan Obligations | 6,786 | 8,968  \nAsset Manager Affiliates | — | —  \nJoint Ventures | 52,288 | 59,287  \nDerivatives | — | —  \nTotal | $ | 455,753 | $ | 539,429  \n  \nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had unrestricted cash of $13.7 million and restricted cash of $13.0 million. This compares to unrestricted cash of $9.8 million and restricted cash of $26.8 million as of June 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had $40.5 million of available borrowing capacity under the JPM Credit Facility.\n\n**Interest Rate Risk**\n\nThe Company’s investment income is affected by fluctuations in various interest rates, including SOFR and prime rates.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, approximately 91.2% of our Debt Securities Portfolio at par value were either floating rate with a spread to an interest rate index such as SOFR or the PRIME rate. 88.5% of these floating rate loans contain floors ranging between 0.50% and 5.25%. We generally expect that future portfolio investments will predominately be floating rate investments.\n\nIn periods of rising or lowering interest rates, the cost of the portion of debt associated with the 4.875% Notes Due 2026 would remain the same, given that this debt is at a fixed rate, while the interest rate on borrowings under the JPM Credit Facility would fluctuate with changes in interest rates.\n\nGenerally, the Company would expect that an increase in the base rate index for floating rate investment assets would increase gross investment income and a decrease in the base rate index for such assets would decrease gross investment income (in either case, such increase/decrease may be limited by interest rate floors/minimums for certain investment assets).\n\n**Impact on net investment income from****a change in interest rates at:**  \n---  \n**($ in thousands)** | **1%** | **2%** | **3%**  \nIncrease in interest rate | $ | 1,732 | $ | 3,501 | $ | 5,270  \nDecrease in interest rate | $ | (1,712 | ) | $ | (3,425 | ) | $ | (5,072 | )  \n  \n**Conference Call and Webcast**\n\nWe will hold a conference call on Tuesday, November 12, 2024, at 10:00 am Eastern Time to discuss our third quarter 2024 financial results.

(“GARS”) and Harvest Capital Credit Corporation (“HCAP”) mergers. Portman Ridge believes presenting core investment income and the related per share amount is useful and appropriate supplemental disclosure for analyzing its financial performance due to the unique circumstance giving rise to the purchase accounting adjustment. However, core investment income is a non-U.S. GAAP measure and should not be considered as a replacement for total investment income and other earnings measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Instead, core investment income should be reviewed only in connection with such U.S. GAAP measures in analyzing Portman Ridge’s financial performance.² Net leverage is calculated as the ratio between (A) debt, excluding unamortized debt issuance costs, less available cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash and (B) NAV. Portman Ridge believes presenting a net leverage ratio is useful and appropriate supplemental disclosure because it reflects the Company’s financial condition net of $26.8 million and $36.6 million of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. However, the net leverage ratio is a non-U.S. GAAP measure and should not be considered as a replacement for the regulatory asset coverage ratio and other similar information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Instead, the net leverage ratio should be reviewed only in connection with such U.S. GAAP measures in analyzing Portman Ridge’s financial condition.\n\n![](https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=OTI2OTc0NyM2NTcxNTA2IzIwMjA5Mjc=)![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/YzQ4MWEwZmUtNTRjOS00N2M0LTk1MTgtYzk3M2Q4YzkxYzQwLTEwMzIwNjk=/tiny/Portman-Ridge-Finance-Corporat.png)\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/39c70ff2-a155-44fc-872b-f68105f0d5ad/small/portmanlogo-jpg.jpg)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/39c70ff2-a155-44fc-872b-f68105f0d5ad)\n\nSource: Portman Ridge Finance Corporation\n"

The second amendment, among other things, (i) provided for a committed increase to the aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Credit Facility in an amount not to exceed $85,000,000, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, (ii) provided for a committed seven-day bridge advance in an aggregate principal amount of $18,250,000, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, (iii) reduced the applicable margin on the Revolving Credit Facility to 2.50% per annum, (iv) extended the period in which the Company may request advances under the Revolving Credit Facility to August 29, 2026, (v) extended the stated maturity of the Revolving Credit Facility to August 29, 2027, (vi) extended the non-call period under the Revolving Credit Facility to April 29, 2025, and (vii) provided for certain fees to be paid to the administrative agent and the lenders in connection therewith.\n  * On August 8, 2024, the Company declared a cash distribution of $0.69 per share of common stock. The distribution is payable on August 30, 2024 to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 22, 2024.\n\n\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n**Ted Goldthorpe , Chief Executive Officer of Portman Ridge, **stated, “We are pleased to report that Portman Ridge delivered net investment income of $0.70 per share, which is an increase of 4.5% from the previous quarter and exceeded the Company’s quarterly distribution. Additionally, during the three months ended June 30, 2024, we repurchased 79,722 shares for an aggregate cost of approximately $1.6 million, which was accretive to NAV by $0.03. During the quarter, however, we experienced challenges at certain select inherited portfolio companies, resulting in a decline in NAV and an increase in non-accruals. Despite the challenging quarter, we remain confident in the quality of the portfolio and our ability to generate attractive and sustainable returns for shareholders over the long-term.\n\nSubsequent to quarter end, we amended and extended our Credit Facility with JPM. The new attractive terms, which reduced the applicable margin from 2.80% per annum to 2.50% per annum, have reduced our overall cost of capital, providing us with further financial flexibility. The new revolving commitment from JPM, which increased by $85.0 million to $200.0 million, expands our ability to provide additional capital to our existing portfolio companies as well as provides us with greater flexibility to finance new attractive investment opportunities as they arise.\n\nAs we enter the back half of 2024, we want to reiterate our commitment to our shareholders. With our amended credit facility, robust pipeline, and strong balance sheet, we believe we are well positioned to continue executing our strategy and delivering positive returns to our shareholders.”\n\n**Selected Financial Highlights**\n\n  * **Total investment income** for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, was $16.3 million, of which $13.9 million was attributable to interest income, inclusive of payment-in-kind income, from the Debt Securities Portfolio. This compares to total investment income of $19.6 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, of which $15.5 million was attributable to interest income, inclusive of payment-in-kind income, from the Debt Securities Portfolio.\n  * **Core investment income** for the second quarter of 2024, excluding the impact of purchase discount accretion, was $16.2 million, a decrease of $3.0 million as compared to core investment income of $19.2 million for the second quarter of 2023.\n  * **Net investment income (“NII”)** for the second quarter of 2024 was $6.5 million ($0.70 per share) as compared to $7.9 million ($0.83 per share) for the same period the prior year.\n  * **Non-accruals on debt investments** , as of June 30, 2024, were nine debt investments representing 0.5% and 4.5% of the Company’s investment portfolio at fair value and amortized cost, respectively. This compares to seven debt investments representing 0.5% and 3.2% of the Company’s investment portfolio at fair value and amortized cost, respectively, as of March 31, 2024. Two non-accrual debt investments were sold subsequent to the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n  * **Total investments at fair value** as of June 30, 2024, was $444.4 million and consisted of investments in 92 portfolio companies.

This compares to unrestricted cash of $20.8 million and restricted cash of $18.8 million as of March 31, 2024. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had $23.0 million of available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility, and no remaining borrowing capacity under the 2018-2 Secured Notes.\n\n**Interest Rate Risk**\n\nThe Company’s investment income is affected by fluctuations in various interest rates, including SOFR and prime rates.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, approximately 88.1% of our Debt Securities Portfolio at par value were either floating rate with a spread to an interest rate index such as SOFR or the PRIME rate. 81.6% of these floating rate loans contain SOFR floors ranging between 0.50% and 3.25%. We generally expect that future portfolio investments will predominately be floating rate investments.\n\nIn periods of rising or lowering interest rates, the cost of the portion of debt associated with the 4.875% Notes Due 2026 would remain the same, given that this debt is at a fixed rate, while the interest rate on borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility would fluctuate with changes in interest rates.\n\nGenerally, the Company would expect that an increase in the base rate index for floating rate investment assets would increase gross investment income and a decrease in the base rate index for such assets would decrease gross investment income (in either case, such increase/decrease may be limited by interest rate floors/minimums for certain investment assets).\n\n**Impact on net investment income from****a change in interest rates at:**  \n---  \n**($ in thousands)** | **1****%** | **2****%** | **3****%**  \nIncrease in interest rate | $ | 1,764 | $ | 3,528 | $ | 5,292  \nDecrease in interest rate | $ | (1,764 | )  | $ | (3,528 | )  | $ | (5,252 | )   \n  \n**Conference Call and Webcast** We will hold a conference call on Friday, August 9, 2024, at 10:00 am Eastern Time to discuss our second quarter 2024 financial results.

(“GARS”) and Harvest Capital Credit Corporation (“HCAP”) mergers. Portman Ridge believes presenting core investment income and the related per share amount is useful and appropriate supplemental disclosure for analyzing its financial performance due to the unique circumstance giving rise to the purchase accounting adjustment. However, core investment income is a non-U.S. GAAP measure and should not be considered as a replacement for total investment income and other earnings measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Instead, core investment income should be reviewed only in connection with such U.S. GAAP measures in analyzing Portman Ridge’s financial performance.2 Net leverage is calculated as the ratio between (A) debt, excluding unamortized debt issuance costs, less available cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash and (B) NAV. Portman Ridge believes presenting a net leverage ratio is useful and appropriate supplemental disclosure because it reflects the Company’s financial condition net of $36.6 million and $39.6 million of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash as of June 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively. However, the net leverage ratio is a non-U.S. GAAP measure and should not be considered as a replacement for the regulatory asset coverage ratio and other similar information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Instead, the net leverage ratio should be reviewed only in connection with such U.S. GAAP measures in analyzing Portman Ridge’s financial condition.\n\n![](https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=OTIwMjA3MSM2NDE2MTEwIzIwMjA5Mjc=)![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/OWJjOWQ1YmYtZjQ3Mi00N2I0LWE0NGMtNWE2Zjc3M2ViNTA3LTEwMzIwNjk=/tiny/Portman-Ridge-Finance-Corporat.png)\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/39c70ff2-a155-44fc-872b-f68105f0d5ad/small/portmanlogo-jpg.jpg)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/39c70ff2-a155-44fc-872b-f68105f0d5ad)\n\nSource: Portman Ridge Finance Corporation\n"
