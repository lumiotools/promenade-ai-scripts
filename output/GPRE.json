(NASDAQ:GPRE) (“Green Plains” or the “company”) today announced financial results for the third quarter of 2024. Net income attributable to the company was $48.2 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, compared to net income attributable to the company of $22.3 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, for the same period in 2023. Revenues were $658.7 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared with $892.8 million for the same period last year. EBITDA was $83.3 million compared with $52.0 million for the same period in the prior year. \n\n“Our financial performance was strong this quarter, as our entire platform performed well, which is a testament to our ongoing focus on operational excellence,” said Todd Becker, President and Chief Executive Officer. “We continue to achieve higher ethanol production rates achieving a platform utilization rate of 97%, and we produced record levels of Ultra-High Protein and renewable corn oil. Our focus on operating more efficiently and consistently, paired with our proprietary technology deployments helped drive the improved cash flow generation we experienced in the third quarter.” \n\n“We are increasingly confident about our ‘Advantage Nebraska’ strategy, and with the recent Class VI well approval in Wyoming we remain on track for second half of 2025 operation as we expect that construction of the compression facilities will commence in the coming weeks,” said Becker. “While we believe that our current share price does not reflect the value of our decarbonization opportunity at our well-positioned Nebraska assets, we are relentlessly focused on delivering on this strategy. Our 287 million gallons of capacity is on track to be decarbonized next year, well ahead of the vast majority of the industry, and we are evaluating potential expansions to leverage this opportunity.” \n\n“We continue to increase and diversify our customer base for our high protein ingredients, both domestically and internationally,” said Becker. “Our focus is on growing market share in the higher value pet and international aquaculture markets, where we believe our products have a performance edge and command a premium. We delivered a production record of Ultra-high Protein in the quarter as yields continue to improve and we streamline the operations of our MSC facilities.” \n\n“As we announced earlier this week, our first commercial-scale Clean Sugar Technology deployment in Shenandoah is operational with samples going to customers for evaluation,” added Becker. “Interest from prospective customers remains high as we can produce dextrose and glucose syrups with up to a 40% reduction in carbon intensity. We will continue to optimize the facility to produce greater quantities over the coming quarters and plan to apply our learnings from this construction and commissioning as we evaluate our next potential CST location.” \n\n“Our financial position and liquidity are even stronger after the third quarter as we generated solid free cash from operations. Completing the sale of our unit train terminal in Birmingham, Alabama, enabled us to pay off higher-priced debt that remained from Green Plains Partners,” concluded Becker. \n\n** Highlights and Recent Developments **\n\n  * Nebraska pipeline partner received their first Class VI Carbon Capture and Sequestration well permit in Wyoming \n  * On September 30, 2024, Birmingham BioEnergy Partners, LLC completed the sale of its unit train terminal in Birmingham, Ala. to Lincoln Birmingham, LLC. The proceeds of the sale were used to repay the outstanding balance of the Green Plains Partners term loan due July 20, 2026 \n  * Clean Sugar Technology™ deployment in Shenandoah, Iowa is operational with samples sent to customers for evaluation \n\n\n\n**Results of Operations**\n\nGreen Plains’ ethanol production segment sold 220.3 million gallons of ethanol during the third quarter of 2024, compared with 223.5 million gallons for the same period in 2023. The consolidated ethanol crush margin was $58.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared with $52.9 million for the same period in 2023. The consolidated ethanol crush margin is the ethanol production segment’s operating income before depreciation and amortization, which includes renewable corn oil and Ultra-High Protein, plus marketing and agribusiness fees, nonrecurring decommissioning costs, and nonethanol operating activities. \n\nConsolidated revenues decreased $234.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same period in 2023, primarily due to lower weighted average selling prices on ethanol, distillers grains and renewable corn oil, as well as lower volumes sold on ethanol and distillers grains within our ethanol production segment. Revenues were also lower within our agribusiness and energy services segment primarily due to lower weighted average ethanol trading prices. \n\nNet income attributable to Green Plains increased $25.9 million and EBITDA increased $31.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same period last year, primarily due to a gain on the sale of our Birmingham terminal and higher margins in our ethanol production segment. Interest expense increased $0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period in 2023 primarily due to higher loan fees in connection with the repayment of the Green Plains Partners term loan. Income tax benefit, including income tax benefit from equity method investees, was $1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with income tax benefit of $7.8 million for the same period in 2023, primarily due to a decrease in the valuation allowance recorded against certain deferred tax assets for the three months ended September 30, 2023. \n\n**Segment Information**\n\nThe company reports the financial and operating performance for the following two operating segments: (1) ethanol production, which includes the production, storage and transportation of ethanol, distillers grains, Ultra-High Protein and renewable corn oil and (2) agribusiness and energy services, which includes grain handling and storage, commodity marketing and merchant trading for company-produced and third-party ethanol, distillers grains, Ultra-High Protein, renewable corn oil, natural gas and other commodities. \n\nAs a result of the Merger, the partnership's operations are included in the ethanol production operating segment. The following changes were made to the company's operating segments: \n\n  * The revenue and operating results from fuel storage and transportation services previously disclosed within the partnership segment are now included within the ethanol production segment. \n  * Intersegment activities between the partnership and Green Plains Trade associated with ethanol storage and transportation services previously treated like third-party transactions and eliminated on a consolidated level are now eliminated within the ethanol production segment. \n\n\n\nIntersegment activities between the partnership and Green Plains Trade associated with terminal services transacted with the agribusiness and energy services segment will continue to be eliminated on a consolidated level. \n\n**GREEN

EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization excluding the change in right-of-use assets and debt issuance costs. Adjusted EBITDA includes adjustments related to other income associated with the USDA COVID-19 relief grant, gain on asset dispositions, and our proportional share of EBITDA adjustments of our equity method investees. Management believes these measures provide useful information to investors for comparison with peer and other companies. These measures should not be considered alternatives to net income or segment operating income, which are determined in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). These non-GAAP calculations may vary from company to company. Accordingly, the company’s computation of adjusted EBITDA, segment EBITDA and consolidated ethanol crush margins may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of another company. \n\n**About Green Plains Inc.**\n\nGreen Plains Inc.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, forward-looking statements contained in this communication include statements relying on a number of assumptions concerning future events and are subject to a number of uncertainties and factors, many of which are outside the control of the company, which could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. Accordingly, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. The forward-looking statements may include, but are not limited to the expected future growth, dividends and distributions; and plans and objectives of management for future operations. Forward-looking statements may be identified by words such as “believe,” “intend,” “expect,” “may,” “should,” “will,” “anticipate,” “could,” “estimate,” “plan,” “predict,” “project” and variations of these words or similar expressions (or the negative versions of such words or expressions). While the company believes that the assumptions concerning future events are reasonable, it cautions that there are inherent difficulties in predicting certain important factors that could impact the future performance or results of its business. Among the factors that could cause results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements are: the failure to realize the anticipated results from the new products being developed; the failure to realize the anticipated costs savings or other benefits of the merger; local, regional and national economic conditions and the impact they may have on the company and its customers; disruption caused by health epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak; conditions in the ethanol and biofuels industry, including a sustained decrease in the level of supply or demand for ethanol and biofuels or a sustained decrease in the price of ethanol or biofuels; competition in the ethanol industry and other industries in which we operate; commodity market risks, including those that may result from weather conditions; the financial condition of the company’s customers; any non-performance by customers of their contractual obligations; changes in safety, health, environmental and other governmental policy and regulation, including changes to tax laws; risks related to acquisition and disposition activities and achieving anticipated results; risks associated with merchant trading; risks related to our equity method investees; the results of any reviews, investigations or other proceedings by government authorities; and the performance of the company. \n\nThe foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive. The forward-looking statements in this press release speak only as of the date they are made and the company assumes no obligation and does not intend to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by securities and other applicable laws. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and assumptions about future events. While the company’s management considers these expectations and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other risks, contingencies and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the company’s control. These risks, contingencies and uncertainties relate to, among other matters, the risks and uncertainties set forth in the “Risk Factors” section of the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), and any subsequent reports filed by the company with the SEC. These filings identify and address other important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. \n\n**GREEN PLAINS INC.**  \n---  \n**CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS**  \n(in thousands)   \n**September 30,** **2024** |  **December 31,** **2023**  \n(unaudited)   \n**ASSETS**  \nCurrent assets   \nCash and cash equivalents  |  $  |  227,460  |  $  |  349,574   \nRestricted cash  |  24,500  |  29,188   \nAccounts receivable, net  |  74,738  |  94,446   \nIncome taxes receivable  |  737  |  822   \nInventories  |  193,596  |  215,810   \nOther current assets  |  40,336  |  42,890   \nTotal current assets  |  561,367  |  732,730   \nProperty and equipment, net  |  1,025,448  |  1,021,928   \nOperating lease right-of-use assets  |  71,066  |  73,993   \nOther assets  |  102,073  |  110,671   \nTotal assets  |  $  |  1,759,954  |  $  |  1,939,322   \n**LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY**  \nCurrent liabilities   \nAccounts payable  |  $  |  108,227  |  $  |  186,643   \nAccrued and other liabilities  |  50,081  |  57,029   \nDerivative financial instruments  |  9,169  |  10,577   \nOperating lease current liabilities  |  23,654  |  22,908   \nShort-term notes payable and other borrowings  |  123,116  |  105,973   \nCurrent maturities of long-term debt  |  1,875  |  1,832   \nTotal current liabilities  |  316,122  |  384,962   \nLong-term debt  |  431,189  |  491,918   \nOperating lease long-term liabilities  |  49,194  |  53,879   \nOther liabilities  |  24,488  |  18,507   \nTotal liabilities  |  820,993  |  949,266   \nStockholders' equity   \nTotal Green Plains stockholders' equity  |  925,512  |  843,733   \nNoncontrolling interests  |  13,449  |  146,323   \nTotal stockholders' equity  |  938,961  |  990,056   \nTotal liabilities and stockholders' equity  |  $  |  1,759,954  |  $  |  1,939,322   \n  \n**GREEN PLAINS INC.**  \n---  \n**CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS**  \n(unaudited, in thousands except per share amounts)   \n**Three Months Ended** **September 30,** |  **Nine Months Ended** **September 30,**  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nRevenues  |  $  |  658,735  |  $  |  892,770  |  $  |  1,874,774  |  $  |  2,583,351   \nCosts and expenses   \nCost of goods sold (excluding depreciation and amortization expenses reflected below)  |  580,626  |  818,008  |  1,750,475  |  2,492,427   \nSelling, general and administrative expenses  |  26,710  |  35,340  |  92,429  |  100,510   \nGain on sale of assets  |  (30,723  |  )  |  (5,651  |  )  |  (30,723  |  )  |  (5,651  |  )   \nDepreciation and amortization expenses  |  26,070  |  23,899  |  69,141  |  73,911   \nTotal costs and expenses  |  602,683  |  871,596  |  1,881,322  |  2,661,197   \nOperating income (loss)  |  56,052  |  21,174  |  (6,548  |  )  |  (77,846  |  )   \nOther income (expense)   \nInterest income  |  1,737  |  2,467  |  5,737  |  8,403   \nInterest expense  |  (10,089  |  )  |  (9,550  |  )  |  (25,369  |  )  |  (29,029  |  )   \nOther, net  |  478  |  4,282  |  1,272  |  4,310   \nTotal other income (expense)  |  (7,874  |  )  |  (2,801  |  )  |  (18,360  |  )  |  (16,316  |  )   \nIncome (loss) before income taxes and income (loss) from equity method investees  |  48,178  |  18,373  |  (24,908  |  )  |  (94,162  |  )   \nIncome tax benefit  |  825  |  7,763  |  769  |  5,353   \nIncome (loss) from equity method investees, net of income taxes  |  (366  |  )  |  156  |  (2,384  |  )  |  532   \nNet income (loss)  |  48,637  |  26,292  |  (26,523  |  )  |  (88,277  |  )   \nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests  |  437  |  3,981  |  1,039  |  12,340   \nNet income (loss) attributable to Green Plains  |  $  |  48,200  |  $  |  22,311  |  $  |  (27,562  |  )  |  $  |  (100,617  |  )   \nEarnings per share   \nNet income (loss) attributable to Green Plains -

(NASDAQ:GPRE) today announced that Phil Boggs, EVP Investor Relations & Finance will take over as Chief Financial Officer of Green Plains effective Nov 1, 2024. Jim Stark will retire from Green Plains by the end of the year. \n\n“As part of a predetermined succession planning, Jim became CFO in 2022 with the intent to prepare Phil to take over the position when Jim was ready to retire from Green Plains,” said Todd Becker, President and Chief Executive Officer of Green Plains. “Jim has been an integral part of the leadership team for many years, having served in investor and media relations from 2009 to 2019 and then rejoining the company in 2022. We appreciate Jim’s numerous contributions and leadership over the years and wish him well.” \n\n“Returning for a second time to work at Green Plains has been a great experience for me and I’m grateful for the opportunity to have led the development of the team and the company during that time,” said Jim Stark. “It has been an honor to work with this great group of people who are more than ready to lead. The company is in great financial and strategic shape and I was pleased to have Phil take over for me as I have decided to pursue opportunities outside of public markets in smaller private businesses that more closely match my desire to spend more time with my family and grandchildren.” \n\nPhil Boggs has served in multiple areas of increasing responsibilities since joining the company in 2009, most recently as head of investor relations since 2019 and Treasurer from 2014 to 2021. He will lead all aspects of finance, accounting and investor relations. \n\n“I am excited to announce Phil Boggs’ promotion to CFO,” stated Becker. “His deep experience with the company through his various roles in FP&A and Treasury and having worked on our capital markets transactions and debt issuances have prepared him well for this opportunity. Since leading Investor Relations, he has developed the relationships and credibility with our stakeholders to pick up where Jim left off. He has the experience, leadership, respect of the team and necessary skillset to lead our Finance organization through our next chapter.” \n\n**About Green Plains Inc.**\n\nGreen Plains Inc.

(NASDAQ:GPRE) (“Green Plains” or the “company”) today\nannounced \u0000nancial results for the third quarter of 2024. Net income attributable to the company was $48.2\nmillion, or $0.69 per diluted share, compared to net income attributable to the company of $22.3 million, or $0.35\nper diluted share, for the same period in 2023. Revenues were $658.7 million for the third quarter of 2024\ncompared with $892.8 million for the same period last year. EBITDA was $83.3 million compared with $52.0 million\nfor the same period in the prior year.\n“Our \u0000nancial performance was strong this quarter, as our entire platform performed well, which is a testament to\nour ongoing focus on operational excellence,” said Todd Becker, President and Chief Executive O\u0000cer. “We\n1\ncontinue to achieve higher ethanol production rates achieving a platform utilization rate of 97%, and we produced\nrecord levels of Ultra-High Protein and renewable corn oil. Our focus on operating more e\u0000ciently and consistently,\npaired with our proprietary technology deployments helped drive the improved cash \u0000ow generation we\nexperienced in the third quarter.”\n“We are increasingly con\u0000dent about our ‘Advantage Nebraska’ strategy, and with the recent Class VI well approval\nin Wyoming we remain on track for second half of 2025 operation as we expect that construction of the\ncompression facilities will commence in the coming weeks,” said Becker. “While we believe that our current share\nprice does not re\u0000ect the value of our decarbonization opportunity at our well-positioned Nebraska assets, we are\nrelentlessly focused on delivering on this strategy. Our 287 million gallons of capacity is on track to be decarbonized\nnext year, well ahead of the vast majority of the industry, and we are evaluating potential expansions to leverage\nthis opportunity.”\n“We continue to increase and diversify our customer base for our high protein ingredients, both domestically and\ninternationally,” said Becker. “Our focus is on growing market share in the higher value pet and international\naquaculture markets, where we believe our products have a performance edge and command a premium. We\ndelivered a production record of Ultra-high Protein in the quarter as yields continue to improve and we streamline\nthe operations of our MSC facilities.”\n“As we announced earlier this week, our \u0000rst commercial-scale Clean Sugar Technology deployment in Shenandoah\nis operational with samples going to customers for evaluation,” added Becker. “Interest from prospective customers\nremains high as we can produce dextrose and glucose syrups with up to a 40% reduction in carbon intensity. We\nwill continue to optimize the facility to produce greater quantities over the coming quarters and plan to apply our\nlearnings from this construction and commissioning as we evaluate our next potential CST location.”\n“Our \u0000nancial position and liquidity are even stronger after the third quarter as we generated solid free cash from\noperations. Completing the sale of our unit train terminal in Birmingham, Alabama, enabled us to pay o\u0000 higher-\npriced debt that remained from Green Plains Partners,” concluded Becker.\nHighlights and Recent Developments\nNebraska pipeline partner received their \u0000rst Class VI Carbon Capture and Sequestration well permit in\nWyoming\nOn September 30, 2024, Birmingham BioEnergy Partners, LLC completed the sale of its unit train terminal in\nBirmingham, Ala. to Lincoln Birmingham, LLC. The proceeds of the sale were used to repay the outstanding\nbalance of the Green Plains Partners term loan due July 20, 2026\nClean Sugar Technology™ deployment in Shenandoah, Iowa is operational with samples sent to customers for\n2\nevaluation\nResults of Operations\nGreen Plains’ ethanol production segment sold 220.3 million gallons of ethanol during the third quarter of 2024,\ncompared with 223.5 million gallons for the same period in 2023. The consolidated ethanol crush margin was $58.3\nmillion for the third quarter of 2024, compared with $52.9 million for the same period in 2023. The consolidated\nethanol crush margin is the ethanol production segment’s operating income before depreciation and amortization,\nwhich includes renewable corn oil and Ultra-High Protein, plus marketing and agribusiness fees, nonrecurring\ndecommissioning costs, and nonethanol operating activities.\nConsolidated revenues decreased $234.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with\nthe same period in 2023, primarily due to lower weighted average selling prices on ethanol, distillers grains and\nrenewable corn oil, as well as lower volumes sold on ethanol and distillers grains within our ethanol production\nsegment. Revenues were also lower within our agribusiness and energy services segment primarily due to lower\nweighted average ethanol trading prices.\nNet income attributable to Green Plains increased $25.9 million and EBITDA increased $31.3 million for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same period last year, primarily due to a gain on the sale of\nour Birmingham terminal and higher margins in our ethanol production segment. Interest expense increased $0.5\nmillion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period in 2023 primarily due to\nhigher loan fees in connection with the repayment of the Green Plains Partners term loan. Income tax bene\u0000t,\nincluding income tax bene\u0000t from equity method investees, was $1.5 million for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, compared with income tax bene\u0000t of $7.8 million for the same period in 2023, primarily due to\na decrease in the valuation allowance recorded against certain deferred tax assets for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023.\nSegment Information\nThe company reports the \u0000nancial and operating performance for the following two operating segments: (1)\nethanol production, which includes the production, storage and transportation of ethanol, distillers grains, Ultra-\nHigh Protein and renewable corn oil and (2) agribusiness and energy services, which includes grain handling and\nstorage, commodity marketing and merchant trading for company-produced and third-party ethanol, distillers\ngrains, Ultra-High Protein, renewable corn oil, natural gas and other commodities.\nAs a result of the Merger, the partnership's operations are included in the ethanol production operating segment.\nThe following changes were made to the company's operating segments:\n3\nThe revenue and operating results from fuel storage and transportation services previously disclosed within\nthe partnership segment are now included within the ethanol production segment.\nIntersegment activities between the partnership and Green Plains Trade associated with ethanol storage and\ntransportation services previously treated like third-party transactions and eliminated on a consolidated level\nare now eliminated within the ethanol production segment.\nIntersegment activities between the partnership and Green Plains Trade associated with terminal services\ntransacted with the agribusiness and energy services segment will continue to be eliminated on a consolidated\nlevel.\nGREEN PLAINS INC.\nSEGMENT OPERATIONS\n(unaudited, in thousands)\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 %

EBITDA is de\u0000ned as earnings before\ninterest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization excluding the change in right-of-use assets and debt\nissuance costs. Adjusted EBITDA includes adjustments related to other income associated with the USDA COVID-19\nrelief grant, gain on asset dispositions, and our proportional share of EBITDA adjustments of our equity method\ninvestees. Management believes these measures provide useful information to investors for comparison with peer\nand other companies. These measures should not be considered alternatives to net income or segment operating\nincome, which are determined in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). These\nnon-GAAP calculations may vary from company to company. Accordingly, the company’s computation of adjusted\nEBITDA, segment EBITDA and consolidated ethanol crush margins may not be comparable with similarly titled\nmeasures of another company.\nAbout Green Plains Inc.\nGreen Plains Inc.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION, DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nReferences to the Company\nReferences to “Green Plains” or the “company” in the consolidated financial statements and in these notes to the consolidated financial statements refer to\nGreen Plains Inc., an Iowa corporation, and its subsidiaries.\nConsolidated Financial Statements\nThe consolidated financial statements include the company’s accounts, and all significant intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated.\nUnconsolidated entities are included in the financial statements on an equity basis.\nOn January 9, 2024, the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement were completed and the company acquired all of the publicly held common\nunits of the partnership not already owned by the company and its affiliates. Refer to Note 3 – Merger and Dispositions included herein for more information.\nThe company also owns a majority interest in FQT, with their results being consolidated in our consolidated financial statements.\nThe accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial information and the\ninstructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Because they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete\nfinancial statements, the unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year\nended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 9, 2024.\nThe unaudited financial information reflects adjustments, which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of results of\noperations, financial position and cash flows for the periods presented. The adjustments are normal and recurring in nature, unless otherwise noted. Interim\nperiod results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the entire year.\nReclassifications\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications did not affect total revenues, costs\nand expenses or net income, but increased cost of goods sold and decreased gross margin, within the ethanol production segment. Costs historically reported as\noperations and maintenance expenses in the consolidated statements of operations are now being reported within cost of goods sold.\nUse of Estimates in the Preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect\nthe reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported\namounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The company bases its estimates on historical experience and assumptions it believes are proper\nand reasonable under the circumstances and regularly evaluates the appropriateness of its estimates and assumptions. Actual results could differ from those\nestimates. Certain accounting policies, including but not limited to those relating to derivative financial instruments and accounting for income taxes, are\nimpacted significantly by judgments, assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.\nDescription of Business\nThe company operates within two operating segments: (1) ethanol production, which includes the production, storage and transportation of ethanol,\ndistillers grains, Ultra-High Protein and renewable corn oil and (2) agribusiness and energy services, which includes grain handling and storage, commodity\nmarketing and merchant trading for company-produced and third-party ethanol, distillers grains, renewable corn oil, natural gas and other commodities.\n10\nTable of Contents\nAs a result of the Merger, the partnership's operations are included in the ethanol production operating segment.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include bank deposits as well as short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.\nRestricted Cash\nThe company has restricted cash, which can only be used for funding letters of credit and for payment towards a credit agreement. Restricted cash also\nincludes cash margins and securities pledged to commodity exchange clearinghouses. To the degree these segregated balances are cash and cash equivalents,\nthey are considered restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe company recognizes revenue when obligations under the terms of a contract with a customer are satisfied. Generally, this occurs with the transfer of\ncontrol of products or services. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring goods or providing\nservices. Sales, value add, and other taxes the company collects concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue.\nSales of ethanol, distillers grains, Ultra-High Protein, renewable corn oil, natural gas and other commodities by the company’s marketing business are\nrecognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with a customer are satisfied. Generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of products or\nservices. Revenues related to marketing for third parties are presented on a gross basis as the company controls the product prior to the sale to the end\ncustomer, takes title of the product and has inventory risk. Unearned revenue is recorded for goods in transit when the company has received payment, but\ncontrol has not yet been transferred to the customer. Revenues for receiving, storing, transferring and transporting ethanol and other fuels are recognized when\nthe product is delivered to the customer.\nThe company routinely enters into physical-delivery energy commodity purchase and sale agreements. At times, the company settles these transactions by\ntransferring its obligations to other counterparties rather than delivering the physical commodity. Revenues include net gains or losses from derivatives related\nto products sold while cost of goods sold includes net gains or losses from derivatives related to commodities purchased. Revenues also include realized gains\nand losses on related derivative financial instruments and reclassifications of realized gains and losses on cash flow hedges from accumulated other\ncomprehensive income or loss.\nSales of products are recognized when control of the product is transferred to the customer, which depends on the agreed upon shipment or delivery terms.\nShipping and Handling Costs\nThe company accounts for shipping and handling activities related to contracts with customers as costs to fulfill its promise to transfer the associated\nproducts. Accordingly, the company records customer payments associated with shipping and handling costs as a component of revenue and classifies such\ncosts as a component of cost of goods sold.\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold includes materials, direct labor, shipping, plant overhead and transportation costs. Materials include the cost of corn feedstock,\ndenaturant, and process chemicals. Corn feedstock costs include gains and losses on related derivative financial instruments not designated as cash flow\nhedges, inbound freight charges, inspection costs and transfer costs, as well as reclassifications of gains and losses on cash flow hedges from accumulated other\ncomprehensive income or loss. Direct labor includes all compensation and related benefits of non-management personnel involved in production. Shipping\ncosts incurred by the company, including railcar costs, are also reflected in cost of goods sold. Plant overhead consists primarily of plant utilities, repairs and\nmaintenance and outbound freight charges. Transportation costs include railcar leases, freight and shipping of the company's products, as well as storage costs\nincurred at destination terminals.\nThe company uses exchange-traded futures and options contracts and forward purchase and sale contracts to attempt to minimize the effect of price\nchanges on ethanol, renewable corn oil, grain and natural gas. Exchange-traded futures and options contracts are valued at quoted market prices and settled\npredominantly in cash. The company is exposed to loss when counterparties default on forward purchase and sale contracts. Grain inventories held for sale and\nforward purchase and sale contracts are valued at market prices when available or other market quotes adjusted for basis differences,\n11\nTable of Contents\nprimarily in transportation, between the exchange-traded market and local market where the terms of the contract are based. Changes in forward purchase\ncontracts and exchange-traded futures and options contracts are recognized as a component of cost of goods sold.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe company uses various derivative financial instruments, including exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and over-the-counter options contracts,\nto attempt to minimize risk and the effect of commodity price changes including but not limited to, corn, ethanol, natural gas and other agricultural and energy\nproducts. The company monitors and manages this exposure as part of its overall risk management policy to reduce the adverse effect market volatility may\nhave on its operating results. The company may hedge these commodities as one way to mitigate risk; however, there may be situations when these hedging\nactivities themselves result in losses.\nBy using derivatives to hedge exposures to changes in commodity prices, the company is exposed to credit and market risk. The company’s exposure to\ncredit risk includes the counterparty’s failure to fulfill its performance obligations under the terms of the derivative contract. The company minimizes its credit\nrisk by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties, limiting the amount of financial exposure it has with each counterparty and monitoring their\nfinancial condition. Market risk is the risk that the value of the financial instrument might be adversely affected by a change in commodity prices or interest\nrates. The company manages market risk by incorporating parameters to monitor exposure within its risk management strategy, which limits the types of\nderivative instruments and strategies the company can use and the degree of market risk it can take using derivative instruments.\nForward contracts are recorded at fair value unless the contracts qualify for, and the company elects, normal purchase or sale exceptions. Changes in fair\nvalue are recorded in operating income unless the contracts qualify for, and the company elects, cash flow hedge accounting treatment.\nCertain qualifying derivatives related to ethanol production and agribusiness and energy services are designated as cash flow hedges. The company\nevaluates the derivative instrument to ascertain its effectiveness prior to entering into cash flow hedges. Unrealized gains and losses are reflected in\naccumulated other comprehensive income or loss until the gain or loss from the underlying hedged transaction is realized and the physical transaction is\ncompleted. When it becomes probable a forecasted transaction will not occur, the cash flow hedge treatment is discontinued, which affects earnings. These\nderivative financial instruments are recognized in current assets or current liabilities at fair value.\nAt times, the company hedges its exposure to changes in inventory values and designates qualifying derivatives as fair value hedges. The carrying amount\nof the hedged inventory is adjusted in the current period for changes in fair value. Estimated fair values carried at market are based on exchange-quoted prices,\nadjusted as appropriate for regional location basis values which represent differences in local markets including transportation as well as quality or grade\ndifferences. Basis values are generally determined using inputs from broker quotations or other market transactions. However, a portion of the value may be\nderived using unobservable inputs. Ineffectiveness of the hedges is recognized in the current period to the extent the change in fair value of the inventory is not\noffset by the change in fair value of the derivative.\nInvestments in Equity Method Investees\nThe company's equity method investments, which consist primarily of the company's 50% investment in GP Turnkey Tharaldson, including additional\ncontributions during 2024, totaled $53.3 million and $41.7 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and are reflected in other\nassets on the consolidated balance sheet. Interest capitalized related to our equity method investments for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled\n$0.8 million.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280) - Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which improves\nreportable segment disclosure requirements through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses.

MERGER AND DISPOSITIONS\nGreen Plains Partners Merger\nOn January 9, 2024, the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement were completed and the company issued approximately 4.7 million shares of\ncommon stock to acquire all of the publicly held common units of the partnership not already owned by the company prior to the Merger at a fixed exchange\nratio of 0.405 shares of the company's common\n14\nTable of Contents\nstock, par value $0.001 per share, along with $2.50 of cash consideration for each partnership common unit. The total consideration as a result of the Merger\nwas $143.1 million, which was comprised of $29.2 million in cash and $113.9 million of common stock exchanged. As a result of the Merger, the partnership's\ncommon units are no longer publicly traded.\nThe interests in the partnership owned by the company and its subsidiaries remain outstanding as limited partner interests in the surviving entity. The\nGeneral Partner of the partnership will continue to own the non-economic general partner interest in the surviving entity.\nSince the company controlled the partnership prior to the Merger and continues to control the partnership after the Merger, the company accounted for the\nchange in its ownership interest in the partnership as an equity transaction during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which is reflected as a reduction\nof non-controlling interest with a corresponding increase to common stock and additional paid-in capital. No gain or loss was recognized in the consolidated\nstatements of operations as a result of the Merger.\nPrior to the effective time of the Merger on January 9, 2024, public unitholders owned a 49.2% limited partner interest, the company owned a 48.8%\nlimited partner interest and a 2.0% general partner interest in the partnership. The earnings of the partnership that were attributed to its common units held by\nthe public for the year ended December 31, 2023 are reflected in net income attributable to non-controlling interest in the consolidated statements of\noperations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the non-controlling interest attributed to the partnership common units held by the public of\n$133.8 million were recorded as a reduction of non-controlling interest with a corresponding increase to additional paid-in capital.\nThe company incurred transaction costs of $5.5 million related to the Merger during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and $2.0 million during\nthe year ended December 31, 2023. These costs were directly related to the Merger consisting primarily of financial advisory services, legal services and other\nprofessional fees, and were recorded as an offset to the issuance of common stock within additional paid-in capital.\nDisposition of Birmingham Terminal\nOn September 30, 2024, the company completed the sale of the terminal located in Birmingham, Alabama and certain related assets and transfer of\nliabilities (the \"Birmingham Transaction\") for a sale price of $47.5 million, plus working capital of $1.4 million. The company recorded a pretax gain on the\nsale of $30.7 million. The proceeds from the sale were used to repay the outstanding balance of the Green Plains Partners term loan due July 20, 2026.\n15\nTable of Contents\nThe assets sold and liabilities transferred of the Birmingham Transaction at closing on September 30, 2024 were as follows (in thousands):\nAmounts of Identifiable Assets Disposed and Liabilities Relinquished\nAccounts receivable $ 315\nPrepaid expenses and other 1,225\nProperty and equipment 7,012\nOperating lease right-of-use assets 2,208\nGoodwill 10,598\nAccounts payable (112)\nAccrued and other liabilities (49)\nOperating lease current liabilities (427)\nOperating lease long-term liabilities (2,312)\nOther liabilities (556)\nTotal identifiable net assets disposed 17,902\nThe amounts reflected above represent amounts subject to post-closing working capital adjustments, which had not yet occurred as of September 30, 2024.\nDisposition of the Atkinson Ethanol Plant\nOn September 7, 2023, the company completed the sale of the plant located in Atkinson, Nebraska and certain related assets and transfer of liabilities (the\n\"Atkinson Transaction\") for a sale price of $22.9 million, plus working capital of $1.1 million. Correspondingly, the company entered into a separate asset\npurchase agreement with the partnership for $2.1 million to acquire the storage assets and the associated railcar operating leases. The divested assets were\nreported within the company’s ethanol production and agribusiness and energy services segments. The company recorded a pretax gain on the sale of the\nAtkinson plant of $4.1 million recorded within corporate activities.\nThe assets sold and liabilities transferred of the Atkinson Transaction at closing on September 7, 2023 were as follows (in thousands):\nAmounts of Identifiable Assets Disposed and Liabilities Relinquished\nInventories 3,164\nPrepaid expenses and other 423\nProperty and equipment 15,199\nOperating lease right-of-use assets 3,428\nAccrued and other liabilities (162)\nOperating lease current liabilities (1,332)\nOperating lease long-term liabilities (2,096)\nOther liabilities (189)\nTotal identifiable net assets disposed 18,435\n4. FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES\nThe following methods, assumptions and valuation techniques were used in estimating the fair value of the company’s financial instruments:\nLevel 1 – unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities the company can access at the measurement date.\n16\nTable of Contents\nLevel 2 – directly or indirectly observable inputs such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets other than quoted prices included\nwithin Level 1, quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, and other inputs that are observable or can be substantially\ncorroborated by observable market data through correlation or other means. Grain inventories held for sale in the agribusiness and energy services segment as\nwell as forward commodity purchase and sale contracts are valued at nearby futures values, plus or minus nearby basis values, which represent differences in\nlocal markets, including transportation or commodity quality or grade differences.\nLevel 3 – unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and comprise a significant component of the fair value of the assets or\nliabilities. The company currently does not have any recurring Level 3 financial instruments.\nDerivative contracts include exchange-traded commodity futures and options contracts and forward commodity purchase and sale contracts. Exchange-\ntraded futures and options contracts are valued based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified in Level 1. The majority of the\ncompany’s exchange-traded futures and options contracts are cash-settled on a daily basis.\nThere have been no changes in valuation techniques and inputs used in measuring fair value. The company’s assets and liabilities by level are as follows\n(in thousands):\nFair Value Measurements at September 30, 2024\nQuoted Prices in\nActive Markets for Significant Other\nIdentical Assets Observable Inputs\n(Level 1) (Level 2) Total\nAssets\nCash and cash equivalents $ 227,460 $ — $ 227,460\nRestricted cash 24,500 — 24,500\nInventories carried at market — 32,336 32,336\nDerivative financial instruments - assets — 6,554 6,554\nOther assets — 15 15\nTotal assets measured at fair value $ 251,960 $ 38,905 $ 290,865\nLiabilities\nAccounts payable (1) $ — $ 20,794 $ 20,794\nAccrued and other liabilities (2) — 2,094 2,094\nDerivative financial instruments - liabilities — 9,169 9,169\nOther liabilities (2) — 1,138 1,138\nTotal liabilities measured at fair value $ — $ 33,195 $ 33,195\n17\nTable of Contents\nFair Value Measurements at December 31, 2023\nQuoted Prices in\nActive Markets for Significant Other\nIdentical Assets Observable Inputs\n(Level 1) (Level 2) Total\nAssets\nCash and cash equivalents $ 349,574 $ — $ 349,574\nRestricted cash 29,188 — 29,188\nInventories carried at market — 45,898 45,898\nDerivative financial instruments - assets — 13,311 13,311\nTotal assets measured at fair value $ 378,762 $ 59,209 $ 437,971\nLiabilities\nAccounts payable (1) $ — $ 54,716 $ 54,716\nAccrued and other liabilities (2) — 9,917 9,917\nDerivative financial instruments - liabilities — 10,577 10,577\nOther liabilities (2) — 659 659\nTotal liabilities measured at fair value $ — $ 75,869 $ 75,869\n(1) Accounts payable is generally stated at historical amounts with the exception of $20.8 million and $54.7 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, related to\ncertain delivered inventory for which the payable fluctuates based on changes in commodity prices. These payables are hybrid financial instruments for which the company has elected the\nfair value option.\n(2) As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, accrued and other liabilities includes $2.1 million and $9.9 million and other liabilities includes $1.0 million and $0.7\nmillion of consideration related to potential earn-out payments recorded at fair value.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the fair value of the company’s debt was approximately $509.8 million compared with a book value of $556.2 million. At\nDecember 31, 2023, the fair value of the company’s debt was approximately $585.0 million compared with a book value of $599.7 million. The company\nestimated the fair value of its outstanding debt using Level 2 inputs. The company believes the fair value of its accounts receivable approximated book value,\nwhich was $74.7 million and $94.4 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nAlthough the company currently does not have any recurring Level 3 financial measurements, the fair values of tangible assets and goodwill acquired\nrepresent Level 3 measurements which were derived using a combination of the income approach, market approach and cost approach for the specific assets or\nliabilities being valued.\n5. SEGMENT INFORMATION\nThe company reports the financial and operating performance for the following two operating segments: (1) ethanol production, which includes the\nproduction, storage and transportation of ethanol, distillers grains, Ultra-High Protein and renewable corn oil and (2) agribusiness and energy services, which\nincludes grain handling and storage, commodity marketing and merchant trading for company-produced and third-party ethanol, distillers grains, Ultra-High\nProtein, renewable corn oil, natural gas and other commodities.\nAs a result of the Merger, the partnership's operations are included in the ethanol production operating segment. The following changes were made to the\ncompany's operating segments:\n18\nTable of Contents\n• The revenue and operating results from fuel storage and transportation services previously disclosed within the partnership segment are now included\nwithin the ethanol production segment.\n• Intersegment activities between the partnership and Green Plains Trade associated with ethanol storage and transportation services previously treated\nlike third-party transactions and eliminated on a consolidated level are now eliminated within the ethanol production segment.\nIntersegment activities between the partnership and Green Plains Trade associated with terminal services transacted with the agribusiness and energy\nservices segment will continue to be eliminated on a consolidated level.\nCorporate activities include selling, general and administrative expenses, consisting primarily of compensation, professional fees and overhead costs not\ndirectly related to a specific operating segment, as well as gain on sale of assets.\nDuring the normal course of business, the operating segments conduct business with each other. For example, the agribusiness and energy services\nsegment procures grain and natural gas and sells products, including ethanol, distillers grains, Ultra-High Protein and renewable corn oil for the ethanol\nproduction segment. These intersegment activities are treated like third-party transactions with origination, marketing and storage fees charged at estimated\nmarket values. Consequently, these transactions affect segment performance; however, they do not impact the company’s consolidated results since the\nrevenues and corresponding costs are eliminated.\nThe following tables set forth certain financial data for the company’s operating segments (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenues\nEthanol production\nRevenues from external customers $ 563,564 $ 774,321 $ 1,592,274 $ 2,198,736\nIntersegment revenues 1,075 1,208 3,467 3,446\nTotal segment revenues 564,639 775,529 1,595,741 2,202,182\nAgribusiness and energy services\nRevenues from external customers 95,171 118,449 282,500 384,615\nIntersegment revenues 6,689 6,632 19,305 18,675\nTotal segment revenues 101,860 125,081 301,805 403,290\nRevenues including intersegment activity 666,499 900,610 1,897,546 2,605,472\nIntersegment eliminations (7,764) (7,840) (22,772) (22,121)\n$ 658,735 $ 892,770 $ 1,874,774 $ 2,583,351\nRefer to Note 2 – Revenue, for further disaggregation of revenue by operating segment.\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nCost of goods sold\nEthanol production (1) $ 498,326 $ 716,556 $ 1,501,681 $ 2,142,567\nAgribusiness and energy services 90,064 109,292 271,566 371,981\nIntersegment eliminations (7,764) (7,840) (22,772) (22,121)\n$ 580,626 $ 818,008 $ 1,750,475 $ 2,492,427\n19\nTable of Contents\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nGross margin\nEthanol production (1) (3) $ 66,313 $ 58,973 $ 94,060 $ 59,615\nAgribusiness and energy services 11,796 15,789 30,239 31,309\n$ 78,109 $ 74,762 $ 124,299 $ 90,924\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nDepreciation and amortization\nEthanol production $ 21,444 $ 22,596 $ 62,522 $ 69,603\nAgribusiness and energy services 505 534 1,507 1,883\nCorporate activities (2) 4,121 769 5,112 2,425\n$ 26,070 $ 23,899 $ 69,141 $ 73,911\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nOperating income (loss)\nEthanol production (3) $ 35,240 $ 23,931 $ (626) $ (43,158)\nAgribusiness and energy services 7,830 11,313 16,000 17,612\nCorporate activities (4) 12,982 (14,070) (21,922) (52,300)\n$ 56,052 $ 21,174 $ (6,548) $ (77,846)\n(1) Costs historically reported as operations and maintenance expenses in the consolidated statements of operations are now being reported within cost of goods sold, resulting in increased cost\nof goods sold and decreased gross margin within the ethanol production segment.\n(2) Depreciation and amortization for corporate activities includes impairment of a research and development technology intangible asset of $3.5 million for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024.\n(3) Ethanol production includes an inventory lower of average cost or net realizable value adjustment of $10.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and of $1.7\nmillion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n(4) Corporate activities include a pretax gain on sale of assets of $30.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and of $5.7 million for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023.\nThe following table sets forth total assets by operating segment (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nTotal assets (1)\nEthanol production $ 1,300,845 $ 1,275,562\nAgribusiness and energy services 301,409 413,937\nCorporate assets 159,870 254,300\nIntersegment eliminations (2,170) (4,477)\n$ 1,759,954 $ 1,939,322\n(1) Asset balances by segment exclude intercompany balances.\n6.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nAt September 30, 2024, the company’s consolidated balance sheet reflected unrealized gains of $3.6 million, net of tax, in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income.

The 2.25%\nnotes bear interest at a rate of 2.25% per year, payable on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The 2.25% notes are senior, unsecured obligations of the\ncompany. The 2.25% notes are convertible, at the option of the holders, into consideration consisting of, at the company’s election, cash, shares of the\ncompany’s common stock, or a combination of cash and stock (and cash in lieu of fractional shares). However, before September 15, 2026, the 2.25% notes\nwill not be convertible unless certain conditions are satisfied. The initial conversion rate is 31.6206 shares of the company’s common stock per $1,000 principal\namount of 2.25% notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $31.62 per share of the company’s common stock), representing an\napproximately 37.5% premium over the offering price of the company’s common stock. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of\ncertain events, including but not limited to; the event of a stock dividend or stock split; the issuance of additional rights, options\n25\nTable of Contents\nand warrants; spinoffs; or a tender or exchange offering. In addition, the company may be obligated to increase the conversion rate for any conversion that\noccurs in connection with certain corporate events, including the company’s calling the 2.25% notes for redemption.\nOn and after March 15, 2024, and prior to the maturity date, the company may redeem, for cash, all, but not less than all, of the 2.25% notes if the last\nreported sale price of the company’s common stock equals or exceeds 140% of the applicable conversion price on (i) at least 20 trading days during a 30\nconsecutive trading day period ending on the trading day immediately prior to the date the company delivers notice of the redemption; and (ii) the trading day\nimmediately before the date of the redemption notice. The redemption price will equal 100% of the principal amount of the 2.25% notes to be redeemed, plus\nany accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. In addition, upon the occurrence of a “fundamental change” (as defined in the indenture\nfor the 2.25% notes), holders of the 2.25% notes will have the right, at their option, to require the company to repurchase their 2.25% notes for cash at a price\nequal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2.25% notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change\nrepurchase date.\nEthanol Production Segment\nOn February 9, 2021, Green Plains SPE LLC, a wholly-owned special purpose subsidiary and parent of Green Plains Obion and Green Plains Mount\nVernon, issued $125.0 million of junior secured mezzanine notes due 2026 (the “Junior Notes”) with BlackRock, a holder of a portion of the company’s\ncommon stock.\nThe Junior Notes will mature on February 9, 2026 and are secured by a pledge of the membership interests in and the real property owned by Green Plains\nObion and Green Plains Mount Vernon.

During the second quarter of 2024, the agreement was modified to remove the Wood River facility from the assets considered to be\nsecured under the loan agreement and Green Plains Wood River was removed as a counterparty to the loan agreement. The proceeds from the loan were used to\nadd MSC™ technology at the Wood River and Shenandoah facilities as well as other capital expenditures.\nThe loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 5.02% plus an interest rate premium, subject to quarterly adjustments, of 0.00% to 1.50% based on the leverage\nratio of total funded debt to EBITDA of Shenandoah. Principal payments of $1.5 million per year began in October 2022. Prepayments were prohibited until\nSeptember 2024.

The plan provides for shares, including options to purchase shares of common stock, stock appreciation rights tied\nto the value of common stock, restricted stock, performance share awards, and restricted and deferred stock unit awards, to be granted to eligible employees,\nnon-employee directors and consultants. The company measures stock-based compensation at fair value on the grant date, with no adjustments for estimated\nforfeitures.

These performance shares vest based on the level of achievement of certain performance goals, including the incremental value\nachieved from the company's high-protein and clean sugar initiatives, annual production levels and return on investment (ROI). Performance shares granted in\n2024 include certain market-based factors requiring a Monte Carlo valuation model to estimate the fair value of the performance shares on the date of the grant.\nThe weighted average assumptions used by the company in applying the Monte Carlo valuation model for performance share grants and related valuation\ninclude a risk-free interest rate of 4.44%, dividend yields of 0%, expected volatility of 54.6% and a closing stock price on the date of grant of $20.21, resulting\nin an estimated fair value of $25.23 per share. Performance shares granted in 2023 and 2022 do not contain market-based factors requiring a Monte Carlo\nvaluation model. The performance shares were granted at a target of 100%, but each performance share can be reduced or increased depending on results for\nthe performance period. If the company achieves the maximum performance goals, the maximum amount of shares available to be issued pursuant to the 2024,\n2023 and 2022 awards are 1,077,144 performance shares which represents 200% of the 538,572 performance shares which remain outstanding.

This compensation is expected to be recognized\nover a weighted-average period of approximately 1.8 years. The potential tax benefit related to stock-based payment is approximately 23.9% of these expenses.\n11. EARNINGS PER SHARE\nBasic earnings per share, or EPS, is calculated by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common\nshares outstanding during the period.\nThe company computes diluted EPS by dividing net income on an if-converted basis, adjusted to add back net interest expense related to the convertible\ndebt instruments, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, adjusted to include the shares that would be issued if the\nconvertible debt instruments were converted to common shares and the effect of any outstanding dilutive securities.\n29\nTable of Contents\nThe basic and diluted EPS are calculated as follows (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nEPS - basic\nNet income (loss) attributable to Green Plains $ 48,200 $ 22,311 $ (27,562) $ (100,617)\nWeighted average shares outstanding - basic 63,946 58,910 63,741 58,780\nEPS - basic $ 0.75 $ 0.38 $ (0.43) $ (1.71)\nEPS - diluted\nNet income (loss) attributable to Green Plains $ 48,200 $ 22,311 $ (27,562) $ (100,617)\nInterest and amortization on 2.25% convertible notes due 2027, net of tax\neffect 1,209 1,201 — —\nNet income (loss) attributable to Green Plains - diluted $ 49,409 $ 23,512 $ (27,562) $ (100,617)\nWeighted average shares outstanding - basic 63,946 58,910 63,741 58,780\nEffect of dilutive 2.25% convertible notes due 2027 7,273 7,273 — —\nEffect of dilutive warrants — 837 — —\nEffect of dilutive stock-based compensation awards 441 382 — —\nWeighted average shares outstanding - diluted 71,660 67,402 63,741 58,780\nEPS - diluted $ 0.69 $ 0.35 $ (0.43) $ (1.71)\nAnti-dilutive weighted-average convertible debt, warrants and stock-based\ncompensation (1) — — 7,687 8,516\n(1) For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, the effects related to the company's 2.25% convertible notes due in 2027, warrants and certain stock-based\ncompensation awards were excluded from diluted EPS as the inclusion of these shares would have been anti-dilutive.\n12.

Income tax benefit\n13. INCOME TAXES\nThe company records actual income tax expense or benefit during interim periods rather than on an annual effective tax rate method. Certain items are\ngiven discrete period treatment, and the tax effect of those items are reported in full in the relevant interim period. Green Plains Partners is a limited\npartnership, which is treated as a flow-through entity for federal income tax purposes and is not subject to federal income taxes.\nThe IRA was signed into law on August 16, 2022. The IRA includes significant law changes relating to tax, climate change, energy and health care. The\nIRA significantly expands clean energy incentives by providing an estimated $370 billion of new energy related tax credits over the next ten years. It also\npermits more flexibility for taxpayers to use the credits with direct-pay and transferable credit options. In addition, the IRA includes key revenue-raising\nprovisions which include a 15% book-income alternative minimum tax on corporations with adjusted financial statement income over $1 billion, a 1% excise\ntax on the value of certain net stock repurchases by publicly traded companies, and the reinstatement of Superfund excise taxes.\nOn January 9, 2024, the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement were completed as described in more detail in Note 3 – Merger and\nDispositions included herein. For income tax purposes, the total consideration given by the company in exchange for the remaining interest in the partnership,\ncreates a tax basis in the acquired interest. Because the GAAP basis in the acquired interest is less than the total consideration, a new deferred tax asset was\ncreated. The company's valuation allowance on deferred tax assets increased by a corresponding amount, which did not have a material impact on the\ncompany's consolidated financial statements.\nThe company recorded income tax benefit, including income tax benefit from equity method investments, of $1.5 million for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, compared with income tax benefit of $7.8 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease in the amount of tax benefit recorded was\nprimarily due to a decrease in the valuation allowance recorded against certain deferred tax assets for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe effective tax rate can be affected by variances in the estimates and amounts of taxable income among the various states, entities and activity types,\nrealization of tax credits, adjustments from resolution of tax matters under review, valuation allowances and the company’s assessment of its liability for\nuncertain tax positions.\nUnrecognized tax benefits of approximately $51.4 million have been recorded as a reduction of the deferred tax assets associated with the federal tax credit\ncarryforwards, which are currently under audit. The research and development (\"R&D\") tax credits are currently under review by the IRS Office of\nIndependent Appeals. The results of the current audit may cause the company to significantly increase or decrease the unrecognized tax benefits associated with\nR&D tax credits for periods under audit and for periods not under audit, which could impact the company's effective tax rate. At this time, the company does\nnot have enough information to be able to estimate the potential financial statement impact.\n33\nTable of Contents\n14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLeases\nThe company leases certain facilities, parcels of land, and equipment, with remaining terms ranging from less than one year to approximately 13.1 years.\nThe land and facility leases include renewal options.

Payments associated with\nthese contracts are due monthly over a period of twelve years, commencing after the capture facilities are considered in-service. Amounts due under the\ncontracts are based on the achievement of certain project milestones and are subject to termination of all or portions of the contracts. Certain of the future\nobligations to Tallgrass High Plains Carbon Storage LLC are secured by a leasehold deed of trust, security agreement and assignment of rents and leases. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the company had incurred $7.2 million of accumulated construction costs in relation to the projects, presented as property, plant and\nequipment on the consolidated balance sheet, with an equal and offsetting liability presented as other liabilities.\nLegal\nThe company is currently involved in litigation that has arisen in the ordinary course of business, but does not believe any pending litigation will have a\nmaterial adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n35\nTable of Contents\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nGeneral\nThe following discussion and analysis provides information we believe is relevant to understand our consolidated financial condition and results of\noperations. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements\ncontained in this report together with our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nCautionary Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nForward-looking statements are made in accordance with safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements\nare based on current expectations that involve a number of risks and uncertainties and do not relate strictly to historical or current facts, but rather to plans and\nobjectives for future operations. These statements may be identified by words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,”\n“outlook,” “plan,” “predict,” “may,” “could,” “should,” “will” and similar expressions, as well as statements regarding future operating or financial\nperformance or guidance, business strategy, environment, key trends and benefits of actual or planned acquisitions.\nFactors that could cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those\ndiscussed in Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 or incorporated by reference.

Consequently, forward-looking statements are not guaranteed. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied in\nour forward-looking statements. In addition, we are not obligated and do not intend to update our forward-looking statements as a result of new information\nunless it is required by applicable securities laws. We caution investors not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which represent\nmanagement’s views as of the date of this report or documents incorporated by reference.\nOverview\nGreen Plains is an Iowa corporation, founded in June 2004 as a producer of low-carbon fuels and has grown to be a leading biorefining company\nmaximizing the potential of existing resources through fermentation and patented agribusiness technologies. We continue the transition from a commodity-\nprocessing business to a value-added agricultural technology company creating sustainable, high-value ingredients from existing resources. To that end, we are\ncurrently executing on a number of initiatives to develop and implement proven agricultural, food and industrial biotechnology systems that allow for product\ndiversification, new market opportunities and production of additional value-added low-carbon ingredients, such as Ultra-High Protein, glucose and dextrose\ncorn syrups, renewable corn oil and more, as well as offering these technologies to the broader biofuels industry.\nGreen Plains Partners LP, a master limited partnership, is our primary downstream storage and logistics provider since its assets are the principal method of\nstoring and delivering the ethanol we produce. On January 9, 2024, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, we completed the acquisition of all the publicly held\ncommon units of the partnership not already owned by us and our affiliates. As a result of the Merger, the partnership common units are no longer publicly\ntraded.\n36\nTable of Contents\nRefer to Note 3 – Merger and Dispositions included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein for more information.\nWe group our business activities into the following two operating segments to manage performance:\n• Ethanol Production. Our ethanol production segment includes the production, storage and transportation of ethanol, distillers grains, Ultra-High\nProtein and renewable corn oil at ten biorefineries in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska and Tennessee. At capacity, our facilities are\ncapable of processing approximately 310 million bushels of corn per year and producing approximately 903 million gallons of ethanol, 2.2 million\ntons of distillers grains and Ultra-High Protein, and 300 million pounds of renewable corn oil, a low-carbon feedstock for biodiesel and renewable\ndiesel. This segment also includes 24 ethanol storage facilities, one fuel terminal facility and approximately 2,200 leased ethanol railcars. We are one\nof the largest ethanol producers in North America.\n• Agribusiness and Energy Services. Our agribusiness and energy services segment includes grain procurement, with approximately 20.2 million\nbushels of grain storage capacity, and our commodity marketing business, which markets, sells and distributes the ethanol, distillers grains, Ultra-High\nProtein and renewable corn oil produced at our ethanol plants. We also market ethanol for a third-party producer as well as buy and sell ethanol,\ndistillers grains, Ultra-High Protein, renewable corn oil, grain, natural gas and other commodities in various markets.\nWe have installed and are operating FQT MSC™ technology at five of our biorefineries. Through our value-added ingredients initiative, we produce Ultra-\nHigh Protein, a feed ingredient with protein concentrations of 50% or greater and yeast concentrations of 25%, increase production of renewable corn oil and\nproduce other higher value products, such as post-MSC™ distillers grains. We successfully completed full scale 60% protein production runs using FQT's\nMSC™ system, which is our new specialty feed ingredient branded as Sequence™. In 2021, we formed a 50/50 joint venture with Tharaldson Ethanol Plant I\nLLC (Tharaldson Ethanol), which owns the MSC™ technology assets added adjacent to the Tharaldson Ethanol plant in Casselton, North Dakota to produce\nUltra-High Protein and increase renewable corn oil yields. These assets completed commissioning and shipped the first commercial quantities during the\nsecond quarter of 2024. Including GP Turnkey Tharaldson's capacity, the annual Ultra-High Protein capacity we market is approximately 430 thousand tons.\nWe began pilot scale batch operations at the FQT CST™ production facility at our Innovation Center at York in the second quarter of 2021, which allows\nfor the production of both food and industrial grade low carbon-intensity glucose and dextrose corn syrups to target applications in food production, renewable\nchemicals and synthetic biology. The world's first commercial scale FQT CST™ facility in Shenandoah, Iowa is now producing, with shipments expected to\nbegin in the fourth quarter of 2024. We also anticipate modifying additional biorefineries to include FQT CST™ production capabilities to meet anticipated\nfuture customer demands.\nAdditionally, we have taken advantage of opportunities to divest certain assets to reallocate capital toward our current growth initiatives. We are focused\non generating stable and growing operating margins through our business segments and risk management strategy.\nSAF is a drop-in fuel, chemically identical to petroleum-based jet fuel and can be blended into the fuel supply at varying levels. There is an increasing\nfocus on using this fuel to reduce the carbon footprint of air travel. SAF can be produced from vegetable and waste oil feedstocks, such as our renewable corn\noil. Additionally, ATJ technologies are emerging and being commercialized that use low-CI ethanol as a feedstock to produce SAF. In January 2023, Green\nPlains, United Airlines and Tallgrass formed a joint venture, Blue Blade Energy, to develop and then commercialize ATJ SAF technology.\nAs part of our carbon reduction strategy, we committed our seven biorefineries in Nebraska, Iowa and Minnesota to carbon capture and sequestration\nprojects through carbon pipeline transport, four with Summit Carbon Solutions and three with Trailblazer CO2 Pipeline LLC, which will lower GHG emissions\nthrough the capture of biogenic carbon dioxide at each of these biorefineries, significantly lowering their CI. We have executed agreements for the future\npurchase, financing and installation of carbon capture equipment at our three Nebraska plants. We anticipate completion of these Nebraska biorefinery carbon\ncapture projects in the second half of 2025, and Summit Carbon Solutions intends to be operational in the second half of 2026. In addition, we are collaborating\nwith global partners to explore innovative options for carbon use where pipeline transport or direct injection may not be feasible. Reducing the CI of our fuel\nethanol could allow us to benefit from state and federal clean fuel programs, including LCFS and federal tax credits under the IRA, and could position our low-\ncarbon ethanol as a potential feedstock for ATJ pathways to produce SAF.\n37\nTable of Contents\nIn July 2023, we announced a technology collaboration with Equilon Enterprises LLC, which allows us to use FQT’s precision separation and processing\ntechnology with Shell Fiber Conversion Technology. The two technologies will combine fermentation, mechanical separation and processing, and fiber\nconversion into one platform. This has the potential to create a new process to liberate all available distillers corn oil currently bound in the fiber fraction of the\ncorn kernel, generate cellulosic sugars for production of low-carbon ethanol, and enhance and expand available high protein to produce high-quality ingredients\nfor global animal feed diets. Our collaboration completed the construction of a facility at Green Plains York and began commissioning during 2024.\nOur profitability is highly dependent on commodity prices, particularly for ethanol, distillers grains, Ultra-High Protein, renewable corn oil, soybean meal,\ncorn, and natural gas. Since market price fluctuations of these commodities are not always correlated, our operations may be unprofitable at times. We use a\nvariety of risk management tools and hedging strategies to monitor price risk exposure at our ethanol plants and lock in favorable margins or reduce production\nwhen margins are compressed. Our profitability could be significantly impacted by price movements of the aforementioned commodities.\nRecent Developments\nClean Sugar Technology\nThe company has achieved successful ongoing production of dextrose syrups with CSTTM at its Shenandoah facility. The syrups produced with CSTTM\nhave proven successful in trials as feedstocks for fermentation of various bio-products and bio-chemicals, in addition to food ingredients. The company is\ngoing through final product approvals with multiple potential offtake partnerships.\nBirmingham Terminal\nOn September 30, 2024, the company completed the sale of the terminal located in Birmingham, Alabama and certain related assets and transfer of\nliabilities (the \"Birmingham Transaction\") for a sale price of $47.5 million, plus working capital of $1.4 million. The company recorded a pretax gain on the\nsale of $30.7 million. The proceeds from the sale were used to repay the outstanding balance of the Green Plains Partners term loan due July 20, 2026. Refer to\nNote 3 – Merger and Dispositions in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein for more information.\nStrategic Review\nAs previously announced, the company initiated a strategic review process in February 2024 to explore a broad range of opportunities to enhance long-\nterm shareholder value, including, but not limited to, acquisitions, divestitures, a merger or sale, partnerships and financings. The Board of Directors continues\nto progress the strategic review process, working with its financial advisors, BMO Capital Markets Corp. and Moelis & Company, and legal advisors Vinson &\nElkins LLP. There is no deadline or definitive timetable for completion of the strategic review process, and there can be no assurances that the process will\nresult in a transaction or any other outcome. The company does not intend to make any further public comment regarding the review until the Board has\napproved a specific action or otherwise determines that additional disclosure is appropriate or required.\nThe Partnership Merger\nOn January 9, 2024, the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement were completed and the company acquired all of the publicly held common\nunits of the partnership not already owned by the company and its affiliates. Refer to Note 3 – Merger and Dispositions in the notes to the consolidated\nfinancial statements included herein for more information.\nResults of Operations\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, we maintained an average utilization rate of approximately 96.8% of capacity, resulting in ethanol production of 220.2\nmmg, compared with 223.4 mmg, or 93.9% of capacity, for the same quarter last year. Our operating strategy is to transform our company into a value-add\nagricultural technology company. Depending on the margin environment, we may exercise operational discretion that results in reductions in production\nvolumes. It is possible that throughput volumes could fluctuate in the future, depending on various factors that drive each biorefinery’s variable contribution\nmargin, including future driving and gasoline demand for the industry, demand for valuable coproducts we produce, and the supply and pricing of renewable\nfeedstocks needed to operate our biorefineries. We are currently producing Ultra-High Protein at five of our biorefineries.\n38\nTable of Contents\nU.S. Ethanol Supply and Demand\nAccording to the EIA, domestic ethanol production averaged 1.07 million barrels per day during the third quarter of 2024, which was 3.1% higher than the\n1.04 million barrels per day for the same quarter last year. Refiner and blender input volume was 914 thousand barrels per day for the third quarter of 2024,\ncompared with 907 thousand barrels per day for the same quarter last year. Gasoline demand was 2.7% higher than the prior year at 9.0 million barrels per day\nduring the third quarter of 2024. U.S. domestic ethanol ending stocks increased by approximately 1.6 million barrels compared to the prior year, or 7.2%, to\n23.5 million barrels as of September 30, 2024. As of this filing, according to Prime the Pump, there were approximately 3,571 retail stations selling E15 year-\nround.\nGlobal Ethanol Supply and Demand\nAccording to the USDA Foreign Agriculture Service, domestic ethanol exports through August 31, 2024, were approximately 1,240 mmg, up from the 921\nmmg for the same period of 2023. Canada was the largest export destination for U.S. ethanol accounting for approximately 35% of domestic ethanol export\nvolume, driven in part by their national clean fuel standard. The United Kingdom, India, Colombia, and the Netherlands accounted for approximately 13%,\n10%, 7% and 6%, respectively, of U.S. ethanol exports. We currently estimate that net ethanol exports will range from 1.7 to 1.9 billion gallons in 2024, based\non historical demand from a variety of countries and certain countries that seek to improve their air quality, reduce GHG emissions through low-carbon fuel\nprograms and eliminate MTBE from their own fuel supplies. Fluctuations in currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could impact the U.S. ethanol\ncompetitiveness in the global market.\nProtein and Vegetable Oil Supply and Demand\nOur dried distillers grains and high protein ingredients compete against other ethanol producers domestically and abroad, as well as with soybean meal,\ncanola meal and other protein feed ingredients. Likewise, our distillers corn oil, which is a feedstock for producing biodiesel, renewable diesel and to some\nextent SAF, competes against other vegetable oils such as soybean oil, canola oil, and to some extent palm oil, as well as against waste oils such as used\ncooking oils, animal fats and tallow. Soybean processing capacity in the U.S. has been expanding to meet the rising demand for vegetable oils to produce\nrenewable fuels. According to the National Oilseed Processors Association, for the third quarter of 2024, soybean crush was approximately 518 million\nbushels, up 18 million bushels from the 500 million bushels crushed during the third quarter of 2023. Soybean oil stocks as of September 30, 2024, were 1.1\nbillion pounds, which was consistent with stocks as of the prior year. Soybean meal production was 12.2 million short tons for the third quarter of 2024, up\nfrom the 11.8 million short tons from the same period in the prior year.\nLegislation and Regulation\nWe are sensitive to government programs and policies that affect the supply and demand for ethanol and other fuels, which in turn may impact the volume\nof ethanol and other products we handle. Over the years, various bills and amendments have been proposed in the House and Senate, which would eliminate\nthe RFS entirely, eliminate the corn-based ethanol portion of the mandate, lower the price of RINs and make it more difficult to sell fuel blends with higher\nlevels of ethanol. Bills have also been introduced to require or otherwise incentivize higher levels of octane blending, allow for year-round sales of higher\nblends of ethanol and require car manufacturers to produce vehicles that can operate on higher ethanol blends. We believe it is unlikely that any of these bills\nwill become law in the current Congress. In addition, the manner in which the EPA administers the RFS and related regulations can have a significant impact\non the actual amount of ethanol and other biofuels blended into the domestic fuel supply.\nFederal mandates and state-level clean fuel standards supporting the use of renewable fuels are a significant driver of ethanol demand in the U.S. Ethanol\npolicies are influenced by concerns for the environment, diversifying the fuel supply, supporting U.S. farmers and reducing the country’s dependence on\nforeign oil. Consumer acceptance of FFVs, availability of higher ethanol blends and increased use of higher ethanol blends in non-FFVs may be necessary\nbefore ethanol can achieve further growth in the U.S. light duty surface transportation fleet market share. In addition, expansion of clean fuel standards in other\nstates and countries, or a national LCFS could increase the demand for ethanol, depending on how they are structured. Incentives for automakers to produce\nFFVs phased out in 2020, and the EPA's proposed Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards further incentivize EV production, with the current\nadministration's stated goal of having EVs represent two-thirds of vehicles sold by 2032. Sales of EVs in the U.S. were approximately 346 thousand vehicles\nduring the third quarter of 2024, an 11% year over year increase. During the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, EV market share reached 8.9%, the\nhighest on record. Transition of the light duty surface transportation fleet from internal combustion engines to EVs could decrease the demand for ethanol.\n39\nTable of Contents\nThe IRA, which was signed into law on August 16, 2022, is a sweeping policy that could have many potential impacts on our business which we are\ncontinuing to evaluate. The legislation (1) created a new Clean Fuel Production Credit, section 45Z of the Internal Revenue Code, of $0.02 per gallon per CI\npoint reduction for any fuel below a 50 CI threshold from 2025 to 2027, which could impact our fuel ethanol, depending on the level of GHG reduction for\neach gallon; (2) created a new tax credit for SAF, section 40B of the Internal Revenue Code, of $1.25 to $1.75 per gallon for 2023 and 2024, depending on the\nGHG reduction for each gallon, that could possibly involve some of our renewable corn oil or low carbon ethanol as feedstock through an ATJ pathway,\ndepending on the life cycle analysis model being used (this credit expires after 2024 and shifts to the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, where it qualifies for\nup to $0.035 per gallon per CI point reduction below a 50 CI threshold); (3) expanded the carbon capture and sequestration credit, section 45Q of the Internal\nRevenue Code, to $85 for each metric ton of carbon dioxide sequestered, which could impact our carbon capture strategies, though it cannot be claimed in\nconjunction with the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, which could prove to be more valuable; (4) extended the $1.00 per gallon biomass-based diesel tax\ncredit through 2024, which could impact our renewable corn oil values, as this co-product serves as a low-carbon feedstock for renewable diesel and biodiesel\nproduction (this credit expires after 2024 and shifts to the 45Z Clean Fuel Production credit, where all non-SAF fuels qualify for $0.02 per gallon for each point\nof CI reduction under the 50 CI threshold); (5) funded $500 million of biofuel blending infrastructure, which could impact the availability of higher level\nethanol blended fuel; (6) increased funding for climate-smart agriculture and working lands conservation programs for farmers by $20 billion; and (7) provided\ncredits for the production and purchase of EVs, which could impact the amount of internal combustion engines built and sold longer term, and by extension\nimpact the demand for liquid fuels including ethanol. There are numerous additional clean energy credits included in this law, including investment tax credits\nfor construction of clean energy infrastructure, that could impact us and our overall competitiveness. Regulatory rulemaking for the administration of these\nprograms is underway, and the final regulations could impact many aspects of our business. On April 30, 2024, the U.S. Department of Treasury issued\nregulatory guidance along with an updated GREET lifecycle assessment model for the 40B SAF tax credit, which included a pathway for U.S. corn ethanol to\nqualify as a feedstock for SAF if the carbon intensity is lowered through utilization of various technologies and practices, including carbon capture and climate\nsmart agriculture practices. On June 22, 2024, the USDA put out a Request for Information on the Production of Biofuel Feedstocks using climate smart\npractices, which could inform rulemaking for the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit. As of this filing, proposed regulations for 45Z had yet to be issued, despite\nits effective date of January 1, 2025.\nThe RFS sets a floor for biofuels use in the United States. In June 2023, the EPA finalized RVOs for 2023, 2024 and 2025, setting the implied conventional\nethanol levels at 15.25 billion gallons for 2023, and 15 billion for 2024 and 2025, inclusive of 250 million gallons of supplemental volume in 2023 to reflect a\ncourt-ordered remand of a previously lowered RVO. The EPA also proposed a modest increase in biomass-based diesel volumes over the three years, setting the\nvolumes at 2.82 billion for 2023, 3.04 billion for 2024 and 3.35 billion for 2025. The EPA also indicated that corn kernel fiber would contribute to the finalized\ncellulosic volumes and could move to approve registrations that have been languishing for years at the agency. The EPA also removed a proposed e-RIN\nprogram to support EVs from the final rule, but indicated they may move forward with it in a separate rulemaking. The EPA is required to propose RVOs for\n2026 and potentially additional years by November of 2024. From time to time, the EPA has delayed the proposed RVOs past the statutory deadlines, and on\nJuly 8, 2024, the administration indicated that it intends to propose RVOs for 2026 and potentially additional years in March 2025, and finalize them in\nDecember 2025.\nUnder the RFS, RINs impact supply and demand. The EPA assigns individual refiners, blenders, and importers the volume of renewable fuels they are\nobligated to use in each annual RVO based on their percentage of total production of domestic transportation fuel sales. Obligated parties use RINs to show\ncompliance with the RFS mandated volumes. Ethanol producers assign RINs to each gallon of renewable fuel they produce and the RINs are detached when\nthe renewable fuel is blended with transportation fuel domestically. Market participants can trade the detached RINs in the open market. The market price of\ndetached RINs can affect the price of ethanol in certain markets and can influence purchasing decisions by obligated parties. SREs can reduce or waive entirely\nthe obligation for a refinery, which has the practical effect of reducing the RVO, and by extension the number of RINs that need to be retired, which can impact\ntheir values and ultimately blending levels of renewable fuels. There are multiple on-going legal challenges to how the EPA has handled SREs and RFS\nrulemakings. On October 21, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review the various Circuit Court rulings on SREs to determine the proper venue.\nThe One-Pound Waiver, which was extended in May 2019 to allow E15 to be sold year-round to all vehicles model year 2001 and newer, was challenged\nin an action filed in Federal District Court for the D.C. Circuit. On July 2, 2021, the Circuit Court vacated the EPA’s rule so the future of summertime, defined\nas June 1 to September 15, sales of E15 is uncertain. The Supreme Court subsequently declined to hear a challenge to this ruling. In 2022, the EPA issued\nemergency waivers to allow for the continued sale of E15 during the summer months and similar summertime waivers have been issued each year since then,\nwith the 2024 driving season marking the sixth consecutive year that E15 is able to be sold\n40\nTable of Contents\nyear-round nationwide, with the exception of California which has not approved the fuel. The EPA has also allowed for the elimination of the One-Pound\nWaiver for E10 in several Midwestern states beginning with the 2025 summer driving season, which would have the practical effect of allowing for E15 to be\nsold year- round in the following states: Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin.\nIn October 2019, the White House directed the USDA and EPA to move forward with rulemaking to expand access to higher blends of biofuels. This\nincludes funding for infrastructure, labeling changes and allowing E15 to be sold through E10 infrastructure. The USDA rolled out the Higher Blend\nInfrastructure Incentive Program in the summer of 2020, providing competitive grants to fuel terminals and retailers for installing equipment capable of\ndispensing higher blends of ethanol and biodiesel. In December 2021, the USDA announced it would administer another infrastructure grant program. The\nIRA, signed into law in 2022, provided for an additional $500 million in USDA grants for biofuel infrastructure. On June 26, 2023, the USDA announced the\ninitial $50 million in awards, and laid out a process for distributing the remaining $450 million, with $90 million being made available each quarter.\nA string of recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions, namely Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, SEC v. Jarkesy and Corner Post, Inc. v. Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve, have the potential to redefine the power of federal agencies, as well as overturn the important principle of administrative law\ncalled \"Chevron deference,\" based on a landmark case, Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. The Chevron deference was a doctrine\nof judicial deference to administrative interpretations. The general shift in power from agencies to the judicial system resulting from these decisions could\nimpact various regulatory rules affecting our business in ways that could affect our business, prospects and operations, and our financial performance positively\nor negatively.\nEnvironmental and Other Regulation\nOur operations are subject to environmental regulations, including those that govern the handling and release of ethanol, crude oil and other liquid\nhydrocarbon materials. Compliance with existing and anticipated environmental laws and regulations may increase our overall cost of doing business,\nincluding capital costs to construct, maintain, operate, and upgrade equipment and facilities. Our business may also be impacted by government policies, such\nas tariffs, duties, subsidies, import and export restrictions and outright embargos.\nComparability\nThere are various events that could affect comparability of our operating results, including fluctuations in our production rates in 2024 compared to 2023,\nalong with the disposition of our terminal in Birmingham, Alabama, on September 30, 2024, the disposition of our Atkinson, Nebraska ethanol plant in\nSeptember 2023 and losses associated with an extended shut down in spring of 2023 at a facility.\nSegment Results\nWe report the financial and operating performance for the following two operating segments: (1) ethanol production, which includes the production,\nstorage, and transportation of ethanol, distillers grains, Ultra-High Protein and renewable corn oil and (2) agribusiness and energy services, which includes\ngrain handling and storage, commodity marketing and merchant trading for company-produced and third-party ethanol, distillers grains, renewable corn oil,\nnatural gas and other commodities.\nAs a result of the Merger, the partnership's operations are included in the ethanol production operating segment. The following changes were made to the\ncompany's operating segments:\n• The revenue and operating results from fuel storage and transportation services previously disclosed within the partnership segment are now included\nwithin the ethanol production segment.\n• Intersegment activities between the partnership and Green Plains Trade associated with ethanol storage and transportation services previously treated\nlike third-party transactions and eliminated on a consolidated level are now eliminated within the ethanol production segment.\nIntersegment activities between the partnership and Green Plains Trade associated with terminal services transacted with the agribusiness and energy\nservices segment will continue to be eliminated on a consolidated level.\nCorporate activities include gain on sale of assets and selling, general and administrative expenses, consisting primarily of compensation, professional fees\nand overhead costs not directly related to a specific operating segment.\n41\nTable of Contents\nDuring the normal course of business, our operating segments do business with each other. For example, our agribusiness and energy services segment\nprocures grain and natural gas and sells products, including ethanol, distillers grains, Ultra-High Protein, and renewable corn oil of our ethanol production\nsegment. These intersegment activities are treated like third-party transactions with origination, marketing and storage fees charged at estimated market values.\nConsequently, these transactions affect segment performance; however, they do not impact our consolidated results since the revenues and corresponding costs\nare eliminated.\nWhen we evaluate segment performance, we review the following segment information as well as earnings before interest expense, income taxes,\ndepreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA.\nThe selected operating segment financial information is as follows (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n% %\n2024 2023 Variance 2024 2023 Variance\nRevenues\nEthanol production\nRevenues from external customers $ 563,564 $ 774,321 (27.2)% $ 1,592,274 $ 2,198,736 (27.6)%\nIntersegment revenues 1,075 1,208 (11.0) 3,467 3,446 0.6\nTotal segment revenues 564,639 775,529 (27.2) 1,595,741 2,202,182 (27.5)\nAgribusiness and energy services\nRevenues from external customers 95,171 118,449 (19.7) 282,500 384,615 (26.5)\nIntersegment revenues 6,689 6,632 0.9 19,305 18,675 3.4\nTotal segment revenues 101,860 125,081 (18.6) 301,805 403,290 (25.2)\nRevenues including intersegment activity 666,499 900,610 (26.0) 1,897,546 2,605,472 (27.2)\nIntersegment eliminations (7,764) (7,840) (1.0) (22,772) (22,121) 2.9\n$ 658,735 $ 892,770 (26.2)% $ 1,874,774 $ 2,583,351 (27.4)%\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n% %\n2024 2023 Variance 2024 2023 Variance\nCost of goods sold\nEthanol production (1) $ 498,326 $ 716,556 (30.5)% $ 1,501,681 $ 2,142,567 (29.9)%\nAgribusiness and energy services 90,064 109,292 (17.6) 271,566 371,981 (27.0)\nIntersegment eliminations (7,764) (7,840) (1.0) (22,772) (22,121) 2.9\n$ 580,626 $ 818,008 (29.0)% $ 1,750,475 $ 2,492,427 (29.8)%\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n% %\n2024 2023 Variance 2024 2023 Variance\nGross margin\nEthanol production (1) (3) $ 66,313 $ 58,973 12.4% $ 94,060 $ 59,615 57.8%\nAgribusiness and energy services 11,796 15,789 (25.3) 30,239 31,309 (3.4)\n$ 78,109 $ 74,762 4.5% $ 124,299 $ 90,924 36.7%\n42\nTable of Contents\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n% %\n2024 2023 Variance 2024 2023 Variance\nDepreciation and amortization\nEthanol production $ 21,444 $ 22,596 (5.1)% $ 62,522 $ 69,603 (10.2)%\nAgribusiness and energy services 505 534 (5.4) 1,507 1,883 (20.0)\nCorporate activities (2) 4,121 769 * 5,112 2,425 110.8\n$ 26,070 $ 23,899 9.1% $ 69,141 $ 73,911 (6.5)%\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n% %\n2024 2023 Variance 2024 2023 Variance\nOperating income (loss)\nEthanol production (3) $ 35,240 $ 23,931 47.3% $ (626) $ (43,158) (98.5)%\nAgribusiness and energy services 7,830 11,313 (30.8) 16,000 17,612 (9.2)\nCorporate activities (4) 12,982 (14,070) (192.3) (21,922) (52,300) (58.1)\n$ 56,052 $ 21,174 164.7% $ (6,548) $ (77,846) (91.6)%\n(1) Costs historically reported as operations and maintenance expenses in the consolidated statements of operations are now being reported within cost of goods sold, resulting in increased cost\nof goods sold and decreased gross margin within the ethanol production segment.\n(2) Depreciation and amortization for corporate activities includes impairment of a research and development technology intangible asset of $3.5 million for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024.\n(3) Ethanol production includes an inventory lower of average cost or net realizable value adjustment of $10.1 million and $1.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023, respectively.\n(4) Corporate activities includes a $30.7 million and $5.7 million pretax gain on sale of assets for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n* Percentage variances not considered meaningful.\nWe use EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and segment EBITDA as measures of profitability to compare the financial performance of our reportable segments\nand manage those segments. EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, including related income taxes of equity method\ninvestments, depreciation and amortization excluding the amortization of right-of-use assets and debt issuance costs. Adjusted EBITDA includes adjustments\nrelated to other income associated with the USDA COVID-19 relief grant, gain on asset dispositions, and our proportional share of EBITDA adjustments of our\nequity method investees. We believe EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and segment EBITDA are useful measures to compare our performance against other\ncompanies. These measures should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income, which is prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nEBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and segment EBITDA calculations may vary from company to company. Accordingly, our computation of EBITDA, adjusted\nEBITDA, and segment EBITDA may not be comparable with a similarly titled measure of other companies.\n43\nTable of Contents\nThe following table reconciles net income (loss) including noncontrolling interest to adjusted EBITDA (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n% %\n2024 2023 Variance 2024 2023 Variance\nNet income (loss) $ 48,637 $ 26,292 85.0% $ (26,523) $ (88,277) (70.0)%\nInterest expense 10,089 9,550 5.6 25,369 29,029 (12.6)\nIncome tax benefit, net of equity method income\ntaxes (1,478) (7,763) (81.0) (1,422) (5,353) (73.4)\nDepreciation and amortization (1) 26,070 23,899 9.1 69,141 73,911 (6.5)\nEBITDA 83,318 51,978 60.3 66,565 9,310 *\nOther income (2) — (3,440) * — (3,440) *\nGain on sale of assets (30,723) (5,651) * (30,723) (5,651) *\nProportional share of EBITDA adjustments to\nequity method investees 723 45 * 1,039 135 *\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 53,318 $ 42,932 24.2% $ 36,881 $ 354 *\n(1) Excludes amortization of operating lease right-of-use assets and amortization of debt issuance costs.\n(2) Other income includes a grant received from the USDA related to the Biofuel Producer Program of $3.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe following table reconciles segment EBITDA to consolidated adjusted EBITDA (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n% %\n2024 2023 Variance 2024 2023 Variance\nAdjusted EBITDA\nEthanol production (1) $ 56,144 $ 50,983 10.1% $ 60,475 $ 32,038 88.8%\nAgribusiness and energy services 8,754 12,160 (28.0) 18,855 20,258 (6.9)\nCorporate activities 18,420 (11,165) * (12,765) (42,986) (70.3)\nEBITDA 83,318 51,978 60.3 66,565 9,310 *\nOther income (2) — (3,440) * — (3,440) *\nGain on sale of assets (30,723) (5,651) * (30,723) (5,651) *\nProportional share of EBITDA adjustments to\nequity method investees 723 45 * 1,039 135 *\n$ 53,318 $ 42,932 24.2% $ 36,881 $ 354 *\n(1) Ethanol production includes an inventory lower of average cost or net realizable value adjustment of $10.1 million and $1.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023, respectively.\n(2) Other income includes a grant received from the USDA related to the Biofuel Producer Program of $3.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n* Percentage variances not considered meaningful.\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared with the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023\nConsolidated Results\nConsolidated revenues decreased $234.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period in 2023 primarily due to\nlower weighted average selling prices on ethanol, distillers grains and renewable corn oil, as well as lower volumes sold on ethanol and distillers grains within\nour ethanol production segment as described below. Revenues were also lower within our agribusiness and energy services segment primarily due to lower\nweighted average ethanol trading prices.\n44\nTable of Contents\nNet income increased $22.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period last year primarily due to a gain on the\nsale of assets from the Birmingham Transaction and higher margins in our ethanol production segment.

Interest expense was $10.1 million for three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $9.6\nmillion for the same period in 2023 due to higher loan fees in connection with the repayment of the Green Plains Partners term loan. Income tax benefit,\nincluding income tax benefit from equity method investees, was $1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with income tax benefit\nof $7.8 million for the same period in 2023 primarily due to a decrease in the valuation allowance recorded against certain deferred tax assets for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023.\nThe following discussion provides greater detail about our third quarter segment performance.\nEthanol Production Segment\nKey operating data for our ethanol production segment is as follows:\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023 % Variance\nEthanol (thousands of gallons) 220,299 223,469 (1.4)%\nDistillers grains (thousands of equivalent dried tons) 489 514 (4.9)\nUltra-High Protein (thousands of tons) 69 61 13.1\nRenewable corn oil (thousands of pounds) 77,074 74,227 3.8\nCorn consumed (thousands of bushels) 75,140 76,544 (1.8)\nRevenues in our ethanol production segment decreased $210.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period in\n2023, primarily due to lower weighted average selling prices on ethanol, distillers grains and renewable corn oil resulting in decreased revenues of $174.5\nmillion, $27.6 million and $15.9 million, respectively, in addition to lower ethanol and distillers grain volumes sold resulting in decreased revenues of $8.6\nmillion and $3.1 million, respectively. Revenues also increased as a result of hedging activities by $16.2 million.\nCost of goods sold in our ethanol production segment decreased $218.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same\nperiod last year primarily due to lower weighted average corn prices, ethanol volumes purchased and input costs related to natural gas of $123.3 million, $69.6\nmillion and $23.9 million, respectively. Costs also decreased as a result of hedging activities of $9.1 million.\nOperating income in our ethanol production segment increased $11.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same\nperiod in 2023 primarily due to increased margins as outlined above.

The decrease in revenues was primarily due to lower weighted average ethanol trading\nprices.\nIntersegment Eliminations\nIntersegment eliminations of revenues were consistent for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period in 2023.\nCorporate Activities\nOperating income related to corporate activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily impacted by an increase in gain on sale of\nassets and a decrease in personnel costs compared to the same period in 2023.\n45\nTable of Contents\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared with the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nConsolidated Results\nConsolidated revenues decreased $708.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period in 2023 primarily due to\nlower weighted average selling prices on ethanol, distillers grains and renewable corn oil, partially offset by higher volumes sold on ethanol and renewable\ncorn oil within our ethanol production segment as described below. Revenues were also lower within our agribusiness and energy services segment primarily\ndue to lower weighted average ethanol and natural gas trading prices.\nNet loss decreased $61.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period last year primarily due to higher margins\nin our ethanol production segment, a gain on the sale of assets from the Birmingham Transaction and decreased depreciation expense. Adjusted EBITDA\nincreased $36.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period last year primarily due to higher margins in our ethanol\nproduction segment. Interest expense decreased $3.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period in 2023 primarily\ndue to lower working capital revolver balances. Income tax benefit, including income tax benefit from equity method investees, was $1.4 million for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, compared with income tax benefit of $5.4 million for the same period in 2023 primarily due to a decrease in the valuation\nallowance recorded against certain deferred tax assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe following discussion provides greater detail about our year-to-date segment performance.\nEthanol Production Segment\nKey operating data for our ethanol production segment is as follows:\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023 % Variance\nEthanol (thousands of gallons) 636,686 625,102 1.9%\nDistillers grains (thousands of equivalent dried tons) 1,421 1,454 (2.3)\nUltra-High Protein (thousands of tons) 194 157 23.6\nRenewable corn oil (thousands of pounds) 217,425 206,927 5.1\nCorn consumed (thousands of bushels) 218,233 215,115 1.4\nRevenues in our ethanol production segment decreased $606.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period in\n2023, primarily due to lower weighted average selling prices on ethanol, distillers grains, and renewable corn oil resulting in decreased revenues of $532.3\nmillion, $97.1 million, and $35.2 million, respectively, partially offset by higher ethanol and renewable corn oil volumes sold resulting in increased revenues of\n$30.8 million and $6.7 million, respectively. Revenues also increased as a result of hedging activities by $19.2 million.\nCost of goods sold in our ethanol production segment decreased $640.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same\nperiod last year primarily due to lower weighted average corn prices, ethanol volumes purchased and lower input costs related to natural gas resulting in\ndecreased costs of $467.4 million, $145.1 million and $78.0 million, respectively, partially offset by higher corn volumes processed resulting in increased corn\ncosts of $20.6 million.\nOperating loss decreased $42.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period in 2023 primarily due to increased\nmargins as outlined above. Depreciation and amortization expense for the ethanol production segment was $62.5 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, compared with $69.6 million for the same period last year, with the decrease primarily due to certain assets becoming fully depreciated.\nAgribusiness and Energy Services Segment\nRevenues in our agribusiness and energy services segment decreased $101.5 million while operating income decreased $1.6 million for the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period in 2023. The decrease in\n46\nTable of Contents\nrevenues was primarily due to lower weighted average ethanol and natural gas trading prices.\nIntersegment Eliminations\nIntersegment eliminations of revenues increased by $0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period in 2023\nprimarily due to increased corn origination fees paid to the agribusiness and energy services segment as a result of higher corn volumes processed.\nCorporate Activities\nOperating loss related to corporate activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily impacted by an increase in gain on sale of\nassets and a decrease in personnel costs compared to the same period in 2023.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of liquidity include cash generated from operating activities and bank credit facilities. We fund our operating expenses and service\ndebt primarily with operating cash flows. Capital resources for maintenance and growth expenditures are funded by a variety of sources, including cash\ngenerated from operating activities or from debt and equity capital markets. Our ability to access capital markets for debt under reasonable terms depends on\nour financial condition, credit ratings and market conditions. We believe that our ability to obtain financing at reasonable rates based on these factors remains\nsufficient and provides a solid foundation to meet our future liquidity and capital resource requirements.\nOn September 30, 2024, we had $227.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and $24.5 million in restricted cash. We also had $228.5 million available\nunder our committed revolving credit agreement, subject to restrictions or other lending conditions. Funds at certain subsidiaries are generally required for their\nongoing operational needs and restricted from distribution. At September 30, 2024, our subsidiaries had approximately $92.0 million of net assets that were not\navailable to use in the form of dividends, loans or advances due to restrictions contained in their credit facilities.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $3.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with net cash used in operating activities\nof $55.4 million for the same period in 2023. Net cash used in operating activities compared to the prior year was primarily affected by a lower net loss as well\nas a decrease in cash used for inventory when compared to the same period of the prior year. Net cash used in investing activities was $34.6 million for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 compared with net cash used in investing activities of $69.1 million for the same period in 2023. Investing activities\ncompared to the prior year were primarily affected by proceeds from the Birmingham Transaction in addition to a decrease in capital expenditures. Net cash\nused in financing activities was $89.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with net cash used by financing activities of $9.7\nmillion for the same period in 2023, primarily due to the retirement of debt related to the partnership along with the extinguishment of non-controlling interest\nwhen compared to the same period in 2023.\nAdditionally, Green Plains Finance Company, Green Plains Trade, Green Plains Grain and Green Plains Commodity Management use revolving credit\nfacilities to finance working capital requirements. We frequently draw from and repay these facilities, which results in significant cash movements reflected on\na gross basis within financing activities as proceeds from and payments on short-term borrowings.\nWe incurred net capital expenditures of approximately $67.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily for the clean sugar\nexpansion project at Shenandoah and for various other capital projects. Capital spending for the remainder of 2024 is expected to be between $20.0 million and\n$30.0 million, which is subject to review prior to the initiation of any project. This excludes an estimated $110 million of additional expenditures related to our\ncarbon capture and sequestration projects expected to occur in 2024 and 2025 and to be funded through project related financing. The 2024 estimate includes\nexpenditures for various capital projects, which are expected to be financed with cash on hand and with cash provided by operating activities.\nOur business is highly sensitive to the price of commodities, particularly for corn, ethanol, distillers grains (including Ultra-High Protein), renewable corn\noil and natural gas. We use derivative financial instruments to reduce the market risk associated with fluctuations in commodity prices. Sudden changes in\ncommodity prices may require cash deposits with brokers for margin calls or significant liquidity with little advanced notice to meet margin calls, depending on\nour open derivative positions. We continuously monitor our exposure to margin calls and believe we will continue to maintain adequate liquidity to cover\nmargin calls from our operating results and borrowings.\n47\nTable of Contents\nIn August 2014 and October 2019, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $200.0 million of our common stock. Under the\nprogram, we may repurchase shares in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share buyback programs, tender offers or by\nother means. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions are determined by our management based on market conditions, share price, legal requirements\nand other factors. The program may be suspended, modified or discontinued at any time without prior notice. Since the inception of the repurchase program,\nwe have repurchased 7.4 million shares of common stock for approximately $92.8 million under the program. We did not repurchase any shares of common\nstock during the third quarter of 2024.\nWe believe we have sufficient working capital for our existing operations. A continued sustained period of unprofitable operations, however, may strain\nour liquidity. We may sell additional assets or equity or borrow capital to improve or preserve our liquidity, expand our business or acquire businesses.\nDebt\nWe were in compliance with our debt covenants at September 30, 2024. Based on our forecasts, we anticipate we will maintain compliance at each of our\nsubsidiaries for the next twelve months or have sufficient liquidity available on a consolidated basis to resolve noncompliance. We cannot provide assurance\nthat actual results will approximate our forecasts or that we will inject the necessary capital into a subsidiary to maintain compliance with its respective\ncovenants. In the event a subsidiary is unable to comply with its debt covenants, the subsidiary’s lenders may determine that an event of default has occurred,\nand following notice, the lenders may terminate the commitment and declare the unpaid balance due and payable.\nCorporate Activities\nIn March 2021, we issued $230.0 million of unsecured 2.25% convertible senior notes due in 2027, or the 2.25% notes. The 2.25% notes bear interest at a\nrate of 2.25% per year, payable on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The initial conversion rate is 31.6206 shares of our common stock per $1,000\nprincipal amount of 2.25% notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $31.62 per share of our common stock), representing an\napproximately 37.5% premium over the offering price of our common stock. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain\nevents, including but not limited to; the event of a stock dividend or stock split; the issuance of additional rights, options and warrants; spinoffs; or a tender or\nexchange offering. In addition, we may be obligated to increase the conversion rate for any conversion that occurs in connection with certain corporate events,\nincluding our calling the 2.25% notes for redemption. We may settle the 2.25% notes in cash, common stock or a combination of cash and common stock. At\nSeptember 30, 2024, the outstanding principal balance on the 2.25% notes was $230.0 million.\nEthanol Production Segment\nOn February 9, 2021, Green Plains SPE LLC, a wholly-owned special purpose subsidiary and parent of Green Plains Obion and Green Plains Mount\nVernon issued $125.0 million of junior secured mezzanine notes due February 2026 with BlackRock. These notes accrue interest at an annual rate of 11.75%\nand will mature on February 9, 2026.\nGreen Plains Shenandoah, a wholly-owned subsidiary, has a $75.0 million secured loan agreement, which matures on September 1, 2035. During the\nsecond quarter of 2024, the agreement was modified to remove the Wood River facility from the assets considered to be secured under the loan agreement and\nGreen Plains Wood River was removed as a counterparty to the loan agreement. At September 30, 2024, the outstanding principal balance was $72.0 million on\nthe loan and the interest rate was 5.52%.\nGreen Plains Partners, through a wholly owned subsidiary, had a secured term loan to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general\npartnership purposes. Interest on the term loan was based on 3-month SOFR plus 8.26%. At September 30, 2024, the interest rate on the term loan was 13.21%.\nOn September 30, 2024, the proceeds from the Birmingham Transaction were used to repay the outstanding principal and interest of the loan in full.\nPrepayments totaling $53.0 million and $56.0 million were made during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and $1.5 million\nand $3.0 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\nWe also have small equipment financing loans, finance leases on equipment or facilities, and other forms of debt financing.\n48\nTable of Contents\nAgribusiness and Energy Services Segment\nGreen Plains Finance Company, Green Plains Grain and Green Plains Trade have total senior secured revolving commitments of $350.0 million and an\naccordion feature whereby amounts available under the facility may be increased by up to $100.0 million of new lender commitments subject to certain\nconditions. The facility matures in March 2027. Each SOFR rate loan shall bear interest for each day at a rate per annum equal to the Term SOFR rate for the\noutstanding period plus a Term SOFR adjustment and an applicable margin of 2.25% to 2.50%, which is dependent on undrawn availability under the facility.\nEach base rate loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the base rate plus the applicable margin of 1.25% to 1.50%, which is dependent on undrawn\navailability under the facility. The unused portion of the facility is also subject to a commitment fee of 0.275% to 0.375%, dependent on undrawn availability.\nAt September 30, 2024, the outstanding principal balance was $109.0 million on the facility and the interest rate was 8.11%.\nGreen Plains Commodity Management has an uncommitted $40.0 million secured revolving credit facility to finance margins related to its hedging\nprograms. During the first quarter of 2023, this revolving credit facility was extended five years to mature on April 30, 2028. Advances are subject to variable\ninterest rates equal to SOFR plus 1.75%. At September 30, 2024, the outstanding principal balance was $14.1 million on the facility and the interest rate was\n6.59%.\nGreen Plains Grain has a short-term inventory financing agreement with a financial institution. The company has accounted for the agreement as short-\nterm notes, rather than revenues, and has elected the fair value option to offset fluctuations in market prices of the inventory. This agreement is subject to\nnegotiated variable interest rates. The company had no outstanding short-term notes payable related to the inventory financing agreement as of September 30,\n2024.\nRefer to Note 8 – Debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein for more information about our debt.\nEffects of Inflation\nWe have experienced inflationary impacts on labor costs, wages, components, equipment, other inputs and services across our business and inflation and\nits impact could escalate in future quarters, many of which are beyond our control. Moreover, we have fixed price arrangements with our customers and are not\nable to pass those costs along in most instances. As such, inflationary pressures could have a material adverse effect on our performance and financial\nstatements.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nIn addition to debt, our material future obligations include certain lease agreements and contractual and purchase commitments related to commodities,\nstorage and transportation, and construction. Aggregate minimum lease payments under the operating lease agreements for future fiscal years as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 totaled $81.4 million. As of September 30, 2024, we had contracted future purchases of grain, distillers grains and natural gas valued at\napproximately $187.8 million, future commitments for storage and transportation valued at approximately $26.3 million, and accumulated commitments\nrelated to the construction of carbon capture and sequestration equipment at our three Nebraska plants of $7.2 million. Refer to Note 14 – Commitments and\nContingencies included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein for more information.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nCritical accounting policies, including those relating to derivative financial instruments and accounting for income taxes, are impacted significantly by\njudgments, assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Information about our critical accounting policies and\nestimates are included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nWe use various financial instruments to manage and reduce our exposure to various market risks, including changes in commodity prices and interest rates.\nWe conduct the majority of our business in U.S. dollars and are not currently exposed to material foreign currency risk.\n49\nTable of Contents\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk through our loans which bear interest at variable rates. Interest rates on our variable-rate debt are based on the market\nrate for the lender’s prime rate or SOFR. At September 30, 2024, we had $559.8 million in debt, $123.1 million of which had variable interest rates. A 10%\nincrease in interest rates would affect our interest cost by approximately $1.2 million per year.\nFor additional information related to our debt, see Note 8 – Debt included herein as part of the notes to the consolidated financial statements and Note 12 –\nDebt included as part of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nCommodity Price Risk\nOur business is highly sensitive to commodity price risk, particularly for ethanol, corn, distillers grains (including Ultra-High Protein), renewable corn oil\nand natural gas. Ethanol prices are sensitive to world crude oil supply and demand, the price of crude oil, gasoline, corn, the price of substitute fuels, refining\ncapacity and utilization, government regulation and consumer demand for alternative fuels. Corn prices are affected by weather conditions, yield, changes in\ndomestic and global supply and demand, and government programs and policies. Distillers grains and Ultra-High Protein prices are impacted by livestock\nnumbers on feed, prices for feed alternatives and supply, which is associated with ethanol plant production. Renewable corn oil prices are impacted by prices\nfor renewable diesel fuel, diesel fuel and competing feedstocks. Natural gas prices are influenced by severe weather in the summer and winter and hurricanes in\nthe spring, summer and fall. Other factors include North American energy exploration and production, and the amount of natural gas in underground storage\nduring injection and withdrawal seasons.\nTo reduce the risk associated with fluctuations in the price of ethanol, corn, distillers grains, Ultra-High Protein, renewable corn oil and natural gas, at\ntimes we use forward fixed-price physical contracts and derivative financial instruments, such as futures and options executed on the Chicago Board of Trade,\nthe New York Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. We focus on locking in favorable operating margins, when available, using a model\nthat continually monitors market prices for corn, natural gas and other inputs relative to the price for ethanol and distillers grains at each of our production\nfacilities. We create offsetting positions using a combination of forward fixed-price purchases, sales contracts and derivative financial instruments. As a result,\nwe frequently have gains on derivative financial instruments that are offset by losses on forward fixed-price physical contracts or inventories and vice versa.\nOur results are impacted by a mismatch of gains or losses associated with the derivative instrument during a reporting period when the physical commodity\npurchases or sale has not yet occurred. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenues included net gains of $16.1 million, while cost of goods\nsold included net losses of $4.2 million, and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenues included net gains of $14.2 million, and cost of goods\nsold included net losses of $9.9 million, associated with derivative financial instruments.\nEthanol Production Segment\nIn the ethanol production segment, net gains and losses from settled derivative instruments are offset by physical commodity purchases or sales to achieve\nthe intended operating margins. To reduce commodity price risk caused by market fluctuations, we enter into exchange-traded futures and options contracts that\nserve as economic hedges.\nOur exposure to market risk, which includes the impact of our risk management activities resulting from our fixed-price purchase and sale contracts and\nderivatives, is based on the estimated net income effect resulting from a hypothetical 10% change in price for the next 12 months starting on September 30,\n2024, which is as follows (in thousands):\nEstimated Total Volume Net Income Effect of\nRequirements for the Unit of Approximate 10%\nCommodity Next 12 Months (1) Measure Change in Price\nEthanol 903,000 Gallons $98,304\nCorn 310,000 Bushels $99,487\nDistillers grains (2) 2,200 Tons (3) $22,347\nRenewable corn oil 300,000 Pounds $8,893\nNatural gas 26,400 MmBTU $4,630\n(1) Estimated volumes assume production at full capacity.\n50\nTable of Contents\n(2) Includes Ultra-High Protein.\n(3) Distillers grains quantities are stated on an equivalent dried ton basis.\nAgribusiness and Energy Services Segment\nIn the agribusiness and energy services segment, our physical purchase and sale contracts and derivatives are marked to market. Our inventories are carried\nat the lower of average cost or net realizable value, except fair-value hedged inventories. To reduce commodity price risk caused by market fluctuations for\npurchase and sale commitments of grain and grain held in inventory, we enter into exchange-traded futures and options contracts that serve as economic\nhedges.\nThe market value of exchange-traded futures and options used for hedging are highly correlated with the underlying market value of grain inventories and\nrelated purchase and sale contracts for grain. The less correlated portion of inventory and purchase and sale contract market values, known as basis, is much\nless volatile than the overall market value of exchange-traded futures and tends to follow historical patterns. We manage this less volatile risk by constantly\nmonitoring our position relative to the price changes in the market. Inventory values are affected by the month-to-month spread in the futures markets. These\nspreads are also less volatile than the overall market value of our inventory and tend to follow historical patterns, but cannot be mitigated directly. Our\naccounting policy for futures and options, as well as the underlying inventory held for sale and purchase and sale contracts, is to reflect their current market\nvalues and include gains and losses in the consolidated statement of operations.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure the information that must be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the\nExchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is\naccumulated and communicated to management, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required financial disclosure. In designing and evaluating\nthe disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only\nreasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of\npossible controls and procedures.\nUnder the supervision and participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, management carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness\nof the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024 as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the\nExchange Act and concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding\nthe reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally\naccepted accounting principles. There were no material changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this\nreport that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n51\nTable of Contents\nPART II – OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings.\nWe are currently involved in litigation that has arisen during the ordinary course of business. We do not believe this litigation will have a material adverse\neffect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors.\nInvestors should carefully consider the discussion of risks and the other information in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,\n2023, in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” and the discussion of risks and other information in Part I, Item 2, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations,” under “Cautionary Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” of this report. Investors should also\ncarefully consider the discussion of risks with the partnership under the heading “Risk Factors” and other information in their annual report on Form 10-K for\nthe year ended December 31, 2023. Although we have attempted to discuss key factors, our investors need to be aware that other risks may prove to be\nimportant in the future. New risks may emerge at any time, and we cannot predict such risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect our financial\nperformance.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.\nThe company withholds shares when restricted stock grants are vested to satisfy statutory minimum required payroll tax withholding obligations. The\nfollowing table lists the shares that were withheld during the third quarter of 2024:\nTotal Number of Average Price\nPeriod Shares Withheld Paid per Share\nJuly 1 - 31 — $ —\nAugust 1 - 31 866 15.13\nSeptember 1 - 30 239 12.88\nTotal 1,105 $ 14.64\nIn August 2014 and October 2019, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $200 million of our common stock. Under this\nprogram, we may repurchase shares in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated buyback programs, tender offers or by other\nmeans. The timing and amount of the transactions are determined by management based on its evaluation of market conditions, share price, legal requirements\nand other factors. The program may be suspended, modified or discontinued at any time, without prior notice. Since inception of the repurchase program, the\ncompany has repurchased approximately 7.4 million shares of common stock for approximately $92.8 million under the program.

FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 31, 2024\nPresentation\n....................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator\nGood morning, and welcome to the Green Plains Inc. Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call.\n[Operator Instructions]\nWe will now turn the call over to your host, Phil Boggs, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations and\nFinance. Mr. Boggs, please go ahead.\nPhil Boggs\nExecutive Vice President of Investor Relations & Finance\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Green Plains Inc. Third Quarter 2024 Earnings\nCall. Participants on today's call are Todd Becker, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jim Stark, Chief\nFinancial Officer; and several other members of Green Plains senior leadership team.\nThere is a slide presentation available, and you can find it on our Investor page, under the Events &\nPresentations link on our website.\nDuring this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections\nor other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and\nassumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of\nfactors discussed in today's press release and the comments made during this conference call and in the\nRisk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and\nExchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Todd Becker.\nTodd A. Becker\nPresident, CEO & Director\nThanks, Phil. Good morning, and thanks for joining our call today.\nWe reported $83.3 million in EBITDA for the third quarter, inclusive of a $30.7 million gain on the sale of\nthe Birmingham unit train terminal. Our EBITDA from normal operations was $53 million, and our stand-\nalone consolidated crush margin was $58 million.\nBefore I get too deep into the numbers, I'm sure you saw the announcement this morning regarding Jim\nStark retiring from Green Plains and the promotion of Phil Boggs as Chief Financial Officer. These 2 guys\nare really well known to all of you, which should make for a seamless transition.\nWhen Jim returned to Green Plains and was subsequently named CFO, I always knew this day would\ncome, as his goal was to get back to Nebraska and spend more time with his grandkids. One of the things\nthat was part of the succession planning was to set Phil up for success, and Jim lived up to his end of the\nbargain and more.\nJim and I spent many years together at Green Plains, and he is one of the many who will have made a\nlong-standing impact on the company, and I'm proud to have worked with him.\nI'll let Jim tell you a bit more, but he'll be exiting the public company world to focus on the next stage of\nhis career with smaller private companies and spend more time with his family. Thanks again, Jim, for\nyour dedication and loyalty.\nSo let's get back to the quarter. Our ethanol operating rate reached nearly 97%, and we also delivered a\nrecord quarter of ultra-high protein production as well as maintaining a strong corn oil yield in line with\nour record rates achieved in the second quarter. Our operating results are demonstrating the success of\nyears of planning and execution to deliver improved operational performance across our platform, and\nwe believe we have room to continue improving on these operating rates. The mid- to high-90s run rate\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 3\nGREEN PLAINS INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 31, 2024\nshould be the new normal for our platform, as we still have some more improvements underway to get\nthere and are finishing up some of those in the fourth quarter as well.\nEarlier this month, we completed an extended shutdown at our Mount Vernon location, as we indicated\nearlier, location performing some of the needed maintenance to bring the plant back to its full run rate\ncapabilities. We are now beginning to scale up production and expect to reap the reward of additional\ncapacity in the next couple of weeks.\nWe are in the process of upgrading Obion in the next coming months and anticipate that plant being able\nto increase its efficiency and production as well over the next several quarters.\nThe operations team has done a fantastic job safely maximizing the platform, and we continue to find new\nopportunities to increase throughput and improve production metrics.\nMargins were solid during the quarter, as we indicated on the prior call, driven by demand of continued\nstrong exports and favorable natural gas and corn prices, even though we did see some rapid compression\nlate into the quarter.\nWe continue to experience tailwinds for ethanol exports, with totals through August of 1.2 billion gallons\nand on pace for a record year of 1.8 billion to 1.9 billion gallons, as other countries ramp up their blend\nmandates in low-carbon programs. We believe this will continue to grow, led by Canada, where they are\nrapidly expanding blends and represent over 1/3 of where all of our exports go. Overall, we significantly\noutperformed the prior quarter and were up prior year as well.\nWe will cover protein, carbon and corn oil on this call as well, but I would be remiss not to start with clean\nsugar. While it may have taken longer than we all wanted, the ongoing start-up and commissioning of\nour CST project in Shenandoah was a key focus during the quarter. As we had indicated earlier this week,\nwe have worked through some of the -- most of the challenges, and we have begun to supply product to\ncustomers for validation. We also believe we will be executing our first bulk commercial sales and shipping\nlow-CI dextrose to customers during the fourth quarter.\nThe production process will continue to be debottlenecked, ramping up over the coming year, and interest\nremains very strong despite the delays. Having up to a 40% carbon intensity advantage, it's worth the\nwait for many of these customers.\nAs we always said, this technology developed by Fluid Quip is massively disruptive to an industry supply\noligopoly that has existed for decades, and no one thought we could make clear, clean, low-carbon\ndextrose, but here we are. It was a Herculean effort across Green Plains and Fluid Quip to get to this\npoint. We still have plenty to do to scale from here, but this is one of the many steps to realizing the true\nvalue of this technology, and I'll spend a little bit more time on this later in the call.\nDuring the quarter, we completed the sale of the Birmingham unit train terminal and used the proceeds\nto retire the remaining high-priced debt related to Green Plains Partners. This was an important step,\nenabling the additional simplification and efficiency gains anticipated when we first began the process of\nacquiring Green Plains Partners.\nThe board of directors continues to progress the strategic review process, working with its financial\nadvisers, BMO and Moelis, as outlined in the press release.\nAnd now I'll hand the call over to Jim to provide an update on the overall financial results. I'll come back\non the call to provide an updated policy outlook and discuss our progress on all of our initiatives in more\ndetail. Jim?\nJames E. Stark\nChief Financial Officer\nThank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone.\nGreen Plains consolidated revenues for the third quarter were $658.7 million, which was $234 million, or\napproximately 26%, lower than the same period a year ago. As it has been the last couple of quarters, the\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 4\nGREEN PLAINS INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 31, 2024\nlower revenue is attributable to lower prices experienced for ethanol, dry distillers grains and renewable\ncorn oil in the third quarter of '24 as compared to the same period a year ago.\nAs Todd mentioned, we also saw a drop in our commodity inputs, with corn and natural gas down\nsignificantly year-over-year, resulting in a stronger margin opportunity in the quarter compared to the\nprior quarter and prior year.\nOur plant utilization rate was 97% during the quarter, compared to a 94% run rate in the same period\nlast year. The year ago quarter of 2023 included production gallons from the Atkinson plant that was sold\nin third quarter of last year. So utilization actually increased despite production gallons declining slightly\nyear-over-year.\nFor the trailing 4 quarters, we have averaged a 94% utilization rate, and we anticipate our plants to\ncontinue to perform in that mid-90% range of our stated capacity for the fourth quarter, barring any\nevents outside of our control.\nFor the quarter, we reported net income attributable to Green Plains of $48.2 million, or $0.69 per diluted\nshare. That compares to a net income of $22.3 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, for the same period in\n2023.\nI want to point out that the diluted share count for the third quarter for both the current and prior year\nthird quarters include the dilutive effects of the 2027 converts due to the accounting treatment of the as-\nif-converted method so long as the effect would not be anti-dilutive, for which it was not.\nEBITDA for the quarter was $83.3 million, inclusive of that $30.7 million gain on the sale of the\nBirmingham unit train terminal, compared to $52 million in the prior year period.\nLike-for-like, adjusted EBITDA for Q3 of '24 was $53.3 million, compared to $42.9 million for Q3 of '23,\nwhen you adjust out onetime items for both periods.\nDepreciation and amortization expense was higher by $2.2 million versus a year ago, at $26.1 million. This\nincludes a onetime $3.5 million impairment charge related to R&D intangible assets that were taken in Q3.\nWe realized $58.3 million in consolidated crush for the quarter, and that compares to $52.9 million for the\nprior year of 2023.\nAlso in the third quarter, our SG&A costs for all segments was $26.7 million. That's $8.6 million lower than\nthe prior year, due to lower personnel costs and adjustments to incentive accruals.\nInterest expense of $10.1 million for the quarter, which includes the impact of debt amortization and\ncapitalized interest, was $0.5 million higher than the prior year's third quarter. This increase was primarily\ndue to loan fees associated with the payoff of the Green Plains Partners debt retired in the third quarter of\n2024.\nPaid income tax for the quarter was a benefit of $0.8 million, compared to a tax benefit of $7.8 million\nfor the same period in 2023. At the end of the quarter, the federal net loss carryforwards available to the\ncompany was $10.8 million, which may be carried forward indefinitely. The NOLs are down significantly\nfrom our Q2 2024, as the NOLs were used to offset the gain on the sale of the Birmingham unit train\nterminal and the profitability we had within the quarter. Our normalized tax rate for the quarter was\naround 25%.\nOur liquidity position at the end of the quarter improved from the prior quarter due to strong results from\noperations. Our liquidity included $252 million in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, along with\napproximately $228.5 million available under our working capital revolver.\nFor the third quarter, we allocated $28 million to capital across the platform, including $9 million to our\nclean sugar initiative, about $8 million to other growth initiatives and approximately $11 million towards\nmaintenance, safety and regulatory capital.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 5\nGREEN PLAINS INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 31, 2024\nOn a year-to-date basis, we have incurred capital expenditures of about $67.8 million, and we anticipate\nCapEx for the total year '24 will be in that range of about $90 million to $100 million. Again, as a\nreminder, this range excludes the approximately $110 million in carbon capture equipment needed for our\nNebraska initiatives, as we have financing lined up to cover those needs.\nIn closing, my time with Green Plains has been immensely rewarding. I'm grateful for the opportunities\nI've been given to grow professionally and personally during my 14 years here. I cannot thank Todd and\nthe board enough for allowing me to rejoin Green Plains at the executive level at the beginning of 2022 to\nbe closer to my family and grandkids.\nI have complete confidence that Phil Boggs will excel in his well-deserved new position as CFO and the\nfinance and accounting team will continue to support him and the management team as the company\nmoves forward.\nI look forward to my next chapter, and I appreciate knowing and working with all of you on this call over\nthe last nearly 16 years of my public company career in the renewable fuels industry.\nNow I'll turn the call back over to Todd.\nTodd A. Becker\nPresident, CEO & Director\nThanks, Jim. And again, thank you, and good luck in the future.\nSo let's talk carbon. Our Advantage Nebraska strategy to decarbonize our 287 million-gallon footprint in\nthe state remains on track. And along with our pipeline partners, we have made great progress again this\nquarter.\nOf note, Wyoming, which is 1 of 3 states with primacy for issuing Class VI permits, approved the first\nsequestration well for the Trailblazer project in September, and we expect additional well approvals for the\nproject to follow in the coming months.\nThe long lead time carbon compression equipment has been ordered and is on schedule for delivery in Q2\nof 2025, and we expect to begin construction on these facilities in the next month or so, keeping us on\ntrack for the second half of 2025 operations and cash flows.\nThis is another game-changing and differentiating project for Green Plains shareholders, that we will be\none of the earliest and largest platforms sequestering carbon. Our carbon earning estimates remain intact,\nwith the expectation we will generate $130 million or so per year starting in the second half of 2025,\nassuming 45Z values and a $70 ton carbon credit, or LCFS credit, even after discounting the value of the\ntax credits.\nNebraska as an asset alone with this type of base earnings is not at all reflected in our share price of\nour company, in my opinion, in our opinion as well. During the quarter, we saw a decarbonized ethanol\nproduction facility exchange hands for the price over $3 per gallon. So you could do the math. The value\nof our 287 million gallons in Nebraska would be higher than our current market cap from those plants\nalone.\nWhile the Summit Carbon Solutions project continues to make progress with permitting and right of way,\nwe anticipate the Nebraska pipeline will be on prior to that, giving us some of the largest volumes of low-\nCI ethanol gallons during the existing 45Z runway of 2025 to 2027, with a 12-year 45Q credit available if\nit is not extended. And what some misunderstand is that 12-year credit is from the date when the facility\nis placed in service, not from when the IRA was enacted. And I think that's a really important point when\nwe look at the availability of our long-term cash flows.\nWe do believe that 45Z will be extended beyond 2027 when the new Congress considers a broader tax\npackage next year. Regardless of how this election plays out, there is bipartisan support for this measure\nand support across a diverse set of industries, but we're still waiting for proposed regulations to come out.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc.

We have seen some stabilization in oil prices, as the market has tightened\nup as evidenced by the rise in palm and soy oil prices during the quarter. We look forward to 2025, as we\nknow DCO becomes an advantaged feedstock, and we continue to push record yields as a platform, with\nmore to come in the future. When you add corn oil and carbon, those 2 account for over $220 million of\ncombined EBITDA contribution beginning in the last half of 2025.\nIn protein, as noted on the top of the call, we had record production of ultra-high protein during Q3 at our\nGreen Plains plants, and we will continue to grow from there in the future. Our commercial and operations\nteam have continued to execute and improve our processes to maximize the flexibility and efficiency at\neach of the locations. Our Tharaldson JV also ramped up production during the quarter and continues to\nget to max run rates.\nCommercially, we continue to open up new markets and win new customers for our 50 Pro ultra-high\nprotein product, both in the U.S. and internationally. We now ship to many Asian destinations and\nstarted commercial shipments to our strategic customers in Latin America. With JV production, we now\nalso have a better access to customers in the Western U.S., opening another new market for us from\na transportation standpoint. The team is making great progress increasing our sales to our pet and\naquaculture customers.\nWhile operationally we've been improving, margins are somewhat lower than expected due to the\navailability of cheap competing products. We believe this will work itself out in due time and continue to\nbelieve that adding optionality and flexibility to our biorefinery platform to maximize what can be achieved\nwith a kernel of corn positions us for long-term success.\nFor our 60 Pro Sequence product, we have been making additional upgrades to our production capabilities\nand continue to refine and improve our product. Our upgrade at Wood River is expected to be online in\nthe first quarter next year to allow that plant to better and more efficiently and cheaper produce more\nSequence.\nMore important, we just completed a new run at Central City, and we were up to spec of Sequence in\nless than 6 hours, with little disruption to daily operations as we continue to ship and sell Sequence to\ncustomers.\nThere is a lot of interest in this ingredient, but we are limiting volumes until we finish these upgrades\nduring the first quarter of 2025. We also have some really exciting potential process breakthroughs for 60\nPro on deck for early next year. So stay tuned.\nLastly, we will wait and see how the margin structure shakes out this quarter once the corn crop is fully\nharvested. The forward-looking ethanol margins is a bit of an unknown, as usual, but we know export\nand demand overall does not support this margin structure tone, as evidenced by yesterday's EIA report\nshowing stocks now under 20 days of production and the crush yesterday finally improving $0.04 per\ngallon on this news.\nIf you compare year-over-year at this time last year relative to much similar numbers, margins were\nsignificantly higher, and hopefully yesterday began the march to start to match some of those numbers,\nbut we have a little bit of a ways to go.\nWith regard to sugar, our outstanding operational and engineering teams worked tirelessly to prove out\nthis groundbreaking technology at commercial scale, and we have been consistently producing at the\nfacility, with product already sent to key customers for formulation testing.\nWe will continue to work over the coming quarters to optimize the Shenandoah facility to increase\nproduction volumes, including addressing additional bottlenecks. The learnings from our York Innovation\nCenter pilot and now building and operating this commercial-scale facility in Shenandoah puts us in a\nmuch better place for when we decide to execute on [ Serial 2 ].\nThe critical piece here is what we have proven is the technology at scale, and now it's a matter of building\nout that infrastructure and reshaping an industry that has never been disrupted.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc.

FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 31, 2024\nQuestion and Answer\n....................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jordan Levy, with Truist Securities.\nJordan Levy\nTruist Securities, Inc., Research Division\nJim, thank you for everything, and best of luck on the next ventures. Phil, congratulations on the new role.\nTodd, you mentioned it on the call, but your equity value here is certainly not reflecting the value of\nAdvantage Nebraska on the CCS side and maybe even more so the other initiatives in protein and sugar.\nCan you just talk to outside of the strategic review process you have what you think the market needs to\nsee from you all to get more value reflected there on what the work you guys are doing?\nTodd A. Becker\nPresident, CEO & Director\nI think that, obviously, the milestones. There's a couple of big events. The milestones in carbon are going\nto be really critical, and we should be able to break ground here in the next 30 to 45 days on that project.\nAnd I think once we do that, you're going to start to see a quick ramp-up in the interest -- in the credits\nthat we are going to produce, both 45Z voluntary and/or LCFS credits for California.\nI think what's really important is that those are programs that are in place. And I think that once that\nstarts to kick off, just from that alone the value of our company will begin to adjust higher, if not sooner\nthan that.\nObviously, we've gone through some ups and downs as an industry. I think broadly as an industry as\nwell, whether it's going to be in ag or renewable fuels or ethanol or anything in between, we've seen\ncompressions across the board in overall values as an industry. And I think a little bit of that is overblown,\nespecially the value of our asset base. If you look at a per gallon value of our asset base today, it's just\nsignificantly too low.\nBut we've had a few challenging quarters. And I think what we were able to show this quarter in a normal\nmargin environment, we can certainly deliver free cash flows.\nI think when we look at things like sugar that was delayed, it's not going to be an immediate impact to\nearnings. But what it is, we believe and we always have believed is that our CST technology developed at\nFluid Quip and now producing at Green Plains is a game-changer, but it's a longer-term process that will\ntake place, but we have significant interest in those products.\nSo I think, just overall, it's a little bit of everything. We've had ups and downs as a company. And I think\nthe margin environment continues to be very, very volatile in this industry, and we're just going to have\nto watch that closely. But our financial position remains strong. Our per gallon, just generally on a generic\nper gallon valuation, is too low relative to replacement and relative to other transactions. And I think, just\noverall, it's just a step process to get ourselves revalued back into where we need to be.\nJordan Levy\nTruist Securities, Inc., Research Division\nAppreciate that. And then maybe just kind of building on the CST side that you mentioned, I don't think\nit's quite as well of an understood market certainly as ethanol, but even as much as protein. But maybe\njust help differentiate the long-term value you see from that business from some of the more near-term\nchallenges we've seen in protein, and maybe just give a little more detail on how you view the sugar\ndextrose market evolving.\nTodd A. Becker\nPresident, CEO & Director\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 9\nGREEN PLAINS INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 31, 2024\nThat market and demand remains strong for dextrose overall, but even more so for low-carbon dextrose,\nas CPG companies continue to remain focused on lowering the carbon score of their products. And\nthat's where we see interest in everything from pancake syrup to industrial chemicals and everything\nin between. I think that's a misunderstanding that that's -- a lot of that happens in fermentation. Our\nsweeteners are used in many other areas, and that's really what we're producing.\nWe have started to receive our certifications. And now that we are producing product, our goal now is to\nget our food-grade certification so we can begin to sell into the consumer markets as well. I think that's\njust the first step of many steps that we want to do to monetize this product.\nThe margins remain strong. If you make dextrose instead of alcohol, your margin is significantly higher.\nAnd I think that's still proven by results that you see from the others in the space that make dextrose in\nwet mills. Those margins continue to remain strong, especially on that product.\nSo we have an interesting technology. We have interest in the technology from around the world right\nnow, and Fluid Quip continues to get calls in, in the work that they've done. And what we're proving out in\nthe United States, where we're really going to focus our efforts, is that there's significant demand. People\nhave waited for us, and it's from food all the way through chemicals. And I think you'll start to see us\ndeliver on some commercial volumes to customers and also some offtakes as well during the kind of next\n30 to 90 days. So we're really excited about that. The team has worked really hard.\nBut the margins have maintained themselves throughout this whole process and have not compressed\nrelative to everything else that we have seen. And we're really excited about it. It's a long game on this\none, but owning and controlling this IP and this technology and proving at commercial scale that we can\nmake low-carbon dextrose and sweeteners, this has never been done before in the history of agriculture\nat this type of scale and this type of level, where you can take a dry-grind facility and make dextrose to be\nused in food and industrial products. So it's really exciting, and it's a great testament to our team.\nOperator\nYour next question is from the line of Laurence Alexander, with Jefferies.\nKevin Estok\nJefferies LLC, Research Division\nThis is Kevin Estok on for Laurence. I've got 2 questions, one on clean sugar and one on ethanol margins.\nI guess, I know that you said that margins don't really reflect current conditions. And I guess just given\nthe direction that ethanol prices have moved in the last, like, several weeks, months, I mean, could you\nforesee producers possibly lowering rates, like temper production, to sort of lift pricing? I'd just be curious\nhow your outlook has changed for margins and prices since the last earnings. And I guess, I think you said\nlast call that the corn basis was coming down into Q3. Did that play out as expected?\nTodd A. Becker\nPresident, CEO & Director\nLook, this is a little bit of a wait and see on margins this quarter. I think what we saw was a compression\nlate in the quarter, you all saw that, you've all talked about that, late in the third quarter, and it continued\na little into October. But I think as we leave October, and these numbers that we saw yesterday prove that\nwhat we produce is being absorbed, with [ draws at a $10.80 ] run rate yesterday. And I think the market\nis going to have to adjust to that.\nI think we were dragged down by this weakness in oil and gasoline prices that we saw in the quarter, and\nethanol took a hit as well. But overall, I think hopefully we're going to -- we're bottoming out here, and\nagain, we saw some increase yesterday, and we'd like to see that continue and see what happens over the\nnext coming weeks.\nBut we still have turnarounds in the industry, and we still have some other areas where I think we're going\nto take some stuff offline naturally. But I don't know yet today that we're at a point where anybody is\ngoing to significantly reduce production. And as we go into next year, if we can maintain these stocks and\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 10\nGREEN PLAINS INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 31, 2024\nget through the first quarter and get into driving season again, I think that will be a very positive for next\nyear margins. And we do believe exports will remain strong through the rest of the year and hit those\nnumbers.\nSo generally speaking, we're using what we're producing, but it would be nice if we can get even a larger\ndraw. But with [ stated ] demand less than 20, typically, we see an expansion back into normal margin\nstructures.\nOn the corn basis, we've definitely come out of harvest firmer than I think anybody really thought. The\nfarmer was able to put some of this away. But we are -- the corn basis in Q3 was at least $0.50 a bushel\nbetter than the prior 3 years. So we saw that market come down, which obviously helped the margin\nstructure for everybody in the industry, including ourselves.\nAnd as we come out of harvest, basis is still lower in areas than traditional last couple of years, but it's\ndefinitely firmer than we thought. But we're not having any trouble buying corn. It's just a matter of -- at\nthese flat prices, with futures pushing towards $4, the basis is going to remain firm, I think, throughout\nthe year.\nKevin Estok\nJefferies LLC, Research Division\nUnderstood. And then just on clean sugar, as you announced earlier this week, the first commercial Clean\nSugar Tech [indiscernible], samples going to customers. Just curious what your feedback has been from\nthose customers, whether or not you've received feedback on those samples. And I guess, just curious\nabout the geographic makeup. I mean, are most of them North American customers? Any color there\nwould be helpful.\nTodd A. Becker\nPresident, CEO & Director\nI'll answer your last question first. They're all North American customers today. It's really where sugar is\ngoing to -- our dextrose is going to travel.\nBut we are seeing global demand for the technology from customers that want to talk to Fluid Quip about\nbringing their technologies to other countries. And again, we're not opposed to that. And I think it's going\nto be a very big value creator for them and for Green Plains as well.\nRelative to customer feedback, look, they've seen product already out of our York Innovation Center that\nis structurally similar to what we're producing in Shenandoah. And the product we'll have in Shenandoah\nwill be even better.\nSo for us, it's really a matter of time now. You have to make product before you can get food-grade\ncertification started, the process, and that's where we're at today, is we're going to start that process.\nBut you saw we had GMP approvals. We've got other approvals pending. And I think you'll start to see\nthat our product will become a very well accepted product. Our first goal is to ship our products into\nindustrial markets today because they're not food-grade markets, although they do need some of their\nown certifications.\nBut early feedback on stuff that we have shared has been good. But again, we're just starting to ship it\nout now. So it's going to take a little bit of time. This is a long game, but owning and controlling this IP\nand this technology that is such a disruption and game changing, and we have proven now that it works\nand it works at scale. But there's still some things we're going to have to continue to work through in\nShenandoah. But as we think about #2, it will be better engineered and better constructed in terms of\ncost and cost per pound and cost per ton and those type of things.\nI think we're on a -- it's just a long path, but this is absolutely a disruptive technology that has never --\nthis has never been done before in history, and we're very proud of the team that has done it. So thanks.\nOperator\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 11\nGREEN PLAINS INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 31, 2024\nYour next question is from the line of Saumya Jain, with UBS.\nSaumya Jain\nI guess I just wanted any color on how the partnership with Shell is progressing and if you guys have any\nupdates on Tharaldson as well.\nTodd A. Becker\nPresident, CEO & Director\nI'll let Leslie comment on our SFCT partnership. There's some exciting things going on there. Leslie, do\nyou want to comment on that to start?\nLeslie van der Meulen\nExecutive Vice President of Product Marketing & Innovation\nSure. So the process has successfully started up in York, and the first cellulosic ethanol has been\nproduced. The process will now switch to really a one-of-a-kind opportunity. The DCO, or what we call the\nsecond-gen DCO, is the next in line to line out. So that's basically the previously unattainable corn oil.\nAnd then the last piece is going to be the alignment of protein. Once that all is up and running, then the\nprocess will switch to campaign mode, and that's when we'll be producing more products for validation\nefforts on the protein side.\nTodd A. Becker\nPresident, CEO & Director\nThanks, Leslie. And then also then -- what was the second question that you had?\nSaumya Jain\nAny update on Tharaldson?\nTodd A. Becker\nPresident, CEO & Director\nTharaldson start-up. Obviously, it took a little bit longer than we wanted, construction took a little bit\nlonger. And we continue to debottleneck there, but we're starting to push towards the upper end of the\nrates that are available of the production capacity there.\nBringing on that much protein on the market, we had to wait for customer approvals, but the quality of\nthe protein is excellent. The toxin levels at Tharaldson are the lowest in the country, which is nice because\nthere are certainly customers that wanted North Dakota product because of the absolute zero toxin in\ncorn that is there. And so that's getting -- opening us new markets as well as the West Coast, where we\nreally did not have a freight advantage out of our terminals or out of our facilities to get to the West Coast.\nWe're seeing some new demand out of there as well.\nSo again, these are long games, but I think as we go to max production over the next several quarters,\nwe're just excited about the fact that we have a really great product and as Sequence starts to kick in, in\n2025. So more on that next quarter.\nOperator\nYour next question is from the line of Andrew Strelzik, from BMO Capital Markets.\nUnknown Analyst\nThis is actually Ben on for Andrew. I just want to say congratulations, Jim, and to Phil as well. Jim, I wish\nyou all the best of luck there.\nSo my question has to do with carbon capture. Can you just walk through the key milestones that we\nshould be tracking in order to hit the second half '25 $70 a credit target?\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 12\nGREEN PLAINS INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 31, 2024\nTodd A. Becker\nPresident, CEO & Director\nSo what we're watching very closely, obviously, is the lead time -- our equipment order. That is all on\ntrack. And we've been talking to the manufacturer, and they believe they are on track for our second\nquarter delivery.\nWe expect to break ground on the structure in the next several weeks, or less than a month from\nnow, and that will really be the first milestone. I think that will be important to everybody. Most of the\nengineering has been done already.\nWe have the credits -- the permits to operate in all the counties where we are located. Nebraska is very\ndifferent than other states relative to carbon capture and approvals and permits. And so very supportive\nfrom the state. So we'll wait to see when Trailblazer starts to build their laterals as well. And so we'll know\nat that point. I think we'll watch that closely.\nWe do have some [ air ] permits just to start construction, which we expect to receive shortly. Those\nare just permits from the state as we receive on every other construction project that we do, and there\ndoesn't seem to be any delays receiving those relative to the start of construction.\nSo then it's really up to our partner to make sure the pipeline is in service and the laterals are built and\nthe continuation of Class VI wells in Wyoming. All of this has been laid out in the past. And I think each of\nthose are going to be really important.\nI think what also is important is the rules on 45Z as they roll out early next year sometime. And we\nbelieve those will be positive relative to what we've seen in the past and expect certainly by the third\nquarter of next year to have those full rules outlined by the time we're sequestering carbon so we can\nearn the 45Z tax credit and then on top of that the voluntary credits or the LCFS credits.\nSo it's just a step-by-step process. But at this point, the equipment is in construction and in manufacture.\nSo this is -- we're on path to somewhere in that third quarter begin to compress carbon. And when we\nturn it on, we're basically turning it on at a full rate. And we have no reason to believe that our partner\nwon't be operational as well.\nSo we're -- I mean, I think that when you look at that and the interest that we have not only in the low-\ncarbon ethanol, which I think -- don't underestimate the interest in low-CI ethanol, both domestically\nand globally, especially as we start to see what we believe will be better outcomes in Europe on CORSIA\nmodeling, is what we're hearing as well, as well as some of the other things that are happening relative to\nmodeling in carbon markets.\nBut I think what's also really important is our door is also being knocked for getting those carbon credits\nand also providing us with payments relative to those credits. So I think the value of it is just very well\nmisrepresentative in our current share price, and I think that's going to have to change because the value\nof these assets are just too high in the future, especially relative to the future cash flows of when you\nadd that, corn oil in Nebraska, add on top of that protein in both of those plants, add on top of that those\nare some of the best plants that we have, generally speaking, long term, the value of that asset base is\nunderrepresentative in our share price.\nBut I think one thing that's really important here is that, which is missed and we don't talk about it much,\nis we think by the end of the year or early into the first quarter we will have 9 of our 10 plants approved\nfor D3 RIN generation for 1% or 2% of our capacity. And that D3 RINs, because we are -- you add certain\nthings into fermentation when you talk about 8 million or 9 million gallons and the spread between D3 and\nD6 RINs is $2.50 to $3 a gallon, that is not represented at all in our capabilities as a company.\nOn top of that, the Corn Kernel Fiber program in California is not represented either. And we think in 2025,\nthat also gets added to carbon earnings.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 13\nGREEN PLAINS INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 31, 2024\nSo there's a lot more going on here than just sequestering carbon, especially around D3 RIN generation\nwith our ability to make 1% or 2% of cellulosic or next-generation ethanol, as well as what's going to\nhappen with SFCT in the future.\nSo it's a step-by-step process, but I think each of those milestones will be met in carbon, and it's just now\na path to turning it on in the third quarter of next year.\nOperator\nYour next question is from the line of Salvator Tiano, with Bank of America.\nSalvator Tiano\nBofA Securities, Research Division\nFirstly, I wanted to check a little bit on any update on Blue Blade Energy. I think the plan was you test the\nSAF technology, and if it works you would start construction on the pilot plant this year, 2024. So where\ndo we stand on that?\nTodd A. Becker\nPresident, CEO & Director\nI think from the Blue Blade standpoint, what we've done is we had a partnership, and we looked at several\ndifferent catalysts -- we looked at a catalyst that we had control of. And at this point, we've decided not to\nproceed with that catalyst. I think there's other things with the other technologies that are out there that\nare much quicker to get to market.\nWhen you bring a new technology to market, as we learned in clean sugar and even in Sequence and\nother proteins, it just takes a long time to scale up. And since there are other technologies, much like a\nUOP Honeywell or others that are out there, we think that that's a much faster path to market for alcohol-\nto-jet.\nOur focus from that standpoint is we want to be a provider of low-carbon fuels, energy and ingredients,\nand that's where we're spending our time. Before anything happens in sustainable aviation fuel with\nalcohol-to-jet, you have to be able to decarbonize the alcohol. And being a significant advantage for Green\nPlains is we will have some of the largest quantities in the United States and globally on decarbonized\nalcohol middle of next year. And that's really where we're going to focus our efforts today.\nI think for Green Plains to build an alcohol-to-jet plant is probably not something we'd focus on today\nbecause I think we can earn a significant return for our shareholders by just making sure that we're a\ngreat supplier of low-carbon ingredients and fuels.\nSalvator Tiano\nBofA Securities, Research Division\nPerfect. And I wanted to ask also what's kind of your view for ethanol exports next year and essentially\ndemand from some key end markets or key producing markets like Brazil and India, given what's\nhappening in sugar production, among others?\nTodd A. Becker\nPresident, CEO & Director\nWe think this train is going to continue down the road relative to us finding our path into global markets\nas they have increased their blend rates. You saw Brazil did that. You saw other countries have done that.\nWe are going to -- we're hitting some of the European markets as a country as well. The EU is very strong,\nand we continue to think that will continue to gain momentum, especially if we see positive news out of\nCORSIA for U.S. ethanol and the way they model that relative to 20-year-old modeling that's been in\nplace. I think they've realized that we grow more corn per acre than 20 years ago, and that reduces our\noverall carbon scores.\nGenerally speaking, the demand remains robust globally. And I think that's going to continue because I\nthink we are a value molecule. We're $0.40 or $0.50 less than wholesale gasoline today, at a minimum,\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 14\nGREEN PLAINS INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 31, 2024\nplus in the United States with the RIN. But globally, we are very, very competitive as a molecule, and\nI think we've shown that we can ship significant quantities. And I don't believe next year will be any\ndifferent than this year. And I think we need that.\nAnd I think we also continue to see blends increase in the United States, especially as we go through\nquarter after quarter of a driving demand, which doesn't seem to be going down right now. We've seen\ngood driving miles in the last couple of months, and we saw great demand this week relative to the blend\nrate.\nSo if you add all that up together and if we can keep these stocks at check as we move into the end of the\nyear, I think we have a really good shot at a good margin environment in 2025.\nOperator\nYour next question is from the line of Kristen Owen, with Oppenheimer.\nKristen Owen\nOppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division\nA couple here that I wanted to ask on. First is the protein margins. You touched on this being a little bit\nlighter than what you were hoping for, that spread over traditional soybean meal not quite where you want\nit to be yet. But as we look at some of the soybean crush capacity and the transition in the policy in 2025,\nhow are you thinking about the premium for ultra-high protein as we come into this transition year next\nyear?\nTodd A. Becker\nPresident, CEO & Director\nIt's really going to depend on what market we go to. When we are sending our product internationally\nas we continue to grow those markets, we see -- we realize the full spread, and more, many times, or at\nleast within, plus or minus, 5 or 10 points of that.\nOur pet food demand remains strong. We've just renewed with our long-term customer and increased\nvolumes during the first quarter of next year on our 50 Pro product and continue to get full access to that,\nwith a new plant coming on next year as well.\nBut I think, look, there's a lot of protein coming. We've seen a lot of protein hit the market already, and\nwe've settled out at these type of spreads. Demand remains really good. We'll have to wait and see what\nhappens out of South America.\nLook, 14 million or 15 million tons sounds like a lot. And if it all comes at once, it is a lot of soy meal\nhitting the market. But when ethanol came on, we brought 40 million tons of distillers onto the market\nas well. And so I think we are going to absorb much of that. It may take a few more quarters or at least\nanother year or so.\nBut look, we still earn a margin. It's not like we don't earn a margin and a return on our investment. It's\njust that we've seen some compression relative to the soy against corn. And I think that's probably Â–\nthat is most likely stabilizing at this point. I don't think we're going to see much more compression against\nthose spreads. And we continue to make our product and sell everything that we produce.\nAnd one of our past and one of our things that we've always talked about is our way to get out of that is\nwe can make 60% protein products and higher even. And we're working on even some of those products\ntoday, and Leslie's team is making great progress. And we're learning how to reduce the cost of producing\nSequence, which I think drives a bigger margin contribution as well as we go into next year with the\nimprovements we're making and some of the other technology improvements we made and the cost of\nproduction coming down.\nSo it's a little bit of learning, but I think in the next 18 months a lot of this protein will just get absorbed\ninto the market. There's not a bunch more soy crush capacity to come on, and it seems to be coming on\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 15\nGREEN PLAINS INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 31, 2024\nin a more methodical pace. And you start to see investments being made in export capacity as well to get\nsome of this protein out of the country.\nKristen Owen\nOppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division\nOkay. That's helpful. I was actually thinking there's some soybean crush capacity that's not coming on and\npotentially flowing. So that could be a tailwind for your margins next year as well.\nTodd A. Becker\nPresident, CEO & Director\nYes, we've seen some of that, where projects were abandoned because of the cost versus the overall\nmargin structure. And we believe that's happening as well, that it will come on slower or not come on at\nall. And I think that will be helpful overall. And then we get into next year and let this RD market settle out\nand see where that settles out from the oil standpoint as well.\nKristen Owen\nOppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division\nSuper. So then my follow-up question, as you said, the $250 million to $300 million run rate value of\ncarbon just from those Nebraska assets probably not baked into most folks' models at this point in time.\nHelp us understand now that that is becoming much more within the next 12 months' time frame, help us\nunderstand the mechanics of those credits, how you think about monetization of them, like what sort of\ntolling fees you might have to pay to use that pipeline. Just give us a little bit more granularity so that we\ncan build that into our forecasts.\nTodd A. Becker\nPresident, CEO & Director\nSo let's start from the pipeline standpoint. We have an agreement with Trailblazer on transport and\ninjection, and that's just a fixed fee. And there's no sharing of our upside in our credit values from the\nrevenue side. So we just pay a standard transport midstream relationship that we have with Tallgrass --\nwith Trailblazer, owned by Tallgrass. And that's really -- it's very simple.\nAnd then what we generate is revenue from 45Z, 45Q and either voluntary credits or LCFS credits. And\nthat's the revenue side of the equation. And I think we've outlined in the past our carbon score reductions\nat Central City, Wood River and York, which will be on the pipelines to start. And I'll get into York in a\nsecond.\nBut when we look at the revenue side of the reduction, which is $0.02 per gallon per point from our\nstarting point is everything below 50 carbon score, that's on the revenue side with the 45Z.\nOn top of that, we'll be generating over 800,000 tons of high-quality carbon credits that either will flow\ninto California from the fuel standpoint, and we'll monetize LCFS and/or from voluntary markets.\nSo monetizing the 45Z and monetizing the carbon credit will be something that there are well-developed\nmarkets to do that. We've seen those trades in that 90%, 95% of face value happen, and that's in our\nnumbers as well. So we're going to sell those credits and monetize them and not use them internally\nunless we need to down the road from a standpoint of then we can realize 100% monetization of those\ncredits.\nSo we add all of that revenue up. We discount it by somewhere between 5% and 10% to get to our net\nrevenue; deduct our transport fees, a little bit of operational cost for the facility to get to an EBITDA\nnumber.\nNow when we look at York, York is today is a 45Q plant because they start with a higher carbon score. But\nwe are on deck to lower their carbon score through low-energy distillation, that we would expect that we\nwill try to get that into service within the first 6 to 12 months of their operations so that we can have that\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 16\nGREEN PLAINS INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 31, 2024\nplant qualify for 45Z as well, which is upside to those numbers once we're able to do that. And we'll do\nother things to reduce our carbon scores overall to give upside to those numbers.\nSo it's 287 million gallons generating 800,000 tons or more of carbon credits. And we today have interest\nfrom companies and the broker markets to take our credits to market and/or come up with some structure\nto monetize those credits the day we start. And we can actually start selling credits before we even start\nto sequester carbon, knowing that we will be sequestering carbon at a certain date, and we have interest\nin that as well.\nSo generally speaking, the demand for the alcohol remains strong from alcohol-to-jet players, and\nthe demand for the credit remains strong from the tax credit markets all the way up from the Big\nTech companies that need to buy offsets, and they can use our tax credits, all the way down into just\nmonetizing into the LCFS market.\nIs that helpful for you?\nDid we lose everybody?\nJames E. Stark\nChief Financial Officer\nNo. We must have lost her. Operator, time for the next call?\nOperator\nYour next question is from the line of Matthew Blair, with TPH.\nMatthew Robert Lovseth Blair\nTudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, LLC, Research Division\nCongrats, Jim and Phil, on your respective moves here. I wanted to ask about the election risk to the IRA\nand the associated credits like 45Z and Q. I think the Wall Street Journal had a story yesterday talking\nabout how a potential candidate for Treasury Secretary was talking about scrapping the entire IRA. What\ndo you make of that? How much does that concern you? And is there anything you can be doing today to\npotentially mitigate some of that risk?\nTodd A. Becker\nPresident, CEO & Director\nI'll let Devin comment on that first, and I'll close off after that.\nDevin Mogler\nSenior Vice President of Corporate & Investor Relations\nSure. So thanks for the question, Matthew. We saw that article, and there's been a lot of talk in this\ncampaign if Republicans sweep of trying to eliminate the entire IRA. You'll recall that they tried to do this\nwith the debt ceiling lift back in April of '23, and there were 7 Republican House members, all of whom\nhad voted against the IRA, who blocked that from happening as it relates to 45Z.\nSo there remains bipartisan support for not only preserving but extending 45Z. Several bills have\nbeen introduced with both Republican and Democratic support to extend that credit. And you've got\nto remember that there's now multiple industries that are interested in this. It's not just biodiesel and\nrenewable diesel and ethanol. It's also sustainable aviation fuel because the 40B credit rolls into the 45Z.\nSo we believe that regardless of the election outcome there will be support for that program. And while\nsome aspects of the IRA may be curtailed if Republicans control all 3 corners, we think the prospects are\nbright for having that extended to have a much longer runway.\nTodd A. Becker\nPresident, CEO & Director\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 17\nGREEN PLAINS INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 31, 2024\nAnd one last thing, Matthew, is the 45Q -- let's just say, worst-case scenario, the 45Q is the remaining\nprogram. If that were to happen, which we do not believe that will happen, that is not part of the IRA.\nIt's expanded during the IRA, but it's not part of the IRA. And I think that that's an important point as\nwell. And it's a 12-year program that starts when you start sequestering carbon. It doesn't go away from\n2 years ago to 10 years from now. It goes away 12 years after you start to sequester carbon. It's been\npermanent for a long time in the program, and it's a direct-pay program as well for the first 5 years.\nSo while we certainly would not like that to be the program, because I think there's much more\nopportunities around 45Z, if that were worst-case scenario, then we'd have less revenues around carbon,\nbut it would still be a significantly profitable project. Instead of paying off in less than a year, it maybe\nwould pay off in a year and 4 months. And it's really not that much of a big difference for us. But it\ncertainly is nicer to have the 45Z, and we do believe that will stay intact.\nMatthew Robert Lovseth Blair\nTudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, LLC, Research Division\nThat's helpful. And then earlier in the call there was some talk about Mount Vernon and Obion increasing\ncapacity. What's the total capacity increases that you're expecting? And does that shift anything on your\nproduct slate? Would you expect to increase your exports as a result of that new capacity?\nTodd A. Becker\nPresident, CEO & Director\nSo Mount Vernon is complete. We've redone all the full conveyor systems among other bins and tanks and\nsystems and processes, and that was needed. We're starting to ramp that plant back up as we speak, and\nthat should add about 20 million gallons of yearly production run rate capacity there. And when we add\ngallons, we add pounds of corn oil, and we add tons of protein on top of that. That has a protein system\ndown there as well. So it's going to be all 3 components there.\nIn Obion, we're waiting for final construction of the RTO, instead of a TO, thermal oxidizer, to a\nregenerative thermal oxidizer, and that will allow the plant then to get back to the traditional run rate.\nThat is another 20 million to 25 million gallons of opportunity per year as well. And that project should\nbe completed in the first quarter of next year. That plant should be running at a much higher rate, but\nbecause of the longer-term effects of this piece of equipment, we haven't been able to. And then we\nbrought protein on. And now combined, it's just overloading all of the systems, and we're going to be able\nto get that back in line sometime hopefully early in the first quarter of next year as well.\nSo the 2 of those combined should add 40 million to 50 million gallons -- about 40 million gallons of\nadditional capacity that we bring online, but it doesn't necessarily change where we ship. It's just shipping\nmore product to the same markets, and those markets are ready to absorb everything we bring on.\nOperator\nYour next question is from the line of Craig Irwin, with ROTH Capital Partners.\nCraig Irwin\nROTH MKM Partners, LLC, Research Division\nFirst, I would say congratulations, Phil, on the promotion. Jim, going to miss you. It's been great working\nwith you this last many years.\nMy question is around clean sugar. I wanted to ask for a little bit more color. Todd, do you feel some of\nthe projected economics that you've talked about these last couple of years are starting to be confirmed\nby the plant start-up? And then if we rewind about a year, there was some optimism that we could\nstart seeing additional facilities once this plant was up and running. What do you expect to see out of\nShenandoah? What do you need to see out of this plant to make a go decision to invest in the next\nfacility? And can you remind us maybe on the CapEx and project returns that we should be thinking\nabout?\nTodd A. Becker\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 18\nGREEN PLAINS INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 31, 2024\nPresident, CEO & Director\nThanks. And we have significant optimism for this product, the production process. There's definitely\nthings that we will do different in a much larger facility than we did here relative to some of the equipment\nthat we had outlined in the past, where we had some early issues that we worked through and have fixed\nsome of those issues. But I think the engineering on plant #2 would be different than plant #1 just in\nterms of improving the capabilities of the asset.\nThe econs are very similar to when we started this 5 years ago. We said it's $0.67 to $0.87 a gallon uplift\nrelative to making alcohol, and those still exist today, even relative to sugar prices and sweetener prices\nthat are out there, on top of lower corn and input costs. So from that standpoint, nothing's changed\neconomically on how we think about a full-blown build of a clean sugar facility at a plant, either ours or\neven potentially stand-alone, with support of a Gen-1 ethanol plant.\nSo additional facilities, more to come on that. I think what we want to do is -- like I said, it's only been a\nweek we've been at it. Give us a little more time. But I think what has been proven is that we can make\nthe product. We can -- we're shipping the product. It's in rail cars. It will be shipped in trucks. It will end\nup on people's doorsteps for them to analyze. We still have to get food-grade certification. And we'd like\nto run it just a little bit longer than a week or 2 and continue to optimize and continue to drive better\nand better product quality, because I think we can continue to do that. It's not just around 95 dextrose\nequivalent. There's 63 and 48. And I think that we want to make sure we can make all of those as well.\nAnd then we want to make sure we get into the food market.\nSo it will be a little bit before we decide on plant #2, but I can tell you based on early returns we're very\noptimistic that that technology will be radically transformed, not just what we can do at a dry mill, but the\nindustry in general over the long term, not necessarily in the next 6 to 12 months.\nBut CapEx, still working through that. We've seen some stuff come down and some stuff go up. Labor is\nstill a challenge when you build anything. And long lead time on electrical gear and switches and those\ntype of things remain a significant challenge with all the data center demand that exists in the United\nStates and other things that are happening around nuclear and those type of things.\nBut when we look at CST and we look at clean sugar and we look at what we can make out of a dry-grind\nfacility when everybody said, \"You can't do that,\" I'm going to tell you this right now, we are absolutely\n100% doing it. It's an amazing technology from Fluid Quip. It still has some work to do relative to what we\nwould do maybe in Serial #2, but we are really, really optimistic about the future of this technology as a\nwhole.\nCraig Irwin\nROTH MKM Partners, LLC, Research Division\nSo my follow-up question, I guess, is a 2-part question, right? Can you maybe share with us the --\nwell, the housekeeping side is really sales mix on High Pro products, 50 versus 60 Pro. Do you have an\nestimated mix exiting the year and then comments around what you think is reasonable for Green Plains\nto target in 2025?\nAnd then the second part is the blue sky economics out of High Pro, one of the more exciting parts of the\nstory was always the collaboration with Novozymes for some tailored products that might have improved\nnutritional profile and make it an even better match for many of the markets that you're pursuing. Do you\nhave an update on the Novozymes partnership? Is there anything we should look for there over the next\nnumber of quarters?\nTodd A. Becker\nPresident, CEO & Director\nI'll start with that, and I'll have Leslie talk about some of the things that we're doing around product\nquality and nutritional quality and working with other customers on that.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 19\nGREEN PLAINS INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 31, 2024\nBut we have re-signed our agreement with Novozymes and our partnership. We did it quietly, as we're\nworking together on several products and several opportunities. We are -- it's an amazing partnership\nbetween Green Plains and Novozymes and what we've been able to accomplish together, and especially\naround development of higher proteins and different nutritional characteristics that we continue to work\non. So that has been renewed.\nOn top of that, we talked about our pet food customer has begun to renew for 2025 as well, as we just\nfinished the first quarter at higher volumes in 2025.\nAnd so we're really excited to work together on all different types of recipes with Novozymes, inclusive of\ngenerating these D3 RINs as well.\nEverything evolved in all of these technologies. When we started out, we thought we'd put protein\neverywhere. And along came the IRA, and now we're going to invest capital into carbon sequestration with\nsignificant returns. And someday, I'm absolutely confident we'll continue to build protein systems as we\nabsorb this protein into the market. Because what we have is, depending on the species, it's a very special\nproduct that does really interesting things relative to that.\nWe continue to work with some of the largest pet food customers in the world on 60 Pro inclusions in\n2025, and we believe we are going to get a significant lift relative to demand from this year to next year.\nToday, we are making 60 Pro product. We are shipping 60 Pro product around the world. As we always\nsay, it always take longer than we ever really want it to take. But when you kind of look at what we've\nbeen able to accomplish so far and where we've been able to ship this product, our team has done a great\njob finding homes for the product. And we are still working with those same large pet food customers on\ngetting 60 Pro in large volumes into their systems.\nWhat we want to make sure though, and Leslie may talk about that, is that what we send them is the\nsame every day out of every location. And that's why we wanted to make sure that we got -- we did a\nlittle bit of CapEx in Wood River and Central City and wanted to make sure that we are able to ship that\nproduct consistently.\nWe are developing new markets in Asia and South America. We expect volumes to ramp up as we get\nthrough Jan and June and then really ramp up in July through Dec of next year. We have very large\nvolumes that we expect to kick in, in July of next year. And we have other customers that we can sell\nmore volumes of Sequence without negatively impacting anything else that we do. It's only positive\nimpacts.\nSo overall, everything always takes longer, as we always know, but the demand for our product remains\nstrong, and we expect to make significant inroads in the 60 Pro market next year.\nLeslie, do you want to talk a little bit about some of the things we're doing on quality?\nLeslie van der Meulen\nExecutive Vice President of Product Marketing & Innovation\nSure. As Todd mentioned earlier, I think you're kind of looking at a bookend, where we're looking at\nconsistency on the product side, really making sure that that is where our customers can actually go\nto increased inclusion levels, and then the other side, which was already mentioned, is really the cost\nreduction. So that's been an opportunity for us to really tailor the use of our biological system to fine-\ntune it. On top of that, the team has been working on increased protein concentrations, which is, again,\nalmost a third-generation product that we're working on. But I think the main focus has been between\nthat consistency and the OpEx reduction side.\nCraig Irwin\nROTH MKM Partners, LLC, Research Division\nExcellent. Congratulations on the really strong crush margins this quarter. It's good to see those come\nthrough.\nOperator\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc.

FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 31, 2024\nI would now like to hand today's call back over to Todd Becker, CEO, for any closing remarks.\nTodd A. Becker\nPresident, CEO & Director\nThanks, everybody, for jumping on the call and participating in today's call.\nOur teams continue to execute at a high rate. We look forward to sharing our continued progress with you\nin coming months.\nWe also want to make sure that we provide you with the information you need to make the best decisions\naround our company. And as you can see with our carbon strategy, which is very unique and very\nadvantaged and very early in the cycle, is going to be providing significant what we believe shareholder\nvalue creation.\nOn top of that, all of our products are starting to kick in. And obviously, when strong margin environments\nexist in the base product of fuel, which we believe will start to ramp back up as we get into 2025, I think\nwe're well positioned to capitalize on all that we've invested and all the strategic advantages that we have\nas a company.\nAnd again, we wish Jim best of luck and Phil best of luck in his new role. And we really appreciate your\nsupport, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thank you for everybody being on the call.\nOperator\nThis concludes today's call. Thank you for joining.
