For important information on the Company’s non-IFRS measures, see “Non-IFRS Financial Measures” below.   \n  \n**Chief Executive Officer Commentary**\n\nMatevž Mazij, Chief Executive Officer for Bragg, commented, “The third quarter marked another period of strong growth and record results for Bragg. Revenue grew 16% year-over-year, gross profit increased 18%, and Adjusted EBITDA rose 7%. In the U.S., strong third quarter revenue gains from content distribution helped drive a 40% global increase in proprietary online content revenue year-over-year. \n\n“Additionally, we announced today that the Board of Directors has unanimously decided to conclude its review of strategic alternatives for Bragg. After extensive evaluation and deliberation, the Board determined that the ongoing execution of the Company’s strategic plan is the best way to maximize value for shareholders at this time. \n\n“Since stepping in as Chairman 16 months ago and then as CEO 14 months ago, we’ve transformed our executive team, restructured commercial operations, and sharpened our sales strategy with a targeted, jurisdictional approach. These decisive actions position us to drive growth and capture market opportunities with greater precision and impact. Under new leadership, we’ve built a strong pipeline of tier 1 opportunities across key markets and key products, positioning Bragg for accelerated top- and bottom-line growth. \n\n“With the strategic review process now complete, Bragg is now fully focused on commercialization and unlocking profitable growth, without the need for significant new investment in product development. Our decade-long investments in technology and talent, combined with a robust leadership team, have built a scalable platform that uniquely positions us for aggressive growth in 2025 and beyond. With significant operating leverage now within reach, we’re poised for an exciting, high-growth, and profitable future.” \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 and Recent Business Highlights**\n\n  * Launched its newest games and Remote Gaming Server (RGS) technology with Caesars Digital in Pennsylvania and Ontario. The launch marked the expansion of Bragg’s existing partnership with Caesars Digital, following earlier launches in New Jersey and Michigan respectively, doubling the number of states/provinces in which Bragg content is offered on Caesars Palace Online Casino and Caesars Sportsbook & Casino. \n  * Launched its newest games and RGS technology with FanDuel in New Jersey, adding to its existing distribution with the leading North American operator in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Connecticut and Ontario \n  * Post-quarter end, the Company additionally launched its newest games and RGS technology with bet365 in New Jersey, following on from its second quarter launch in Pennsylvania, and an earlier launch in Ontario with the major global iGaming operator \n  * Launched HardRockCasino.nl in the Dutch market, supplying its cutting-edge player account management (PAM) software to the brand. The agreement is Bragg’s 6th PAM customer in the Netherlands, reinforcing Bragg’s status as the leading technology and content supplier in the Dutch market \n  * Launched the Kambi sportsbook on 711.nl, adding an additional revenue-generating product stream to a key PAM customer in the Netherlands \n  * Management is pleased to announce the appointment of Robbie Bressler to CFO of Bragg, effective immediately. Robbie had been serving as Bragg’s interim CFO since July 1, 2024. \n\n\n\n**Additional September 30, 2024 Key Financial Metrics**\n\n  * For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, Cash flow generated from operations was EUR 8.4 million (USD 9.4 million), compared to EUR 6.2 million (USD 6.9 million) for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. \n  * Cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 was EUR 11.6 million (USD 13.0 million) and net working capital, excluding deferred consideration, loans payable, and convertible debt, was EUR 11.3 million (USD 12.7 million) \n\n\n\n**Strategic Alternatives Process Concluded**\n\nThe Bragg Board announced the strategic alternatives process in March 2024 with the formation of a Special Committee, comprised solely of independent members of the Board. The Committee, together with its advisors Oakvale Capital LLP and Blake, Cassels & Graydon LLP, evaluated a wide range of strategic alternatives for maximizing shareholder value including a potential sale or merger of the Company. Bragg solicited interest from a significant number of potential counterparties and received multiple non-binding proposals. \n\nAfter careful consideration, the Board, on recommendation from the special committee, unanimously determined that none of the proposals received reflect the Company’s intrinsic value or current and projected financial performance, and therefore elected to conclude its review and disband the Special Committee. \n\nDon Robertson, independent Board member and Chair of the Special Committee, said, “After a comprehensive and exhaustive process, the Committee recommended, and the Board unanimously agreed, that continuing to execute Bragg’s strategic plan as an independent public company is the best approach for maximizing shareholder value. Although the process has now concluded, Bragg’s Board will continue to be open to and consider all opportunities for enhancing shareholder value.” \n\n“Over the past year, our financial performance, cashflow generation and revenue outlook have significantly improved. We remain extremely confident about our business plan, operating strategy, and financial prospects” said Matevz Mazij, Chairman and CEO of Bragg. \n\n**Reiterates Full Year 2024 Guidance and 2025 Outlook**\n\nBragg reiterates its 2024 full year revenue guidance range of EUR 102.0-109.0 million (USD 114.2-122.1 million) and its full year Adjusted EBITDA range of EUR 15.2-18.5 million (USD 17.0-20.7 million), noting that the Company is currently tracking to the lower end of guidance. \n\nBragg is actively advancing a robust pipeline of opportunities that is anticipated to drive strong momentum as we enter 2025. The outlook for 2025 remains positive, with expectations of sustained double-digit top line growth, expanding bottom line margins, and increased operational leverage, further strengthening Bragg’s position in the market. The preceding guidance and outlook constitute forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws, and is based on a number of assumptions and subject to a number of risks. \n\n**Investor Conference Call**\n\nThe Company will host a conference call today, November 14, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time, to discuss its third quarter 2024 results.

Forward-looking statements are provided for the purpose of presenting information about management’s current expectations and plans relating to the future and allowing readers to get a better understanding of the Company’s anticipated financial position, results of operations, and operating environment. Often, but not always, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as “plans”, “expects” or “does not expect”, “is expected”, “budget”, “scheduled”, “estimates”, “forecasts”, “intends”, “anticipates” or “does not anticipate”, or “believes”, or describes a “goal”, or variation of such words and phrases or state that certain actions, events or results “may”, “could”, “would”, “might” or “will” be taken, occur or be achieved. \n\nAll forward-looking statements contained in this news release or the conference call reflect the Company’s beliefs and assumptions based on information available at the time the statements were made. Actual results or events may differ from those predicted in these forward-looking statements. All of the Company’s forward-looking statements are qualified by the assumptions that are stated or inherent in such forward-looking statements, including the assumptions listed below. Although the Company believes that these assumptions are reasonable, this list is not exhaustive of factors that may affect any of the forward-looking statements. The key assumptions that have been made in connection with the forward-looking statements include the regulatory regime governing the business of the Company; the operations of the Company; the products and services of the Company; the Company’s customers; the growth of Company’s business, meeting minimum listing requirements of the stock exchanges on which the Company’s shares trade; the integration of technology; and the anticipated size and/or revenue associated with the gaming market globally. \n\nForward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, future events, conditions, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, prediction, projection, forecast, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Such factors include, among others, the following: risks related to the Company’s business and financial position; that the Company may not be able to accurately predict its rate of growth and profitability; risks associated with general economic conditions; adverse industry events; future legislative and regulatory developments; the inability to access sufficient capital from internal and external sources; the inability to access sufficient capital on favourable terms; realization of growth estimates, income tax and regulatory matters; the ability of the Company to implement its business strategies; competition; economic and financial conditions, including volatility in interest and exchange rates, commodity and equity prices; changes in customer demand; disruptions to our technology network including computer systems and software; natural events such as severe weather, fires, floods and earthquakes; any disruptions to operations as a result of the strategic alternatives review process; and risks related to health pandemics and the outbreak of communicable diseases. Although the Company has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, there may be other factors that cause actions, events or results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended. There can be no assurance that forward-looking statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. \n\nThe Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except in accordance with applicable securities laws. \n\n**Non-IFRS Financial Measures**\n\nStatements in this news release make reference to “Adjusted EBITDA”, which is a non-IFRS (as defined herein) financial measure that the Company believes is appropriate to provide meaningful comparison with, and to enhance an overall understanding of, the Company’s past financial performance and prospects for the future. The Company believes that “Adjusted EBITDA” provides useful information to both management and investors by excluding specific expenses and items that management believe are not indicative of the Company’s core operating results. “Adjusted EBITDA” is a financial measure that does not have a standardized meaning under International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). As there is no standardized method of calculating “Adjusted EBITDA”, it may not be directly comparable with similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company considers “Adjusted EBITDA” to be a relevant indicator for measuring trends in performance and its ability to generate funds to service its debt and to meet its future working capital and capital expenditure requirements. “Adjusted EBITDA” is not a generally accepted earnings measure and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income (loss), cash flows or other measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. Adjusted EBITDA is more fully defined and discussed, and reconciliation to IFRS financial measures is provided, in Company’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) for the three-month and six-month period ended September 30, 2024. \n\n**About Bragg Gaming Group**\n\n[Bragg Gaming Group](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fbragg.group%2F&esheet=54152674&newsitemid=20241114956792&lan=en-US&anchor=Bragg+Gaming+Group&index=6&md5=148e30a9dcb9fd4ba76d381f72dccef1) ( [NASDAQ: BRAG](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nasdaq.com%2Fmarket-activity%2Fstocks%2Fbrag&esheet=54152674&newsitemid=20241114956792&lan=en-US&anchor=NASDAQ%3A+BRAG&index=7&md5=5723c0f38676869fb071c8e38fba1a1f), [ TSX: BRAG](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmoney.tmx.com%2Fen%2Fquote%2FBRAG&esheet=54152674&newsitemid=20241114956792&lan=en-US&anchor=TSX%3A+BRAG&index=8&md5=160643a4c35b94f4a4f7e789d07bb8a7) ) is an iGaming content and turnkey technology solutions provider serving online and land-based gaming operators with its proprietary and exclusive content, and cutting-edge technology.

The following is a\ndescription of those risks and how the exposures are managed.\nLiquidity risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Company is unable to generate or obtain sufficient cash and cash equivalents in a cost-\neffective manner to fund its obligations as they come due. The Company will experience liquidity risks if it fails to maintain\nappropriate levels of cash and cash equivalents, is unable to access sources of funding or fails to appropriately diversify\nsources of funding. If any of these events were to occur, they could adversely affect the financial performance of the\nCompany.\nThe Company has a planning and budgeting process in place by which it anticipates and determines the funds required to\nsupport its normal operating requirements. The Company coordinates this planning and budgeting process with its\nfinancing activities through its capital management process. The Company holds sufficient cash and cash equivalents and\nworking capital, maintained through stringent cash flow management, to ensure sufficient liquidity is maintained. The\nCompany is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.\nThe following are the undiscounted contractual maturities of significant financial liabilities and the total contractual\nobligations of the Company as at September 30, 2024:\n2024 2025 2026 2027 Thereafter Total\nTrade payables and other liabilities 19,683 — — — — 19,683\nLease obligations on right of use assets 187 771 750 772 834 3,314\nLoans payable 219 6,970 — — — 7,189\nOther non-current liabilities 1 3 3 7 778 792\n20,090 7,744 753 779 1,612 30,978\n26\nBRAGG GAMING GROUP INC.\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE THREE AND NINE-MONTHS PERIODS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2023\nPRESENTED IN EUROS (THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE AMOUNTS)\n21 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)\nFOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK\nThe Company is exposed to foreign currency risk, which includes risks related to its revenue and operating expenses\ndenominated in currencies other than EUR, which is both the reporting currency and primary contracting currency of the\nCompany’s customers. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates may in the future reduce the purchasing power of the\nCompany’s customers thereby potentially negatively affecting the Company’s revenue and other operating results.\nThe Company has experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in its net income (loss) as a result of\ntranslation gains or losses related to revaluing certain current asset and current liability balances that are denominated\nin currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded.\nCredit risk\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk resulting from the possibility that counterparties could default on their financial\nobligations to the Company including cash and cash equivalents, other assets and accounts receivable. Failure to manage\ncredit risk could adversely affect the financial performance of the Company.\nThe Company mitigates the risk of credit loss relating to accounts receivable by evaluating the creditworthiness of new\ncustomers and establishes a provision for expected credit losses. The Company applies the simplified approach to provide\nfor expected credit losses as prescribed by IFRS 9, Financial Instruments, which permits the use of the lifetime expected\nloss provision for all accounts receivable. The expected credit loss provision is based on the Company’s historical\ncollections and loss experience and incorporates forward-looking factors, where appropriate.\nThe provision matrix below shows the expected credit loss rate for each aging category of accounts receivable as at\nSeptember 30, 2024:\nA ging (months )\nNote <1 1 - 3 >3 Total\nGross trade receivable 15 15,972 1,673 2,984 20,629\nExpected loss rate 2.56% 7.39% 72.64% 13.09%\nExpected loss provision 15 409 124 2,168 2,701\nGross accounts receivable includes the balance of accrued income within the aging category of less than one month.\n27\nBRAGG GAMING GROUP INC.\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE THREE AND NINE-MONTHS PERIODS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2023\nPRESENTED IN EUROS (THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE AMOUNTS)\n21 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)\nConcentration risk\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, one customer (three and nine months ended September 30,\n2023: one customer) contributed more than 10% each to the Company’s revenues. Aggregate revenues from this customer\ntotaled EUR 5,853 and EUR 17,723, respectively, for the three and nine months period ended September 30, 2024 (three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2023: EUR 6,328 and EUR 22,805 respectively).\nAs at September 30, 2024, one customer (December 31, 2023: one customer) constituted more than 10% of the\nCompany’s accounts receivable.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS\nThis Management Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) provides a review of the results of operations, financial condition and cash flow\nfor Bragg Gaming Group Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Bragg” or the “Company”), on a consolidated basis, for the three and nine months\nperiod ended September 30, 2024 (“3Q24”). This document should be read in conjunction with the interim unaudited condensed\nconsolidated financial statements for the three and nine months period ended September 30, 2024 (the “Interim Financial\nStatements”).\nFor reporting purposes, the Company prepared the Interim Financial Statements in European Euros (“EUR”) and, unless otherwise\nindicated, in conformity with International Accounting Standards (“IAS”) 34, Interim Financial Reporting, as issued by the International\nAccounting Standards Board (“IASB”). The financial information contained in this MD&A was derived from the Interim Financial\nStatements. Unless otherwise indicated, all references to a specific “note” refer to the notes to the Interim Financial Statements.\nThis MD&A references non-International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) financial measures, including those under the\nheadings “Selected Financial Information” and “Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data” below. The Company believes these non-\nIFRS financial measures will provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of its business,\nenable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and\nallow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating its business and making decisions.\nAlthough management believes these financial measures are important in evaluating the Company, they are not intended to be\nconsidered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with IFRS.\nNon-IFRS measures are not recognized measures under IFRS and do not have standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS. These\nmeasures may be different from non-IFRS financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison\npurposes. These non-IFRS measures and metrics are used to provide investors with supplemental measures of our operating\nperformance and liquidity and thus highlight trends in our business that may nor otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS\nmeasures.\nFor purposes of this MD&A, the term “gaming license” refers collectively to all the different licenses, consents, permits, authorizations,\nand other regulatory approvals that are necessary to be obtained in order for the Company to lawfully conduct (or be associated with)\ngaming in a particular jurisdiction.\nUnless otherwise stated, in preparing this MD&A the Company has considered information available to it up to November 14, 2024,\nthe date the board of directors of the Company (the “Board”) approved this MD&A.\nBragg Gaming Group Inc. 2\nManagement Discussion & Analysis\nSeptember 30, 2024\n2. CAUTION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis MD&A contains forward-looking information and statements (collectively, “forward-looking statements”) within the meaning of\nthe Canadian securities legislation and applicable securities laws, including financial and operational expectations and projections.\nThese statements, other than statements of historical fact, are based on management’s current expectations and are subject to a\nnumber of risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, including market and economic conditions, business prospects or opportunities,\nfuture plans and strategies, projections, technological developments, anticipated events and trends and regulatory changes that affect\nthe Company, its subsidiaries and their respective customers and industries. Although the Company and management believe the\nexpectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are appropriate and are based on reasonable assumptions and estimates\nas of the date hereof, there can be no assurance that these assumptions or estimates are accurate or that any of these expectations\nwill prove accurate. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to significant business, regulatory, economic and competitive\nrisks, uncertainties and contingencies that could cause actual events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in such\nstatements. Forward-looking statements are often, but not always, identified by the use of words such as “seek”, “anticipate”, “plan”,\n“continue”, “estimate”, “expect”, “may”, “will”, “project”, “predict”, “potential”, “targeting”, “intend”, “could”, “might”, “would”,\n“should”, “believe”, “objective”, “ongoing”, “imply” or the negative of these words or other variations or synonyms of these words or\ncomparable terminology and similar expressions.\nBy their nature forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors which may cause\nactual results, events or developments to be materially different from any future results, events or developments expressed or implied\nby such forward-looking statements. Such factors include, among other things, the Company’s stage of development, long-term capital\nrequirements and future ability to fund operations, future developments in the Company’s markets and the markets in which it expects\nto compete, risks associated with its strategic alliances, the impact of entering new markets on the Company’s operations, and risks\nassociated with new or proposed gaming regulations. Each factor should be considered carefully, and readers are cautioned not to\nplace undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. See the section, “Risk Factors and Uncertainties”, below noting that these\nfactors are not intended to represent a complete list of the factors that could affect the Company.\nShareholders and investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as the plans, assumptions, intentions or\nexpectations upon which they are based might not occur. The forward-looking statements contained in this MD&A are expressly\nqualified by this cautionary statement. Unless otherwise indicated by the Company, forward-looking statements in this MD&A describe\nthe Company’s expectations as of November 14, 2024, and, accordingly, are subject to change after such date. The Company does not\nundertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements, except in accordance with applicable securities laws.\n3. LIMITATIONS OF KEY METRICS AND OTHER DATA\nThe Company’s key metrics are calculated using internal Company data. While these numbers are based on what the Company believes\nto be reasonable judgments and estimates of customer numbers for the applicable period of measurement, there are certain\nchallenges and limitations in measuring the usage of its product offerings across its customer base. In addition, the Company’s key\nmetrics and related estimates may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of its competitors\ndue to differences in methodology and access to information.\nFor important information on the Company’s non-IFRS measures, see the information presented in “Limitations of Key Metrics and\nOther Data” and “Selected Financial information” below. The Company continually seeks to improve its estimates of its active\ncustomer base and the level of customer activity, and such estimates may change due to improvements or changes in the Company’s\nmethodology.\nBragg Gaming Group Inc. 3\nManagement Discussion & Analysis\nSeptember 30, 2024\n4.

After extensive\nevaluation and deliberation, the Board determined that the ongoing execution of the Company’s strategic plan is the best way to\nmaximize value for shareholders at this time.\nThe Bragg Board announced the strategic alternatives process in March 2024 with the formation of a Special Committee, comprised\nsolely of independent members of the Board. The Committee, together with its advisors Oakvale Capital LLP and Blake, Cassels &\nGraydon LLP, evaluated a wide range of strategic alternatives for maximizing shareholder value including a potential sale or merger\nof the Company. Bragg solicited interest from a significant number of potential counterparties and received multiple non-binding\nproposals. After careful consideration, the Board, on recommendation from the special committee, unanimously determined that\nnone of the proposals received reflect the Company’s intrinsic value or current and projected financial performance, and therefore\nelected to conclude its review and disband the Special Committee. Bragg’s Board will continue to be open to and consider all\nopportunities for enhancing shareholder value.\nFinancial performance in the third quarter of 2024\nThe Company is pleased to report on its trading performance during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The\nCompany has continued to deliver against its strategic objectives, achieving growth, while remaining committed to revenue\ndiversification and geographic expansion.\nRevenue\nThe Company’s revenue1 for the period ended September 30, 2024 increased from the same period in the previous year by 15.9% to\nEUR 26.2m (3Q23: EUR 22.6M). The Company’s year-over-year revenue growth was mainly organic through its existing customer\nbase, and the onboarding of new customers in various jurisdictions. See “Risks and Uncertainties” below.\nThe Company’s revenue growth was mainly derived from the games and content segment which amounted to EUR 20.5m (3Q23:\nEUR 17.9m) and accounted for 78.2% (3Q23: 79.4%) of total revenues, as demand for the Company’s unique games and content and\ntechnology proposition continues to grow.

The gross profit margin increase is primarily the result of increased revenue\nperformance in all content products categories while recording lower PAM and managed services revenues.\nExpenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased from the same period in the previous year by 13.7% to EUR 14.8m (3Q23:\nEUR 13.0m) amounting to 56.7% of total revenue (3Q23: 57.8%).\nThe increase of costs is in line with the Company’s investment in its growth strategy, as the Company continues to build its\nfoundation as a scalable and innovative vertically integrated content and technology provider in the iGaming industry.\n1 Revenue includes group share in Game and content, platform fees and management and turnkey solutions.\nBragg Gaming Group Inc. 5\nManagement Discussion & Analysis\nSeptember 30, 2024\nMain changes in the quarter were driven by the following:\n(a) Salaries and subcontractors decreased by 7.3% to EUR 5.2m (3Q23: EUR 5.6m) mainly due to more compensation being\ncapitalized to support further product enhancement. During the period, the Company continued to invest in expanding its\ntechnology and product offering by scaling its software and games development teams, product managers, and data and analytics\nprofessionals. This has enabled the Company to source new customers and maintain growth from its existing customer base,\nexpand into new markets, and adapt to regulatory requirements.\n(b) Share based compensation costs decreased by 89.4% to EUR 0.1m (3Q23: EUR 1.0m) in connection with share-based incentive\nplan awards to directors and management composed of deferred share units (“DSUs”), restricted share units (“RSUs”) and share\noptions (“FSOs”).\nTotal employee costs (including share-based compensation charge) decreased by 19.7% to EUR 5.3m (3Q23: EUR 6.6m).\n(c) Information technology hosting increased by EUR 0.4m to EUR 1.4m (3Q23: EUR 1.0m) as a result of security enhancements.\n(d) Professional fees increased by EUR 0.8m to EUR 1.6m (3Q23: EUR 0.8m) mainly as a result of the costs associated with the\nstrategic review process (EUR 0.7m). Remaining costs are comprised of audit and tax advisory, legal, recruitment, regulatory and\nlicensing costs which increased in the period.\n(e) Corporate costs amounted to EUR 0.1m (3Q23: EUR 0.1m) which relates to costs of investor and public relations activities as part\nof the Company’s general corporate strategy.\n(f) Sales and marketing increased by EUR 0.1m to EUR 0.7m (3Q23: EUR 0.6m) mainly related to increase in investment in gaming\nsector events, marketing and public relation activities.\n(g) Other operational costs amounted to EUR 0.6m (3Q23: EUR 0.7m), a slight decrease of EUR 0.1m.\nBragg Gaming Group Inc. 6\nManagement Discussion & Analysis\nSeptember 30, 2024\nProfitability\nTotal operating loss for the period amounted to EUR 0.4m (3Q23: operating loss of EUR 2.1m), a decrease of EUR 1.7m as a result the\nincrease in gross profit of EUR 2.1m and decrease in loss on remeasurement of deferred consideration amounting to EUR 1.4m, offset\nby the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of EUR 1.8m.\nThe Company’s Adjusted EBITDA2 increased from the same period in the previous year by 7.1% to EUR 4.1m (3Q23: EUR 3.8m) with\nAdjusted EBITDA margins decreasing by 129bps to 15.6% (3Q23: 16.9%). The change in margin is mainly due to the increase in Selling,\ngeneral and administrative expenses. A reconciliation between the current and prior year’s reported figures to Adjusted EBITDA is\nshown in Section 5.3.\nCash Flow\nCash flows generated from operating activities for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, amounted to EUR 6.3m\n(3Q23: EUR 1.0m) with the underlying performance reaching EUR 3.6m (3Q23: EUR 3.4m) coupled with the positive movements in\nworking capital and income taxes paid of EUR 2.7m (3Q23: negative EUR 2.4m).\nCash flows used in investing activities amounted to EUR 3.0m (3Q23: EUR 2.7m), an increase of EUR 0.3m. During both periods, the\nCompany continued its investment in software development costs.\nCash flows used in financing activities amounted to an outflow of EUR 1.6m (3Q23: EUR 1.2m outflow) mainly from repayment of\nconvertible debt of EUR 0.9m (3Q23: EUR 1.4m) and interest and financing charges of EUR 0.3m (3Q23: nil).\nFinancial performance in the nine months ended September 30, 2024\nRevenues\nThe Company’s revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased from the same period in the previous year by\n6.7% to EUR 74.8m (nine months ended September 30, 2023: EUR 70.2m) continuing a solid quarterly positive momentum since\n4Q22. The Company’s positive year-over-year revenue growth was derived mainly from organic growth from its existing content and\nPAM customer base, the onboarding of new customers in various jurisdictions and a stronger revenue performance from its\nproprietary casino games studio and existing United States customer base.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased EUR 0.4m from the same period in the previous year by 1.0%\nto EUR 38.3m (nine months ended September 30, 2023: EUR 37.9m) with gross margins decreasing by 287 bps to 51.2% (nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023: 54.0%). The gross margin decreases are mainly as a result of the shift in the product mix leading\nto an increased revenue performance in all content products while PAM and managed services were slightly lower proportionally.\nExpenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses amounted to EUR 40.9m, an increase of EUR 2.9m from the same period in the previous\nyear (nine months ended September 30, 2023: EUR 38.0m). Expenses were mainly driven by an increase of EUR 2.9m in depreciation\nand amortization, and an increase of EUR 1.9m in professional fees. These movements have been offset by a reduction in total\nemployee costs of EUR 3.5m.\n2 Adjusted EBITDA excludes income or expenses that relate to exceptional items and non-cash share-based charges and\nincludes deductions for lease expenses that are recognized as part of depreciation and finance charges under IFRS 16.\nBragg Gaming Group Inc. 7\nManagement Discussion & Analysis\nSeptember 30, 2024\nProfitability\nAdjusted EBITDA amounted to EUR 11.1m (nine months ended September 30, 2023: EUR 12.5m), a decrease of EUR 1.3m for the\nperiod with margins decreasing by 290 bps to 14.8% (nine months ended September 30, 2023: 17.7%). Operating loss amounted to\nEUR 2.9m (nine months ended September 30, 2023: loss of EUR 0.3m), an increase in loss of EUR 2.6m as a result the increase in\nselling, general and administrative expenses of EUR 2.9 offset by increase in gross profit of EUR 0.4m.\nCash Flow\nCash flows generated from operating activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 amounted to EUR 8.4m (nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023: EUR 6.2m) with the underlying performance reaching EUR 10.3m (nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023: EUR 11.4m) coupled with the negative movement in working capital and income taxes paid of EUR 1.9m (nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023: negative EUR 5.2m).\nCash flows used in investing activities amounted to EUR 8.9m (nine months ended September 30, 2023: EUR 6.6m), an increase of\nEUR 2.2m.

This will be achieved by\nthe Company functioning as a leading provider, developer and licensor of iGaming services and technologies and as a producer and\ndistributor of casino games content for the iGaming industry.\nThe casino content portfolio produced by Bragg includes both online and land-based casino titles developed and distributed from\nBragg’s in-house studios, exclusive online games from third-party content providers via the ‘Powered by Bragg’ program, as well as\naggregated, non-exclusive online casino content provided via the Bragg HUB product delivery platform to the Company’s customers.\nBragg’s technology-based solutions, provided as part of the Company’s iGaming and sports betting turnkey services include\nproprietary player account management (PAM) technology, a Remote Games Server (RGS), technology on which it builds and\noperates its exclusive games portfolio, the Bragg HUB product delivery platform, the Fuze ™ player engagement toolset, and Bragg’s\ndata reporting and analytics platforms.\nThe Company additionally provides fully managed, operational and marketing services to several customers who utilize its PAM\noffering.\nIn summary, Bragg’s content, technology and services comprise a full turnkey solution, a suite which focuses on capturing a growing\nproportion of the online casino, sportsbook and lottery market at all levels of the value chain.\nIn planning to achieve this goal, Bragg has continued to focus on progressing in the following key strategic business areas:\n1. Rollout of Bragg’s content portfolio in the United States\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, Bragg has built on its strategic expansion in the U.S. market, building on its existing partnership\nwith Caesars Entertainment, and expanding its online casino content and RGS technology into Pennsylvania and Ontario .During the\nquarter the Company also launched its newest games and RGS technology with FanDuel in New Jersey, adding to its existing\ndistribution with the leading North American operator in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Connecticut and Ontario. Finally, adding to its\nprior launch with bet365 in Pennsylvania, the Company also launched with the international operator in New Jersey during the third\nquarter.\n2. Continued expansion in other markets\nIn the third quarter, Bragg continued to expand its business in key regulated and regulating markets outside of North America, in line\nwith its strategic goals. Bragg added Mozzart Bet, a top local operator in the Serbian market, as a content and aggregation partner\nduring the third quarter, giving the Company a significant position in the Serbian market as a distributor of content.\nDuring the quarter, Bragg continued to expand its position as a leading iGaming content and technology solutions provider in the\nNetherlands, launching its sixth PAM and turnkey operator, HardRockCasino.nl, as well as launching the Kambi sportsbook solution\nwith its existing partner, 711.nl.\nBragg Gaming Group Inc. 9\nManagement Discussion & Analysis\nSeptember 30, 2024\n3. Proprietary Bragg Studios content development\nBragg has continued to expand and grow its portfolio of proprietary Bragg Studios content throughout the quarter, as part of its wider\nbusiness strategy of generating revenue growth from casino content which is developed in-house. Proprietary content generally\ncreates a higher gross profit margin for Bragg when compared to third-party content, primarily due to the fact that no royalties are\npayable to the studio owners.\nProprietary studios released 11 new content titles globally in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 8 in the same period in the\nprevious year. Notably, during 3Q24 the Company also launched 8 proprietary titles compared to 3 proprietary titles in the same\nperiod in the previous year which were new to North American markets. These North American proprietary releases contributed to\ncontinued robust growth in wagering and GGR in the region during the quarter.\n4. Exclusive portfolio expansion via Powered by Bragg content partners\nBragg continued its expansion of its games portfolio from partner studios offered exclusively from Bragg to its customers throughout\nthe quarter. Online casino titles, which have been built on the Bragg RGS and distributed on an exclusive basis by the Company,\nincrease the number of in-demand games titles offered to customers. Additionally, exclusive games from third-party partners allow\nBragg to offer highly localized game portfolios, such as through the offering of several exclusive online titles in North America from\ncasino brands with established land-based footprints such as King Show Games and Bluberi.\nBragg released fewer new global titles from partners in the third quarter of 2024 (9, compared to 12 in the same period the previous\nyear), but this is partly due to the relatively high number of proprietary titles released in 3Q24. In general, the Company aims to\nkeep a balanced portfolio with approximately half of released titles coming from the higher margin, in-house studios, and half\ncoming from carefully selected partner studios which enrich and diversify the Company’s exclusive games portfolio.\n5. PAM & full product suite\nIn the Netherlands, the Company continues to be the market leading PAM supplier, launching with a sixth PAM customer in Hard\nRock Casino during 3Q24. The Company also launched the sports betting vertical with its existing PAM customer 711.nl, integrating\nthe Kambi sportsbook for the operator. Bragg also onboarded Kero Sports suite of micro betting options onto its sportsbook\noffering, providing both new and existing sportsbook partners with a useful range of betting options for players.\nOutlook\nBragg has undertaken continued launches of both proprietary and exclusive content across the U.S. and other global jurisdictions. It\nhas also expanded Bragg’s in-house Bragg Studios content portfolio, content which generates a higher product margin compared to\nthat of distribution of content from third-party studios. The Company is also growing its Powered By Bragg program, expanding its\ncontent portfolio and ultimately creating differentiation in the Bragg content offering.\nBragg is actively advancing a robust pipeline of opportunities that is anticipated to drive strong momentum as it enters 2025. The\noutlook for 2025 remains positive, with expectations of sustained double-digit top line growth, expanding bottom line margins, and\nincreased operational leverage, further strengthening Bragg’s position in the market. The preceding guidance and outlook constitute\nforward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws, and is based on a number of assumptions and subject\nto a number of risks.\nBragg Gaming Group Inc. 10\nManagement Discussion & Analysis\nSeptember 30, 2024\n5.

The\npresentation currency of the Euro has been selected as it best represents the majority of the Company’s economic inflows, outflows\nas well as its assets and liabilities.\n5.2 SELECTED INTERIM INFORMATION\nThe primary non-IFRS financial measure which the Company uses is Adjusted EBITDA. When internally analyzing underlying operating\nperformance, management excludes certain items from EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization).\nThree Months Ended Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30, September 30, September 30,\nEUR 000 2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenue 26,169 22,574 74,841 70,162\nNet Loss (165) (2,951) (4,469) (3,050)\nEBITDA 3,924 1,209 9,312 8,963\nAdjusted EBITDA 4,083 3,814 11,109 12,450\nBasic Loss Per Share (0.01) (0.13) (0.19) (0.14)\nDiluted Loss Per Share (0.01) (0.13) (0.19) (0.14)\nAs at As at\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nTotal assets 103,647 103,367\nTotal non-current financial liabilities 2,566 4,367\nDividends paid nil nil\nAs at September 30, 2024, non-current financial liabilities primarily consists of EUR 2.2m in lease obligations on right of use assets in\nrelation to office leases (December 31, 2023: EUR 2.6m), EUR 0.4m in other non-current liabilities (December 31, 2023: EUR 0.4m) and\nnil in deferred consideration (December 31, 2023: EUR 1.4m).\nWith the exception of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, the financial data has been prepared to conform with IFRS as issued by the\nInternational Accounting Standards Board. These accounting principles have been applied consistently across for all reporting periods\npresented.\n5.3 OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nTo supplement its Interim Financial Statements, the Company considers certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance\nwith IFRS. The Company uses such non-IFRS financial measures in evaluating its operating results and for financial and operational\ndecision-making purposes. The Company believes that such measures help identify underlying trends in its business that could\notherwise be masked by the effect of the expenses that it excludes in such measures.\nBragg Gaming Group Inc. 11\nManagement Discussion & Analysis\nSeptember 30, 2024\nThe Company also believes that such measures provide useful information about its operating results, enhance the overall\nunderstanding of its past performance and future prospects and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by\nmanagement in its financial and operational decision-making. However, these measures should not be considered in isolation from,\nor as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with IFRS. There are a number of limitations related to the use of\nsuch non-IFRS measures as opposed to their nearest IFRS equivalents.\nA reconciliation of operating loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is as follows:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\nEUR 000 2024 2023 2024 2023\nOperating loss (406) (2,137) (2,889) (346)\nDepreciation and amortization 4,330 3,346 12,201 9,309\nEBITDA 3,924 1,209 9,312 8,963\nDepreciation of right-of-use assets (229) (107) (602) (273)\nLease interest expense (24) (7) (84) (27)\nShare based compensation 106 999 710 2,283\nTransaction and acquisition costs 72 (32) 72 —\nExceptional costs 655 806 1,447 1,291\n(Gain) Loss on remeasurement of derivative liability (46) 82 94 261\nGain on settlement of convertible debt (104) (231) (169) (435)\n(Gain) loss on remeasurement of deferred\nconsideration (271) 1,095 329 387\nAdjusted EBITDA 4,083 3,814 11,109 12,450\nExceptional costs in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 amounts to EUR 0.7m and EUR 1.4m, respectively, relating\nto legal and professional costs associated with non-recurring strategic process driven cost, corporate and regulatory matters, and\nexpenses related to the Board’s strategic review.\nExceptional costs in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 amounts to EUR 0.8m and EUR 1.3m which mostly relates\nto the termination of the employment contracts of certain key senior executives.\nGain/Loss on remeasurement of derivative liability is due to remeasurement of the present value of the conversion options\nembedded in the convertible debt instrument, whilst gain on settlement of convertible debt arose from cash-in-lieu settlement of\nthe debt.

Estimates and assumptions are used mainly in determining the\nmeasurement of balances recognized or disclosed in the interim financial statements and are based on a set of underlying data that\nmay include management’s historical experience, knowledge of current events and conditions and other factors that are believed to\nbe reasonable under the circumstances.\nManagement continually evaluates the estimates and judgments it uses.\nThe following are the accounting policies subject to judgments and key sources of estimation uncertainty that the Company believes\ncould have the most significant impact on the amounts recognized in the interim financial statements.\nImpairment of non-financial assets (property and equipment, right-of-use assets, intangible assets and goodwill)\n- Judgments made in relation to accounting policies applied\nManagement is required to use judgment in determining the grouping of assets to identify their cash generating units (“CGUs”) for\nthe purposes of testing property and equipment, intangible assets and right-of-use assets for impairment. Judgment is further required\nto determine appropriate groupings of CGUs for the level at which goodwill and intangible assets are tested for impairment.\nThe Company has determined that Oryx Gaming, Wild Streak and Spin are a single CGU for the purposes of property and equipment,\nintangible assets and right-of-use asset impairment testing. For the purpose of goodwill impairment testing, CGUs are grouped at the\nlowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. In addition, judgment is used to determine whether a\ntriggering event has occurred requiring an impairment test to be completed.\n- Key sources of estimation\nIn determining the recoverable amount of a CGU or a group of CGUs, various estimates are employed. The Company determines fair\nvalue less costs to sell using such estimates as market rental rates for comparable properties, recoverable operating costs for leases\nwith tenants, non-recoverable operating costs, discount rates, capitalization rates and terminal capitalization rates. The Company\ndetermines value in use by using estimates including projected future revenues, earnings and capital investment consistent with\nBragg Gaming Group Inc. 18\nManagement Discussion & Analysis\nSeptember 30, 2024\nstrategic plans presented to the Board. Discount rates are consistent with external industry information reflecting the risk associated\nwith the specific cash flows.\nImpairment of accounts receivable\nIn each stage of the expected credit loss (“ECL”) impairment model, impairment is determined based on the probability of default,\nloss given default, and expected exposures at default. The application of the ECL model requires management to apply the following\nsignificant judgments, assumptions, and estimations:\n- movement of impairment measurement between the three stages of the ECL model, based on the assessment of the increase\nin credit risks on accounts receivables. The assessment of changes in credit risks includes qualitative and quantitative factors\nof the accounts, such as historical credit loss experience and external credit scores;\n- thresholds for significant increase in credit risks based on changes in probability of default over the expected life of the\ninstrument relative to initial recognition; and\n- forecasts of future economic conditions.\nLeases\n- Judgments made in relation to accounting policies applied\nManagement exercises judgment in determining the appropriate lease term on a lease-by-lease basis. Management considers all facts\nand circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise a renewal option or to not exercise a termination option including\ninvestments in major leaseholds and past business practice and the length of time remaining before the option is exercisable. The\nperiods covered by renewal options are only included in the lease term if management is reasonably certain to renew. Management\nconsiders reasonably certain to be a high threshold. Changes in the economic environment or changes in the office rental industry\nmay impact management’s assessment of lease term, and any changes in management’s estimate of lease terms may have a material\nimpact on the Company’s interim unaudited condensed consolidated statements of financial position and statements of loss and\ncomprehensive loss.\n- Key sources of estimation\nIn determining the carrying amount of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, the Company is required to estimate the incremental\nborrowing rate specific to each leased asset or portfolio of leased assets if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily\ndetermined. Management determines the incremental borrowing rate using a base risk-free interest rate estimated by reference to\nthe bond yield with an adjustment that reflects the Company’s credit rating, the security, lease term and value of the underlying leased\nasset, and the economic environment in which the leased asset operates. The incremental borrowing rates are subject to change due\nto changes in the business and macroeconomic environment.\nWarrants and share options\n- Judgments made in relation to accounting policies applied\nManagement exercises judgment in determining the model used and the inputs therein to evaluate the value of share option grants\nand issued warrants. Management considers all facts and circumstances for each grant issuance on an individual basis.\n- Key sources of estimation\nIn determining the fair value of warrants and share options, the Company is required to estimate the future volatility of the market\nvalue of the Company’s shares by reference to its historical volatility or comparable companies over the previous years, a risk-free\ninterest rate estimated by reference to the Government of Canada bond yield, and a dividend yield of Nil.\nBragg Gaming Group Inc. 19\nManagement Discussion & Analysis\nSeptember 30, 2024\nLong-term employee benefits obligations\n- Judgments made in relation to accounting policies applied\nManagement exercises judgment in determining the appropriate fair value of severance pay upon retirement and awards for years of\nservice that certain employees have earned in return for their service. A calculation is made for each employee taking into account\nthe cost of severance pay upon retirement due under the contract of employment and the cost of all expected awards for years of\nservice with the Company until retirement.\n- Key sources of estimation\nIn determining the present value of liabilities to certain employees, the Company performs actuarial calculations in accordance with\nIAS 19 Employee Benefits applying the Projected Unit Credit Method to measure obligations and costs. Various assumptions are\napplied including retirement age, mortality, average salary of an individual and growth in income in future years.\nConvertible debt\n- Judgments made in relation to accounting policies applied\nManagement exercises judgment in determining the appropriate fair value of each separately identifiable component in the\nconvertible debt instrument. Embedded derivatives such as conversion and buy-back options are measured at fair value through profit\nand loss and remeasured at each reporting period. The host debt liability is measured at amortised cost and amortised over the life of\nthe instrument. Residual amounts, if any, from the transaction price after deducting the fair value of derivative liabilities and host debt\nare allocated to warrants if issued as part of the convertible debt.\n- Key sources of estimation\nIn determining the present value of conversion options, the Company has performed Monte-Carlo simulations modelled as a series of\ncall options with inputs including strike price, stock price WVAP, annualized volatility and risk-free rate.\nIn respect of buy-back options, the Company has employed a Black Scholes valuation, adding an early exercise premium. Inputs and\nassumptions include share price, risk free rate, volatility and exercise price.\nThe fair value of the host debt liability is determined using a discounted cash flow method at an appropriate market participant\ndiscount rate.\n9 CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICY\nThere have been no changes in the Company’s accounting policies in any of the reporting periods discussed in this MD&A.\n10 MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable\nassurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with IFRS. Any\nsystem of internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations. Therefore, even those\nsystems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and\npresentation. Based on a review of the Company’s internal control procedures, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer believe its internal controls and procedures are appropriately designed as at the date of this MD&A.\nBragg Gaming Group Inc. 20\nManagement Discussion & Analysis\nSeptember 30, 2024\nThere have been no material changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the three and nine months\nperiod ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\nDisclosure controls and procedures\nManagement is also responsible for the design and effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures to provide reasonable\nassurance that material information related to the Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, which is required to be disclosed\nby the Company in its filings or required to be submitted by the Company under securities legislation is recorded, processed and\nsummarized and reported within specified time periods. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have each\nevaluated the design of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as at the date of this MD&A, and have concluded that these\ncontrols and procedures were appropriately designed.\n11 RISK FACTORS AND UNCERTAINTIES\nCertain factors, listed below, may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of\noperations. Current and prospective investors should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties and other information contained\nin this MD&A and the corresponding financial statements.\nFor a detailed description of risk factors associated with the Company, please refer to the “Risk Factors” section of the Company's\nannual information form. The risks and uncertainties described herein and therein are not the only ones the Company may face.\nAdditional risks and uncertainties that the Company is unaware of, or that the Company currently believes are not material, may also\nbecome important factors that could adversely affect the Company’s business. If any of such risks actually occur, the Company’s\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe Company depends on a small number of significant customers for a large portion of revenue.\nThe business of the Company was dependent on ten customers for approximately 59.8% and 61.1% of its revenue in the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2024, and approximately 64.1% and 64.7% in the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2023, respectively. The Company's largest customer accounted for approximately 22.4% and 23.7% of the Company's revenue for the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and approximately 28.0% and 32.5% in the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, respectively. The Company’s accounts receivables tend to be concentrated within a small group of customers\nand this is expected to improve while the Company is growing its customer base in various jurisdictions.\nThe loss of any significant customer, a significant decrease in business from any such customer or a reduction in customer revenue\ndue to adverse changes in the terms of contractual arrangements or other factors could harm the Company’s results of operations\nand financial condition. Revenue from individual customers may fluctuate from time to time.\nThe Company currently relies on third-parties for its gaming content and has no control over the providers of its content. Our\nbusiness could be adversely affected if our access to games is limited or delayed.\nThe control of content by our major providers means that even one entity, or a small number of entities working together, may\nunilaterally affect our access to games and other content. We cannot guarantee that these providers will always choose to license to\nus. Our business may be adversely affected if our access to games is limited or delayed because of deterioration in our relationships\nwith one or more of these providers or if they choose not to license to us for any other reason.\nEven if we are able to secure rights to gaming content from providers or creators, external groups may object and may exert pressure\non third parties to discontinue licensing rights to us, hold back content from us, or increase content fees. Content providers also may\nBragg Gaming Group Inc. 21\nManagement Discussion & Analysis\nSeptember 30, 2024\nattempt to take advantage of their market power to demand onerous financial terms from us. If any of these content providers were\nto not renew their contracts at the expiration of their current service terms, fail to meet their contractual obligations or cease\noperations for any reason, and if no suitable alternative providers were available, we could be unable to operate our gaming platform.\nOur inability to retain such third-party providers or find suitable alternate providers in a timely manner could lead to significant costs\nand disruptions that could reduce our revenue, harm our business reputation, and have a material adverse effect on our financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nTo the extent that we are unable to license a large amount of content or the content of certain popular games, our business, operating\nresults, and financial condition could be materially harmed.\nThe industry within which the Company operates are intensely competitive, characterized by low barriers to entry, and are\nsubject to changing technology, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new offerings.\nThe Company's current and potential competitors include large and established companies as well as other start-up companies.\nCertain competitors have more established relationships and greater financial resources and they can use their resources against the\nCompany in a variety of competitive ways, including by making acquisitions, investing aggressively in research and development and\nadvertising. Emerging start-ups may be able to innovate and provide offerings faster than the Company can. As a result of\ndevelopments in digital and internet gaming, the cost of entry to the gaming market has decreased significantly. This has resulted in\na highly competitive environment. Digital and internet gaming have emerged as substantial methods of competition from existing\ncompetitors and, increasingly, new competitors as a result of the lower cost of entry. The increased competition may result in\nincreased pricing pressures on a number of the Company’s products and services. If competitors are more successful than the\nCompany in developing compelling offerings or navigating regulatory hurdles, the Company's revenue and growth rates could be\nnegatively affected. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to maintain or grow its position in the marketplace.\nThe integrity, reliability and operational performance of the Company's content aggregation, parsing and distribution and other\noperational information technology systems are critical to the Company's ability to serve its businesses.\nThe Company's information technology (\"IT\") systems may be damaged or interrupted by increases in usage, human error,\nunauthorized access, natural hazards or disasters or similarly disruptive events. Any failure of these IT systems or the\ntelecommunications and/or other third party infrastructure on which such systems rely, could lead to significant costs and disruptions\nthat could reduce the Company's revenue, harm the Company's business reputation and have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany's prospects, business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company incurs significant costs to maintain, transfer and receive personal data across jurisdictions.\nThe Company has procedures and measures in place to protect against network or IT system failure or disruption. However, those\nprocedures and measures may not be effective to ensure that the Company is able to carry on its business in the ordinary course if\nthey fail or are disrupted. In addition, the Company's IT systems may not be effective in detecting any intrusion or other security\nbreaches, or safeguarding against sabotage, hackers, denial of service attacks, viruses or cybercrime. Any failure in these protections\ncould harm the Company's business reputation and have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition,\nresults of operations and prospects.\nWith regard to transfers to the U.S. of personal data (as such term is defined under the European Union’s General Data Protection\nRegulation 679/2016 (the \"GDPR\")) from the Company’s European and U.K. employees, customers, users and other persons, the\nCompany has relied until recently upon the EU - U.S. Privacy Shield, and the Company currently attempts to rely upon EU standard\ncontractual clauses in certain circumstances. Both the EU - U.S. Privacy Shield and EU standard contractual clauses have been subject\nto legal challenge, resulting in the EU - U.S. Privacy Shield being invalidated, in July 2020, by the Court of Justice of the European Union\n(the \"CJEU\"). The U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Commission have initiated discussions to evaluate the potential\nfor an enhanced EU - U.S. Privacy Shield framework that would comply with the CJEU decision; however, such an enhancement may\nBragg Gaming Group Inc. 22\nManagement Discussion & Analysis\nSeptember 30, 2024\nnot be created, or any such enhancement could be subject to further challenge before the European courts. While the validity of the\nEU standard contractual clauses was confirmed by the CJEU, the use of the standard clauses with respect to data transfers to countries\noutside of the European Economic Area (\"EEA\") or the U.K., including the U.S., may be subject to further challenge. On 4 June 2021,\nthe European Commission issued revised EU standard contractual clauses which intend to address the decision of the CJEU and\nrecommendations made by the European Data Protection Board. Parties currently relying, or wishing to rely, upon EU standard\ncontractual clauses therefore face operational and administrative challenges to implement these revised clauses, and/or any\nequivalent clauses issued by the relevant competent authority in the United Kingdom. Due to the unsettled nature of data export\nfrom the EEA and the U.K. to the U.S. (and other third countries), the Company may experience reluctance or refusal by current or\nprospective European customers to use the Company’s products, and the Company may find it necessary or desirable to make further\nchanges to its handling of personal data of EEA residents, including arrangements to store and process such data outside the U.S. The\nregulatory environment applicable to the handling of EEA or U.K. residents' personal data, and our actions taken in response, may\ncause the Company to assume additional liabilities or incur additional costs, and could result in the Company’s business, operating\nresults and financial condition being harmed. Additionally, should the Company continue to transfer the personal data of EEA or U.K.\nresidents to the U.S. or other country outside of the EEA or the U.K., without a solution that complies with the GDPR and other\napplicable data privacy laws, the Company and its customers may face a risk of enforcement actions by data protection authorities in\nthe EEA or the U.K. relating to personal data transfers to the Company and by the Company from the EEA or the U.K. Any such\nenforcement actions could result in substantial fines, costs, legal orders to stop transfers and diversion of resources, distract\nmanagement and technical personnel and negatively affect the Company’s business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe Company may require the registration of its users or end users prior to accessing its offerings or certain features of its\nofferings and it may be subject to increased legislation and regulations on the collection, storage, retention, transmission and use\nof user-data that is collected.\nThe Company's efforts to protect the personal information of its users may be unsuccessful due to the actions of third parties, software\nbugs or technical malfunctions, employee error or malfeasance, or other factors. In addition, third parties may attempt to fraudulently\ninduce employees or users to disclose information in order to gain access to the Company's data or its user's data. If any of these\nevents occur, users' information could be accessed or disclosed improperly. Any incidents involving the unauthorized access to or\nimproper use of the information of users or incidents involving violation of the Company's terms of service or policies, could damage\nthe Company's reputation and the Company's brands and diminish its competitive position. In addition, the affected users or\ngovernmental authorities could initiate legal or regulatory action against the Company in connection with such incidents, which could\ncause the Company to incur significant expense and liability or result in orders or consent decrees forcing the Company to modify its\nbusiness practices and remediate the effects of any such incidents of unauthorized access or use. Any of these events could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the Company's prospects, business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company transmits and stores a large volume of data in the course of supporting its offerings. The interpretation of privacy and\ndata protection laws and their application to the Internet is unclear and subject to rapid change in numerous jurisdictions. There is a\nrisk that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is not consistent with the Company's data protection practices\nand results in additional compliance or changes in the Company's business practices, or both, and liability or sanction under these\nlaws. In addition, because its offerings are accessible in many jurisdictions, certain foreign jurisdictions may claim that the Company\nis required to comply with local laws, even where the Company has no local operating entity, employees, infrastructure or other\nphysical presence in those jurisdictions.\nThe Company may require additional capital in order to carry out its business objectives.\nThe Company may require additional equity or debt financing in order to carry out its business objectives and to execute on its strategy.\nThere can be no assurance that debt or equity financing or cash generated by operations would be available or sufficient to meet\nthese requirements or for other corporate purposes or, if debt or equity financing is available, that it would be on terms acceptable\nto the Company. Failure to obtain sufficient financing may result in the delay or indefinite postponement of development or\nBragg Gaming Group Inc. 23\nManagement Discussion & Analysis\nSeptember 30, 2024\nproduction on any or all of the Company's offerings which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe Company’s growth prospects depend on the legal status of real-money gaming in various jurisdictions.\nThe Company’s growth prospects depend on the legal status of real-money gaming in various jurisdictions, and predominantly within\nthe United States, which is an initial area of focus, and legalization may not occur in as many states as the Company expects, or may\noccur at a slower pace than the Company anticipates. Additionally, even if jurisdictions legalize real-money gaming, this may be\naccompanied by legislative or regulatory restrictions and/or taxes that make it impracticable or less attractive to operate in those\njurisdictions, or the process of implementing regulations or securing the necessary licenses to operate in a particular jurisdiction may\ntake longer than the Company anticipates, which could materially and adversely affect the Company’s future results of operations and\nmake it more difficult to meet its expectations for financial performance.\nSeveral U.S. states have legalized, or are currently considering legalizing, real-money gaming, and the Company’s business, financial\ncondition and results of operations are significantly dependent upon legalization of real-money gaming. The Company’s business plan\nis partially based upon the legalization of real-money gaming for a specific percent of the population on a yearly basis and the\nlegalization may not occur as the Company has anticipated. Additionally, if a large number of additional U.S. states or the U.S. federal\ngovernment enact real-money gaming legislation and the Company is unable to obtain or its key customers are unable to obtain, or\nare otherwise delayed in obtaining, the necessary licenses to operate iGaming, online casino suites, sportsbook and insurance-based\nlottery betting websites in U.S. jurisdictions where such games are legalized, the Company’s future growth in iGaming, online casino\nsuites, sportsbook and insurance-based lottery betting could be materially impaired.\nAs the Company enters into new jurisdictions, governments in those jurisdictions may legalize real-money gaming in a manner that is\nunfavourable to the Company. Further, authorities overseeing businesses and jurisdictions in which the Company already operates\nmight pass legislation or construe existing law in an unfavourable matter. As a result, the Company may encounter legal, regulatory\nand political challenges that are difficult or impossible to foresee and which could result in an unforeseen adverse impact on planned\nrevenues or costs associated with operations in existing jurisdictions or opportunities in new jurisdictions.\nAdditionally, certain U.S. states require the Company to have a relationship with a land-based, licensed casino for online sportsbook\naccess, which tends to increase the Company’s costs of revenue. States that have established state-run monopolies may limit\nopportunities for private sector participants like the Company. States also impose substantial tax rates on iGaming, online casino\nsuites, sportsbook and insurance-based lottery betting wagering revenue, in addition to sales taxes in certain jurisdictions and a federal\nexcise tax of 25 basis points on the amount of each wager. As most state product taxes apply to various measures of modified gross\nprofit, tax rates, whether federal- or state-based, that are higher than the Company expects, will make it more costly and less desirable\nfor the Company to launch in a given jurisdiction. Additionally, tax increases in any of the Company’s existing jurisdictions may\nadversely impact the Company’s profitability.\nEven in cases in which a jurisdiction purports to license and regulate iGaming, online casino suites, sportsbook and insurance-based\nlottery betting, the licensing and regulatory regimes can vary considerably in terms of their business-friendliness and at times may be\nintended to provide incumbent operators with advantages over new licensees.\nThe Company expects to be subject to a variety of United States and foreign laws and regulations, many of which are unsettled\nand still developing and which could subject the Company to claims or otherwise harm its business.\nAs the Company seeks to expand in the U.S. and foreign markets, the Company expects to be subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign\nlaws and regulations, many of which are unsettled and still developing and which could subject the Company to claims or otherwise\nharm its business. Any change in existing regulations or their interpretation, or the regulatory climate applicable to the Company’s\nproducts and services, or changes in tax laws and regulations or the interpretation thereof related to the Company’s products and\nservices, could adversely impact the Company’s ability to operate its business as currently conducted or as the Company seeks to\nBragg Gaming Group Inc. 24\nManagement Discussion & Analysis\nSeptember 30, 2024\noperate in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nWhile the Canadian courts have yet to clarify the scope of certain aspects of the exemption provided by section 207(1)(h) of the\nCriminal Code for offshore gaming services provided from Canada, and a risk exists that the Canadian authorities may commence\nenforcement proceedings against the Company for its activities, the Company is not aware of such proceedings against B2B solutions\nproviders operating in Canada who solely export their products to lawful jurisdictions. Although the Company believes it is compliant\nwith all applicable laws and regulations, there is a risk that certain activities of the Company could be found to be in contravention of\nany such law or regulation in Canada and the penalties for any such contravention are unknown. Additionally, changes in applicable\nlaws or regulations or evolving interpretations of existing law could, in certain circumstances, result in increased compliance costs or\ncapital expenditures, which could affect the Company’s profitability, or impede the Company’s ability to carry on its business which\ncould affect its revenues. Violations of the Criminal Code or any other regulation, whether foreign or domestic, could negatively affect\nthe reputation of the Company and the ability of the Company to obtain required regulatory licenses and registrations in Canada and\nelsewhere, and cause financial harm to the Company.\nThe Company is generally subject to laws and regulations relating to online gaming, online casino suites, sportsbook and insurance-\nbased lottery betting in the jurisdictions in which the Company or the Company’s customers conduct their businesses or in some\ncircumstances, of those jurisdictions in which their services are offered or available, as well as the general laws and regulations that\napply to all online businesses, such as those related to privacy and personal information, tax and consumer protection. These laws and\nregulations vary from one jurisdiction to another and future legislative and regulatory action, court decisions or other governmental\naction, which may be affected by, among other things, political pressures, attitudes and climates, as well as personal biases, may have\na material impact on the Company’s operations and financial results. In particular, some jurisdictions have introduced regulations\nattempting to restrict or prohibit online gaming, while others have taken the position that online gaming should be licensed or\notherwise permitted and regulated and have adopted, or are in the process of considering, legislation and regulations to enable that\nto happen. Additionally, some jurisdictions in which the Company may operate could presently be unregulated or partially regulated,\nand therefore more susceptible to the enactment or change of laws and regulations.\nCertain of the Company's customers may, from time to time, provide gaming services to players in unregulated markets.\nCertain of the Company's customers may, from time to time, provide gaming services to players in unregulated markets. This activity\nby any of the Company's customers does not necessarily amount to an infringement of laws or regulation in a given jurisdiction, but it\nis not uncommon for customers to cease providing interactive gaming services in an unregulated market in response to changes or\nintimated changes to laws or regulation. If a customer is found to have infringed laws or regulations in an unregulated jurisdiction this\ncould materially adversely affect the Company's operations, financial performance and prospects.\nThe Company cannot be certain that its customers will not provide interactive gaming services to end-users in markets which prohibit\ninteractive gambling. The Company may be considered by a regulatory body in such a restricted jurisdiction as infringing the laws or\nregulations of that jurisdiction on the basis that the Company is aiding the infringement by providing products or services to that\ncustomer. If a customer is found to be operating in a prohibited market, this could materially adversely affect the Company's\noperations, financial performance, reputation and prospects, as well as jeopardize any one or all of the Licenses and Registrations by\nvirtue of the Company's association with, or provision of products or services to, such customer.\nThe Company operates in regulated jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that regulations will be consistent in different\njurisdictions that the Company operates.\nSome countries from which the online gambling industry has historically derived revenue have introduced regulations attempting to\nrestrict and/or prohibit online gaming and gambling, while other jurisdictions have taken the position that online gaming and gambling\nshould be regulated and have adopted or are in the process of considering legislation to enable that regulation. The introduction of\nnew gambling regulations or changes to the nature and scope of existing gaming and gambling regulations (and applicable laws and\nBragg Gaming Group Inc. 25\nManagement Discussion & Analysis\nSeptember 30, 2024\nregulations more generally) in the territories in which the Company’s customers operates or may operate or from where the Company\nderives or may derive revenue could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of\noperations and prospects.\nWhile certain European countries such as Malta and Gibraltar have adopted \"point-of-supply\" regimes which generally permit their\nlicensees to accept wagers from any jurisdiction that does not expressly prohibit the supply of online gambling from outside such\njurisdiction, other countries, including the United Kingdom, Spain and Denmark have implemented, or are in the process of\nimplementing, \"point-of-consumption\" regimes which only permit the targeting of the domestic market, provided the appropriate\nlocal license is obtained and local taxes accounted for (regardless of where the operator's assets, infrastructure and employees may\nbe located). Such licensing regimes can apply onerous compliance requirements and/or introduce product restrictions or marketing\nrestrictions that could have an adverse effect on the Company's operations (and correspondingly on its financial performance).\nOperators within the online gambling industry, including the Company, traditionally have based their own risk rationales on a\nremoteness of supply, adopting a \"country of origin\" / point-of-supply approach that justifies supplying gambling services into a\njurisdiction unless there was something within the laws of that jurisdiction that explicitly outlawed such provision, and explicitly\napplied to such inward supply emanating from outside its borders.\nMany jurisdictions have historically been unable to prevent inward remote supply due to a lack of extra-territorial enforceability of\ntheir laws. As a result, many jurisdictions have sought to regulate online gambling while a small number of other jurisdictions have\nsought to expand their existing legislation to explicitly prohibit such inward supply. Some jurisdictions include wording in their\nlegislation which explicitly purports to apply extra territorially, thereby challenging the point-of-supply approach.\nCertain European territories continue to maintain licensing regimes that protect monopoly providers and, in certain jurisdictions, have\ncombined this with an attempt to prohibit or otherwise restrict all other supplies into the territory.\nFuture legislative initiatives and court decisions may have a material impact on the Company's operations and financial results. There\nis a risk that governmental authorities may view the Company as having violated their local gaming regulations and laws if the Company\nfails to comply with local rules and requirements, including those relating to the licenses it holds. There is also a risk that civil and\ncriminal proceedings, including class actions brought by or on behalf of prosecutors or public entities, incumbent monopoly providers,\nor private individuals, could be initiated against the Company and its internet service providers, credit card processors, advertisers\nand others involved in the online gaming and gambling industry. Such potential proceedings could involve substantial litigation\nexpense, penalties, fines, seizure of assets, injunctions or other restrictions being imposed on the Company or its business partners,\nand may divert the attention of key executives of the Company. Such proceedings could have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects as well as its reputation.\nThere can be no assurance that prohibitive legislation will not be proposed and passed in jurisdictions relevant or potentially relevant\nto the Company's business to regulate various aspects of the internet or the online gaming and gambling industry (or that existing\nlaws in those jurisdictions will not be interpreted negatively). Compliance with any such legislation may have a material adverse effect\non the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations, either as a result of determining that a jurisdiction should\nbe blocked, or because a local license may be costly to obtain and/or such licenses may contain other commercially undesirable\nconditions.\nIn addition, certain countries in which laws currently prohibit or restrict online gaming or the marketing of those services, or protect\nmonopoly providers of gaming or gambling services, may implement changes to open their markets through the adoption of\ncompetitive licensing and regulatory frameworks. While these changes may provide growth opportunities for the Company, a new\nlicensing and regulatory regime adopted in any such country may not grant a license to the Company or may impose onerous\nconditions such as a requirement to locate significant technical infrastructure within the relevant territory or establish and maintain\nreal-time data interfaces with the regulator, together with enforcement sanctions for breach thereof, taxation liabilities that make the\nBragg Gaming Group Inc. 26\nManagement Discussion & Analysis\nSeptember 30, 2024\nmarket unattractive to the Company, or impose restrictions that limit its ability to offer certain of its key products or to market its\nproducts in the way it would wish to do so. There is also an associated cost with creating specific bespoke, localized platforms.\nIf regulation is liberalized or clarified in some jurisdictions, then the Company may face increased competition from other providers.\nThe opening of new markets, and the clarification of restrictions surrounding online gaming and gambling in other markets where the\nlegal position is currently unclear, may encourage new entrants to the online gaming sector or strengthen the position of competing\noperators. A significant increase in competition may have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, revenues,\noperating results and financial condition.\nLegislative interpretation may result in criminality of activities in jurisdictions where the Company supplies operation gaming\nsoftware.\nThe Company generates the majority of its income through licensing the Company's technology and games to enable gaming operators\nto provide gaming services to customers where such services are dependent on that software and the functionality it provides. One\nof the consequences of the Company's supply of operational gaming software to customers is the potential regulatory risk associated\nwith doing so. While in many jurisdictions laws and regulations may not specifically apply to gaming software licensors (as distinct\nfrom its customers' delivery to end customers), this is not universally the case and, indeed, some jurisdictions have sought to regulate\nor prohibit such supply explicitly.\nFurthermore, the Company relies on the continuity of supply by the Company's customers to their end-users using the gaming related\nsoftware and technology which the Company licenses. Laws and regulations relating to the supply of gaming services are complex,\ninconsistent and evolving and the Company may be subject to such laws either directly through explicit service provision or indirectly\ninsofar as it has assisted the supply to customers who are themselves subject to such laws.\nOperators within the remote gaming industry have sought, in the past, to justify their activities by asserting that if remote gaming is\npermitted from the country of origin (i.e., from the point of supply) then the laws in the country of receipt would have to specifically\noutlaw the activity of the customer (remotely accessing interactive gaming services) or an entity in that jurisdiction or have the\nauthority to implement laws that impacted outside the jurisdiction in order to render the activity illegal, or entitle the country of\nreceipt to assert jurisdiction. Operators have sought to reduce any associated risks of jurisdictions forming a contrary view by limiting\nor omitting to have physical presence in such jurisdictions where any connected activities are not clearly legal. Several jurisdictions\nconsider this rationale to be unjustified. Indeed in some jurisdictions, laws have been passed to expressly criminalize the provision of\n(and sometimes the participation in) gaming, irrespective of where the operator is located and licensed. There is a corresponding,\ncontinuing risk to any participant in the gaming industry (be they an operator, supplier or other service provider) that jurisdictions in\nwhich customers are located may seek to argue that such a participant was acting illegally in accepting or assisting in the acceptance\nof wagers from its citizens or in the manner in which it operates gaming networks. This could lead to actions being brought against\ncustomers which, in turn, could have a detrimental effect on the financial performance and the Company's reputation. Similarly, where\nsupply by the Company to the customer is critical to the gaming transaction, one cannot rule out the risk that direct enforcement\naction will be taken against the Company or any of the Company's employees and directors.\nMany jurisdictions have not updated their laws to address the supply of remote gaming, which by its nature is a multi-jurisdictional\nactivity. Moreover, the legality of interactive gaming and the provision of software, services and gaming network management is\nsubject to uncertainties arising from differing approaches by legislatures, regulators and enforcement agents including in relation to\ndetermining in which jurisdiction the gaming takes place and therefore which law applies. This uncertainty creates a risk for the\nCompany that even in instances where older laws have not been updated to address new technology, courts may interpret older\nlegislation in an unfavorable way and determine customers' and/or the Company's activities to be illegal. This could lead to actions\nbeing brought against customers and/or the Company or any of the Company's employees and directors, all or any of which may,\nindividually or collectively, have a detrimental effect on the Company's financial performance and the Company's reputation.\nBragg Gaming Group Inc. 27\nManagement Discussion & Analysis\nSeptember 30, 2024\nThe Company seeks to keep abreast of legal and regulatory developments affecting the gaming industry as a whole. However, the\nCompany does not necessarily monitor, on a continuous basis, the laws and regulations in every jurisdiction where the Company's\ncustomers derive business and, correspondingly, from where the Company may derive revenue. The Company adapts its regulatory\npolicy and, therefore, the scope of the Company's ongoing monitoring on the basis that an individual market's materiality to both any\nrelevant customer and to the Company may change. As such, the Company may receive revenue from customers' dealing in\njurisdictions where the Company may be unaware of the full extent of enforcement risk.\nDespite the monitoring undertaken by the Company and the precautions the Company takes as to the location of employees or assets,\nthere remains a prospect that, in the event of legislation being interpreted in an unfavorable or unanticipated way, such measures are\nnot sufficient and result in actions being brought against the Company or the Company's employees and directors, all of which would\nhave a detrimental effect on financial performance and the Company's reputation. Furthermore, similar actions could be brought\nagainst customers with the consequence that revenue streams from such customers may be frozen or traced at the behest of\nauthorities even if none of the Company's entities are made a party to any legal proceedings against any such customer. Customers\nmay also face problems in legitimately moving monies in and out of certain jurisdictions which will impact upon payments from\ncustomers. Finally, there is also a risk that the Company's directors or employees or individuals engaged by the Company (or directors,\nemployees or individuals connected to any customer) may face extradition, arrest and/or detention in (or from) such territories even\nif they are only temporarily present.\n12 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nAdditional information relating to the Company, including the Company’s annual information form, quarterly and annual reports and\nsupplementary information is available on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca and on the EDGAR section of the SEC website at www.sec.gov\nunder the Company’s name.\nPress releases and other information are also available in the Investor section of the Company’s website at www.bragg.group.\nBragg Gaming Group Inc. 28\nManagement Discussion & Analysis\nSeptember 30, 2024"
