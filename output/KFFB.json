          "content": "First Bancorp of Indiana, Inc. Announces Financial Results\nEVANSVILLE, Ind., November 12, 2024. First Bancorp of Indiana, Inc. (OTCPK:FBPI), the holding\ncompany (the “Company”) for First Federal Savings Bank (the “Bank”), reported earnings of $439,000\n($0.26 per diluted common share) for the first fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to\n$738,000 ($0.44 per diluted common share) for the same quarter a year ago. Earnings for the three-month\nperiod equate to a return on average assets (ROA) of 0.28% and a return on average equity (ROE) of\n5.40%. This compares to an annualized ROA of 0.47% and an annualized ROE of 9.80% last fiscal year.\nNet interest income improved from the prior year. Increased yields on earning assets, provided by higher interest rates on newly originated loans and\nadjustable-rate loans that have repriced upward, outpaced higher funding costs. The Company’s Net Interest Margin (NIM), as a percentage of average\ninterest-earning assets, was 2.67% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Gains on loan sales declined in the most recent quarter as higher loan rates\nslowed loan origination volume. The sale of a pool of investment securities resulted in a gain of $30,700 in the first fiscal quarter. The modest year over\nyear rise in total non-interest expenses was largely the result of increased professional fees and data processing costs.\nThe securities portfolio, which is primarily composed of investment-grade municipal bonds or obligations of US government agencies, declined to $92.8\nmillion on September 30, 2024, following the sale of $5.3 million of securities in August.\nNet loans outstanding have increased $2.8 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Commercial loan production slowed to $4.2 million for the\nthree-month period. Single-family mortgage loan production added $15.1 million during the same timeframe, with construction lending accounting for nearly\none-third of this activity. Consumer lending originations, which included auto loans, personal loans, and home equity loans and lines of credit, totaled $5.0\nmillion. The $478.2 million of net loans on September 30, 2024, included $624,100 of loans committed for sale to either Fannie Mae or the Federal Home\nLoan Bank.\nNo provision for credit losses on loans was recorded in the three months ended September 30, 2024. Net loan chargeoffs totaled $75,800 for the quarter.\nThe ratio of nonperforming loans 90 days or more delinquent to total loans was 1.60% on September 30, 2024, compared to 1.35% a year ago. Overall, the\nAllowance for Credit Losses, including reserves for investment securities and unfunded commitments, stood at $5.58 million at quarter end. The portion of\nthe allowance attributed to the loan portfolio represented 1.11% of at-risk loans. Although management believes that the allowance is adequate, a slowing\neconomy and persistent inflation may have an adverse effect on the credit quality of the loan portfolio. Management remains in close contact with our most\nvulnerable borrowers and will make additional provisions to the allowance, as necessary.\nDeposit accounts, totaling $468.8 million on September 30, 2024, have\nincreased by $3.2 million since the beginning of the fiscal year.\nCompetition for funding, both in local markets and at the wholesale\nlevel, has driven deposit rates upward and pushed the Bank’s cost of\ndeposits to an annualized 2.71% for the quarter. Similarly, the\nCompany’s total cost of funds, including FHLB advances and debt of the\nholding company, totaled an annualized 2.89% for the same period.\nAs a part of the Bank’s Liquidity Management Plan, contingency funding\nsources are available and liquidity stress tests determine adequacy.\nFirst Federal Savings Bank maintains lines of credit at multiple\ninstitutions and additional borrowing capacity with the Federal Reserve\nBank’s discount window and the FHLB.\nStockholders’ equity totaled $34.8 million on September 30, 2024, which\nincludes a $7.4 million fair value reduction to the available for sale\nsecurities portfolio given the rapid rise in market interest rates. This\nsecurities portfolio adjustment is not a part of the regulatory capital\ncalculations. Gains or losses in the securities portfolio are recognized\nwhen a security is sold. Based on the 1,685,519 outstanding common\nshares on September 30, 2024, the book value per share of FBPI stock\nwas $20.63.\nAt September 30, 2024, the Bank’s Tier 1 Leverage, Tier 1 Risk Based\nand Total Risk Based Capital ratios were 8.36%, 11.76% and 12.98%,\nrespectively.\nThis press release may contain statements that are forward-looking, as that term is defined by the Private Securities Litigation Act of 1995 or the Securities\nand Exchange Commission in its rules, regulations and releases.

(OTCPK:FBPI), the holding company (the\n“Company”) for First Federal Savings Bank (the “Bank”), reported earnings of $276,000 ($0.16 per diluted\ncommon share) for the fourth fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to $462,000 ($0.28 per diluted\ncommon share) for the same quarter a year ago. Likewise, earnings for Fiscal 2024 totaled $1.67 million ($0.99\nper diluted common share), compared to $2.85 million ($1.70 per diluted common share) last fiscal year. Annual\nearnings equate to a return on average assets (ROA) of 0.26% and a return on average equity (ROE) of 5.49%. This compares to an annualized ROA of 0.50% and an\nannualized ROE of 9.07% for the last fiscal year.\nNet interest income contracted from the prior year. Improved yields on earning assets, provided by higher interest rates on newly originated loans and adjustable-rate\nloans that have repriced upward, were outpaced by higher funding costs. The Company’s Net Interest Margin (NIM), as a percentage of average interest-earning\nassets, was 2.62% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and 2.57% for the fiscal year. Gains on loan sales improved for both periods as loan origination volume\nremained strong. The sale of $10.4 million of investment securities resulted in a loss of $103,400 in the fourth fiscal quarter. The year over year rise in total non-\ninterest expenses was largely the result of increased personnel costs, occupancy expenses, and FDIC insurance premiums due to growth in the Bank’s geographic\nfootprint and asset size.\nIn Fiscal 2022, the board of directors approved a leveraging strategy to\nincrease earnings. The liquidity at the time was used to increase investment\nsecurities holdings and fund loan demand. Proceeds from the Company’s $12\nmillion subordinated debt offering and wholesale deposits acquired by the\nBank funded additional growth. The securities portfolio, primarily composed of\ninvestment-grade municipal bonds or obligations of US government agencies,\ndeclined to $95.2 million on June 30, 2024 following the sale of $10.4 million\nof securities in April.\nDespite the rising interest rate environment, net loans outstanding have\nincreased $21.9 million, or 4.83%, during the fiscal year. Commercial loan\nproduction, including $2.0 million participated with other banks, totaled $63.3\nmillion for the twelve-month period. Single-family mortgage loan production\nadded $72.9 million during the same period. A lack of housing supply in the\nlocal market has resulted in increased housing construction activity.\nConsumer lending originations, which included auto loans, personal loans,\nand home equity loans and lines of credit, totaled $14.5 million. The $475.3\nmillion of net loans on June 30, 2024, included $1.1 million of loans committed\nfor sale to either Fannie Mae or the Federal Home Loan Bank.\nEffective July 1, 2023, the Bank adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments\n– Credit Losses (Topic 326), commonly referred to as the current expected\ncredit loss (CECL) methodology, to determine the required Allowance for\nCredit Losses (ACL) on the Bank’s loans, investments, and unfunded\ncommitments. The adoption increased the allowance by $1.9 million and, on a tax-effected basis, reduced retained earnings by $1.4 million.\nNo provision for loan losses was recorded in the three months ended June 30, 2024, as loan chargeoffs totaled less than $1,000 for the quarter. Moreover, a reverse\nprovision was recorded in the September quarter due to a $286,000 recovery for a loan previously charged off. The ratio of nonperforming loans 90 days or more\ndelinquent to total loans was 0.38% on June 30, 2024, compared to 0.53% a year ago. Overall, the Allowance for Credit Losses, including reserves for investment\nsecurities and unfunded commitments, stood at $5.65 million at quarter end. The portion of the allowance attributed to the loan portfolio represented 1.12% of at-risk\nloans. Although management believes that the allowance is adequate, a slowing economy and persistent inflation may have an adverse effect on the credit quality of\nthe loan portfolio. Management remains in close contact with our most vulnerable borrowers and will make additional provisions to the allowance, as necessary.\nDeposit accounts, totaling $465.6 million on June 30, 2024, have increased by $3.4 million since the beginning of the fiscal year. Competition for funding, both in local\nmarkets and at the wholesale level, has driven deposit rates upward and pushed the Bank’s cost of deposits to an annualized 2.70% for the quarter. Similarly, the\nCompany’s total cost of funds, including FHLB advances and debt of the holding company, increased to an annualized 2.84% for the same period.\nAs a part of the Bank’s Liquidity Management Plan, contingency funding sources are available and liquidity stress tests determine adequacy. First Federal Savings\nBank maintains lines of credit at multiple institutions and additional borrowing capacity with the Federal Reserve Bank’s discount window and the FHLB.\nStockholders’ equity totaled $31.7 million on June 30, 2024, which includes a $10.1 million fair value reduction to the available for sale securities portfolio given the\nrapid rise in market interest rates. This securities portfolio adjustment is not a part of the regulatory capital calculations. Gains or losses in the securities portfolio are\nrecognized when a security is sold. Based on the 1,680,624 outstanding common shares on June 30, 2024, the book value per share of FBPI stock was $18.84.\nAt June 30, 2024, the Bank’s Tier 1, Tier 1 Risk Based and Total Risk Based Capital ratios were 8.24%, 11.44% and 12.66%, respectively.\nThis press release may contain statements that are forward-looking, as that term is defined by the Private Securities Litigation Act of 1995 or the Securities and\nExchange Commission in its rules, regulations and releases.

(OTCPK:FBPI), the holding company\n(the “Company”) for First Federal Savings Bank (the “Bank”), reported earnings of $307,000 ($0.18\nper diluted common share) for the third fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024, compared to $623,000\n($0.37 per diluted common share) for the same quarter a year ago. Likewise, earnings for the first\nthree quarters of Fiscal 2024 totaled $1.39 million ($0.83 per diluted common share), compared to\n$2.39 million ($1.42 per diluted common share) last fiscal year-to-date. Earnings for the nine-month\nperiod equate to an annualized return on average assets (ROA) of 0.29% and a return on average\nequity (ROE) of 6.15%. This compares to an annualized ROA of 0.57% and an annualized ROE of\n10.25% for the corresponding period last fiscal year.\nNet interest income contracted from the prior year. Improved yields on earning assets, provided by\nhigher interest rates on newly originated loans and adjustable-rate loans that have repriced upward,\nwere outpaced by higher funding costs. The Company’s Net Interest Margin (NIM), as a percentage of\naverage interest-earning assets, was 2.47% for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, and 2.55% for the\nfirst nine months of the fiscal year. Noninterest income improved for both periods, led by higher gains\non loan sales. Total non-interest expenses, higher for both the quarter and the nine-month periods,\nwere largely the result of increased personnel costs, occupancy expenses, and FDIC insurance\npremiums due to growth in the Bank’s geographic footprint and asset size.\nIn Fiscal 2022, the board of directors approved a leveraging strategy to increase earnings. The\nliquidity at the time was used to increase investment securities holdings and fund loan demand.\nProceeds from the Company’s $12 million subordinated debt offering and wholesale deposits\nacquired by the Bank funded additional growth. The securities portfolio, primarily composed of\ninvestment-grade municipal bonds or obligations of US government agencies, totaled $110.9 million\non March 31, 2024.\nDespite the rising interest rate environment, net loans outstanding have increased $17.4 million, or\n3.83%, during the first nine months of the fiscal year. Commercial loan production, including $2.0\nmillion participated with other banks, totaled $48.3 million for the nine-month period. Single-family\nmortgage loan production added $54.7 million during the same period. A lack of housing supply in the\nlocal market has resulted in increased housing construction activity. Consumer lending originations,\nwhich included auto loans, personal loans, and home equity loans and lines of credit, totaled $10.8\nmillion. The $470.8 million of net loans on March 31, 2024, included $721,000 of loans committed for\nsale to either Fannie Mae or the Federal Home Loan Bank.\nEffective July 1, 2023, the Bank adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic\n326), commonly referred to as the current expected credit loss (CECL) methodology, to determine the\nrequired Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL) on the Bank’s loans, investments, and unfunded\ncommitments. The adoption increased the allowance by $1.9 million and, on a tax-effected basis,\nreduced retained earnings by $1.4 million.\nNo provision for loan losses was recorded in the quarter ended March 31, 2024, as no loans were\ncharged off. Moreover, a reverse provision was recorded in the September quarter due to a $286,000\nrecovery for a loan previously charged off. The ratio of nonperforming loans 90 days or more\ndelinquent to total loans was 0.35% on March 31, 2024, compared to 0.25% a year ago. Overall, the\nAllowance for Credit Losses, including reserves for investment securities and unfunded commitments,\nstood at $5.65 million at quarter end. The portion of the allowance attributed to the loan portfolio\nrepresented 1.14% of at-risk loans. Although management believes that the allowance is adequate, a\nslowing economy and persistent inflation may have an adverse effect on the credit quality of the loan\nportfolio. Management remains in close contact with our most vulnerable borrowers and will make\nadditional provisions to the allowance, as necessary.\nDeposit accounts, totaling $469.7 million on March 31, 2024, have increased 1.63% since the\nbeginning of the fiscal year. Competition for funding, both in local markets and at the wholesale level,\nhas driven deposit rates upward and pushed the Bank’s cost of deposits to an annualized 2.74% for\nthe quarter. Similarly, the Company’s total cost of funds, including FHLB advances and debt of the\nholding company, increased to an annualized 2.85% for the same period.\nAs a part of the Bank’s Liquidity Management Plan, contingency funding sources are available and\nliquidity stress tests determine adequacy. First Federal Savings Bank maintains lines of credit at\nmultiple institutions and additional borrowing capacity at FHLB. The Bank also has access to, but has\nnot utilized, the Federal Reserve’s discount window.\nStockholders’ equity totaled $32.3 million on March 31, 2024, which includes a $9.5 million fair value\nreduction to the available for sale securities portfolio given the rapid rise in market interest rates. This\nsecurities portfolio adjustment is not a part of the regulatory capital calculations. Gains or losses in the\nsecurities portfolio are recognized when a security is sold. Based on the 1,680,624 outstanding\ncommon shares on March 31, 2024, the book value per share of FBPI stock was $19.21.\nAt 8.23%, First Federal’s tier one capital ratio exceeded the five percent regulatory standard for “well-\ncapitalized” financial institutions.

(April 8, 2024)—During America Saves Week, First\nFederal Savings Bank and the Independent Community Bankers of America (ICBA)\nare reminding consumers of the value of a financial nest egg to provide financial\nresiliency during times of economic distress or uncertainty.\nWhile the share of families with difficulties paying bills or expenses increased from\n35.7 percent in 2022 to 37.8 percent in 2023, it remains below its 40.4 percent pre-\npandemic level, according to a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau report.\nMeanwhile, America’s personal savings rate dropped from 15 percent in Q3 2020 to\n4.0 percent in Q3 2023, according to the Commerce Department.\n“Saving is an important component of maintaining financial wellness and stability,”\nCourtney Schmitt, Marketing Manager VP at First Federal Savings Bank said. “As\nyour trusted financial advisor, First Federal Savings Bank can put you in the driver’s\nseat so you can help avoid financial pitfalls and reach your short- and long-term\nfinancial goals.”\nFirst Federal Savings Bank and ICBA offer these tips to help consumers boost their\nsavings:\nPay yourself first. Many employers offer automatic payroll deduction, which\nis a great way to save. Use those funds to build a retirement fund.\nCreate a spending plan to help you take control of your finances by tracking\nwhere your money goes so you can prioritize your spending.\nStart small. Setting aside just $4.90 a day (the average cost of a cup of\ncoffee) for a year can boost your emergency fund by nearly $1,800 annually.\nBuild a financial cushion. Strive for an emergency savings of six to nine\nmonths of living expenses.\nPut your tax refund to work. More than three quarters (83 percent) of\nAmericans plan to use their anticipated return for savings or paying off debt.\nOther important factors to consider when choosing where to place your savings:\nAccess. How quickly can you retrieve funds? Community banks use the latest\ntechnology to allow consumers the freedom to access their money when and\nwhere they need it.\nSafety. Is your money protected? The FDIC insures deposits up to $250,000\nper depositor and $250,000 for certain retirement accounts. No one has ever\nlost a penny of FDIC-insured funds.\n“Community banks provide personalized service and competitively priced products\nand services to suit a diverse range of consumer financial needs,” ICBA President\nand CEO Rebeca Romero Rainey said. “Reach out to these trusted financial\nadvisors to help finance major purchases and plan for your financial future and put\nyour money to work for you and your community.”\nTo talk more about the importance of saving or to open a savings account during\nAmerica Saves Week, be sure to stop by any of our ten convenient banking centers.\nAbout First Federal Savings Bank\nFirst Federal Savings Bank was established on Evansville, Indiana's Westside in 1904.

Likewise, earnings for the first half of Fiscal 2024 totaled $1.09\nmillion ($0.65 per diluted common share), compared to $1.77 million ($1.04 per diluted common share) last fiscal\nyear-to-date. Earnings for the six-month period equate to an annualized return on average assets (ROA) of 0.34% and a return on average equity (ROE) of 7.52%.\nThis compares to an annualized ROA of 0.64% and an annualized ROE of 11.51% for the corresponding period last fiscal year.\nNet interest income contracted from the prior year. Improved yields on earning assets, provided by higher interest rates on newly originated commercial adjustable-rate\nloans and investments, could not keep up with higher funding costs as deposit rates continued their upward trajectory. The Company’s Net Interest Margin (NIM), as a\npercentage of average interest-earning assets, was 2.56% for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, and 2.60% for the first half of the fiscal year. Noninterest income\nimproved for both periods, led by higher gains on loan sales. Total non-interest expenses, higher for both the quarter and the six-month periods, were the result of\nincreased personnel costs, occupancy expenses, and FDIC insurance premiums due to the growth in the Bank’s footprint and asset size.\n“The banking system has faced significant headwinds in 2023,” stated Michael H. Head,\nPresident, and CEO, “Regional bank failures, inflationary pressures, and margin compression\npresented a challenging environment. As a community bank, we continue to focus on our\ncustomers and practice prudent risk management as interest rates stabilize.”\nIn Fiscal 2022, the board of directors approved a leveraging strategy to increase earnings.\nThe liquidity at the time increased investment securities holdings and funded loan demand.\nProceeds from the Company’s $12 million subordinated debt offering and wholesale deposits\nacquired by the Bank funded additional growth. The securities portfolio, primarily composed\nof investment-grade municipal bonds or obligations of US government agencies, totaled\n$113.0 million on December 31, 2023.\nDespite the rising interest rate environment, net loans outstanding have increased $21.0\nmillion, or 4.6%, during the first half of the fiscal year. Commercial loan production, including\n$2.0 million participated with other banks, totaled $29.2 million for the six-month period.\nSingle-family mortgage loan production added $40.6 million during the same period. A lack of\nhousing supply in the local market has resulted in increased housing construction activity.\nConsumer lending originations, which included auto loans, personal loans, and home equity\nloans and lines of credit, totaled $8.1 million. The $474.4 million of net loans on December\n31, 2023, included $2.2 million of loans committed for sale to either Fannie Mae or the\nFederal Home Loan Bank.\nEffective July 1, 2023, the Bank adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326), commonly referred to as the current expected credit loss\n(CECL) methodology, to determine the required Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL) on the Bank’s loans, investments, and unfunded commitments. The adoption\nincreased the allowance by $1.9 million and, on a tax-effected basis, reduced retained earnings by $1.4 million.\nNo provision for loan losses was set aside in the current quarter. Charged off loans totaled less than $3,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. Moreover, a\nreverse provision was recorded in the September quarter due to a $286,000 recovery for a loan previously charged off.\nThe ratio of nonperforming loans 90 days or more delinquent to total loans was 0.89% on December 31, 2023, compared to 0.04% a year ago. Overall, the Allowance\nfor Credit Losses, including reserves for investment securities and unfunded commitments, stood at $5.65 million at quarter end. The portion of the allowance\nattributed to the loan portfolio represented 1.17% of at-risk loans. Although management believes that the allowance is adequate, a slowing economy and persistent\ninflation may have an adverse effect on the credit quality of our loan portfolio. Management remains in close contact with our most vulnerable borrowers and will make\nadditional provisions regarding the allowance, as necessary.\nDeposit accounts, totaling $487.1 million on December 31, 2023, have increased 5.4% since the beginning of the fiscal year. Competition for funding, both in local\nmarkets and at the wholesale level, has driven deposit rates upward and pushed the Bank’s cost of deposits to an annualized 2.63% for the quarter. Similarly, the\nCompany’s total cost of funds, including FHLB advances and debt of the holding company, increased to an annualized 2.74% for the same period.\nAs a part of the Bank’s Liquidity Management Plan, contingency funding sources are available and liquidity stress tests determine adequacy. First Federal Savings\nBank maintains lines of credit at multiple institutions and additional borrowing capacity at FHLB. The Bank also has access to, but has not utilized, the Federal\nReserve’s discount window and the Bank Term Funding Program.\nStockholders’ equity totaled $33.4 million on December 31, 2023, which includes an $8.3 million fair value reduction to the available for sale securities portfolio given\nthe rapid rise in market interest rates. This securities portfolio adjustment is not a part of the regulatory capital calculations. Gains or losses in the securities portfolio\nare recognized when a security is sold. Based on the 1,680,624 outstanding common shares on December 31, 2023, the book value per share of FBPI stock was\n$19.87.\nAt 8.11%, First Federal’s tier one capital ratio exceeded the five percent regulatory standard for “well-capitalized” financial institutions. The bank’s other capital\nmeasurements also continue to comfortably exceed “well-capitalized” standards.\nThis news release may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.

(Jan. 11, 2024) — First Federal Savings Bank and the Independent\nCommunity Bankers of America (ICBA) are offering tips to help customers plan for their financial future\nby establishing and maintaining good credit habits for financial wellness and prosperity in the New Year.\n“Demonstrating sound money management principles as you plan your financial future not only builds\ngood credit, but is essential to establishing financial independence,” said Courtney Schmitt, VP Marketing\nManager at First Federal Savings Bank. “Your local community banker can work with you to develop a\nbudget that reflects your short- and long-term financial goals to help avoid financial pitfalls and set you\nup for financial success.”\nFirst Federal Savings Bank and ICBA offer the following tips to help build and sustain good credit:\n• Open a checking account and keep track of your balance to help establish a credit history.\n• Use debit and credit cards for convenience and safety, but don’t overspend or miss payments,\nwhich can negatively affect your credit score.\n• Develop a mix of credit (such as a revolving credit line and an installment loan) to demonstrate\nyour proficiency managing several types of credit.\n• Show stability in the three to six months before a major purchase. Avoid opening or closing\naccounts or moving large amounts of money around.\n• Build an emergency fund equal to at least six months of living expenses to help absorb\nunexpected expenses and avoid penalties and fees for missed or delinquent payments.\n• Alter your credit focus as you approach different life stages. While Gen Z might be saving for\na down payment, Gen Xers or baby boomers may be paying down debt or planning for\nretirement, respectively.\n• Monitor your credit to correct any errors and detect potential signs of identity theft.

McBride\nCorporate Secretary\nEvansville, Indiana\nOctober 18, 2024\nNOTE: Whether or not you plan to attend the annual meeting, please vote by marking, signing,\ndating, and promptly returning the enclosed proxy card in the enclosed envelope.\nFIRST BANCORP OF INDIANA, INC.\nPROXY STATEMENT\nThis proxy statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of\nDirectors of First Bancorp of Indiana, Inc. (“First Bancorp” or the “Company”) to be used at the annual\nmeeting of shareholders of the Company. First Bancorp is the holding company for First Federal Savings\nBank (“First Federal”). The annual meeting will be held at the Company’s corporate headquarters located\nat 5001 Davis Lant Drive, Evansville, Indiana on Tuesday, November 26, 2024, at 1:00 p.m., local time.\nThis proxy statement and the enclosed proxy card are being mailed on or about October 18, 2024, to\nshareholders of record.\nGENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT VOTING\nWho Can Vote at the Meeting\nYou are entitled to vote your shares of First Bancorp common stock if the records of the\nCompany show that you held your shares as of the close of business on October 1, 2024. As of the close\nof business on October 1, 2024, a total of 1,685,519 shares of First Bancorp common stock were\noutstanding. Each share of common stock has one vote. The Company’s Articles of Incorporation\nprovide that record holders of the Company’s common stock who beneficially own, either directly or\nindirectly, in excess of 10% of the Company’s outstanding shares are not entitled to any vote with respect\nto the shares held in excess of the 10% limit. With respect to shares held by a broker, bank or other\nnominee, the Company generally will look beyond the holder of the shares to the person or entity for\nwhom the shares are held when applying the voting limitation. However, where the ultimate owner of the\nshares has granted voting authority to the broker, bank or other nominee that holds the shares, the\nCompany would apply the 10% voting limitation to the broker, bank, or nominee.\nOwnership of Shares; Attending the Meeting\nIf your shares are registered directly in your name as the stockholder of record, you are the holder\nof record of these shares, and we are sending these proxy materials directly to you. As the holder of\nrecord, you have the right to give your proxy directly to us or to vote in person at the annual meeting. If\nyou plan to attend the annual meeting, you must bring photo identification to be admitted to the\nmeeting.\nIf you hold your shares in street name, your broker, bank, or other holder of record is sending\nthese proxy materials to you. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank, or\nother holder of record how to vote by filling out a voting instruction form that accompanies your proxy\nmaterials. Your broker, bank or other holder of record may allow you to provide voting instructions by\ntelephone or by the Internet. Please see the voting instruction form provided by your broker, bank or\nother holder of record that accompanies this proxy statement. If you hold your shares in street name,\nyou will need photo identification and proof of ownership to be admitted to the annual meeting.\nExamples of proof of ownership include a recent brokerage statement or letter from a bank or broker. If\nyou want to vote your shares of First Bancorp common stock held in street name in person at the annual\nmeeting, you must obtain a written proxy in your name from the broker, bank, or other holder of record of\nyour shares.\n1\nQuorum and Vote Required\nQuorum. The annual meeting will be held only if there is a quorum present. A quorum exists if\na majority of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote is represented at the meeting. If\nyou return valid proxy instructions or attend the meeting in person, your shares will be counted for\npurposes of determining whether there is a quorum, even if you abstain from voting. Broker non-votes\nalso will be counted for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum. A broker non-vote occurs\nwhen a broker, bank or other nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner does not vote on a particular\nproposal because the broker, bank or other nominee does not have discretionary voting power with\nrespect to that item and has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner.\nVote Required. First Bancorp’s Board of Directors currently consists of twelve members. At\nthis year’s annual meeting, shareholders will elect a maximum of three directors, each to serve for a term\nof three years. In voting on the election of directors, you may vote in favor of all nominees, withhold\nvotes as to all nominees, or withhold votes as to specific nominees. There is no cumulative voting for the\nelection of directors. Directors must be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at the annual meeting.\nThis means that the nominees receiving the greatest number of votes will be elected as directors up to the\nmaximum number of directors to be elected at the annual meeting. For purposes of the election of\ndirectors, abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted as votes cast and will have no effect on\nthe result of the vote.\nIn voting on the appointment of Plante Moran as the Company’s independent registered public\naccounting firm, you may vote in favor of the proposal, vote against the proposal or abstain from voting.\nThis proposal will be decided by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the annual meeting.\nIn counting votes on this proposal, abstentions will have no effect on the result of the vote.\nHow We Count Votes. If you return valid proxy instructions or attend the meeting in person,\nwe will count your shares for purposes of determining whether there is a quorum, even if you abstain\nfrom voting. Broker non-votes also will be counted for purposes of determining the existence of a\nquorum. If you are a shareholder of record and you do not sign, date, and return a proxy card, no votes\nwill be cast on your behalf on any of the items of business at the annual meeting.\nEffect of Not Casting Your Vote. If you hold your shares in street name, it is critical that\nyou cast your vote if you want it to count in the election of directors. Current regulations restrict the\nability of your bank or broker to vote your uninstructed shares in the election of directors on a\ndiscretionary basis. Therefore, if you hold your shares in street name and you do not instruct your bank or\nbroker how to vote in the election of directors, no votes will be cast on your behalf. These are referred to\nas “broker non-votes.” Your bank or broker will, however, continue to have discretion to vote any\nuninstructed shares on the ratification of the appointment of the Company’s independent registered public\naccounting firm.\nVoting by Proxy\nThis proxy statement is being sent to you by the Board of Directors of First Bancorp to request\nthat you allow your shares of First Bancorp common stock to be represented at the annual meeting by the\npersons named in the enclosed proxy card. All shares of First Bancorp common stock represented at the\nmeeting by properly executed and dated proxies will be voted according to the instructions indicated on\nthe proxy card. If you sign, date, and return a proxy card without giving voting instructions, your shares\nwill be voted as recommended by the Company’s Board of Directors.\n2\nThe Board of Directors recommends a vote:\n• “FOR” each of the three nominees for director; and\n• “FOR” ratification of Plante Moran as the Company’s independent registered public\naccounting firm.\nIf any matter not described in this proxy statement is properly presented at the annual meeting,\nthe persons named in the proxy card will use their own best judgment to determine how to vote your\nshares. This includes a motion to adjourn or postpone the annual meeting in order to solicit additional\nproxies. If the annual meeting is postponed or adjourned, your shares of First Bancorp common stock\nmay be voted by the persons named in the proxy card on the new annual meeting date as well, unless you\nhave revoked your proxy. The Company does not know of any other matters to be presented at the annual\nmeeting.\nHow to Revoke Your Proxy\nYou may revoke your proxy at any time before the vote is taken at the annual meeting. To revoke\nyour proxy, you must either advise the Corporate Secretary of the Company in writing before your\ncommon stock has been voted at the annual meeting, deliver a later dated proxy or attend the annual\nmeeting and vote your shares in person. Attendance at the annual meeting will not in and of itself\nconstitute revocation of your proxy.\nParticipants in First Federal’s ESOP\nIf you participate in the First Federal Savings Bank Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the\n“ESOP”), you will receive a voting instruction form that reflects all of the shares that you may vote under\nthe ESOP. Under the terms of the ESOP, the ESOP trustees vote all of the shares held by the ESOP, but\neach ESOP participant may direct how the trustees vote the shares of common stock allocated to his or\nher account. The ESOP trustees, subject to the exercise of their fiduciary duties, will vote all of the\nunallocated shares of Company common stock held by the ESOP and allocated shares for which no\nvoting instructions are received in the same proportion as the shares for which the trustees have received\ntimely voting instructions. The deadline for returning your voting instructions to the ESOP trustees is\nNovember 21, 2024.\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nMeetings of the Board of Directors\nThe Company and First Federal conduct business through meetings and activities of their Boards\nof Directors and their committees. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the Board of Directors of\nthe Company held six regular meetings and no special meetings, and the Board of Directors of First\nFederal held 12 regular meetings. No director attended fewer than 75% of the total meetings of the\nBoards of Directors on which such director served.\n3\nCommittees of the Board of Directors of First Bancorp\nThe following table identifies our standing committees and their members as of October 1, 2024.\nEach committee acts under a written charter adopted by the Board of Directors.\nCorporate\nGovernance\nand Information\nAudit Compensation Nominating Technology\nDirector Committee Committee Committee Committee\nGregory L.

          "content": "ANNUAL REPORT\n2 0 2 4\nWWW.FIRSTFEDSAVINGS.BANK\nPRESIDENT'S MESSAGE\nFellow Stockholders:\nFiscal Year 2024 was a challenging year. The Federal Reserve’s interest rate policy of “higher for longer” has taken a toll on southwestern\nIndiana and Henderson, Kentucky’s economic good fortune. We have witnessed small businesses closing and individuals spending\nthrough their accumulated savings and increasing their credit card debt.\nWe are experiencing one of the largest mortgage home loan delinquency periods in my 44 years at First Federal Savings Bank. In addition,\ncommercial business customers are seeing slowdowns in their accounts receivable and extending their payables.\nThe higher interest rate environment, and the pace at which interest rates increased, together with the growth that the Bank has\nexperienced over the last several years, led to a significant increase in our funding costs. In the face of a challenging economic\nenvironment, these factors contributed to the need to suspend the payment of quarterly dividends on shares of our common stock and\nfocus on a strategy of better positioning the Bank to enhance capital levels, liquidity and earnings, and to reduce the Bank’s reliance on\nhigher funding costs.\nWith two retirements on the horizon, the Bank and Company also acted to further strengthen the Boards of Directors by adding twonew\nmembers:\n• Philip E. Rawley, CEO Tri-State Orthopaedics, Evansville, IN, joined the First Bancorp and First Federal Savings Bank board of\ndirectors on April 23, 2024. We welcome Philip with his many years of local business experience in the Evansville market.\n• Gina Hermann, Director of Human Resources, Southern Star Central Gas Pipeline Company in Owensboro, KY, joined the First\nBancorp and First Federal Savings Bank board of directors on May 28, 2024. We welcome Gina with her many years of experience\nin Human Resources.\nThe addition of these two new Board members precedes the anticipated departures of Mr. E. Harvey “Skip” Seaman, III and Ms. Carolyn\nMcClintock, who, after long and distinguished careers of service, elected not to be renominated for election following the conclusion of\ntheir Board terms at the 2024 Annual Meeting.\n• Mr. Seaman has been a Board member of First Federal since 2001 and has served as Chairman of the Board of both the Bank and\nCompany for many years.\n• Ms. McClintock has been a Board member since 2021.\nThe Officers and Employees of the Bank express their sincere thanks to Skip and Carol for their many years of service.\nOn a different note, we want to thank our many customers and shareholders as we celebrate our 120th birthday on October 20, 2024. We\nextend our heartfelt gratitude to you for being an essential part of our journey. For over a century, we've had the privilegeofserving this\ncommunity, and we recognize that our success is due in no small part to the trust, loyalty, and continued support of our customers and\nshareholders.\nWhat began as a small, local bank in 1904, has grown and evolved over the decades, but our commitment to providing personalized\nservices and fostering strong relationships has remained steadfast. Our core values of integrity, community focus, and financial\nresponsibility have guided us through the ups and downs of changing times, ensuring we stay rooted in what matters most -our\nshareholders and customers.\nWe're proud to be part of this community, and we look forward to continuing our partnership with each of you for many more yearsto\ncome. Whether it's supporting your financial goals, offering innovative banking solutions, or helping local businesses thrive, we remain\ndedicated to your success and to the well-being of our community.\nTo celebrate this special occasion, we hope you will take a moment to read about our history on our website. It’s a journey through the\nmilestones, challenges, and triumphs that have shaped our institution throughout the last 120 years.\nAs always, I thank you for your investment in First Bancorp of Indiana, Inc.\nMichael H.
