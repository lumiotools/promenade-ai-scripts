These forward-looking statements are based on the current expectations of the management of Pluri only, and are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.

Statements on this Website regarding Pluri’s business which are not historical facts are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and federal securities laws, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements can be identified by, among other things, the use of forward-looking language, such as “anticipate”, “believe”, “could”, “estimate”, “expect”, “future”, “intend”, “plan”, “potential”, and may describe opinions about future events. These forward-looking statements are based on the current expectations of the management of Pluri only, and are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements: changes in technology and market requirements; we may encounter delays or obstacles in launching our clinical trials; our technology may not be validated as we progress further and our methods may not be accepted by the scientific community; we may be unable to retain or attract key employees whose knowledge is essential to the development of our products; unforeseen scientific difficulties may develop with our progress; our products may wind up being more expensive than we anticipate; results in the laboratory may not translate to equally good results in real surgical settings; our patents may not be sufficient; our products may harm recipients; changes in legislation; inability to timely develop and introduce new technologies, products and applications; loss of market share and pressure on pricing resulting from competition, which could cause the actual results or performance of Pluri to differ materially from those contemplated in such forward-looking statements. For a more detailed description of the risks and uncertainties affecting Pluri, reference is made to Pluri’s reports filed from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Pluri disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)\nU.S. Dollars in thousands (except share and per share amounts)\nNOTE 1: - GENERAL\na. Pluri Inc. (formally known as Pluristem Therapeutics Inc.), a Nevada corporation, was incorporated on May 11, 2001. Pluri Inc.’s common shares trade\non the Nasdaq Capital Market and Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange under the symbol “PLUR”. Pluri Inc. has a wholly owned subsidiary, Pluri-Biotech Ltd.\n(formerly known as Pluristem Ltd.), or the Subsidiary, which is incorporated under the laws of the State of Israel. In January 2020, the Subsidiary\nestablished a wholly owned German Subsidiary, Pluristem GmbH, or the German Subsidiary which is incorporated under the laws of Germany. In\nJanuary 2022, the Subsidiary established a new subsidiary, Ever After Foods Ltd., or Ever After Foods formerly known as Plurinuva Ltd. Ever After\nFoods is incorporated under the laws of Israel, which followed the execution of the collaboration agreement with Tnuva Food Industries – Agricultural\nCooperative in Israel Ltd., through its fully owned subsidiary, Tnuva Food-Tech Incubator (2019), Limited Partnership, or Tnuva. In March 2024, the\nSubsidiary established a new wholly owned subsidiary, Coffeesai Ltd., or Coffeesai which is incorporated under the laws of Israel, to develop\ncultivated coffee. Pluri Inc., the Subsidiary, the German Subsidiary, Ever After Foods and Coffeesai are referred to as the “Company” or “Pluri.” The\nSubsidiary, the German Subsidiary, Coffeesai and Ever After Foods are referred to as the “Subsidiaries.”\nb. The Company is a bio-technology company with an advanced cell-based technology platform, which operates in one operating segment. The Company\nhas developed a unique three-dimensional technology platform for cell expansion with an industrial scale in-house Good Manufacturing Practice cell\nmanufacturing facility. Pluri currently uses its technology in the field of regenerative medicine, food technology and agricultural technology and\nlaunched a Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization or CDMO business and plans to utilize its technology in industries and verticals\nthat have a need for a mass scale and cost-effective cell expansion platform. Pluri is focused on the research, development and manufacturing of cell-\nbased products and the business development of cell therapeutics and cell-based technologies providing potential solutions for various industries.\nc. The Company has incurred an accumulated deficit of approximately $426,354 and incurred recurring operating losses and negative cash flows from\noperating activities since inception. As of September 30, 2024, the Company’s total shareholders’ equity deficit amounted to $5,283. During the three-\nmonth period ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred losses of $6,036 and its negative cash flow from operating activities was $4,064.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company’s cash balances (cash and cash equivalents, short-term bank deposits, restricted cash and restricted bank\ndeposits) totaled $26,677.\nThe Company plans to continue to finance its operations from its current resources, by entering into licensing or other commercial, partnerships and\ncollaboration agreements, by providing CDMO services to clients, from grants and contracts to support its research and development activities and\nfrom sales of its equity securities. The Company’s management believes that its current resources together with its existing operating plan, are\nsufficient for the Company to meet its obligations as they come due at least for a period of twelve months from the date of the issuance of these interim\nunaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. During 2024, the Company also implemented a cost reduction and efficiency plan. There is no\nassurance, however, that the Company will be able to obtain an adequate level of financial resources that are required for the long-term development\nand commercialization of its products. In the case the Company is unable to obtain the required level of financing, operations may need to be scaled\ndown or discontinued.\nOn April 30, 2020, the German Subsidiary entered into a finance contract, or the Finance Contract, with the EIB, pursuant to which the German\nSubsidiary obtained a loan in an amount of €20 million, or the Loan. The amount received is due on June 1, 2026 and bears an annual interest of 4% to\nbe paid with the principal of the Loan. As of September 30, 2024, the linked principal and interest accrued balance was of $25,365 and is presented\namong long-term liabilities (see note 4).\n8\nPLURI INC.

Use of estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates,\njudgments and assumptions that are reasonable based upon information available at the time they are made. These estimates, judgments and\nassumptions can affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n9\nPLURI INC.

Fair value of financial instruments\nThe carrying amounts of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term bank deposits and\nrestricted bank deposits and other current assets, trade payable and other accounts payable and accrued expenses, approximate their fair value because\nof their generally short-term maturities.\nThe Company measures its derivative instruments at fair value under Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, “Fair Value Measurements and\nDisclosures, or ASC 820. Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an\norderly transaction between market participants.\nAs such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an\nasset or a liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, ASC 820 establishes a three-tier value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in\nthe valuation methodologies in measuring fair value:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.\nThe fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring\nfair value. The Company categorized each of its fair value measurements in one of these three levels of hierarchy.\nThe Company measures its liability pursuant to the Finance Contract based on the aggregate outstanding amount of the combined principal and\naccrued interest thereunder. As of September 30, 2024, the Company does not reflect its liability for future royalty payments pursuant to the Finance\nContract with the EIB since the royalty payments are to be paid as a percentage of the Company’s future consolidated revenues, pro-rated to the\namount disbursed, beginning in fiscal year 2024 and until fiscal year 2030. As of September 30, 2024, Pluri had an accrued royalty in the amount of\n$7(see note 4).\n10\nPLURI INC.

Recently adopted accounting pronouncements\nASU No. 2023-07 - “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to reportable segment disclosures”, or ASU 2023-07:\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB issued ASU 2023-07. This guidance expands public entities’ segment disclosures\nprimarily by requiring disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and are included within\neach reported measure of segment profit or loss, an amount and description of its composition of other segment items, and interim disclosures of a\nreportable segment’s profit or loss and assets. The guidance is effective for the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within\nthe fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The amendments should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods\npresented in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance to determine the impact it may have on its consolidated financial\nstatements disclosures.\nASU No. 2023-09 - “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures”, or ASU 2023-09:\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09. This guidance is intended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax\ndisclosures. The amendments in ASU 2023-09 address investors’ requests for enhanced income tax information primarily through changes to the tax rate\nreconciliation and regarding income tax paid both in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after\nDecember 15, 2024, on a prospective basis. Early adoption and retroactive application are permitted. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance to\ndetermine the impact it may have on its consolidated financial statements disclosures.\nNOTE 3: - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\na. As of September 30, 2024, an amount of $1,018 of cash and deposits was pledged by the Subsidiary to secure its credit line, lease agreement,\nderivative and hedging and bank guarantees.\nb. Under the Law for the Encouragement of Industrial Research and Development, 1984, or the Research Law, research and development programs that\nmeet specified criteria and are approved by the IIA are eligible for grants of up to 50% of the project’s expenditures, as determined by the research\ncommittee, in exchange for the payment of royalties from the sale of products developed under the program. Regulations under the Research Law\ngenerally provide for the payment of royalties to the IIA of 3% on sales of products and services derived from a technology developed using these\ngrants until 100% of the U.S. dollar-linked grant is repaid. The Company’s obligation to pay these royalties is contingent on its actual sale of such\nproducts and services. In the absence of such sales, no payment is required. The outstanding balance of the grants will be subject to interest at a rate\nequal to the 12 month London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR (from January 1, 2024, to the 12-month secured overnight financing rate, or SOFR)\napplicable to U.S. dollar deposits that is published on the first business day of each calendar year. Following the full repayment of the grant, there is no\nfurther liability for royalties.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company’s contingent liability in respect to royalties to the IIA amounted to $27,565, not including LIBOR (from\nJanuary 1, 2024, SOFR) interest as described above.\n11\nPLURI INC.

We have developed a unique three-dimensional, or 3D, technology\nplatform for cell expansion with an industrial scale in-house Good Manufacturing Practice, cell manufacturing facility. We are utilizing our technology in the\nfields of regenerative medicine, immunotherapy, food tech, CDMO, and agtech, and plan to utilize it in industries and verticals that have a need for our mass\nscale and cost-effective cell expansion platform via partnerships, joint ventures, licensing agreements and other types of collaborations.\nOur operations are focused on the research, development and manufacturing of cell-based products and the business development of cell therapeutics\nand cell-based technologies, providing potential solutions for various industries.\nCell Therapy\nWe use our advanced cell-based technology platform in the field of regenerative medicine to develop placenta-based cell therapy product candidates\nfor the treatment of inflammatory, muscle injuries and hematologic conditions. Recently, we have also launched a novel immunotherapy platform.\nPLX Cells: Our PLX cells are adherent stromal cells that are expanded using our 3D platform. Our PLX cells can be administered to patients off-the-\nshelf, without blood or tissue matching or additional manipulation prior to administration. PLX cells are believed to release a range of therapeutic proteins in\nresponse to the patient’s condition.\nIn the pharmaceutical area, we have focused on several indications utilizing our product candidates, including, but not limited to, muscle recovery\nfollowing surgery for hip fracture, incomplete recovery following bone marrow transplantation, critical limb ischemia, or CLI, Chronic Graft versus Host\nDisease and a potential treatment for Hematopoietic Acute Radiation Syndrome, or H-ARS. Some of these studies have been completed while others are still\nongoing. We believe that each of these indications is a severe unmet medical need.\nIn July 2023, we announced that we signed a three-year $4.2 million contract with the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, or\nNIAID, which is part of the NIH. Under such contract, we will collaborate with the U.S. Department of Defense’s Armed Forces Radiobiology Research\nInstitute, or AFRRI, and the Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences, or USUHS, in Maryland, U.S.A., to further advance the development of our\nPLX-R18 cell therapy as a potential novel treatment for H-ARS, a deadly disease that can result from nuclear disasters and radiation exposure.\n18\nImmunotherapy MAIT cells: In May 2024, we launched a novel allogenic immunotherapy platform utilizing MAIT cells specifically designed to\naddress solid tumors - a critical area in medicine where effective treatments are currently insufficient. We believe that our MAIT cells, isolated from the human\nplacenta, offer substantial potential benefits compared to conventional T-cells.\nMAIT cells are potent effector cells, potentially targeting tumors through multiple mechanisms while expressing high levels of various chemokine\nreceptors, which facilitate their migration directly to tumor sites. Furthermore, unlike conventional autologous T-cells typically collected from peripheral blood,\nour MAIT cells are designed to be allogenic universal product. Benefiting with very restricted T-cell receptor, the MAIT cells minimize their likelihood of\ninducing Graft versus Host Disease, a significant advantage over other potential allogeneic products. We are aiming to design the MAIT cells to potentially\nshow better persistence in the body for a longer duration, enhancing their therapeutic efficacy.\nIn April 2024, we unveiled a novel method for expansion of immune cells using proprietary technology and announced we were granted a new U.S.\npatent titled, “System and Methods for Immune Cells Expansion and Activation in Large Scale.” This innovative approach ensures that the produced immune\ncells retain their integrity, functionality, and therapeutic efficacy, thus offering a promising solution to meet the escalating demand for advanced cell-based\ntherapies for immune disorders and neurodegenerative diseases.\nPluriCDMO™\nIn January 2024, we launched a new business division offering cell therapy manufacturing services as a CDMO: PluriCDMO™. PluriCDMO™ offers\nCDMO services to companies from early preclinical development, through late-stage clinical trials and commercialization, with a mission to deliver high-\nquality, essential therapies to patients. We have signed several agreements with clients and are currently generating revenues from PluriCDMO™.\nAgTech\nWe are actively involved in several initiatives leveraged by Pluri’s 3D cell expansion in the agtech field, such as: (a) cell-based coffee business activity\nthrough our PluriAgtech business vertical, which is incorporated into our wholly owned subsidiary, Coffeesai Ltd., (b) an innovative proof-of-concept, or POC,\ncollaboration with ICL Group Ltd., a leading global specialty minerals company, to revolutionize bio stimulant delivery and enhance yield sustainably, and (c) a\nstrategic POC agreement with a leading international agriculture corporation which is intended to boost the global vegetable product supply, streamline supply\nchains, and combat global climate change, while ensuring a natural and a more sustainable future for agriculture.\nIn March 2024, we announced an important expansion to our intellectual property portfolio with a new patent approval from the Israel Patent Office,\nthat is designed to reshape the agricultural technology landscape. The patent represents a major breakthrough in our proprietary 3D bioreactor technology,\nenabling efficient cultivation of plant cells across various applications, from sustainable agriculture to critical healthcare solutions.\nFood Tech\nIn 2022, we announced the establishment of a joint venture with Tnuva Food Industries – Agricultural Cooperative in Israel Ltd., or Tnuva, Ever After\nFoods (previously Plurinuva Ltd.), which is incorporated under the laws of the State of Israel, with the purpose of developing cultivated meat products of all\nkinds and types.\nLeveraging Pluri’s innovative technology, Ever After Foods has rapidly advanced its scalable production platform, developing a business-to-business,\nor B2B, version of its proprietary technology system, Ever After Foods has demonstrated the natural production of muscle and fat tissues for various animal\ncells, ensuring taste, feel, and texture akin to conventional animal-derived meat.\nIn June 2024, we entered into a share purchase agreement by and among Ever After Foods, Tnuva, and certain other international strategic investors,\npursuant to which Ever After Foods issued and sold, ordinary shares in a private placement offering, or the Offering, for aggregate gross proceeds of $10\nmillion. As part of the Offering, we invested $1.25 million. In addition, our wholly owned subsidiary, Pluri Biotech Ltd., and Ever After Foods executed an\nAmended and Restated Technology License Agreement, dated June 12, 2024, or the Amended License. The Amended License amended the parties’ existing\nlicense agreement dated as of February 23, 2022, to expand the scope of the license to include fish and seafood.\nThe $10 million funding round is intended to support Ever After Foods’ B2B technology platform, positioning it as a sustainable technology enabler.\nFollowing the closing of the Offering, the Subsidiary holds approximately 69% of Ever After Foods.\n19\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS – THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,\n2023.\nRevenues\nRevenues for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 were $326,000, as compared to $54,000 for the three-month period ended September\n30, 2023. Revenues for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 were mainly related to services provided to CDMO clients and revenues related to a\nPOC, collaboration with a leading international agriculture corporation in the agtech field. Revenues for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 were\nmainly related to services provided to a CDMO client in the field of process and product development. The increase in revenues is mainly attributed to the\nlaunch of new business verticals, specifically in the CDMO and agtech fields.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 was $126,000. Cost of revenues includes (1) manufacturing costs relates to our\nCDMO and agtech fields, which primary consist of materials, personnel-related and overhead costs, and (2) royalties which we are obligated to pay to the\nEuropean Investment Bank, or EIB, according to the finance agreement, or the EIB Finance Agreement, executed with the EIB by us, Pluri Biotech Ltd. and\nPluristem GmbH in April 2020. We had no cost of revenues for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023.\nResearch and Development Expenses, Net\nR&D expenses, net (costs less participation by the IIA, Horizon Europe and the NIAID) for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024\ndecreased by 3% from $2,993,000 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, to $2,889,000. The decrease is mainly attributed to (1) a decrease in\nsalaries and a related to reduction in head count of 9 R&D employees (90 R&D employees on September 30, 2024, compared to 99 R&D employees on\nSeptember 30, 2023) as a result of our cost reduction and efficiency plans, and (2) an increase in participation grants from the NIAID contract, partially offset\nby (1) an increase in material purchases in accordance with our manufacturing needs and plans, and (2) an increase related to subcontractors activity in NIAID\nand immunotherapy projects.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 increased by 3% from $2,438,000 for the three-month\nperiod ended September 30, 2023 to $2,509,000 mainly due to: (1) an increase in salaries and related expenses due to the reinstatement of the salary of Mr.\nYaky Yanay, our Chief Executive Officer, or CEO (following his salary reduction from January 2023 through December 2023, whereby he waived 75% of his\nsalary and converted it to restricted stock units, or RSUs, and options), (2) an increase in bonus expenses for certain employees, including our CEO and Mrs.\nChen Franco-Yehuda, our former Chief Financial Officer, or CFO, for certain performance-based bonuses as defined in their employment agreement, (3) an\nincrease in share-based compensation expenses related to RSUs and options which were granted during the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 to officers and\nconsultants, and (4) an increase in expenses related to corporate activities, such as investor relations and public relations, partially offset by a decrease in share-\nbased compensation expenses related to RSU expenses amortization over time.\nOther Financial Income (expenses), net\nOther financial income (expenses), net, decreased from $493,000 in financial income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 to\n$621,000 in financial expenses for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024. This decrease is mainly attributed to exchange rate differences expenses\nrelated to the EIB loan following fluctuation between the U.S. dollar against the Euro and from a decrease related to interest on deposits, due to a decrease in\ninterest rates, offset by exchange rates income related to the New Israeli Shekel, or NIS, deposits following the strength of the NIS against the U.S. dollar.\n20\nInterest Expenses\nInterest expenses related to our outstanding loan received from the EIB and all changes during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024\ncompared to the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 are attributable solely to exchange rate differences of the Euro compared to the U.S. dollar.\nNet Loss\nNet loss for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 was $6,036,000 compared to net loss of $5,098,000 for the three-month period ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The increase is mainly due to the increase in financial expenses, net, as well as for the reasons mentioned above, partially offset by an\nincrease in income due to the launch of our new businesses, such as the CDMO and agtech fields. Net loss per share attributed to shareholders for the three-\nmonth period ended September 30, 2024 was $1.08 as compared to $0.96 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. We had net loss attributed to\nour non-controlling interest in Ever After Foods for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 of $154,000.\nFor the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had weighted average common shares outstanding of 5,459,236 and 5,166,471,\nrespectively, which were used in the computations of net loss per share for the three-month period.\nThe increase in weighted average common shares outstanding reflects the issuance of additional shares upon the vesting of RSUs and restricted shares\nissued to directors, employees and consultants.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of September 30, 2024, our total current assets were $27,032,000 and total current liabilities were $4,583,000. On September 30, 2024, we had a\nworking capital surplus of $22,449,000, total equity (deficit) of ($63,000), out of which $5,220,000 is attributed to the non-controlling interest in Ever After\nFoods, and an accumulated deficit of $426,354,000.\nOur cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash as of September 30, 2024 amounted to $3,563,000, compared to $5,548,000 as of September 30,\n2023, and compared to $7,037,000 as of June 30, 2024. Cash balances changed in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months\nended September 30, 2023 for the reasons presented below.\nNet cash used for operating activities was $4,064,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $5,857,000 in the three months\nended September 30, 2023. Cash used in operating activities in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 consisted primarily of payments of fees to\nour suppliers, subcontractors, professional services providers and consultants, and payments of salaries to our employees, partially offset by grants from the IIA,\nthe Horizon Europe program, and funds received from the NIAID contract.\nInvesting activities provided cash of $585,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to cash provided of $5,802,000 for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. The investing activities in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 consisted primarily of\nthe proceeds from withdrawal of short-term deposits, net of $793,000 and $5,905,000, respectively.\nWe had no financing activities in the three months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023.\n21\nOn December 14, 2022, our CEO agreed to forgo, starting January 1, 2023, $375,000 of his annual cash salary for the next twelve months in return for\nequity grants, issuable under our existing equity compensation plans. In that regard, we granted Mr. Yanay (i) 41,853 RSUs, vesting ratably each month, and (ii)\noptions to purchase 41,853 common shares, vesting ratably each month, with a term of 3 years, at an exercise price of $8.96 per share. In addition, the Board of\nDirectors also agreed to grant Mr. Yanay options to purchase 187,500 common shares, with a term of 3 years, with the following terms: (i) options to purchase\n62,500 common shares at an exercise price of $12.48 per share, 50% vesting on June 30, 2023 and 50% vesting on December 31, 2023, (ii) options to purchase\n62,500 common shares at an exercise price of $16.64 per share, 50% vesting on June 30, 2023 and 50% vesting on December 31, 2023, and (iii) options to\npurchase 62,500 common shares at an exercise price of $20.8 per share, 50% vesting on June 30, 2023 and 50% vesting on December 31, 2023. All options\nwere granted in January 2023 and will expire three years from the later of the vesting date or the date which the Company increased its authorized share capital.\nIn April 2020, we and our subsidiaries, Pluri Biotech Ltd. and Pluristem GmbH, executed the EIB Finance Agreement for non-dilutive funding of up to\n€50 million in the aggregate, payable in three tranches. The proceeds from the EIB Finance Agreement were intended to support our R&D in the European\nUnion to further advance our regenerative cell therapy platform, and to bring the products in our pipeline to market. The term of the project was three years\ncommencing on January 1, 2020.\nDuring June 2021, we received the first tranche in the amount of €20 million pursuant to the EIB Finance Agreement. The amount received is due to be\nrepaid on June 1, 2026, and bears annual interest of 4% to be paid together with the principal of the loan. As of September 30, 2024, the interest accrued was in\nthe amount of approximately €2.6 million. In addition to the interest payable, the EIB is also entitled to royalty payments, pro-rated to the amount disbursed\nfrom the EIB loan, on our consolidated revenues beginning in the fiscal year 2024 up to and including its fiscal year 2030, in an amount equal to up to 2.3% of\nour consolidated revenues below $350 million, 1.2% of our consolidated revenues between $350 million and $500 million and 0.2% of our consolidated\nrevenues exceeding $500 million. As the project term ended on December 31, 2022, we do not expect to receive additional funds pursuant to the EIB Finance\nAgreement.\nOn July 11, 2023, we signed a three-year $4.2 million contract with the NIAID, which is part of the NIH. We will collaborate with the U.S.\nDepartment of Defense’s, or DoD’s, AFRRI and USUHS to further advance the development of our PLX-R18 cell therapy as a potential novel treatment for H-\nARS. H-ARS is a deadly disease that can result from nuclear disasters and radiation exposure. The period of performance of this contract will be from July 1,\n2023 through June 30, 2024, with an optional extension for an additional two-year period.\nOn June 6, 2024, the NIAID exercised its option for year two of the three-year $4.2 million contract. During the 12 months period from July 1, 2024\nthrough June 30, 2025, the NIAID will provide us with $1.4 million to manufacture the PLX-R18 cell therapy and to conduct both in vitro and in vivo studies to\ndevelop PLX-R18 as a potential novel treatment for hematopoietic complications of the H-ARS. As of September 30, 2024, we have received from the NIAID\napproximately $1.6 million and as of September 30, 2024 we expect to receive an additional amount of approximately $2.2 million for activities conducted by\nthat date.\nOn February 13, 2024, we entered into a sales agreement, or the Sales Agreement, with A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners, or A.G.P., as agent, pursuant\nto which we may issue and sell our common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to $10 million, from time to time through A.G.P. As of November\n12, 2024, we have sold an aggregate of 42,729 common shares pursuant to the Sales Agreement at an average price of $5.93 per share.\nOn October 28, 2024, we announced that the IIA will fund our collaboration with Bar-Ilan University Research and Development Company Ltd., or\nBIRAD, the commercial arm of the Bar-Ilan University in Israel, to support the continued development of MAIT cells. This collaboration is aimed at advancing\ninnovative allogeneic cell therapies targeting solid tumors and multiple indications. The IIA will fund our collaboration with BIRAD over the next year with\nbudget approved of approximately $148,000 allocated to us, with an option to fund an additional year. The goal of this collaboration is to effectively integrate\nboth technologies and advance to preclinical studies. The program does not include any obligation to pay royalties.\n22\nNon-dilutive grants\nIsrael Innovation Authority (IIA)\nAccording to the IIA grant terms, we are required to pay royalties at a rate of 3% on sales of products and services derived from technology developed\nusing this and other IIA grants until 100% of the dollar-linked grants amount plus interest are repaid. In the absence of such sales, no payment is required.\nThrough September 30, 2024, total grants obtained from the IIA aggregated to approximately $27.7 million and total royalties paid and accrued amounted to\n$179 thousand.\nIn June 2020, we announced that we were selected as a member of the CRISPR-IL consortium, a group funded by the IIA. CRISPR-IL brings together\nthe leading experts in life science and computer science from academia, medicine, and industry, to develop AI based end-to-end genome-editing solutions.\nThese next-generation, multi-species genome editing products for human, plant, and animal DNA, have applications in the pharmaceutical, agriculture, and\naquaculture industries. CRISPR-IL is funded by the IIA with a total budget of approximately $10 million of which, an amount of approximately $480 thousand\nwas a direct grant allocated to us, for the initial period of 18 months. During October 2021, we received an approval for an additional grant of approximately\n$583 thousand from the IIA pursuant to the CRISPR-IL consortium program, for an additional period of eighteen months. During January 2023, we received\napproval for an extension of an additional 2 months to finish the program until June 30, 2023. The CRISPR-IL consortium program does not include any\nobligation to pay royalties.\nThrough September 30, 2024, we received total grants of approximately $1 million in cash from the IIA pursuant to the CRISPR-IL consortium\nprogram, and we do not expect to receive any additional funds.\nEU grants - Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe\nOn September 6, 2022, we announced that a €7.5 million non-dilutive grant from the European Union’s Horizon program was awarded to Advanced\nPeRsOnalized Therapies for Osteoarthritis, or PROTO, an international collaboration led by Charité Berlin Institute of Health Center for Regenerative\nTherapies. The goal of the PROTO project is to utilize our PLX-PAD cells in a Phase I/II study for the treatment of mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis.\nAn amount of approximately Euro 500,000 (approximately $540,000) will be a direct grant that will be allocated to us. Through September 30, 2024,\nwe received a payment of approximately $185,000 in cash, which relates to the PROTO program.\nThe clinical study, once approved by the regulatory agencies, will be carried out by Charité, together with us and other members of the international\nconsortium under the leadership of Professor Tobias Winkler, Principal Investigator, at the Berlin Institute of Health Center of Regenerative Therapies, Julius\nWolff Institute and Center for Musculoskeletal Surgery.\nWe have an effective Form S-3 registration statement (File No. 333-273347), filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, with the SEC using a\n“shelf” registration process. Under this shelf registration process, we may, from time to time, sell our common shares, preferred stock and warrants to purchase\ncommon shares, and of two or more of such securities, in one or more offerings for an aggregate initial offering price of $200 million (including amounts sold\nunder the Sales Agreement).\nThe currency of our financial portfolio is mainly in U.S. dollars and we use options contracts and other financial instruments in order to hedge our\nexposures to currencies other than the U.S. dollar. For more information, please see Item 7A. - “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” in\nthe 2024 Annual Report.\nOutlook\nWe have accumulated a deficit of $426,354,000 since our inception in May 2001. We do not expect to generate any significant revenues from sales of\nproducts in the next twelve months. We expect to generate revenues from the sale of services in our CDMO activity, from collaboration based on our cell-based\nproducts, and from licenses to use our technology and products. Although we were able to reduce the burn rate significantly in the last few years, it is unlikely\nthat in the short-term revenues will exceed our costs of operations.\n23\nWe may be required to obtain additional liquidity resources in order to support the commercialization of our products and technology and maintain our\nR&D activities.\nWe are continually looking for sources of funding, including collaboration with other companies via licensing agreements, joint ventures and\npartnerships, and other non-dilutive sources such as our contract with NIAID and DoD, research grants such as the IIA grants and the European Union grants,\nand sales of our common shares.\nWe believe that we have sufficient cash to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures - We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures that are designed for the purposes of\nensuring that information required to be disclosed in our SEC reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the\nSEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and our CFO, as appropriate to\nallow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\nAs of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our CEO and our\nCFO, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based on\nthat evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting - There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the first\nquarter of fiscal year 2025 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n24\nPART II – OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1A. Risk Factors.\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed below and in Part I, “Item 1A. Risk\nFactors” of our 2024 Annual Report, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results.\nOur principal research, development and manufacturing facilities are located in Haifa, Israel and the escalated military conditions of Israel may cause\ninterruption or suspension of our business operations without warning.\nOur principal R&D and manufacturing facilities are located in Haifa, Israel. Due to the ongoing armed conflict between Israel and Hamas, Hezbollah\nin Lebanon, Iran and other Arab terrorists’ groups, there is a high possibility risk that it will turn into a greater regional conflict in the near future.\nMost recently, the war has escalated and expanded further from the Northern border of Israel with Lebanon. Consequently, there has been a major\nincrease in the amount and frequency of the attacks on Israel, and on Haifa in particular.\nAccording to the recent guidelines of the Israeli government, the Company’s offices in Haifa are open and functioning, however, if the war will\nescalate and expand even further, the Israeli government may impose additional restrictions on movement and travel, which will affect our management and\nemployees’ ability to effectively perform their daily tasks, and may result in disruptions and delays in some of our projects.\nAny hostilities involving Israel, terrorist activities, political instability or violence in the region, or the interruption or curtailment of trade or transport\nbetween Israel and its trading partners could make it more difficult for us to raise capital, if needed in the future, and adversely affect our operations and results\nof operations and the market price of our common shares. In addition, to the extent the IIA no longer makes grants similar to those we have received in the past,\nit could adversely affect our financial results.\nFurthermore, certain of our employees may be obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the Israel Defense Forces and are subject to being called up\nfor active military duty at any time. Many Israeli citizens who have served in the army are required to perform reserve duty until they reach the age of 40 or\nolder, depending upon the nature of their military service. Currently, three of our employees have been called up for active military duty.\nThe intensity and duration of Israel’s current war is difficult to predict, as are such war’s economic implications on the Company’s business and\noperations and on Israel’s economy in general. These events may be intertwined with wider macroeconomic indications of a deterioration of Israel’s economic\nstanding, for instance, a downgrade in Israel’s credit rating by rating agencies, which may have a material adverse effect on the Company and its ability to\neffectively conduct its operations.\nIn addition, Israeli-based companies and companies doing business with Israel, have been the subject of an economic boycott by members of the Arab\nLeague and certain other predominantly Muslim countries since Israel’s establishment. Although Israel has entered into various agreements with certain Arab\ncountries and the Palestinian Authority, and various declarations have been signed in connection with efforts to resolve some of the economic and political\nproblems in the Middle East, we cannot predict whether or in what manner these problems will be resolved. Wars and acts of terrorism have resulted in\nsignificant damage to the Israeli economy, including reducing the level of foreign and local investment.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, we issued an aggregate of 7,067 restricted common shares to certain of our service providers as\ncompensation in lieu of cash compensation owed to them for services rendered.\nWe claimed exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, for the foregoing transactions under\nSection 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.\n25\nItem 6. Exhibits.\n3.1 Composite Copy of the Company’s Articles of Incorporation as amended on March 27, 2024 (incorporated by reference to Exhibit 3.3 of our\nquarterly report on Form 10-Q filed on May 9, 2024).\n3.2 Amended and Restated By-Laws amended on September 10,2020 (incorporated by reference to Exhibit 3.3 of our annual report on Form 10-K\nfiled on September 10, 2020).

Statements on this Website regarding Pluri’s business which are not historical facts are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and federal securities laws, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements can be identified by, among other things, the use of forward-looking language, such as “anticipate”, “believe”, “could”, “estimate”, “expect”, “future”, “intend”, “plan”, “potential”, and may describe opinions about future events. These forward-looking statements are based on the current expectations of the management of Pluri only, and are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements: changes in technology and market requirements; we may encounter delays or obstacles in launching our clinical trials; our technology may not be validated as we progress further and our methods may not be accepted by the scientific community; we may be unable to retain or attract key employees whose knowledge is essential to the development of our products; unforeseen scientific difficulties may develop with our progress; our products may wind up being more expensive than we anticipate; results in the laboratory may not translate to equally good results in real surgical settings; our patents may not be sufficient; our products may harm recipients; changes in legislation; inability to timely develop and introduce new technologies, products and applications; loss of market share and pressure on pricing resulting from competition, which could cause the actual results or performance of Pluri to differ materially from those contemplated in such forward-looking statements. For a more detailed description of the risks and uncertainties affecting Pluri, reference is made to Pluri’s reports filed from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Pluri disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Statements on this Website regarding Pluri’s business which are not historical facts are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and federal securities laws, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements can be identified by, among other things, the use of forward-looking language, such as “anticipate”, “believe”, “could”, “estimate”, “expect”, “future”, “intend”, “plan”, “potential”, and may describe opinions about future events. These forward-looking statements are based on the current expectations of the management of Pluri only, and are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements: changes in technology and market requirements; we may encounter delays or obstacles in launching our clinical trials; our technology may not be validated as we progress further and our methods may not be accepted by the scientific community; we may be unable to retain or attract key employees whose knowledge is essential to the development of our products; unforeseen scientific difficulties may develop with our progress; our products may wind up being more expensive than we anticipate; results in the laboratory may not translate to equally good results in real surgical settings; our patents may not be sufficient; our products may harm recipients; changes in legislation; inability to timely develop and introduce new technologies, products and applications; loss of market share and pressure on pricing resulting from competition, which could cause the actual results or performance of Pluri to differ materially from those contemplated in such forward-looking statements. For a more detailed description of the risks and uncertainties affecting Pluri, reference is made to Pluri’s reports filed from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Pluri disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Statements on this Website regarding Pluri’s business which are not historical facts are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and federal securities laws, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements can be identified by, among other things, the use of forward-looking language, such as “anticipate”, “believe”, “could”, “estimate”, “expect”, “future”, “intend”, “plan”, “potential”, and may describe opinions about future events. These forward-looking statements are based on the current expectations of the management of Pluri only, and are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements: changes in technology and market requirements; we may encounter delays or obstacles in launching our clinical trials; our technology may not be validated as we progress further and our methods may not be accepted by the scientific community; we may be unable to retain or attract key employees whose knowledge is essential to the development of our products; unforeseen scientific difficulties may develop with our progress; our products may wind up being more expensive than we anticipate; results in the laboratory may not translate to equally good results in real surgical settings; our patents may not be sufficient; our products may harm recipients; changes in legislation; inability to timely develop and introduce new technologies, products and applications; loss of market share and pressure on pricing resulting from competition, which could cause the actual results or performance of Pluri to differ materially from those contemplated in such forward-looking statements.

Statements on this Website regarding Pluri’s business which are not historical facts are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and federal securities laws, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements can be identified by, among other things, the use of forward-looking language, such as “anticipate”, “believe”, “could”, “estimate”, “expect”, “future”, “intend”, “plan”, “potential”, and may describe opinions about future events. These forward-looking statements are based on the current expectations of the management of Pluri only, and are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.

For a more detailed description of the risks and uncertainties affecting Pluri, reference is made to Pluri’s reports filed from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Pluri disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

They heal. They build.\nThey represent pure potential for individuals and our planet. Harnessing the power of cells can unlock new hope for some\nof the world’s most persistent health challenges, create more ethical sources of critical materials for the food industry and\nbiological products without harming animals in the process, and even potentially change the way we produce agricultural\nproducts, using plant cell culture to ensure a more sustainable, resilient long-term supply.\nThey also represent a tremendous market opportunity. For example, the cultivated food industry alone is projected to grow into\na $140 billion market by 20301. These cell-based products have the potential to dramatically reduce the environmental impact\nof food production and transform manufacturing for different industries using sustainable animal or plant cell production.\nPluri is at the forefront of this extraordinary new world.\nOur state-of-the-art, proprietary bioreactor system – developed over many years during our work in regenerative medicine –\nprovides a 3D micro-environment for cells, resembling their natural environment.\nOur advanced manufacturing technology is tightly controlled, completely automated, efficient and scalable. It can generate\nhigh-quality cell products on a mass scale with batch-to-batch consistency, whether these cells derive from humans, plants or\nanimals.

Due to their nature,\nthese cells have no need for genetic matching – a huge advantage in cell therapy.\nToday, we have perfected our manufacturing process to develop next generation products for a variety\nof industries including pharmaceuticals, food-tech, biologics, agri-tech and beyond.\nOur Unique 3D Cell Expansion Technology and In-House Manufacturing Facility\nOur proprietary bioreactor system provides a 3D micro-environment for cells that mimics the cell’s natural\ngrowth environments. This method provides cells with the perfect environment in order for them to expand\nrapidly and remain viable as we transform them into innovative products and solutions. We also own a\nstate-of-the-art in-house Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) manufacturing facility which enables the\nproduction of high-quality cell-based products.\nPluriMatrix: A Breakthrough System for Unprecedented Industrial-Scale\nProduction of Cell-Based Products\nPluriMatrix enables industrial-scale production of cell-based products by using a packed-bed system design\nin which cells expand as tissue on scaffolds, increasing surface area and providing a uniquely effective\ngrowth environment. Cells can either be harvested as single cells or used along with the scaffolds as a\ncompleted tissue. The system also enables the simultaneous expansion of various cell types within the\nsame platform, giving each cell type its own growth space.\nPluriMatrix’s state-of-the-art cell production system enables mass-scale cell manufacturing while\nminimizing the size requirements of the manufacturing facility compared to existing methods – significantly\nreducing both cost and ecological impact.\nPluri Tech At-A-Glance\n• Patented, proprietary 3D cell expansion technology to • Proven batch-to-batch consistency\nproduce high-quality cells in mass quantities\n• Manufacturing process approved by key regulators:\n• Scalable, automated, efficient, reliable and fully controlled\n• Cost-effective, consistent and validated\n• Suitable for multiple cell sources: human, animal and plant\n• Robust in-house GMP manufacturing facility\nTECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS | 8\nBETTER HEALTH\nOUTCOMES FOR FUTURE\nGENERATIONS\nPopulations are getting older\n2019:\n1 in 11 1 in 6\npeople people\nover the age of 65 over the age of 65\nPercentage Change in the World’s\nPopulation by Age: 2010-2050\n0-64\nBETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS | 10\nspuorG\negA\nBETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR\nFUTURE GENERATIONS\nMeeting the Needs of an Aging Population\nPluri’s work in cell-based therapies and pharmaceuticals will help meet the critical need for more efficient\nhealth care to serve an aging global population.
