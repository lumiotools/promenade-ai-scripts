The Company now expects revenue in the range of $2.72 billion to $2.73 billion for the full year of 2024, representing revenue growth of approximately 11% year-over-year at the midpoint of the range. The Company expects revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024 in the range of $693 million to $703 million, representing revenue growth of approximately 9% year-over-year at the midpoint of the range.\n\n“We now expect adjusted EBITDA for the full year of 2024 in the range of $205 million to $215 million, an increase of 5% at the midpoint of the range from our previous guidance. For the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $76 million to $86 million.”\n\nThe Company expects full year 2024 non-GAAP net income per diluted share in a range of $0.67 to $0.69 based on 408 million shares. For the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company expects non-GAAP net income per diluted share in a range of $0.21 to $0.23 based on 408 million shares. These ranges include an estimated non-GAAP tax rate of 26% for the full year and the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nThe preceding forward-looking statements reflect CoStar Group’s expectations as of October 22, 2024, including forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures on a consolidated basis, based on current estimates, expectations, observations, and trends. Given the risk factors, rapidly evolving economic environment, and uncertainties and assumptions discussed in this release and in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and annual reports on Form 10-K, actual results may differ materially. Other than in publicly available statements, the Company does not intend to update its forward-looking statements until its next quarterly results announcement.\n\nReconciliations of EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP net income per diluted share to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are shown in detail below, along with definitions for those terms. A reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net income, can be found within the tables included in this release.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nFor information regarding the purpose for which management uses the non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this release and why management believes they provide useful information to investors regarding the Company’s financial condition and results of operations, please refer to the Company’s latest periodic report.\n\nEBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents GAAP net income attributable to CoStar Group before interest income or expense, net and other income or expense, net; loss on debt extinguishment; income taxes and depreciation and amortization expense.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents EBITDA before stock-based compensation expense, acquisition- and integration-related costs, restructuring costs, and settlements and impairments incurred outside the Company’s ordinary course of business. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents adjusted EBITDA divided by revenues for the period.\n\nNon-GAAP net income is a non-GAAP financial measure determined by adjusting GAAP net income attributable to CoStar Group for stock-based compensation expense, acquisition- and integration-related costs, restructuring costs, settlement and impairment costs incurred outside the Company's ordinary course of business and loss on debt extinguishment, as well as amortization of acquired intangible assets and other related costs, and then subtracting an assumed provision for income taxes. In 2024, the Company is assuming a 26% tax rate in order to approximate its statutory corporate tax rate excluding the impact of discrete items.\n\nNon-GAAP net income per diluted share is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents non-GAAP net income divided by the number of diluted shares outstanding for the period used in the calculation of GAAP net income per diluted share. For periods with GAAP net losses and non-GAAP net income, the weighted average outstanding shares used to calculate non-GAAP net income per share includes potentially dilutive securities that were excluded from the calculation of GAAP net income per share as the effect was anti-dilutive.\n\n**Operating Metrics**\n\nNet new bookings is calculated based on the annualized amount of change in the Company's sales bookings resulting from new subscription-based contracts, changes to existing subscription-based contracts and cancellations of subscription-based contracts for the period reported. Information regarding net new bookings is not comparable to, nor should it be substituted for, an analysis of the Company's revenues over time.\n\n**Earnings Conference Call**\n\nManagement will conduct a conference call to discuss the third quarter 2024 results and the Company’s outlook at 5:00 PM ET on Tuesday, October 22, 2024. A live audio webcast of the conference will be available in listen-only mode through the Investors section of the CoStar Group website: [https://investors.costargroup.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.costargroup.com&esheet=54140425&newsitemid=20241022146746&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.costargroup.com&index=1&md5=8094cde4bd41de9eb529f1fdb4d9304f).
