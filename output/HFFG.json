(NASDAQ: HFFG) (“HF Foods” or the “Company”), a leading food distributor to Asian restaurants across the United States, reported its unaudited financial results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * Net revenue increased 6.0% to $298.4 million compared to $281.5 million in the prior year.\n  * Gross profit decreased 1.5% to $50.2 million compared to $50.9 million in the prior year. Gross profit margin decreased to 16.8% from 18.1% in the prior year.\n  * Net loss of $3.8 million compared to net income of $2.0 million in the prior year.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA decreased 17.7% to $8.3 million compared to $10.1 million in the prior year.\n\n\n\n**Nine Months 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * Net revenue increased 3.3% to $896.4 million compared to $867.6 million in the prior year.\n  * Gross profit increased 0.8% to $153.0 million compared to $151.8 million in the prior year. Gross profit margin decreased to 17.1% from 17.5% in the prior year.\n  * Net loss improved to $4.2 million compared to $5.4 million in the prior year.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA increased 13.9% to $27.6 million compared to $24.2 million in the prior year.\n\n\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n“We are making meaningful progress on our comprehensive transformation plan, which positions HF Foods to capture the significant growth opportunities in the Asian foodservice market,” said Felix Lin, Interim Chief Executive Officer, President, and Chief Operating Officer. “Our strategic investments in facility upgrades and supply chain enhancements are addressing capacity constraints while building the foundation for sustained growth. 2025 will be a year focused on strengthening our operational infrastructure and digital capabilities, and we remain committed to driving margin improvement through targeted efficiency initiatives. The strong loyalty of our customers, combined with favorable demographic trends driving increased demand for Asian cuisine, reinforces our confidence in our market position. With our exceptional leadership team and best-in-class network of general managers, suppliers, and customers, we remain confident that we are well-positioned to create long-term value for our stakeholders.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024****Results**\n\nNet revenue was $298.4 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $281.5 million in the prior year period, an increase of $16.9 million, or 6.0%. The increase was primarily attributable to product cost inflation, volume increases and improved pricing in certain categories, such as chicken and seafood. The increase was partially offset by deflation in commodities, such as cooking oils, and the $2.7 million loss in revenue resulting from the exit of the Company’s chicken processing businesses in 2023.\n\nGross profit was $50.2 million compared to $50.9 million in the prior year period, a decrease of $0.8 million, or 1.5%. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in margins on meat and poultry and also caused by an increase in our wholesale mix during the quarter. Gross profit margin decreased to 16.8% from 18.1% in the prior year period.\n\nDistribution, selling and administrative expenses increased by $0.8 million to $49.7 million, primarily due to increases of $1.0 million each in both auto expenses and insurance costs, partially offset by a decrease of $1.6 million in professional fees. Distribution, selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased to 16.6% from 17.4% in the prior year period primarily due to increased net revenue and lower professional fees, partially offset by increased rental and insurance costs.\n\nNet loss of $3.8 million was realized in the third quarter compared to net income of $2.0 million in the prior year period. The decrease in income was primarily driven by a non-cash expense related to the change in fair value of interest rate swap contracts of $5.3 million and increases of $1.0 million each in both auto expenses and insurance costs partially offset by the income tax benefit of $1.2 million.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased $1.8 million to $8.3 million compared to $10.1 million in the prior year, which was primarily due to the decrease in income from operations of $1.6 million. \n\n**Nine Months 2024****Results**\n\nNet revenue was $896.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $867.6 million in the prior year, an increase of $28.8 million, or 3.3%. The increase was primarily attributable to product cost inflation and improved pricing in certain categories, partially offset by the $13.3 million loss in revenue resulting from the exit of the Company’s chicken processing businesses in 2023.\n\nGross profit was $153.0 million compared to $151.8 million in the prior year period, an increase of $1.3 million, or 0.8%. The increase was primarily attributable to increased net revenue, partially offset by increased costs. Gross profit margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to 17.1% compared to 17.5% in the same period in 2023.\n\nDistribution, selling and administrative expenses decreased by $4.0 million to $150.0 million, primarily due to a decrease in professional fees of $10.0 million, partially offset by an increase of $3.6 million in payroll and related labor costs and an increase of $2.0 million in insurance costs. Distribution, selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased to 16.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 17.8% in the same period in 2023, primarily due to lower professional fees and increased net revenue, partially offset by increased payroll and related labor costs and insurance costs.\n\nNet loss of $4.2 million was realized compared to a net loss of $5.4 million in the prior year. The improvement was primarily driven by the increase in our income from operations of $5.3 million and the $5.2 million reversal of the lease guarantee liability. The improvement was partially offset by the SEC settlement of $3.9 million, the increase in income tax expense of $2.2 million and the loss of $3.1 million resulting from the change in fair value of interest rate swap contracts.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $3.4 million to $27.6 million compared to $24.2 million in the prior year, which was primarily due to the increase in income from operations.\n\n**Cash Flow and Liquidity**\n\nCash used in operating activities was $3.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to cash provided by operating activities of $20.6 million in the prior year. The decrease in cash flow from operating activities was primarily due to the timing of working capital outlays and the $3.9 million SEC settlement payment. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had a cash balance of $11.4 million and access to approximately $27.3 million in additional funds through its $100.0 million line of credit, subject to a borrowing base calculation.\n\n**Earnings Call and Webcast**\n\nA pre-recorded call and webcast with HF Foods’ management team discussing the results is now available on the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at https://investors.hffoodsgroup.com/.\n\n**About HF Foods Group Inc.**\n\nHF Foods Group Inc. is a leading marketer and distributor of fresh produce, frozen and dry food, and non-food products to primarily Asian restaurants and other foodservice customers throughout the United States.

We have attempted to identify any forward-looking statements by using words such as “aims,” “continues,” “expects,” “plans,” “will,” and other similar expressions. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in all of our forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Such statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the Company’s actual results, events or financial positions to differ materially from those included within or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, risks relating to our ability to consummate our operational transformation plan as anticipated, risks relating to the impact of our operational plan on our sales and efficiencies, risks relating to the impact of demographic trends on demand for the products we distribute, statements of assumption underlying any of the foregoing, and other factors including those disclosed under the caption “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and other filings with the SEC. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to disclose any revision to these forward-looking statements.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nDiscussion of our results includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to HF Foods Group Inc., that we believe provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial performance with other companies in the same industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. The definitions of EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to HF Foods Group Inc. may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies in the industry. EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to HF Foods Group Inc. are not defined under GAAP and are subject to important limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP.\n\nWe use non-GAAP financial measures to supplement our GAAP financial results. Management uses EBITDA, defined as net income (loss) before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization to measure operating performance. In addition, management uses Adjusted EBITDA, defined as net income (loss) before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization, further adjusted to exclude certain unusual, non-cash, or non-recurring expenses. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is less susceptible to variances in actual performance resulting from non-recurring expenses, and other non-cash charges, provides useful information for our investors and is more reflective of other factors that affect our operating performance.\n\nWe believe non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to HF Foods Group Inc. is a useful measure of operating performance because it excludes certain items not reflective of our core operating performance. Non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to HF Foods Group Inc. is defined as net income (loss) attributable to HF Foods Group Inc. adjusted for amortization of intangibles, change in fair value of interest rate swaps, stock based compensation, transaction related costs, transformational project costs and certain unusual, non-cash, or non-recurring expenses. We believe that non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to HF Foods Group Inc. facilitates period-over-period comparisons and provides additional clarity for investors to better evaluate our operating results. We present EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to HF Foods Group Inc. in order to provide supplemental information that we consider relevant for the readers of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in its reports filed with the SEC, including its current Quarterly Report on Form 10Q, and such information is not meant to replace or supersede U.S. GAAP measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the schedules attached to this press release.\n\n**HF FOODS GROUP INC.

Mr. Lin assumes the role of CEO, in addition to his current roles of President and Chief Operating Officer (COO). Mr. Lin replaces HF Foods’ previous CEO, Peter Zhang. The leadership transition is not due to any disagreement with Mr. Zhang regarding the Company’s financial reporting, policies or practices. Mr. Zhang remains on the Board of Directors.\n\nWith extensive experience in operational management and financial strategy, Mr. Lin has been a pivotal leader at HF Foods for the past five years, contributing significantly through his roles on both the management team and the Board of Directors. In addition to his current roles of President and COO, he was previously a member of the Board of Directors and has served as Interim Chief Financial Officer. His contributions have been key in executing the Company’s transformation plan.\n\n“Felix has been instrumental in shaping HF Foods’ strategic direction and operational execution as a core member of our executive team,” said Charlotte Westfall, HF Foods’ Lead Independent Director. “He has been a key decision-maker here at HF Foods, having already guided many of our most significant initiatives. Felix’s depth and breadth of experience, combined with his intimate knowledge of the business, will help lead the Company as Interim CEO during this critical time.”\n\nPrior to HF Foods, Mr. Lin served as Vice President for Blue Bird Corporation, a leading school bus manufacturer in North America, where he oversaw human resources, corporate and operations training, government relations, compliance and strategy. Earlier in his career, Mr. Lin held leadership roles in Finance, Manufacturing Operations, Supply Chain and worked as a key member of the China and Middle East business development team for Blue Bird Corporation under Cerberus Capital Management, LLP. He served as an Independent Board Member for HF Foods from November 2019 to April 2022, where he served as Chairman of the Audit Committee and the Special Investigation Committee.\n\n“I am grateful to the Board for this opportunity, and am excited to continue to build upon our strong foundation alongside our exceptional leadership team,” Mr. Lin said. “The relationships we’ve built with our best-in-class general managers, suppliers and customers have been central to our success, and they will remain crucial as we fortify our industry-leading position and capabilities. Through our continued focus on our transformation plan, we look forward to driving long-term value for all our stakeholders.”\n\n**About HF Foods Group Inc.** HF Foods Group Inc. is a leading marketer and distributor of fresh produce, frozen and dry food, and non-food products to primarily Asian restaurants and other foodservice customers throughout the United States.

(NASDAQ: HFFG) (“HF Foods” or the “Company”), a leading food distributor to Asian restaurants across the United States, reported its unaudited financial results for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2024.\n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * Net revenue increased 3.4% to $302.3 million compared to $292.3 million in the prior year.\n  * Gross profit increased 3.6% to $52.5 million compared to $50.7 million in the prior year. Gross profit margin increased to 17.4% from 17.3% in the prior year.\n  * Net income (loss) improved to net income of $0.2 million compared to net loss of $1.6 million in the prior year.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA increased 26.4% to $10.6 million compared to $8.4 million in the prior year.\n\n\n\n**Six Months 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * Net revenue increased 2.0% to $598.0 million compared to $586.2 million in the prior year.\n  * Gross profit increased 2.0% to $102.9 million compared to $100.8 million in the prior year. Gross profit margin of 17.2% was flat compared to the prior year.\n  * Net loss improved to $0.3 million compared to $7.4 million in the prior year.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA increased 36.6% to $19.3 million compared to $14.1 million in the prior year.\n\n\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n“We are excited to report our second quarter results, in which we delivered improvements on all our key financial metrics,” said Peter Zhang, Chief Executive Officer of HF Foods. “We believe this is the result of the progress made through our operational transformation plan. For example, we recently restored a cross dock operation in our Northern California market which has enabled us to better serve our customers in the area. In addition, we launched our modern ERP solution at one distribution center, and expect the rest of our scheduled ERP implementation to be completed by the end of the year. We are extremely pleased to have settled the legacy SEC matter related to former HF Foods executives, in which the SEC credited the Company’s collaboration efforts throughout the matter. The management team and our board are fully aligned and excited about what the future holds. Our team’s remarkable execution of our transformation initiative, combined with the strong loyalty of our customers, reinforces our confidence that we are uniquely positioned to benefit from the growing Asian foodservice market in both the near and long term.”\n\n**Second Quarter 2024****Results**\n\nNet revenue was $302.3 million for the second quarter of 2024 compared to $292.3 million in the prior year period, an increase of $10.0 million, or 3.4%. The increase was primarily attributable to product cost inflation, volume increases and improved pricing in certain categories, such as chicken and seafood, partially offset by deflation in commodities, such as cooking oils, and the $3.1 million loss in revenue resulting from the exit of the Company’s chicken processing businesses in 2023.\n\nGross profit was $52.5 million compared to $50.7 million in the prior year period, an increase of $1.8 million, or 3.6%. The increase was primarily attributable to increased net revenue. Gross profit margin increased to 17.4% from 17.3% in the prior year period.\n\nDistribution, selling and administrative expenses decreased by $2.4 million to $49.8 million, primarily due to a decrease of $5.5 million in professional fees, partially offset by higher payroll and related labor costs. Distribution, selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased to 16.5% from 17.9% in the prior year period primarily attributable to increased net revenue and lower professional fees, partially offset by payroll and related labor costs from increased headcount to support growth.\n\nNet income (loss) improved to net income of $0.2 million compared to net loss of $1.6 million in the prior year period. The improvement was primarily driven by an increase in our income from operations of $4.2 million and the $5.3 million reversal of the lease guarantee liability, partially offset by the SEC settlement of $3.9 million, the decrease of the gain related to the fair value of interest rate swap contracts of $2.5 million and the increase of income tax expense of $1.4 million.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $2.2 million to $10.6 million compared to $8.4 million in the prior year, which was primarily due to the increase in income from operations.\n\n**Six Months 2024****Results**\n\nNet revenue was $598.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to $586.2 million in the prior year, an increase of $11.8 million, or 2.0%. The increase was primarily attributable to product cost inflation and improved pricing in certain categories, partially offset by the $5.8 million loss in revenue resulting from the exit of the Company’s chicken processing businesses in 2023.\n\nGross profit was $102.9 million compared to $100.8 million in the prior year period, an increase of $2.1 million, or 2.0%. The increase was primarily attributable to increased net revenue. Gross profit margin of 17.2% was flat compared to the prior year period.\n\nDistribution, selling and administrative expenses decreased by $4.8 million to $100.3 million, primarily due to a decrease in professional fees of $8.4 million, partially offset by higher payroll and related labor costs. Distribution, selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased to 16.8% compared to 17.9% in the prior year period, primarily due to lower professional fees and increased net revenue, partially offset by payroll and related labor costs from increased headcount to support growth.\n\nNet loss decreased to $0.3 million compared to a net loss of $7.4 million in the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by an increase in income from operations of $6.9 million, the $5.3 million reversal of the lease guarantee liability and the increase of the gain related to the fair value of interest rate swap contracts of $2.2 million, partially offset by the SEC settlement of $3.9 million and the increase of income tax expense of $3.4 million.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $5.2 million to $19.3 million compared to $14.1 million in the prior year, which was primarily due to the increase in income from operations.\n\n**Cash Flow and Liquidity**\n\nCash flow from operating activities decreased to $0.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $8.7 million in the prior year. The decrease in cash flow from operating activities was primarily due to the timing of working capital outlays and the $3.9 million SEC settlement payment. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had a cash balance of $14.0 million and access to approximately $29.9 million in additional funds through its $100.0 million line of credit, subject to a borrowing base calculation.\n\n**Earnings Call and Webcast**\n\nA pre-recorded call and webcast with HF Foods’ management team discussing the results is now available on the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at https://investors.hffoodsgroup.com/.\n\n**About HF Foods Group Inc.**\n\nHF Foods Group Inc. is a leading marketer and distributor of fresh produce, frozen and dry food, and non-food products to primarily Asian restaurants and other foodservice customers throughout the United States.

We have attempted to identify any forward-looking statements by using words such as “aims,” “continues,” “expects,” “plans,” “will,” and other similar expressions. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in all of our forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Such statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the Company’s actual results, events or financial positions to differ materially from those included within or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, risks relating to our ability to consummate our operational transformation plan as anticipated, risks relating to the impact of our operational plan on our sales and efficiencies, statements of assumption underlying any of the foregoing, and other factors including those disclosed under the caption “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and other filings with the SEC. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to disclose any revision to these forward-looking statements.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nDiscussion of our results includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to HF Foods Group Inc., that we believe provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial performance with other companies in the same industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. The definitions of EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to HF Foods Group Inc. may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies in the industry. EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to HF Foods Group Inc. are not defined under GAAP and are subject to important limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP.\n\nWe use non-GAAP financial measures to supplement our GAAP financial results. Management uses EBITDA, defined as net income (loss) before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization to measure operating performance. In addition, management uses Adjusted EBITDA, defined as net income (loss) before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization, further adjusted to exclude certain unusual, non-cash, or non-recurring expenses. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is less susceptible to variances in actual performance resulting from non-recurring expenses, and other non-cash charges, provides useful information for our investors and is more reflective of other factors that affect our operating performance.\n\nWe believe non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to HF Foods Group Inc. is a useful measure of operating performance because it excludes certain items not reflective of our core operating performance. Non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to HF Foods Group Inc. is defined as net income (loss) attributable to HF Foods Group Inc. adjusted for amortization of intangibles, change in fair value of interest rate swaps, stock based compensation, transaction related costs, transformational project costs and certain unusual, non-cash, or non-recurring expenses. We believe that non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to HF Foods Group Inc. facilitates period-over-period comparisons and provides additional clarity for investors to better evaluate our operating results. We present EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to HF Foods Group Inc. in order to provide supplemental information that we consider relevant for the readers of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in its reports filed with the SEC, including its current Quarterly Report on Form 10Q, and such information is not meant to replace or supersede U.S. GAAP measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the schedules attached to this press release.\n\n**HF FOODS GROUP INC.

(NASDAQ: HFFG) (“HF Foods” or the “Company”), a leading food distributor to Asian restaurants across the United States, reported its unaudited financial results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * Net revenue increased 6.0% to $298.4 million compared to $281.5 million in the prior year.\n  * Gross profit decreased 1.5% to $50.2 million compared to $50.9 million in the prior year. Gross profit margin decreased to 16.8% from 18.1% in the prior year.\n  * Net loss of $3.8 million compared to net income of $2.0 million in the prior year.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA decreased 17.7% to $8.3 million compared to $10.1 million in the prior year.\n\n\n\n**Nine Months 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * Net revenue increased 3.3% to $896.4 million compared to $867.6 million in the prior year.\n  * Gross profit increased 0.8% to $153.0 million compared to $151.8 million in the prior year. Gross profit margin decreased to 17.1% from 17.5% in the prior year.\n  * Net loss improved to $4.2 million compared to $5.4 million in the prior year.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA increased 13.9% to $27.6 million compared to $24.2 million in the prior year.\n\n\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n“We are making meaningful progress on our comprehensive transformation plan, which positions HF Foods to capture the significant growth opportunities in the Asian foodservice market,” said Felix Lin, Interim Chief Executive Officer, President, and Chief Operating Officer. “Our strategic investments in facility upgrades and supply chain enhancements are addressing capacity constraints while building the foundation for sustained growth. 2025 will be a year focused on strengthening our operational infrastructure and digital capabilities, and we remain committed to driving margin improvement through targeted efficiency initiatives. The strong loyalty of our customers, combined with favorable demographic trends driving increased demand for Asian cuisine, reinforces our confidence in our market position. With our exceptional leadership team and best-in-class network of general managers, suppliers, and customers, we remain confident that we are well-positioned to create long-term value for our stakeholders.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024****Results**\n\nNet revenue was $298.4 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $281.5 million in the prior year period, an increase of $16.9 million, or 6.0%. The increase was primarily attributable to product cost inflation, volume increases and improved pricing in certain categories, such as chicken and seafood. The increase was partially offset by deflation in commodities, such as cooking oils, and the $2.7 million loss in revenue resulting from the exit of the Company’s chicken processing businesses in 2023.\n\nGross profit was $50.2 million compared to $50.9 million in the prior year period, a decrease of $0.8 million, or 1.5%. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in margins on meat and poultry and also caused by an increase in our wholesale mix during the quarter. Gross profit margin decreased to 16.8% from 18.1% in the prior year period.\n\nDistribution, selling and administrative expenses increased by $0.8 million to $49.7 million, primarily due to increases of $1.0 million each in both auto expenses and insurance costs, partially offset by a decrease of $1.6 million in professional fees. Distribution, selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased to 16.6% from 17.4% in the prior year period primarily due to increased net revenue and lower professional fees, partially offset by increased rental and insurance costs.\n\nNet loss of $3.8 million was realized in the third quarter compared to net income of $2.0 million in the prior year period. The decrease in income was primarily driven by a non-cash expense related to the change in fair value of interest rate swap contracts of $5.3 million and increases of $1.0 million each in both auto expenses and insurance costs partially offset by the income tax benefit of $1.2 million.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased $1.8 million to $8.3 million compared to $10.1 million in the prior year, which was primarily due to the decrease in income from operations of $1.6 million. \n\n**Nine Months 2024****Results**\n\nNet revenue was $896.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $867.6 million in the prior year, an increase of $28.8 million, or 3.3%. The increase was primarily attributable to product cost inflation and improved pricing in certain categories, partially offset by the $13.3 million loss in revenue resulting from the exit of the Company’s chicken processing businesses in 2023.\n\nGross profit was $153.0 million compared to $151.8 million in the prior year period, an increase of $1.3 million, or 0.8%. The increase was primarily attributable to increased net revenue, partially offset by increased costs. Gross profit margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to 17.1% compared to 17.5% in the same period in 2023.\n\nDistribution, selling and administrative expenses decreased by $4.0 million to $150.0 million, primarily due to a decrease in professional fees of $10.0 million, partially offset by an increase of $3.6 million in payroll and related labor costs and an increase of $2.0 million in insurance costs. Distribution, selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased to 16.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 17.8% in the same period in 2023, primarily due to lower professional fees and increased net revenue, partially offset by increased payroll and related labor costs and insurance costs.\n\nNet loss of $4.2 million was realized compared to a net loss of $5.4 million in the prior year. The improvement was primarily driven by the increase in our income from operations of $5.3 million and the $5.2 million reversal of the lease guarantee liability. The improvement was partially offset by the SEC settlement of $3.9 million, the increase in income tax expense of $2.2 million and the loss of $3.1 million resulting from the change in fair value of interest rate swap contracts.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $3.4 million to $27.6 million compared to $24.2 million in the prior year, which was primarily due to the increase in income from operations.\n\n**Cash Flow and Liquidity**\n\nCash used in operating activities was $3.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to cash provided by operating activities of $20.6 million in the prior year. The decrease in cash flow from operating activities was primarily due to the timing of working capital outlays and the $3.9 million SEC settlement payment. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had a cash balance of $11.4 million and access to approximately $27.3 million in additional funds through its $100.0 million line of credit, subject to a borrowing base calculation.\n\n**Earnings Call and Webcast**\n\nA pre-recorded call and webcast with HF Foods’ management team discussing the results is now available on the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at https://investors.hffoodsgroup.com/.\n\n**About HF Foods Group Inc.**\n\nHF Foods Group Inc. is a leading marketer and distributor of fresh produce, frozen and dry food, and non-food products to primarily Asian restaurants and other foodservice customers throughout the United States.

We have attempted to identify any forward-looking statements by using words such as “aims,” “continues,” “expects,” “plans,” “will,” and other similar expressions. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in all of our forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Such statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the Company’s actual results, events or financial positions to differ materially from those included within or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, risks relating to our ability to consummate our operational transformation plan as anticipated, risks relating to the impact of our operational plan on our sales and efficiencies, risks relating to the impact of demographic trends on demand for the products we distribute, statements of assumption underlying any of the foregoing, and other factors including those disclosed under the caption “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and other filings with the SEC. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to disclose any revision to these forward-looking statements.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nDiscussion of our results includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to HF Foods Group Inc., that we believe provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial performance with other companies in the same industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. The definitions of EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to HF Foods Group Inc. may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies in the industry. EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to HF Foods Group Inc. are not defined under GAAP and are subject to important limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP.\n\nWe use non-GAAP financial measures to supplement our GAAP financial results. Management uses EBITDA, defined as net income (loss) before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization to measure operating performance. In addition, management uses Adjusted EBITDA, defined as net income (loss) before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization, further adjusted to exclude certain unusual, non-cash, or non-recurring expenses. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is less susceptible to variances in actual performance resulting from non-recurring expenses, and other non-cash charges, provides useful information for our investors and is more reflective of other factors that affect our operating performance.\n\nWe believe non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to HF Foods Group Inc. is a useful measure of operating performance because it excludes certain items not reflective of our core operating performance. Non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to HF Foods Group Inc. is defined as net income (loss) attributable to HF Foods Group Inc. adjusted for amortization of intangibles, change in fair value of interest rate swaps, stock based compensation, transaction related costs, transformational project costs and certain unusual, non-cash, or non-recurring expenses. We believe that non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to HF Foods Group Inc. facilitates period-over-period comparisons and provides additional clarity for investors to better evaluate our operating results. We present EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to HF Foods Group Inc. in order to provide supplemental information that we consider relevant for the readers of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in its reports filed with the SEC, including its current Quarterly Report on Form 10Q, and such information is not meant to replace or supersede U.S. GAAP measures.
