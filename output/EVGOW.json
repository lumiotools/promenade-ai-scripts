          "content": "EVgo Receives Conditional Commitment for DOE Loan Guarantee of up to $1.05 Billion\nto Accelerate Buildout of Public Fast Charging Across the U.S.\nAccess to low-cost financing is expected to support construction of approximately 7,500 new DC\nfast charging stalls in community locations\nLOS ANGELES – October 3, 2024 – EVgo Inc. (NASDAQ: EVGO) (“EVgo” or the “Company”),\none of the nation’s largest public fast charging networks for electric vehicles (EVs), announced\ntoday that it has received a conditional commitment for a loan guarantee of up to $1.05 billion of\ndebt financing, from the U.S. Department of Energy (“DOE”) Loan Programs Office (“LPO”)\nunder its Title 17 program to accelerate expansion of its fast charging network in community\nlocations across the U.S.\nThe financing would accelerate EVgo’s efforts to scale its charging footprint and increase\nnationwide access to convenient, reliable public charging stations. Access to this low-cost\nfinancing will facilitate the build out of approximately 7,500 additional fast charging stalls across\nthe U.S., with the top state markets anticipated to be Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia,\nIllinois, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Texas. If finalized, EVgo expects to\ncomplete the deployment of the new stalls by 2030.\nThe network expansion will complement the corridor charging being deployed through the\nNational Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program by creating localized,\ncommunity charging stations with an emphasis on increased access and availability in areas\nthat serve multifamily housing residents and others who rely primarily on public charging for\ntheir needs.\nIn alignment with the Biden-Harris administration’s Justice40 initiative, over 40% of stalls to be\nbuilt pursuant to the financing, if finalized, are anticipated to be in marginalized areas that have\nbeen overburdened by environmental impacts. EVgo also plans to leverage the 30C tax credit,\nwhich was expanded as part of the Inflation Reduction Act and supports the buildout of public\nEV charging infrastructure with a focus on driving investment to rural and lower-income\ncommunities.\n“EVgo shares the Biden-Harris administration’s goal of increasing EV charging access in the\ncommunities that need it most,” said Badar Khan, CEO at EVgo. “This historic investment would\nmeaningfully accelerate our network expansion to provide public charging to EV drivers across\nthe United States.”\nThe proposed financing will be provided directly by the Federal Financing Bank as a loan,\nguaranteed by DOE, and structured as a limited recourse project financing. EVgo will not need\nto raise any third-party equity—public or private—to reach financial close and begin drawdown.\nThe financing structure provides EVgo flexibility to continue scaling its network both within and\noutside of the Project, to meet growing demand and support the Biden-Harris administration’s\ngoal of building a nationwide network of public chargers.\nEVgo estimates that the project buildout will create more than 1,000 jobs, over 700 of which will\nbe contracted resources engaged by the Company encompassing roles in construction,\nengineering, development, and operations and maintenance.\nEVgo has a successful history of public-private partnerships and will continue to collaborate with\nutilities and state agencies to leverage incentives and funding programs that help to accelerate\ninfrastructure deployment. Partnering with retail site hosts and property owners, EVgo has over\na decade of experience in making EV charging more accessible and supporting the broader\nadoption of electric vehicles.\nEVgo and DOE are committed to a superior customer experience for EV drivers and will\ncollaborate on long-term solutions to maximize charging convenience and reliability to bolster\nconsumer confidence and support broader EV adoption across the country. EVgo continues to\ninvest in developing next-generation charging infrastructure that will enhance customer\nexperience and expects to begin rolling out this new infrastructure in the second half of 2026. If\nfinalized, the landmark partnership between EVgo and DOE will enable EVgo to build the fast\ncharging network of the future and deliver a seamless charging experience for all EV drivers.\nWhile this conditional commitment indicates DOE’s intent to finance the project, the Company\nmust satisfy certain technical, legal, environmental, and financial conditions before the\nDepartment enters into definitive financing documents and funds the loan.\nFor more information about EVgo, visit www.evgo.com.\nTransaction Advisors\nGoldman Sachs acted as the financial advisor to EVgo.\nAbout EVgo\nEVgo (Nasdaq: EVGO) is a leader in electric vehicle charging solutions, building and operating\nthe infrastructure and tools needed to expedite the mass adoption of electric vehicles for\nindividual drivers, rideshare and commercial fleets, and businesses.

Previously reported amounts have been updated\nto conform to the current period presentation.\n9\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement EVgo’s financial information, which is prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, EVgo\nuses certain non-GAAP financial measures. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended\nto be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and\npresented in accordance with GAAP. EVgo uses these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and\noperational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. EVgo believes that\nthese non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s\nperformance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of EVgo’s recurring core business operating\nresults.\nEVgo believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial\nmeasures in assessing EVgo’s performance. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s\ninternal comparisons to the Company’s historical performance. EVgo believes these non-GAAP financial\nmeasures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key\nmetrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by EVgo’s\ninstitutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of EVgo’s business.\nFor more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations to the most\ncomparable GAAP measures, please see the sections titled “Definitions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and\n“Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nDefinitions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis release includes some, but not all of the following non-GAAP financial measures, in each case as defined\nbelow: “Charging Network Margin,” “Adjusted Cost of Sales,” “Adjusted Cost of Sales as a Percentage of\nRevenue,” “Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss),” “Adjusted Gross Margin,” “Adjusted General and Administrative\nExpenses,” “Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses as a Percentage of Revenue,” “EBITDA,” “EBITDA\nMargin,” “Adjusted EBITDA,” “Adjusted EBITDA Margin,” and “Capital Expenditures, Net of Capital Offsets.”\nWith respect to Capital Expenditures, Net of Capital Offsets, pursuant to the terms of certain OEM contracts,\nEVgo is paid well in advance of when revenue can be recognized, and usually, the payment is tied to the\nnumber of stalls that commence operations under the applicable contractual arrangement while the related\nrevenue is deferred at the time of payment and is recognized as revenue over time as EVgo provides charging\nand other services to the OEM and the OEM’s customers. EVgo management therefore uses these measures\ninternally to establish forecasts, budgets, and operational goals to manage and monitor its business, including\nthe cash used for, and the return on, its investment in its charging infrastructure. EVgo believes that these\nmeasures are useful to investors in evaluating EVgo’s performance and help to depict a meaningful\nrepresentation of the performance of the underlying business, enabling EVgo to evaluate and plan more\neffectively for the future.\nCharging Network Margin, Adjusted Cost of Sales, Adjusted Cost of Sales as a Percentage of Revenue, Adjusted\nGross Profit (Loss), Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses, Adjusted General\nand Administrative Expenses as a Percentage of Revenue, EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted\nEBITDA Margin and Capital Expenditures, Net of Capital Offsets are not prepared in accordance with GAAP\nand may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. These measures should\nnot be considered as measures of financial performance under GAAP and the items excluded from or included\nin these metrics are significant components in understanding and assessing EVgo’s financial performance.\nThese metrics should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) or any other performance\nmeasures derived in accordance with GAAP.\n10\nEVgo defines Charging Network Margin as total charging network revenue less charging network cost of sales\ndivided by total charging network revenue. EVgo defines Adjusted Cost of Sales as cost of sales before (i)\ndepreciation, net of capital-build amortization, and (ii) share-based compensation. EVgo defines Adjusted\nCost of Sales as a Percentage of Revenue as Adjusted Cost of Sales as a percentage of revenue. EVgo defines\nAdjusted Gross Profit (Loss) as revenue less Adjusted Cost of Sales. EVgo defines Adjusted Gross Margin as\nAdjusted Gross Profit (Loss) as a percentage of revenue. EVgo defines Adjusted General and Administrative\nExpenses as general and administrative expenses before (i) share-based compensation, (ii) loss on disposal of\nproperty and equipment, net of insurance recoveries, and impairment expense, (iii) bad debt expense\n(recoveries), and (iv) certain other items that management believes are not indicative of EVgo’s ongoing\nperformance. EVgo defines Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses as a Percentage of Revenue as\nAdjusted General and Administrative Expenses as a percentage of revenue. EVgo defines EBITDA as net\nincome (loss) before (i) depreciation, net of capital-build amortization, (ii) amortization, (iii) accretion, (iv)\ninterest income, (v) interest expense, and (vi) income tax expense (benefit). EVgo defines EBITDA Margin as\nEBITDA as a percentage of revenue. EVgo defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA plus (i) share-based\ncompensation, (ii) loss on disposal of property and equipment, net of insurance recoveries, and impairment\nexpense, (iii) loss (gain) on investments, (iv) bad debt expense (recoveries), (v) change in fair value of earnout\nliability, (vi) change in fair value of warrant liabilities, and (vii) certain other items that management believes\nare not indicative of EVgo’s ongoing performance. EVgo defines Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA\nas a percentage of revenue. EVgo defines Capital Expenditures, Net of Capital Offsets as capital expenditures\nadjusted for the following capital offsets: (i) all payments under OEM infrastructure agreements excluding any\namounts directly attributable to OEM customer charging credit programs and pass-through of non-capital\nexpense reimbursements, (ii) proceeds from capital-build funding and (iii) proceeds from the transfer of 30C\nincome tax credits, net of transaction costs.

Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words\nsuch as \"estimate,\" \"plan,\" \"project,\" \"forecast,\" \"intend,\" \"will,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"seek,\" \"target,\" \"assume\" or other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical\nmatters. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations or beliefs of the management of EVgo Inc. (\"EVgo\" or the \"Company\") and are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual\nresults to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. You are cautioned, therefore, against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to,\nexpress or implied statements regarding EVgo’s future financial and operating performance; revenues; market size and opportunity; capital expenditures and offsets, including for stalls operationalized in 2024 and in connection with funding\nreceived from automotive original equipment manufacturers; statements regarding EVgo’s future profitability, including its \"path to profitability\" and \"projection of breakeven adjusted EBITDA in 2025;\" targeted returns on EVgo’s charging sites,\nincluding targeted annual revenue per stall, annual costs per stall and annual cash flow per stall and the assumptions underlying those targets; the Company’s network in 3-5 years, including annual revenue, adjusted gross profit, adjusted EBITDA,\nstall count and corporate and general and administrative costs; increases in charge rates on the network and the reasons for those increases; EVgo’s expectation of market position; progress on the Company’s 2024 priorities to drive growth and\nprofitability, including initiatives related to customer experience, operating and capex efficiencies, customer growth and financing; opportunities to obtain financing and the anticipated impacts of such financing on the Company’s network size,\nprofitability and returns, and network size; growth in the Company’s throughput versus the growth in EVs in operation; the anticipated benefits and growth in connection with the conditional commitment from the U.S. Department of Energy\n(\"DOE\") for a loan guarantee; and anticipated awards of funding in connection with the NEVI program and associated state programs.These statements are based on various assumptions, whether or not identified in this presentation, and on the\ncurrent expectations of EVgo’s management and are not predictions of actual performance.There are a significant number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the statements made in this presentation, including\nchanges or developments in the broader general market; EVgo’s dependence on the widespread adoption of electric vehicles (\"EVs\") and growth of the EV and EV charging markets; competition from existing and new competitors; EVgo’s ability\nto expand into new service markets, grow its customer base and manage its operations; the risks associated with cyclical demand for EVgo’s services and vulnerability to industry downturns and regional or national downturns; fluctuations in\nEVgo’s revenue and operating results; EVgo's ability to satisfy required conditions, enter into definitive agreements and receive loan funding in connection with, and to realize any anticipated benefits and growth from, the DOE loan guarantee\ncommitment; unfavorable conditions or disruptions in the capital and credit markets and EVgo’s ability to obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms; EVgo’s ability to generate cash, service indebtedness and incur additional\nindebtedness; any current, pending or future legislation, regulations or policies that could impact EVgo’s business, results of operations and financial condition, including regulations impacting the EV charging market and government programs\ndesigned to drive broader adoption of EVs and any reduction, modification or elimination of such programs due to the results of the 2024 Presidential and Congressional elections; EVgo’s ability to adapt its assets and infrastructure to changes in\nindustry and regulatory standards and market demands related to EV charging; impediments to EVgo’s expansion plans, including permitting and utility-related delays; EVgo’s ability to integrate any businesses it acquires; EVgo’s ability to recruit\nand retain experienced personnel; risks related to legal proceedings or claims, including liability claims; EVgo’s dependence on third parties, including hardware and software vendors and service providers, utilities and permit-granting entities;\nsupply chain disruptions, inflation and other increases in expenses; safety and environmental requirements or regulations that may subject EVgo to unanticipated liabilities or costs; EVgo’s ability to enter into and maintain valuable partnerships\nwith commercial or public-entity property owners, landlords and/or tenants (collectively \"Site Hosts\"), original equipment manufacturers (\"OEMs\"), fleet operators and suppliers; EVgo’s ability to maintain, protect and enhance EVgo’s intellectual\nproperty; and general economic or political conditions, including the conflicts in Ukraine, Israel and the broader Middle East region, and elevated rates of inflation and associated changes in monetary policy.Additional risks and uncertainties that\ncould affect the Company’s financial results are included under the captions \"Risk Factors\" and \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of EVgo\" in EVgo’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K,\nfiled with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), as well as its other SEC filings, copies of which are available on EVgo’s website at investors.evgo.com, and on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.All forward-looking statements in this\npresentation are based on information available to EVgo as of the date hereof, and EVgo does not assume any obligation to update the forward-looking statements provided to reflect events that occur or circumstances that exist after the date\non which they were made, except as required by applicable law.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement EVgo’s financial information, which is prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"), EVgo uses certain non-GAAP financial measures. The\npresentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. EVgo uses these non-GAAP financial\nmeasures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. EVgo believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s\nperformance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of EVgo’s recurring core business operating results. EVgo believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing\nEVgo’s performance.These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to the Company’s historical performance. EVgo believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1)\nthey allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by EVgo’s institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the\nhealth of EVgo’s business.\nReconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures can be found in the tables included in the Appendix.\nTrademarks\nThis presentation contains trademarks, trade names, and service marks of other parties, which, to EVgo’s knowledge, are the intellectual property of such other parties.

EVgo\nmanagement therefore uses these measures internally to establish forecasts, budgets, and operational goals to manage and monitor its business, including the cash used for, and the return on, its investment in its charging infrastructure. EVgo believes that\nthese measures are useful to investors in evaluating EVgo’s performance and help to depict a meaningful representation of the performance of the underlying business, enabling EVgo to evaluate and plan more effectively for the future.\nCharging Network Margin, Adjusted Cost of Sales, Adjusted Cost of Sales as a Percentage of Revenue, Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss), Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses, Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses as a\nPercentage of Revenue, EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Capital Expenditures, Net of Capital Offsets are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other\ncompanies. These measures should not be considered as measures of financial performance under GAAP and the items excluded from or included in these metrics are significant components in understanding and assessing EVgo’s financial performance.\nThese metrics should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP.\nEVgo defines Charging Network Margin as total charging network revenue less charging network cost of sales divided by total charging network revenue.\nEVgo defines Adjusted Cost of Sales as cost of sales before: (i) depreciation, net of capital-build amortization, and (ii) share-based compensation.\nEVgo defines Adjusted Cost of Sales as a Percentage of Revenue as Adjusted Cost of Sales as a percentage of revenue.\nEVgo defines Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss) as revenue less Adjusted Cost of Sales.\nEVgo defines Adjusted Gross Margin as Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss) as a percentage of revenue.\nEVgo defines Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses as general and administrative expenses before (i) share-based compensation, (ii) loss on disposal of property and equipment, net of insurance recoveries, and impairment expense, (iii) bad debt\nexpense (recoveries), and (iv) certain other items that management believes are not indicative of EVgo’s ongoing performance.\nEVgo defines Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses as a Percentage of Revenue as Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses as a percentage of revenue.\nEVgo defines EBITDA as net income (loss) before (i) depreciation, net of capital-build amortization, (ii) amortization, (iii) accretion, (iv) interest income, (v) interest expense, and(vi) income tax expense (benefit).\nEVgo defines EBITDA Margin as EBITDA as a percentage of revenue.\nEVgo defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA plus (i) share-based compensation, (ii) loss on disposal of property and equipment, net of insurance recoveries, and impairment expense, (iii) loss (gain) on investments, (iv) bad debt expense (recoveries), (v) change in\nfair value of earnout liability, (vi) change in fair value of warrant liabilities, and (vii) certain other items that management believes are not indicative of EVgo’s ongoing performance.\nEVgo defines Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue.\nEVgo defines Capital Expenditures, Net of Capital Offsets as capital expenditures adjusted for the following capital offsets: (i) all payments under OEM infrastructure agreements excluding any amounts directly attributable to OEM customer charging credit\nprograms and pass-through of non-capital expense reimbursements, (ii) proceeds from capital-build funding and (iii) proceeds from the transfer of 30C income tax credits, net of transaction costs.\nThe tables below present quantitative reconciliations of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures as described above.\n28\nRECONCILIATIONS OF NON-GAAP MEASURES TO GAAP\n29\nRECONCILIATIONS OF NON-GAAP MEASURES TO GAAP\n30\nRECONCILIATIONS OF NON-GAAP MEASURES TO GAAP\n31\nRECONCILIATIONS OF NON-GAAP MEASURES TO GAAP\n32\nRECONCILIATIONS OF NON-GAAP MEASURES TO GAAP\n33"

All statements contained in this document other than statements of historical fact,\nincluding, without limitation, statements regarding future financial performance, business strategies, market size and\nopportunity, expansion plans, future results of operations, factors affecting EVgo’s performance, estimated revenues, losses,\nprojected costs, prospects, plans and objectives of management, are forward-looking statements. Such statements can be\nidentified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. When used in this Quarterly Report, words\nsuch as “may,” “will,” “might,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “can,” “expect,” “elect,” “plan,” “objective,” “seek,” “grow,”\n“position,” “possible,” “potential,” “outlook,” “forecast,” “strategy,” “budget,” “target,” “if,” “predict,” “anticipate,” “intend,”\n“believe,” “estimate,” “continue,” “project” and the negative of such terms or other similar expressions may identify forward-\nlooking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. These forward-\nlooking statements are based on EVgo’s current expectations, estimates, projections and beliefs, as well as a number of\nassumptions concerning future events, and are not guarantees of performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to\na number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including the risk factors described in EVgo’s filings with the Securities and\nExchange Commission (the “SEC”). Moreover, EVgo operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New\nrisks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for EVgo to predict all risks, nor can it assess the impact of all factors on its\nbusiness or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those\ncontained in any forward-looking statements EVgo may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the future\nevents and trends discussed in this document may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those\nanticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. Accordingly, you should not rely upon forward-looking statements\nas predictions of future events. Forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report may include, without limitation,\nstatements about:\n● changes adversely affecting EVgo’s business;\n● EVgo’s dependence on the widespread adoption of electric vehicles (“EVs”) and growth of the EV and EV charging\nmarkets;\n● competition from existing and new competitors;\n● EVgo’s ability to meet its targeted or specified metrics, expand into new service markets, grow its customer base and\nmanage its operations;\n● the risks associated with cyclical demand for EVgo’s services and vulnerability to industry downturns and regional\nor national downturns;\n● fluctuations in EVgo’s revenue and operating results;\n● EVgo’s and the parties’ ability to satisfy certain technical, legal, environmental and financial conditions, enter into\ndefinitive transaction agreements and receive loan funding in connection with and to realize any anticipated benefits\nand growth from, the conditional commitment for a loan guarantee by the U.S. Department of Energy;\n● unfavorable conditions or disruptions in the capital and credit markets and EVgo’s ability to obtain additional\nfinancing on commercially reasonable terms, or at all;\n● EVgo’s ability to generate cash, service indebtedness and incur additional indebtedness;\n● any current, pending or future legislation, regulations or policies that could impact EVgo’s business, results of\noperations and financial condition, including regulations impacting the EV charging market and government\nprograms designed to drive broader adoption of EVs and any reduction, modification or elimination of such\nprograms due to the results of the 2024 Presidential and Congressional elections;\n● EVgo’s ability to adapt its assets and infrastructure to changes in industry and regulatory standards and market\ndemands related to EV charging;\n● impediments to EVgo’s expansion plans, including permitting and utility-related delays;\n● EVgo’s ability to integrate any businesses it acquires;\n● EVgo’s ability to recruit and retain experienced personnel;\n● risks related to legal proceedings or claims, including liability claims;\n● EVgo’s dependence on third parties, including hardware and software vendors and service providers, utilities and\npermit-granting entities;\n3\nTable of Contents\n● supply chain disruptions, inflation and other increases in expenses;\n● safety and environmental requirements or regulations that may subject EVgo to increased liabilities or costs;\n● EVgo’s climate-related transition plans, related compliance costs, scenario analysis, internal carbon pricing and/or\ntargets and goals;\n● EVgo’s ability to enter into and maintain valuable partnerships with commercial or public-entity property owners,\nlandlords and/or tenants (collectively “Site Hosts”), original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), fleet operators and\nsuppliers;\n● EVgo’s ability to maintain, protect and enhance EVgo’s intellectual property;\n● general economic or political conditions, including the conflicts in Ukraine, Israel and the broader Middle East\nregion, and elevated rates of inflation and associated changes in monetary policy; and\n● other factors detailed under the section entitled “Risk Factors” in EVgo’s periodic filings with the SEC.\nEVgo’s SEC filings are available publicly on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. The forward-looking statements\ncontained in this Quarterly Report are based on EVgo’s current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and\ntheir potential effects on the Company. There can be no assurance that future developments affecting EVgo will be those that\nthe Company has anticipated.

Statements\n(unaudited)\nNote 1 – Description of Business and Nature of Operations\nEVgo Inc. (“EVgo” or the “Company”) owns and operates a public direct current (“DC”) fast charging network for\nelectric vehicles (“EVs”) in the United States (“U.S.”). EVgo’s network of charging stations provides EV charging\ninfrastructure to consumers and businesses. Its network is capable of charging all EV models and charging standards currently\navailable in the U.S. EVgo partners with automotive original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), fleet and rideshare\noperators, retail hosts such as grocery stores, shopping centers, gas stations, parking lot operators, governments and other\norganizations and property owners in order to locate and deploy its EV charging infrastructure. EVgo Services LLC (“EVgo\nServices”) was formed in October 2010 as NRG EV Services, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned\nsubsidiary of NRG Energy, Inc., an integrated power company based in Houston, Texas (“NRG”). On June 17, 2016, NRG\nsold a majority interest in EVgo Services to Vision Ridge Partners.\nOn January 16, 2020 (the “Holdco Merger Date”), EVgo Holdco, LLC (“EVgo Holdco”), a Delaware limited liability\ncompany and a subsidiary of LS Power Equity Partners IV, L.P. (“LS Power”), completed an acquisition of EVgo Services,\npursuant to the merger agreement (the “Holdco Merger Agreement”) among EVgo Services, its investors and EVgo Holdco,\nwhereby EVgo Services became a wholly-owned subsidiary of EVgo Holdco, resulting in a change in control of EVgo\nServices (the “Holdco Merger”). LS Power formed EVgo Holdings, LLC (“EVgo Holdings”) and EVgo Holdco as part of the\ntransaction.\nEVgo Inc. was incorporated in Delaware on August 4, 2020 under the name Climate Change Crisis Real Impact I\nAcquisition Corporation (“CRIS”). The Company was formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, capital stock\nexchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the\n“Initial Business Combination”). On October 2, 2020, the Company completed its initial public offering (the “Initial Public\nOffering”). Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company completed the sale of 6,600,000\nwarrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) at $1.00 in a private placement to Climate Change Crisis Real Impact I\nAcquisition Holdings, LLC (the “Sponsor”).\nOn July 1, 2021 (the “CRIS Close Date”), the Company consummated the business combination (the “CRIS Business\nCombination”) with CRIS, CRIS Thunder Merger LLC (“Thunder Sub”), EVgo Holdings, EVgo Holdco and EVgo OpCo,\nLLC (“EVgo OpCo” and together with EVgo Holdings and EVgo Holdco, the “EVgo Parties”) pursuant to the business\ncombination agreement dated January 21, 2021 (the “Business Combination Agreement”). Following the CRIS Close Date,\nthe combined company is organized in an “Up-C” structure in which the business of EVgo Holdco and its subsidiaries is held\nby EVgo OpCo and continues to operate through the subsidiaries of EVgo Holdco and in which the Company’s only direct\nassets consist of equity interests in Thunder Sub, which, in turn, holds only common units in EVgo OpCo (“EVgo OpCo\nUnits”).\nOn May 22, 2023, in connection with an underwritten equity offering, EVgo Member Holdings, LLC, an affiliate of\nEVgo Holdings, the Company’s controlling shareholder, purchased 5,882,352 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock\nat the equity offering price of $4.25 per share.\nAs the sole managing member of EVgo OpCo, Thunder Sub operates and controls all of the business and affairs of EVgo\nOpCo and through EVgo OpCo and its subsidiaries, conducts its business. Accordingly, the Company consolidates the\nfinancial results of EVgo OpCo and records a redeemable noncontrolling interest in its consolidated financial statements to\nreflect the EVgo OpCo Units that are owned by EVgo Holdings.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, EVgo Holdings held 195,800,000 EVgo OpCo Units, representing a\nvoting interest of 64.7% and 65.4%, respectively, of the total outstanding EVgo OpCo Units and an equal number of shares of\nthe Company’s Class B common stock. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the shares of the\n13\nTable of Contents\nCompany’s Class B common stock held by EVgo Holdings and the shares of the Company’s Class A common stock held by\nEVgo Member Holdings collectively represented a voting interest of 66.6% and 67.4%, respectively, in the Company.\nEach EVgo OpCo Unit, together with one share of Class B common stock, is redeemable, subject to certain conditions,\nfor either one share of Class A common stock, or, at EVgo OpCo’s election, the cash equivalent to the market value of one\nshare of Class A common stock, pursuant to the Amended and Restated LLC Agreement of EVgo OpCo dated July 1, 2021\n(the “EVgo OpCo A&R LLC Agreement”).\nNote 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation and Consolidation\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited and are presented in accordance with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information, as set\nby the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC.

Based on their nature, magnitude and timing, certain subsequent events\nmay be required to be reflected in the condensed consolidated financial statements at the balance sheet date and/or required to\nbe disclosed in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company has evaluated subsequent events\naccordingly.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of EVgo’s condensed consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make judgments,\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses and related disclosures\nof contingent assets and liabilities. Significant estimates made by management include, but are not limited to, variable\nconsideration estimates and stand-alone selling prices for performance obligations for revenue, depreciable lives of property\nand equipment and intangible assets, costs associated with asset retirement obligations, the fair value of operating lease right-\nof-use (“ROU”) assets and liabilities, share-based compensation, earnout liability, and warrant liabilities. Management bases\nthese estimates on its historical experience and various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the\ncircumstances. Actual results experienced may vary materially and adversely from EVgo’s estimates. Revisions to estimates\nare recognized prospectively.\nConcentration of Business and Credit Risk\nThe Company maintains its cash accounts in commercial banks. Cash balances held in a commercial bank are secured by\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $250,000. A portion of deposit balances may be in excess of federal insurance\nlimits. The Company has not experienced any losses on such accounts. The Company mitigates its risk with respect to cash by\nmaintaining its deposits at high-quality financial institutions and monitoring the credit ratings of those institutions.\n14\nTable of Contents\nThe Company had three customers that collectively comprised 50.5% of the Company’s total net accounts receivable as\nof September 30, 2024. The Company had two customers that collectively comprised 45.7% of the Company’s total net\naccounts receivable as of December 31, 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, one\ncustomer represented 32.1% and 29.6% of total revenue, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\nSeptember 30, 2023, one customer represented 36.1% and 49.3% of total revenue, respectively.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, three and two vendors, respectively,\ncollectively provided 90.8% and 74.9% of EVgo’s total charging equipment, respectively. For the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 two vendors collectively provided 86.6% of EVgo’s total charging equipment. For the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, one vendor provided 77.6% of EVgo’s total charging equipment.\nReclassifications\nThe Company has made certain reclassifications to prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nCash and restricted cash include cash held in cash depository accounts in major banks in the U.S. and are stated at cost.\nCash equivalents are carried at fair value and are invested in money market funds. Cash that is held by a financial institution\nand has restrictions on its availability to the Company is classified as restricted cash.\nThe Company had restricted cash on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets, of $11.4 million and $0.7\nmillion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, associated with unused letters of credits related to the\nconstruction of its charging stations and one of its operating leases, and certain amounts held in a short-term escrow account.\nThe restrictions related to the short-term escrow account were removed in October 2024, resulting in the release of $11.0\nmillion of restricted cash.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nAccounts receivable are amounts due from customers under normal trade terms. Payment terms for accounts receivable\nrelated to capital-build agreements are specified in the individual agreements and vary depending on the counterparty.\nManagement reviews accounts receivable on a recurring basis to determine if any accounts receivable will potentially be\nuncollectible. The Company reserves for any accounts receivable balances that are determined to be uncollectible in the\nallowance for doubtful accounts. After all attempts to collect an account receivable have failed, the account receivable is\nwritten off against the allowance for doubtful accounts. Other accounts receivable of $1.9 million and $2.7 million were\nincluded in accounts receivable, net, on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of\nReference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (“ASU 2020-04”), as amended in December 2022 by ASU 2022-06, Reference\nRate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848 (“ASU 2022-06”). ASU 2020-04 provides guidance to\nalleviate the burden in accounting for reference rate reform by allowing certain expedients and exceptions in applying GAAP\nto contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions impacted by reference rate reform. The provisions apply only to\nthose transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued due to reference rate reform.\nAdoption of the provisions of ASU 2020-04 are optional and are effective from March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2024,\nas amended by ASU 2022-06. The Company has not identified any contracts, hedging relationships or other transactions\nimpacted by reference rate reform and therefore does not expect any impact resulting from the adoption of ASU 2020-04 on\nthe Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial position.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, ASC Subtopic 280 “Segment Reporting — Improvements to\nReportable Segment Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-07”). ASU 2023-07 requires incremental disclosures related to a public entity’s\nreportable segments but does not change the definition of a segment, the method for determining segments, or the\n15\nTable of Contents\ncriteria for aggregating operating segments into reportable segments. ASU 2023-07 provides for significant segment expense\ncategories and amounts for each reportable segment and an aggregate amount and description of other segment items included\nin each reported measure of segment profit or loss beyond the significant segment expenses for each reportable segment;\npermits the disclosure of multiple measures of segment profit or loss for each reportable segment, subject to a minimum\ndisclosure of the measure of segment profit or loss that is most consistent with the amounts included in the financial\nstatements (consistent with current guidance); confirms that all disclosures required in the segments guidance apply to all\npublic entities, including those with a single operating or reportable segment; requires disclosure of the title and position of\nthe individual or the name of the group identified as the CODM in the financial statements; and requires disclosure of how the\nCODM uses each reported measure of segment profit or loss to assess performance and allocate resources to the segment.\nASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods within fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2024 and should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial\nstatements. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating this ASU to determine its impact on the\nCompany’s disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, ASC Subtopic 740 “Income Taxes — Improvements to Income Tax\nDisclosures” (“ASU 2023-09”), which is designed to increase transparency about income tax information through\nimprovements to income tax disclosures primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is\neffective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that\nhave not yet been issued or made available for issuance. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of\nthis ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-01, ASC Subtopic 718 “Compensation – Stock Compensation” (“ASU 2024-\n01”) to provide illustrative examples to determine whether profits interest awards are share-based payment arrangements in\nthe scope of ASC 718, or cash bonus or profit-sharing arrangements in the scope of ASC 710, Compensation. ASU 2024-01 is\neffective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, and interim periods within those annual periods and should\nbe applied either retrospectively to all prior periods presented or prospectively to profits interest and similar awards granted or\nmodified on or after the date at which the amendments are first applied. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently\nevaluating the effect that the adoption of this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, ASC Subtopic 220 “Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive\nIncome – Expense Disaggregation Disclosures” (“ASU 2024-03”). The amendments require that each interim and annual\nreporting period an entity disclose more information about the components of certain expense captions than is currently\ndisclosed in the financial statements. The amendments in this Update are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after\nDecember 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. The\nCompany is currently evaluating this ASU to determine its impact on the Company’s disclosures.\nNote 3 – Revenue Recognition\nThe following table provides information about contract assets and liabilities from contracts with customers as of:\nSeptember 30, December 31, Change\n(dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 $ %\nContract assets $ 3,953 $ 1,191 $ 2,762 232 %\nContract liabilities $ 102,448 $ 87,440 $ 15,008 17 %\nAs of September 30, 2024 there was $4.0 million in contract assets compared to $1.2 million as of December 31, 2023.\nThe balance of contract assets is driven by the difference in timing of when revenue is recognized from performance\nobligations satisfied in the current reporting period and when amounts are invoiced to the customer. Contract liabilities as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 increased $15.0 million, or 17%, to $102.4 million compared to $87.4 million as of December 31, 2023.\nThe balance of contract liabilities is driven by the difference in timing between when cash is received pursuant to a contract\nand when the Company’s performance obligations under the contract are satisfied.\n16\nTable of Contents\nThe following table provides the activity for the contract liabilities recognized:\n(in thousands)\nBalance as of December 31, 2023 $ 87,440\nAdditions 106,185\nRecognized in revenue (90,511)\nMarketing activities recognized on a net basis (666)\nBalance as of September 30, 2024 $ 102,448\nRevenues include the following:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nAmounts included in the beginning of period contract liabilities\nbalance $ 3,011 $ 9,305 $ 19,896 $ 15,865\nAmounts associated with performance obligations satisfied in\nprevious periods $ — $ 141 $ 42 $ 166\nIt is anticipated that deferred revenue as of September 30, 2024 will be recognized in the following periods ending\nDecember 31:\n(in thousands)\n2024 $ 4,593\n2025 11,664\n2026 10,731\n2027 18,227\nThereafter 34,978\n$ 80,193\nAs of September 30, 2024, there was $12.7 million in consideration received for charging credits, for which the timing of\nrevenue recognition is uncertain. The Company expects to recognize revenue for these amounts as customers use their\ncharging credits over the next 3 years.\nASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”) does not require disclosure of the transaction price\nto remaining performance obligations if the contract contains variable consideration allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied\nperformance obligation. Under many customer contracts, each unit of product represents a separate performance obligation\nand therefore future volumes are wholly unsatisfied and thus disclosure of the transaction price allocated to a wholly\nunsatisfied performance obligation is not required. Under these contracts, variability arises as both volume and pricing are not\nknown until the product is delivered. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were $9.5 million and $26.4\nmillion, respectively, in variable consideration for wholly unsatisfied performance obligations, which is included in deferred\nrevenue on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nNote 4 – Lease Accounting\nLessee Accounting\nThe Company has entered into agreements with Site Hosts, which allow the Company to operate charging stations on the\nSite Hosts’ property. Additionally, the Company leases offices, a warehouse and laboratory space under agreements with third-\nparty landlords. The agreements with the Site Hosts and landlords are deemed to be operating leases. Original lease terms\ngenerally range from one to 15 years and certain leases contain renewal options that can extend the term for up to an\nadditional 10 years. The Company has not entered into any finance leases.\n17\nTable of Contents\nThe Company has estimated operating lease commitments of $29.8 million for leases where the Company has not yet\ntaken possession of the underlying asset as of September 30, 2024. As such, the related operating lease ROU assets and\noperating lease liabilities have not been recognized in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet as of\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nThe Company’s lease costs consisted of the following:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nOperating lease costs\nCharging network cost of sales $ 2,934 $ 1,731 $ 8,084 $ 4,522\nGeneral and administrative expenses 1,167 1,073 3,340 3,513\nVariable lease costs\nCharging network cost of sales 723 559 1,836 1,376\nGeneral and administrative expenses 37 44 103 101\nShort-term lease costs — 10 — 69\n$ 4,861 $ 3,417 $ 13,363 $ 9,581\nAs of September 30, 2024, the maturities of operating lease liabilities for the periods ending December 31, were as\nfollows:\n(in thousands)\n2024 $ 2,788\n2025 14,806\n2026 14,439\n2027 13,931\n2028 13,699\nThereafter 69,698\nTotal undiscounted operating lease payments 129,361\nLess: imputed interest (43,426)\nTotal discounted operating lease liabilities $ 85,935\nOther supplemental and cash flow information consisted of the following:\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(dollars in thousands) 2024 2023\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (in years) 9.0 8.3\nWeighted-average discount rate 9.4 % 8.8 %\nCash paid for amounts included in measurement of operating lease liabilities $ 11,061 $ 2,374\nROU assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities $ 24,490 $ 5,546\nLessor Accounting\nThe Company leases charging equipment, charging stations and other technical installations and subleases properties\nleased from Site Hosts to third parties under operating leases where EVgo is the lessor. Initial lease terms are generally one to\nten years and may contain renewal options.

LLC as sales agents, pursuant to which the Company may sell up to $200.0 million of\nshares of Class A common stock in “at the market” transactions at prevailing market prices (the “ATM Program”). As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Company had $183.5 million of remaining capacity under the ATM Program.\nNote 9 – Commitments and Contingencies\nPilot Infrastructure Agreement\nOn July 5, 2022, EVgo entered into a charging infrastructure agreement (the “Pilot Infrastructure Agreement”) and an\noperations and maintenance agreement (the “Pilot O&M”) with Pilot Travel Centers LLC (the “Pilot Company”) and General\nMotors LLC (“GM”) to build, operate, and maintain up to 2,000 stalls served by DC chargers that the Pilot Company will\nown. The stalls will be located at the Pilot Company sites across the U.S.\nPursuant to the Pilot Infrastructure Agreement, EVgo is required to meet certain construction milestones measured by the\nnumber of sites commissioned, and the Pilot Company is required to make certain payments each month based on completion\nof pre-engineering and development work, the progress of construction at each site and for each charger procured by EVgo.\nSubject to extensions of time for specified excusable events, if EVgo is unable to meet its commissioning obligations, the Pilot\nCompany will be entitled to liquidated damages calculated per day, subject to a cap of $30,000 at each site. The Pilot\nInfrastructure Agreement includes customary events of default such as those resulting from insolvency, material breaches, and\nextended unexcused noncompliance, in each case subject to applicable notice and cure periods and other customary limitations\non the parties’ ability to seek available remedies, including early termination. Additional provisions that may permit or cause\nearly termination include the Pilot Company’s right to terminate after 1,000 stalls have been completed, the inability of EVgo\nto secure certain chargers and a material increase in the price of chargers due to a change in law. If the Pilot Company elects to\nterminate the Pilot Infrastructure Agreement after 1,000 stalls have been completed, the Pilot Company must pay EVgo a\ntermination fee per stall for those not built; such fee varies based on the number of stalls already built. If EVgo is wholly or\npartially unable to perform its obligations under the Pilot Infrastructure Agreement due to certain circumstances outside its\ncontrol, including delays by permitting authorities and utilities or certain force majeure events, such inability will not be\nconsidered a breach or default under the Pilot Infrastructure Agreement.\nUnder the Pilot O&M, EVgo is required to perform operations, maintenance and networking services on stalls built and\ncommissioned under the Pilot Infrastructure Agreement in exchange for payment of a monthly fee by the Pilot Company to\nEVgo. Similar to the Pilot Infrastructure Agreement, the Pilot O&M includes customary events of default and related\nremedies.\nDelta Charger Supply Agreement and Purchase Order\nOn July 12, 2022, EVgo entered into a General Terms and Conditions for Sale of EV Charger Products (the “Delta\nCharger Supply Agreement”) with Delta Electronics, Inc. (“Delta”), including an initial purchase order (the “Purchase\nOrder”), pursuant to which EVgo will purchase and Delta will sell EV chargers manufactured by Delta in specified quantities\nat certain delivery dates. EVgo expects to use a portion of the chargers purchased under the Purchase Order to meet the\nrequirements of the Pilot Infrastructure Agreement. EVgo is required to purchase a minimum of 1,000 chargers from Delta\nunder the Purchase Order and may, at EVgo’s election, increase the number of chargers it purchases from Delta to 1,100. The\nPurchase Order was amended in August 2023 to provide for certain Delta chargers to be manufactured in Delta’s facility in\nPlano, Texas rather than in Taiwan.\n21\nTable of Contents\nGeneral Motors Agreement\nOn July 20, 2020, EVgo entered into a contract with GM (as amended from time to time, the “GM Agreement”) to build\nfast charger stalls that EVgo will own and operate as part of the Company’s public network. The GM Agreement has been\namended several times, to among other things, expand the overall number of charger stalls to be installed from 2,750 to 2,850,\nadjust charger stall installation targets, extend the completion deadline to June 30, 2028, provide for a payment of $7,000,000\nin December 2022 in exchange for EVgo’s agreement to apply certain branding decals on the fast chargers funded by GM\npursuant to the GM Agreement and additional payments for changes to GM’s charger branding, and maintain a specified\nuptime percentage (described below) over the term of the agreement. In the most recent amendment to the GM Agreement, a\ncertain portion of the charger stalls that EVgo is required to build are required to have additional specifications (“Flagship\nStalls”). Pursuant to the GM Agreement, EVgo is required to meet certain quarterly milestones measured by the number of\ncharger stalls installed, and GM is required to make certain payments based on charger stalls installed.\nUnder the GM Agreement, EVgo is required to install a total of 2,850 charger stalls by June 30, 2028, 67.9% of which\nwere required to be and were installed by September 30, 2024. Meeting the quarterly milestones will require additional funds\nbeyond the amounts committed by GM, and EVgo may face delays in construction, commissioning or aspects of installation\nof the charger stalls the Company is obligated to develop. EVgo is also required to maintain network availability (i.e., the\npercentage of time a charger is operational and available on the network) of at least 97% across Flagship Stalls and 95%\nacross the rest of the GM network. In addition to the capital-build program, EVgo is committed to providing GM EV\ncustomers with reservations and certain EVgo services at a discounted rate and branding on chargers. The contract is\naccounted for under ASC 606, which includes performance obligations related to reservations, memberships, and branding.\nThe capital-build program is considered a set-up activity and not a performance obligation under ASC 606.\nThe GM Agreement is subject to early termination in certain circumstances, including in the event EVgo fails to meet the\nquarterly charger stall-installation milestones or maintain the specified level of network availability. If GM opts to terminate\nthe agreement, EVgo may not be entitled to receive continued payments from GM and instead may be required to pay\nliquidated damages to GM. In the event EVgo fails to meet a charger stall-installation milestone or maintain the required\nnetwork availability in a calendar quarter, GM has the right to provide EVgo with a notice of such deficiency within 30 days\nof the end of the quarter. If the same deficiency still exists at the end of the quarter immediately following the quarter for\nwhich a deficiency notification was delivered, GM may immediately terminate the agreement and seek pre-agreed liquidated\ndamages of up to $15.0 million.\nIf EVgo does not meet its charger stall-installation milestone in any period, GM will have the right, if it so chooses, to\nsend EVgo a charger stall count breach notice, which would trigger a cure period. It is possible that EVgo will not meet the\ncharger stall-installation milestones under the GM Agreement in the future, particularly as a consequence of delays in\npermitting, commissioning and utility interconnection, and delays associated with industry and regulatory adaptation to the\nrequirements of high-powered charger installation, including slower than expected third-party approvals of certain site\nacquisitions and site plans by utilities and landowners, and supply chain issues.\nNissan Agreements\nEVgo executed an agreement with Nissan North America, Inc. (“Nissan”) in June 2019 (the “Nissan Agreement”), that\nprovides for joint marketing activities, charging credit programs for purchasers or lessees of Nissan EVs, and a capital-build\nprogram. The Nissan Agreement has been amended several times to, among other things, adjust the allocation of the value of\nunused charging credits and to provide new offerings for purchasers or lessees of certain Nissan EV models. Under the joint-\nmarketing activities provisions of the Nissan Agreement, EVgo was obligated to spend a specified amount annually on joint-\nmarketing activities that were mutually agreed-upon with Nissan until March 1, 2024. Under the charging credit program\nprovisions in the Nissan Agreement, credits for charging are allocated to purchasers or lessees of Nissan EVs, and such\npurchasers or lessees are permitted to charge their EV for 12 months at no charge to the participant, up to the amount of the\ncharging credit allocated to such participant or on an unlimited basis, depending on the model of Nissan EV purchased or\nleased. Until March 1, 2024, in the event a participant did not use the entire amount of the allocated charging credit or if the\nannual charging credit pool was not exhausted within a specific period, a portion of the remaining dollar value of such credit\nrolled over to subsequent periods, and a portion was retained by the Company. After March 1,\n22\nTable of Contents\n2024, Nissan is required to make additional payments to the extent needed to support charging credits for new enrollees, and\nunused funds from such additional payments will be returned to Nissan at the end of the term. For Nissan EV purchasers or\nlessees receiving unlimited charging, the Company receives an upfront activation fee for each purchaser or lessee as well as a\nusage-based fee. The capital-build program provided for in the Nissan Agreement required the Company to install, operate and\nmaintain public, high-power dual-standard chargers in specified markets pursuant to a schedule that outlined the build\ntimelines for the chargers to be constructed (the “Build Schedule”). EVgo fulfilled its capital-build program obligations under\nthe Nissan Agreement. The contract is accounted for under ASC 606, which includes performance obligations related to\nmemberships, charging credits and joint marketing activities. The capital-build program is considered a set-up activity and not\na performance obligation under ASC 606.\nNissan has the right to terminate the Nissan Agreement, without penalty or obligation of any kind, upon 30 days’ written\nnotice if it is unable to secure funding to make payments required under the Nissan Agreement. Nissan receives budget\napprovals annually from Nissan Motor Company Limited. Nissan has fulfilled its annual payment obligations under the\nNissan Agreement.\nIndemnifications and Guarantees\nIn the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain agreements, the Company has entered into contractual\narrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters. These\narrangements can include provisions whereby we have joint and several liability in relation to the performance of certain\ncontractual obligations along with third parties also providing services and products for a specific project. In addition, our\narrangements may include warranties that our services will substantially operate in accordance with the stated requirements.\nIndemnification provisions are also included in arrangements under which EVgo agrees to hold the indemnified party\nharmless with respect to third-party claims related to such matters as title to assets sold or licensed or certain intellectual\nproperty rights.\nThe Company also has indemnification obligations to other parties, including customers, lessors, and parties to other\ntransactions with us, with respect to certain matters. EVgo has agreed to indemnify against losses arising from a breach of\nrepresentations or covenants or out of intellectual property infringement or the occurrence of certain specified conditions or\nother claims made against certain parties. These agreements may limit the time or circumstances within which an\nindemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. Historically, indemnity payments made by us have not had a\nmaterial effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification\nagreements with our officers and directors, and our Amended and Restated Bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations\nto our agents.\nTo date, EVgo has not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above.\nThe Company has assessed the current status of performance/payment risk related to arrangements with limited guarantees,\nwarranty obligations, unspecified limitations, indemnification provisions, letters of credit and surety bonds, and believes that\nany potential payments would be immaterial to the condensed consolidated financial statements, as a whole.\nLegal Proceedings\nIn the ordinary course of the Company’s business, the Company may be subject to lawsuits, investigations, claims and\nproceedings, including, but not limited to, contractual disputes with vendors and customers and liabilities related to\nemployment, health and safety matters. The Company accrues for losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable. Loss\ncontingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and, therefore, determining the likelihood of a loss and/or the\nmeasurement of any loss can be complex and subject to change.\nContingent liabilities arising from ordinary course litigation are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany’s financial position. However, future events or circumstances, currently unknown to management, may potentially\nhave a material effect on the Company’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations in any future reporting period.\n23\nTable of Contents\nPurchase Commitments\nAs of September 30, 2024, EVgo had $38.0 million in outstanding purchase order commitments to EVgo’s contract\nmanufacturers and component suppliers for charging equipment, of which $34.4 million were short-term in nature. In certain\ninstances, EVgo is permitted to cancel, reschedule or adjust these orders.\nNote 10 – Fair Value Measurements\nThe fair value of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities reflects management’s estimate of amounts that the\nCompany would have received in connection with the sale of the assets or paid in connection with the transfer of the liabilities\nin an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In connection with measuring the fair value of\nits assets and liabilities, the Company seeks to maximize the use of observable inputs (market data obtained from independent\nsources) and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs (internal assumptions about how market participants would price\nassets and liabilities).\nThe following table presents information about the Company’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a\nrecurring basis and indicates the level within the fair value hierarchy of the valuation inputs the Company utilized to\ndetermine such fair value as of:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\n(in thousands) Level Balance Level Balance\nCash equivalents\nMoney market funds 1 $ 121,125 1 $ 186,125\nLiabilities\nEarnout liability 3 $ 719 3 $ 654\nWarrant liability – Public Warrants 1 4,671 1 4,245\nWarrant liability – Private Placement Warrants 3 985 3 896\nTotal liabilities $ 6,375 $ 5,795\nThe earnout liability was valued using a Monte Carlo simulation methodology. Assumptions used in the valuation of the\nearnout liability were as follows as of:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nStock price $ 4.14 $ 3.58\nRisk-free interest rate 3.7 % 4.1 %\nExpected restriction period (in years) 1.7 2.5\nExpected volatility 71 % 63 %\nDividend rate — % — %\nThe warrants are accounted for as liabilities in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and are presented as\nwarrant liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The warrant liabilities are measured at fair value at inception\nand on a recurring basis, with changes in fair value presented within change in fair value of warrant liabilities in\n24\nTable of Contents\nthe condensed consolidated statements of operations. The closing price of the Public Warrants was used as its fair value as of\neach relevant date.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Private Placement Warrants were valued using a Monte Carlo simulation methodology,\nwhich is considered a Level 3 fair value measurement. Assumptions used in the valuation of the Private Placement Warrant\nliability using the Monte Carlo simulation methodology are as follows as of:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nStock price $ 4.14 $ 3.58\nRisk-free interest rate 3.7 % 4.1 %\nExpected term (in years) 1.8 2.5\nExpected volatility 71 % 63 %\nDividend rate — % — %\nExercise price $ 11.50 $ 11.50\nThe following table presents a reconciliation for all liabilities measured and recognized at fair value on a recurring basis\nusing significant unobservable inputs (Level 3):\nPrivate\nPlacement\nEarnout Warrant\n(in thousands) Liability Liability\nFair value as of December 31, 2023 $ 654 $ 896\nChange in fair value of liability 65 89\nFair value as of September 30, 2024 $ 719 $ 985\nThe carrying values of certain accounts such as cash, restricted cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other\ncurrent assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses are deemed to approximate their fair values due to their short-term\nnature. The fair values of the Company’s money market funds are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.\nThere were no assets measured on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) as of September 30, 2024\nand December 31, 2023.\nNote 11 – Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes related to federal and state jurisdictions where business\nis conducted related to the Company’s ownership in EVgo OpCo. All income (loss) before income taxes is generated in the\nU.S. The Company’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rates reflect the impact of a full valuation allowance on its\ndeferred tax assets and a significant portion of income (loss) being allocated to a nontaxable partnership.\nIn assessing the realization of its deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some\nportion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets\nwhen it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Management considered all available material evidence,\nboth positive and negative, in assessing the appropriateness of a valuation allowance for the Company’s deferred tax assets,\nincluding the generation of future taxable income, the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities and other available material\nevidence. After consideration of all of the information available, management believes that significant uncertainty exists with\nrespect to future realization of the deferred tax assets and has therefore established a full valuation allowance against its net\ndeferred tax assets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nThe Company files a U.S. federal income tax return and income tax returns in various state and local jurisdictions and is\nsubject to examination by the various taxing authorities for all periods since its inception. As of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, there were no unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions, nor any amounts accrued for interest\nand penalties.\n25\nTable of Contents\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) was signed into law and offers tax incentives targeting\nenergy transition and renewables. The alternative fuel refueling property credit under Section 30C of the Internal Revenue\nCode, which includes electric vehicle charging stations (“30C Credit”), was reinstated in 2022 and extended to apply to any\nproperty placed in service beginning January 1, 2023 and before January 1, 2033. The credit amount is calculated as 6% of the\neligible costs of the alternative fuel refueling property with a potential higher tax credit rate of 30% of the eligible costs of the\nalternative fuel refueling property if specified prevailing wage and registered apprenticeship requirements are met during\nconstruction of the property, with a maximum credit amount of $100,000 per item of property. Under the IRA 30C Credits\nmay be transferred for cash consideration in the taxable year the credit is generated. The U.S. Department of the Treasury and\nthe Internal Revenue Service have been granted broad authority to issue regulations or guidance that could clarify how these\ntax credits are calculated. The Company is continuing to evaluate the financial impact of the IRA as additional information\nbecomes available. The Company has elected to account for these credits under ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, and disregards\nexpected transfers in assessing realizability as part of the valuation allowance analysis. The Company will instead recognize\nsuch amounts upon transfer of control over the 30C Credits. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the\nCompany transferred EVgo OpCo’s 2023 30C Credits for proceeds, net of estimated transaction costs, of $9.0 million. The\nCompany has not recognized any income tax benefits related to the transfers of any 2023 30C Credits as of September 30,\n2024 as the Company retains substantive indemnification risks. The Company did not transfer any 30C credits during the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nNote 12 – Tax Receivable Agreement\nIn connection with the CRIS Business Combination, EVgo entered into a tax receivable agreement (the “Tax Receivable\nAgreement”) with EVgo Holdings (along with permitted assigns, the “TRA Holders”) and LS Power Equity Advisors, LLC, as\nagent. The Tax Receivable Agreement generally provides for payment by the Company, Thunder Sub or any of their\nsubsidiaries (other than EVgo OpCo and its subsidiaries) (the “Company Group”) to the TRA Holders of 85% of the net cash\nsavings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax or franchise tax that the Company actually realizes or is deemed to\nrealize in certain circumstances after the CRIS Business Combination as a result of (i) certain increases in tax basis that occur\nas a result of the Company Group’s acquisition (or deemed acquisition for U.S. federal income tax purposes) of all or a portion\nof the TRA Holders’ EVgo OpCo Units pursuant to the CRIS Business Combination or the exercise of the redemption or Call\nRights set forth in the EVgo OpCo A&R LLC Agreement and (ii) imputed interest deemed to be paid by the Company Group\nas a result of, and additional tax basis arising from, any payments the Company Group makes under the Tax Receivable\nAgreement. The Company Group will retain the benefit of any remaining net cash savings. If the Company Group elects to\nterminate the Tax Receivable Agreement early (or it is terminated early due to the Company Group’s failure to honor a\nmaterial obligation thereunder or due to certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes of\ncontrol), the Company Group is required to make an immediate payment equal to the present value of the anticipated future\npayments to be made by it under the Tax Receivable Agreement (based upon certain assumptions and deemed events set forth\nin the Tax Receivable Agreement, including (i) that the Company Group has sufficient taxable income on a current basis to\nfully utilize the tax benefits covered by the Tax Receivable Agreement and (ii) that any EVgo OpCo Units (other than those\nheld by the Company Group) outstanding on the termination date or change of control date, as applicable, are deemed to be\nredeemed on such date).\nAmounts payable by the Company under the Tax Receivable Agreement are accrued through a charge to income when it\nis probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount is estimable. As of September 30, 2024, no transactions have\noccurred that would result in a cash tax savings benefit that would trigger the recording of a liability by the Company based on\nthe terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement.\n26\nTable of Contents\nNote 13 – Share-Based Compensation\nThe following table sets forth the Company’s total share-based compensation expense in the Company’s condensed\nconsolidated statements of operations:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nOther cost of sales $ 79 $ 58 $ 277 $ 121\nGeneral and administrative expenses 5,291 6,043 15,196 20,902\nTotal share-based compensation expense $ 5,370 $ 6,101 $ 15,473 $ 21,023\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company entered into a transition agreement with Catherine Zoi\nand certain other parties in connection with Ms. Zoi’s anticipated resignation as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer.\nPursuant to the transition agreement, subject to certain conditions, Ms. Zoi shall be deemed to have remained in continuous\nemployment with the Company or its affiliates through April 30, 2024 (the “Separation Date”), for purposes of vesting,\nsettlement, and exercisability of her outstanding and unvested Company RSUs and stock options, and Ms. Zoi shall vest in her\nTime Vesting Incentive Units (as defined below) on January 16, 2024. Ms. Zoi will additionally vest in her Sale Vesting\nIncentive Units (as defined below) upon the consummation of a sale of the Company during the six month period following\nMs. Zoi’s Separation Date, if such a sale transaction were to occur. The Company determined that these provisions represented\na modification of the existing awards, resulting in the cumulative compensation cost recognized for the original RSU, stock\noption, and Time Vesting Incentive Unit awards being zero immediately prior to the modification as none of the awards were\notherwise expected to vest. The incremental fair value of the modified RSU, stock option and Time Vesting Incentive Unit\nawards of $4.2 million were recognized over the period from the modification date to the Separation Date. The incremental\nfair value of the modified Sale Vesting Incentive Unit awards was $6.1 million.\n2021 Long Term Incentive Plan\nOn July 1, 2021, concurrent with the closing of the CRIS Business Combination, stockholders approved the 2021 Long\nTerm Incentive Plan (the “2021 Incentive Plan”), which had been previously approved by the Board of Directors. The 2021\nIncentive Plan reserves 33,918,000 shares of Class A common stock for issuance to employees, non-employee directors and\nother service providers. As of September 30, 2024, there were 12,638,937 shares of Class A common stock remaining\navailable for grant. The nonvested performance-based restricted stock units (“PSUs”) previously issued under the 2021\nIncentive Plan are subject to under- and over-achievement thresholds. The number of shares remaining available for grant as\ndisclosed in this paragraph was determined based on the number of PSUs whose vesting conditions were considered probable\nof achievement as of September 30, 2024.\nStock Options\nThe following table summarizes stock option activity under the 2021 Incentive Plan for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024:\nWeighted\nShares Weighted Average\nUnderlying Average Remaining Aggregate\n(shares in thousands) Options Exercise Price Contractual Life Intrinsic Value\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2023 1,058 $ 8.66 7.6 years $ —\nForfeited (250) $ 8.59\nExpired (282) $ 10.18\nOutstanding as of September 30, 2024 526 $ 7.88 7.0 years $ —\nExercisable as of September 30, 2024 228 $ 9.90 4.9 years $ —\n27\nTable of Contents\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company’s unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to stock options was\napproximately $0.3 million, which is expected to be recognized over a period of 1.1 years. No stock options were granted or\nexercised during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nRestricted Stock Units\nService-Based Awards\nThe table below represents the Company’s restricted stock unit (“RSU”) activity under the 2021 Incentive Plan during the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024:\nWeighted\nAverage\nNumber of Grant Date\n(shares in thousands) Shares Fair Value\nNonvested as of December 31, 2023 9,051 $ 5.85\nGranted 9,101 $ 2.63\nVested (3,348) $ 6.28\nForfeited (2,265) $ 4.19\nNonvested and outstanding as of September 30, 2024 12,539 $ 3.70\nThe total fair value of RSUs vested during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $8.3 million. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Company’s unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to unvested RSUs was\napproximately $22.6 million, which is expected to be recognized over a period of 1.5 years.\nMarket-Based Awards\nThe Company has granted certain nonvested market-based restricted stock units (“MSUs”), which are subject to market-\nbased performance targets related to the attainment of certain stock price levels in order for these units to vest. Vesting is also\nsubject to continued service requirements through the vesting date over a period of three years from the date of grant.\nCompensation expense for such nonvested stock units is recognized on a straight-line basis over the longer of the explicit\nservice period or the derived service period for the market condition, regardless of whether the market condition has been\nsatisfied. The table below represents the Company’s MSU activity under the 2021 Incentive Plan for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024:\nWeighted\nAverage\nNumber of Grant Date\n(shares in thousands) Shares Fair Value\nNonvested as of December 31, 2023 704 $ 2.25\nGranted 317 $ 2.29\nForfeited (83) $ 2.50\nNonvested as of September 30, 2024 938 $ 2.24\n28\nTable of Contents\nNo MSUs vested during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The grant date fair value for such nonvested stock\nunits was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation that incorporates option-pricing inputs covering the period from the grant\ndate through the end of the performance period. The following assumptions were used for the grants issued during the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024.\nRisk-free interest rate 3.9 to 4.0 %\nExpected dividend yield — %\nExpected volatility 85 to 88 %\nCost of equity 13.6 %\nRemaining time to performance period end date (in years) 5.0 to 5.2\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company’s unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to unvested MSUs\nwas approximately $1.3 million, which is expected to be recognized over a period of 1.5 years.\nPerformance-Based Awards\nThe Company has granted certain PSUs, which vest based on the achievement of certain performance-based vesting\nconditions and subject to a three-year service condition. The number of shares that may ultimately vest with respect to each\naward may range from 0% up to 156% of the target number of shares based on the achievement of certain performance-based\nvesting conditions related to stall counts and Adjusted EBITDA over a one year period and a relative total stockholder return\n(“rTSR”) performance relative to the rTSR of a select group of companies in the Clean Edge Green Energy Index over a three\nyear period. The maximum number of PSUs that may vest is determined based on actual Company achievement and vest over\na three-year period subject to continuous service through the three-year period and achievement of the performance\nconditions. Compensation expense is recognized when performance targets are defined, the grant date is established, and it is\nconsidered probable that the performance objectives will be met. The fair value of the PSUs was calculated based on the\nclosing price of the Company’s Class A common stock on the grant date.\nThe table below represents the Company’s PSU activity under the 2021 Incentive Plan for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024:\nWeighted\nAverage\nNumber of Grant Date\n(shares in thousands) Shares Fair Value\nNonvested as of December 31, 2023 — $ —\nGranted 1,859 $ 2.92\nForfeited (250) $ 2.90\nNonvested as of September 30, 2024 1,609 $ 2.93\nNo PSUs vested during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company’s\nunrecognized share-based compensation expense related to unvested PSUs was approximately $3.8 million, which is\ncontingent upon meeting the performance objectives.\n29\nTable of Contents\nEVgo Management Holdings, LLC Incentive Units\nFollowing the Holdco Merger and prior to the CRIS Business Combination, all employees of EVgo Services employed at\nthat time received share-based compensation in the form of units in EVgo Management Holdings, LLC (“EVgo\nManagement”) designed to track incentive units issued by EVgo Holdings to EVgo Management (“Incentive Units”). Of each\nindividual grant of Incentive Units, 65% of the grant was designated as time vesting (the “Time Vesting Incentive Units”) and\nthe remaining 35% of the grant was designated as sale vesting (the “Sale Vesting Incentive Units”). The Time Vesting\nIncentive Units vest annually and equally over a period of four years from the date of grant. Sale Vesting Incentive Units vest\nbased upon the achievement of certain trigger events relating to the sale of EVgo Holdings. Presented below is a summary of\nthe activity of the Company’s Incentive Units during the nine months ended September 30, 2024:\nWeighted\nAverage\nGrant Date\n(units in thousands) Units Fair Value\nNonvested as of December 31, 2023 252 $ 37.03\nVested (57) $ 15.53\nForfeited (133) $ 52.04\nNonvested as of September 30, 2024 62 $ 24.81\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company’s unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to unvested Time\nVesting Incentive Units was approximately $0.1 million, which is expected to be recognized over a period of 0.3 years.\nNote 14 – Net Loss Per Share\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(in thousands, except per share data) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNumerator\nNet loss $ (33,290) $ (28,257) $ (91,093) $ (98,877)\nLess: net loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest (21,581) (18,536) (59,174) (69,054)\nNet loss attributable to Class A common stockholders (11,709) (9,721) (31,919) (29,823)\nLess: net loss attributable to participating securities (79) (68) (216) (246)\nNet loss attributable to Class A common stockholders, basic and\ndiluted $ (11,630) $ (9,653) $ (31,703) $ (29,577)\nDenominator\nWeighted average common stock outstanding 106,925 103,406 106,210 87,168\nLess: weighted average unvested Earnout Shares outstanding (719) (719) (719) (719)\nWeighted average common stock outstanding, basic and diluted 106,206 102,687 105,491 86,449\nNet loss per share – basic and diluted $ (0.11) $ (0.09) $ (0.30) $ (0.34)\n30\nTable of Contents\nThe Company’s potentially dilutive securities consist of the Company’s Public Warrants, Private Placement Warrants,\nRSUs, stock options and unvested Earnout Shares. For the periods in which EPS is presented, the Company excluded the\nfollowing potential shares, presented based on amounts outstanding at each period end, from the computation of diluted net\nloss per share attributable to Class A common stockholders since their impact would have been antidilutive:\nThree and Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023\nPublic Warrants 14,949 14,949\nPrivate Placement Warrants 3,149 3,149\nRSUs 12,539 8,264\nPSUs 1,609 —\nStock options 526 1,285\n32,772 27,647\nAdditionally, 718,750 unvested Earnout Shares were excluded from the computation of diluted EPS because their vesting\nthreshold (i.e., the $15.00 triggering event) had not yet been met as of September 30, 2024 and 2023. There were\napproximately 0.9 million shares of MSUs that were excluded from the computation of diluted EPS as their market vesting\nconditions had not yet been met as of September 30, 2024.\nNote 15 – Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, EVgo Holdings held 195,800,000 EVgo OpCo Units, representing a\n64.8% and a 65.5% economic ownership interest, respectively, in EVgo OpCo (reflecting the exclusion of 718,750 shares of\nClass A common stock held by other entities that were subject to possible forfeiture) and that same number of shares of the\nCompany’s Class B common stock, representing a 64.7% and a 65.4% voting interest, respectively, in the Company. EVgo\nHoldings is entitled to one vote per share of Class B common stock but is not entitled to receive dividends or any assets upon\nliquidation, dissolution, distribution or winding-up of the Company. Each EVgo OpCo Unit is redeemable, together with one\nshare of Class B common stock, for either one share of Class A common stock or, at EVgo OpCo’s election, the cash\nequivalent market value of one share of Class A common stock in accordance with the terms of the EVgo OpCo A&R LLC\nAgreement (see Note 12).\nThe EVgo OpCo Units held by EVgo Holdings have been classified as a redeemable noncontrolling interest in the\nCompany. The cash redemption feature of the EVgo OpCo Units, together with a corresponding number of shares of Class B\ncommon stock, at the option of EVgo OpCo, is considered outside of the control of the Company. Therefore, in accordance\nwith ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, the EVgo OpCo Units are classified as temporary equity in the\nCompany’s condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nThe redeemable noncontrolling interest held by EVgo Holdings in EVgo OpCo, through its ownership of EVgo OpCo\nUnits, was initially measured at its carrying amount on the CRIS Close Date. Net income or loss and other comprehensive\nincome or loss are attributed to the redeemable noncontrolling interest during each reporting period based on its ownership\npercentage, as appropriate. Subsequent to that, the redeemable noncontrolling interest is measured at its fair value (i.e., based\non the Class A common stock price) at the end of each reporting period, exclusive of the par value of the related Class B\ncommon stock, with the remeasurement amount being no less than the initial carrying amount, as adjusted for the redeemable\nnoncontrolling interest’s share of net income or loss and other comprehensive income or loss. The offset of any fair value\nadjustment is recorded to equity, with no impact to net income (loss).\n31\nTable of Contents\nThe following is a reconciliation of changes in the redeemable noncontrolling interest for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024:\n(in thousands)\nBalance as of December 31, 2023 $ 700,964\nNet loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest (59,174)\nEquity-based compensation attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest 304\nAdjustment to revise redeemable noncontrolling interest to its redemption value at period-end 168,518\nBalance as of September 30, 2024 $ 810,612\nNote 16 – Subsequent Event\nOn October 3, 2024, the U.S. Department of Energy (“DOE”) Loan Programs Office (“LPO”) announced that EVgo\nreceived conditional commitment for a loan guarantee of up to $1.05 billion of debt financing under its Title 17 program to\naccelerate expansion of EVgo’s fast charging network across the U.S. The proposed financing will be provided directly by the\nFederal Financing Bank as a loan, guaranteed by DOE, and structured as a limited recourse project financing. While this\nconditional commitment indicates DOE’s intent to finance the project, DOE and the Company must satisfy certain technical,\nlegal, environmental, and financial conditions and DOE must complete environmental review before the DOE decides whether\nto enter into definitive financing documents and fund the loan. The Company is working to satisfy the required conditions.\n32\nTable of Contents\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and\nunderstanding of EVgo’s consolidated results of operations and financial condition. The discussion should be read in\nconjunction with EVgo’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included\nelsewhere in this Quarterly Report, and the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto as of and for the\nyears ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical\ninformation, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve numerous risks, uncertainties, and assumptions\nthat could cause EVgo’s actual results to differ materially from management’s expectations due to a number of factors,\nincluding those discussed in the sections entitled “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking\nStatements” in this Quarterly Report.\nOverview\nEVgo is a leader in EV charging solutions, building and operating the infrastructure and tools to expedite the mass\nadoption of EVs for individual drivers, rideshare and commercial fleets, and businesses. EVgo is one of the nation’s largest\npublic fast charging networks, featuring over 1,000 fast charging locations across more than 40 states, including stations built\nthrough EVgo eXtend, its white label service offering. EVgo is expected to accelerate transportation electrification through\npartnerships with automakers, fleet and rideshare operators, retail hosts such as grocery stores, shopping centers, and gas\nstations, policy leaders, and other organizations.\nThe foundation of the Company’s business is building, owning and operating EV fast charging sites that deliver charging\nto EVs driven by individuals, commercial drivers, and fleet operators. EVgo’s core revenue stream is from the provision of\ncharging services for EVs of all types on EVgo’s network. In addition, a variety of business-to-business commercial\nrelationships provide EVgo with revenue or cash payments based on commitments to build new infrastructure, provide\nguaranteed access to charging, and provide marketing, data and software-driven services. EVgo also earns revenue from the\nsale of regulatory credits generated through sales of electricity and its operation and ownership of its DCFC network. EVgo\nbelieves this combination of revenue streams can drive long-term margin expansion and customer retention.\nSpecifically, charging network revenue is earned through the following streams:\n● Charging Revenue, Retail: EVgo sells electricity directly to drivers who access EVgo’s publicly available networked\nchargers. Various pricing plans exist for customers and drivers have the choice to charge through a subscription\noffering or a variety of pay-as-you-go plans. Drivers locate the chargers through EVgo’s mobile application, their\nvehicle’s in-dash navigation system, or third-party databases, such as PlugShare, that license charger-location\ninformation from EVgo. EVgo chargers are generally installed in parking spaces owned or leased by commercial or\npublic-entity Site Hosts that desire to provide charging services at their respective locations. Commercial Site Hosts\ninclude retail and grocery stores, offices, medical complexes, airports and convenience stores. EVgo offerings are\nwell aligned with the goals of Site Hosts, as many commercial businesses increasingly view charging capabilities as\nessential to attracting tenants, employees, customers and visitors, and achieve sustainability goals. Site Hosts are\ngenerally able to obtain these benefits at no cost when partnering with EVgo through the Company’s owner and/or\noperator model, in which EVgo is responsible for the development, construction, and operation of chargers located\non Site Hosts’ properties. In many cases, Site Hosts will earn revenue from license payments in the form of parking\nspace rental fees that EVgo pays in exchange for use of the site.\n● Charging Revenue, Commercial: High volume fleet customers, such as transportation networking companies or\ndelivery services, can access EVgo’s charging infrastructure through EVgo’s vast public network. Pricing for\ncharging services is most often negotiated directly with the fleet owner based on the business needs and usage\npatterns of the fleet. In these arrangements EVgo contracts with and bills, either the fleet owner directly or an\nindividual fleet driver utilizing EVgo’s chargers.\n33\nTable of Contents\nIn addition to offering access to its public network, EVgo offers dedicated charging solutions to fleets. Through its\nfleet product, EVgo develops, builds, and services charging assets for fleets either at their own depot locations or at\noff-site charging hubs that EVgo has secured without requiring a fleet to directly incur capital expenditures. EVgo\noffers a variety of pricing models for dedicated charging solutions, including a mix of volumetric commitments and\nvariable and fixed payments for provision of charging services. Together, EVgo’s dedicated charging solutions and\npublic fleet charging services provide fleets with charging infrastructure options that are robust and flexible as the\ntransition to electrified transportation accelerates.\n● Charging Revenue, OEM: EVgo is a pioneer in OEM charging programs with revenue models to meet a wide variety\nof OEM objectives related to the availability of charging infrastructure and the provision of charging services for EV\ndrivers. EVgo contracts directly with OEMs to provide charging services to drivers who have purchased or leased\nsuch OEMs’ EVs and who access EVgo’s public charger network. Other related services currently provided to OEMs\nby EVgo include co-marketing, data services and digital application services. EVgo’s OEM relationships are a core\ncustomer-acquisition channel.\n● Regulatory Credit Sales: As a charging station owner and operator, EVgo earns regulatory credits, such as Low\nCarbon Fuel Standard (“LCFS”) credits and other regulatory credits, in states where such programs are enacted\ncurrently, including the Fast Charging Infrastructure program in California. These credits are generated through\ncharging station operations based on the volume of kWh sold. EVgo earns additional revenue through the sale of\nthese credits to buyers obligated to purchase the credits to comply with the program mandates.\n● Network Revenue, OEM: This revenue stream represents revenue related to contracts that have significant charger\ninfrastructure build programs, which represent set-up costs under Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting\nStandards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”). Proceeds from\nthese contracts are allocated to performance obligations including marketing activities, memberships, reservations\nand the expiration of unused charging credits. Marketing activities are recognized at a point in time as the services\nare performed and measurement is based on amounts spent. For memberships and reservations, revenue is\nrecognized over time and measured based on the charging activity of subscriber members at each measurement\nperiod. Any unused charging credits are recognized as breakage using the proportional method or, for programs\nwhere there is not enough information to determine the pattern of rights exercised by the customer, the remote\nmethod.\nEVgo generates non-charging network revenue from the following streams:\n● eXtend Revenue: Through EVgo eXtend, EVgo provides hardware, design, and construction services for charging\nsites, as well as ongoing operations, maintenance and networking and software integration solutions, while\ncustomers purchase and retain ownership of the charging assets. Existing customers with EVgo accounts are able to\naccess eXtend chargers through the EVgo app, among other options. For some EVgo eXtend customers, EVgo also\nprovides grant application support and related services.\n● Ancillary Revenue: EVgo offers a variety of software-driven digital, development and operations services to\ncustomers. These offerings currently include customization of digital applications, charging data integration, loyalty\nprograms, access to chargers behind parking lot or garage pay gates, microtargeted advertising and charging\nreservations as well as all services provided under PlugShare such as data, research and advertising services and\nequipment procurement and operational services for customers operating dedicated networks. EVgo continues to\nevaluate and engage in opportunities to use its foundational expertise in charging infrastructure to provide value-\nadded services to the rapidly growing EV ecosystem.\nRecent Developments\nGeopolitical and Macroeconomic Environment\nDuring the last several years, the global economy has experienced disruption and sustained volatility due to a number of\nfactors, such as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the conflict between Israel and the broader Middle East\n34\nTable of Contents\nregion have led to disruptions, instability and volatility in global markets and industries and will likely continue to lead to,\ngeopolitical instability, market uncertainty and supply disruptions. Additionally, recent inflationary pressures have resulted in\nand may continue to result in increases to the costs of charging equipment and personnel, which could in turn cause capital\nexpenditures and operating costs to rise. Notwithstanding the current easing of inflation and general improvement in the\nmacroeconomic environment, EVgo remains vigilant of factors that may have the effects of raising the cost of capital and\ndepressing economic growth.\nThe current economic environment remains uncertain, and the extent to which EVgo’s operating and financial results for\nfuture periods will be impacted by the conflicts in Ukraine, Israel and the broader Middle East region, rates of inflation,\ninstability in the financial services sector, supply-chain disruptions, government efforts to reduce inflation and any recession\nwill largely depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. In\naddition, continued long lead times of grid equipment such as transformers may impact EVgo’s development cycle.\nGovernment EV Initiatives\nIn order to encourage the use of EVs, the U.S. federal government and some state and local governments provide\nincentives to end users and owners of EVs and EV charging stations in the form of rebates, tax credits, low-cost funding and\nother financial incentives that promote EV adoption and related EV charging infrastructure. EVgo believes the promotion of\nEVs and the installation of related EV charging infrastructure will continue in part due to the ongoing implementation of the\nInfrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (the “Bipartisan Infrastructure Law”) and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the\n“Inflation Reduction Act”), which included extensions, expansions and revisions of various tax credits relating to EVs and EV\ncharging infrastructure and may provide more flexibility and options in monetizing such credits. In particular, the Inflation\nReduction Act (i) expanded and extended tax credits for EV charging infrastructure and new EVs while also amending rules\nfor vehicles to qualify for such credits, (ii) introduced tax credits for used EVs and commercial EVs and (iii) introduced the\nconcept of transferability for certain tax credits, providing an additional option to monetize such credits.\nHowever, tax incentives may expire, grant programs will end when the allocated funding from the Bipartisan\nInfrastructure Law is exhausted, or may be impacted as a matter of regulatory or legislative policy. For example, the results of\nthe 2024 Presidential and Congressional elections and resulting legislative or regulatory actions, if pursued, could impact the\navailability or value of these incentives. Further, the impact of the Inflation Reduction Act and other government EV\ninitiatives, including regulatory requirements and restrictions that may impact the ability of EVgo and its competitors to take\nadvantage of such initiatives, cannot be known with any certainty at this time, and EVgo may not reap any or all of the\nexpected benefits of the Inflation Reduction Act or the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law if material changes are made to these\nlaws or the regulations issued thereunder, which could negatively affect the EV market and adversely impact EVgo’s business\noperations and expansion potential.\nIn addition, a number of states offer various rebates, grants and tax credits to incentivize both EV and EVSE purchases.\nAdditionally, in many states, utilities offer rebates or other incentive programs, typically called “make-ready” programs, to\nincentivize the development of EV charging infrastructure.\nKey Components of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nEVgo’s revenue is generated across various business lines. The majority of EVgo’s revenue is generated from the sale of\ncharging services, which are comprised of retail, commercial and OEM business lines, and its eXtend offering. In addition,\nEVgo generates ancillary revenue through the sale of data services and consumer retail services. EVgo also offers network\nservices to OEM customers, including memberships and marketing. Finally, as a result of owning and operating the EV\ncharging stations, EVgo earns regulatory credits such as LCFS credits, which are sold to generate additional revenue.\n35\nTable of Contents\nCost of Sales\nCharging Network. Charging network cost of sales consists primarily of energy usage fees, site operating and\nmaintenance expenses, network charges, warranty and repair services, and site lease and related expenses associated with\ncharging stations.\nOther. Other cost of sales is primarily related to costs associated with the eXtend business and the sale of data services\nand other ancillary services.\nDepreciation, Net of Capital-Build Amortization. Depreciation, net of capital-build amortization, consists of depreciation\nrelated to EVgo’s property and equipment associated with charging equipment and installation and is partially offset by the\namortization of EVgo’s capital-build liabilities associated with third-party funding received for charging stations and other\nprograms.\nGross Profit (Loss) and Gross Margin\nGross profit (loss) consists of EVgo’s revenue less its cost of sales. Gross margin is gross profit (loss) as a percentage of\nrevenue.\nOperating Expenses\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses primarily consist of payroll and related personnel\nexpenses, IT and office services, customer service, office rent expense and professional services. EVgo expects its general and\nadministrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as it continues to grow its business. EVgo also expects to continue to\nincur additional expenses related to compliance and reporting obligations pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC,\ngeneral insurance and directors’ and officers’ insurance, investor relations and other professional services.\nDepreciation, Amortization and Accretion. Depreciation, amortization and accretion consists of depreciation related to\nEVgo’s property, equipment and software not associated with charging equipment and, therefore, not included in the\ndepreciation, net of capital-build amortization expenses recorded in cost of sales. This also includes amortization of EVgo’s\nintangible assets and accretion related to EVgo’s asset retirement obligations.\nOperating Profit (Loss) and Operating Margin\nOperating profit (loss) consists of EVgo’s gross profit (loss) less total operating expenses. Operating margin is operating\nprofit (loss) as a percentage of revenue.\nInterest Income\nInterest income consists primarily of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and debt securities.\nChange in Fair Values of Warrant and Earnout Liabilities\nThe change in the fair values of the warrant and earnout liabilities reflects the mark-to-market adjustments associated\nwith warrants to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock and earnout liabilities for each reporting period.\nIncome Taxes\nEVgo’s provision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes related to federal and state jurisdictions where\nbusiness is conducted related to the Company’s ownership in EVgo OpCo.\n36\nTable of Contents\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest\nNet income (loss) attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest represents the share of net income or loss that is\nattributable to EVgo’s Class B common stock held by EVgo Holdings.\nKey Performance Indicators\nEVgo management uses several performance metrics to manage the business and evaluate financial and operating\nperformance:\nNetwork Throughput on the EVgo Network\nNetwork throughput represents the total amount of GWh consumed by EVs using chargers and charging stations that\nEVgo has operational on its network (excluding eXtend chargers and charging stations) (the “EVgo Network”). EVgo\ntypically monitors GWh sales by three components: business line, customer and customer class. EVgo believes monitoring of\ncomponent trends and contributions is the appropriate way to monitor and measure business-related health.\nNumber of DC Stalls on the EVgo Network\nNumber of DC stalls represents the total number of DC stalls (energized, inspected and commissioned) on the EVgo\nNetwork (“DC Stalls”). One stall can charge one vehicle at a time. There are certain configurations of EVgo sites where one\nDC charger is capable of charging only one vehicle at a time; all chargers at such a site are counted as one stall per one\ncharger. There are certain configurations of EVgo sites where one DC charger is capable of charging two vehicles\nsimultaneously; all chargers at such a site are counted as two stalls per one charger.\nThe following table presents network throughput and the number of DC Stalls on the EVgo Network:\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nNetwork throughput (GWh) on the EVgo Network for the three months ended 78 37\nNetwork throughput (GWh) on the EVgo Network for the nine months ended 197 80\nNumber of DC Stalls on the EVgo Network (in thousands) as of 3.4 2.7\nFactors Affecting EVgo’s Operating Results\nEVgo believes its performance and future success depend on a number of factors, including those discussed below and in\n“Part II, Item 1A., Risk Factors.”\nEV Sales\nEVgo’s revenue growth is directly tied to the adoption and continued acceptance and usage of passenger and commercial\nEVs, which it believes drives the demand for electricity, charging infrastructure and charging services. The market for EVs is\nstill rapidly evolving and, although demand for EVs has grown in recent years, there is no guarantee of such future demand.\nAdditionally, as demand increases, the supply must keep pace for adoption to continue to accelerate at a rapid pace. Factors\nimpacting the adoption of EVs include perceptions about EV features, quality, safety, performance and cost; perceptions about\nthe limited range over which EVs may be driven on a single battery charge; availability of services for EVs; consumers’\nperception about the convenience, speed, reliability and cost of EV charging; volatility in the price of gasoline and diesel; EV\nsupply chain shortages and disruptions including, but not limited to, availability of certain components (e.g., semiconductors\nand critical raw materials necessary for the production of EVs and EV batteries), the ability of EV OEMs to ramp-up EV\nproduction and/or allocate sufficient quantities of EV models to the U.S. market; domestic content requirements or other\npolicy constraints; availability of batteries and battery materials; availability, cost and desirability of other alternative fuel\nvehicles, including plug-in hybrid EVs and high fuel-economy gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles; increases in fuel\nefficiency; regulations applicable to vehicle emissions and fuel economy; and availability of federal and state credits for EV\npurchases. In addition, macroeconomic factors could impact demand for\n37\nTable of Contents\nEVs, particularly since the sales price of EVs can be more expensive than traditional gasoline-powered vehicles. If the market\nfor EVs does not develop as expected or if there is any slowdown or delay in overall adoption of EVs, EVgo’s operating\nresults may be adversely affected.\nElectrification of Fleets\nEVgo faces competition in the emerging fleet electrification segment, including from certain fleet customers who may opt\nto install and own charging equipment on their property; however, EVgo believes its unique set of offerings to fleets and its\nexisting charging network position EVgo advantageously to win business from fleets. Fleet owners are generally more\nsensitive to the total cost of ownership of a vehicle than private-vehicle owners. As such, electrification of vehicle fleets may\noccur more slowly or more rapidly than management forecasts based on the cost to purchase, operate and maintain EVs and\nthe general availability of such vehicles relative to those of internal combustion engine vehicles. The ability of EVgo and its\ncompetitors to offer competitive charging services and value-added ancillary services may impact the pace at which fleets\nelectrify and may impact EVgo’s ability to capture market share in fleets. Additionally, federal, state and local government\nsupport and regulations directed at fleets (or lack thereof) may accelerate or delay fleet electrification and increase or reduce\nEVgo’s business opportunity.\nCompetition\nThe EV charging industry is increasingly competitive. The principal competitive factors in the industry include charger\ncount, locations, accessibility and reliability; charger connectivity to EVs and ability to charge widely adopted standards;\nspeed of charging relative to expected vehicle dwell times at a location; DCFC network reliability, scale and local density;\nsoftware-enabled service offerings and overall customer experience; operator brand, track record and reputation; access to\nequipment vendors and service providers; policy incentives; and pricing. Existing competitors may expand their product\nofferings and sales strategies, new competitors may enter the market and certain fleet customers may choose to install and\noperate their own charging infrastructure. If EVgo’s market share decreases due to increased competition, its revenue and\nability to generate profits in the future may be impacted.\nGovernment Mandates, Incentives and Programs\nThe U.S. federal government and some state and local governments provide incentives to end users and owners of EVs\nand EV charging stations in the form of rebates, tax credits, low-cost funding and other financial incentives, such as payments\nfor regulatory credits. The EV market relies on these governmental rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives to\nsignificantly lower the effective price of EVs and EV charging stations and to otherwise financially support these industries.\nHowever, these incentives may expire on a particular date, end when the allocated funding is exhausted, or may be reduced or\nterminated as a matter of regulatory or legislative policy. For example, the results of the 2024 Presidential and Congressional\nelections and resulting legislative or regulatory actions, if pursued, could impact the availability or value of these incentives or\nreduce access to such low-cost funding. Further, EVgo has historically claimed federal tax credits under Section 30C of the\nCode. The Inflation Reduction Act revised the eligibility criteria for these credits, and there can be no assurance that the EV\ncharging stations placed into service by EVgo will meet the revised requirements, and compliance with such requirements\ncould increase EVgo’s labor and other costs. Any reduction in rebates, tax credits or other financial incentives available to\nEVs or EV charging stations could negatively affect the EV market and adversely impact EVgo’s business operations and\nexpansion potential. In addition, there is no assurance that EVgo will have the necessary tax attributes to utilize any such\ncredits that are available and may not be able to monetize such credits on favorable terms. Further, certain features of EVgo\nOpCo’s ownership may limit the available tax credit that can be monetized or utilized.\nTechnology Risks\nEVgo relies on numerous internally developed and externally sourced hardware and software technologies to operate its\nnetwork and generate earnings. EVgo engages a variety of third-party vendors for non-proprietary hardware and software\ncomponents and software-as-a-service elements. The ability of EVgo to continue to integrate its technology stack with\ntechnological advances in the wider EV ecosystem including EV model characteristics, charging standards, charging\nhardware, software and battery chemistries and value-added customer services will determine EVgo’s sustained\n38\nTable of Contents\ncompetitiveness in offering charging services. There is a risk that some or all of the components of the EV technology\necosystem become obsolete and that EVgo will be required to make significant investments to continue to effectively operate\nits business. For example, a majority of the largest OEMs have announced plans to adopt the NACS standard in their future\nEVs. SAE International, a standards-developing organization for automotive engineering professionals, is currently working\non an initiative to adapt Tesla’s specifications for NACS into the SAE J3400 industry standard. EVgo expects that it will begin\nadding NACS connectors to its fast-charging network in late 2024; however, integrating NACS connectors in future charger\ninstallations and on certain existing chargers will require significant investment and management attention.\nEVgo’s management believes EVgo’s business model is well-positioned to enable EVgo to remain technology-, vendor-\nand OEM-agnostic over time and allow the business to remain competitive regardless of long-term technological shifts in\nEVs, batteries or modes of charging.\nSales of Regulatory Credits\nEVgo derives revenue from selling regulatory credits earned for participating in LCFS programs, or other similar carbon\nor emissions trading schemes, in various jurisdictions in the U.S. EVgo currently sells these credits at market prices. These\ncredits are exposed to various market and supply and demand dynamics which can drive price volatility and which are\ndifficult to predict. Price fluctuations in credits may have a material effect on future results of operations. The availability of\nsuch credits depends on continued governmental support for these programs. If these programs are modified, reduced or\neliminated, EVgo’s ability to generate this revenue in the future would be adversely impacted. EVgo is currently monitoring\nproposed enhancements to California’s LCFS program, which is being evaluated at the California Air Resources Board. In\naddition to California, EVgo is monitoring proposed new Clean Fuels programs in Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan,\nMinnesota, New Jersey and New York.\nSeasonality\nEVgo believes that EV charging is subject to seasonality related to driving, travel and economic activity that impacts\ndemand for charging. For example, Americans typically drive more miles in the summer months and fewer in the winter\nmonths, especially in January and February. EVgo’s rideshare drivers also typically experience lower activity levels in the first\nquarter. The exact impacts that these underlying trends have on charging demand has been difficult to discern given the\ngrowth in throughput and utilization that EVgo has experienced over the past several years. Lastly, many utilities tend to\ncharge higher rates in the summer (typically defined as a four month period starting in June), than the rest of the year.\n39\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nThe table below presents EVgo’s results of operations:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Change\n(dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 $ %\nRevenue\nCharging, retail $ 26,656 $ 13,357 $ 13,299 100 %\nCharging, commercial 8,622 4,042 4,580 113 %\nCharging, OEM 4,305 1,477 2,828 191 %\nRegulatory credit sales 2,191 1,807 384 21 %\nNetwork, OEM 1,278 1,114 164 15 %\nTotal charging network 43,052 21,797 21,255 98 %\neXtend 21,912 10,475 11,437 109 %\nAncillary 2,571 2,835 (264) (9)%\nTotal revenue 67,535 35,107 32,428 92 %\nCost of sales\nCharging network1 28,872 15,556 13,316 86 %\nOther1 20,753 10,328 10,425 101 %\nDepreciation, net of capital-build amortization 11,542 8,619 2,923 34 %\nTotal cost of sales 61,167 34,503 26,664 77 %\nGross profit 6,368 604 5,764 954 %\nOperating expenses\nGeneral and administrative 33,114 32,001 1,113 3 %\nDepreciation, amortization and accretion 5,043 4,975 68 1 %\nTotal operating expenses 38,157 36,976 1,181 3 %\nOperating loss (31,789) (36,372) 4,583 13 %\nInterest income 1,809 2,898 (1,089) (38)%\nOther (expense) income, net (1) 1 (2) (200)%\nChange in fair value of earnout liability (374) 442 (816) (185)%\nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities (2,910) 4,774 (7,684) (161)%\nTotal other (expense) income, net (1,476) 8,115 (9,591) (118)%\nLoss before income tax expense (33,265) (28,257) (5,008) (18)%\nIncome tax expense (25) — (25) *\nNet loss (33,290) (28,257) (5,033) (18)%\nLess: net loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest (21,581) (18,536) (3,045) (16)%\nNet loss attributable to Class A common stockholders $ (11,709) $ (9,721) $ (1,988) (20)%\nGross margin 9.4 % 1.7 %\nOperating margin (47.1)% (103.6)%\nNetwork throughput (GWh) 78 37\nNumber of DC Stalls on the EVgo Network (in thousands) as of 3.4 2.7\n1 In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company changed the presentation of cost of sales to disaggregate such costs between “charging network” and\n“other.” Previously reported amounts have been updated to conform to the current presentation.\n* Percentage not meaningful.\nRevenue\nTotal revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased $32.4 million, or 92%, to $67.5 million compared\nto $35.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. As further discussed below, the increase in revenue was\nprimarily due to a $13.3 million increase in retail charging revenue, an $11.4 million increase in eXtend revenue, a $4.6\nmillion increase in commercial charging revenue, and a $2.8 million increase in OEM charging revenue.\n40\nTable of Contents\nCharging Revenue, Retail. Charging revenue, retail, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased $13.3\nmillion, or 100%, to $26.7 million compared to $13.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Period-over-\nperiod growth was primarily due to an overall increase in throughput driven primarily by increased charging volume from a\ngreater number of customers and more throughput per customer and, to a lesser extent, price increases.\nCharging Revenue, Commercial. Charging revenue, commercial, for the three months ended September 30, 2024\nincreased $4.6 million, or 113%, to $8.6 million compared to $4.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nPeriod-over-period growth was primarily due to higher charging volumes by the Company’s public fleet customers and, to a\nlesser extent, price increases.\nCharging Revenue, OEM. Charging revenue, OEM, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased $2.8\nmillion, or 191%, to $4.3 million compared to $1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Period-over-\nperiod growth was primarily due to an increase in active OEM customers and increased throughput per customer.\nRegulatory Credit Sales. Regulatory credit sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased $0.4 million,\nor 21%, to $2.2 million compared to $1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to the impact of\nincreased throughput, partially offset by decreased market prices.\nNetwork Revenue, OEM. Network revenue, OEM, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased $0.2 million,\nor 15%, to $1.3 million compared to $1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The period-over-period\nincrease was due to increased marketing activities and membership fees from OEM customers, partially offset by decreased\nbreakage.\neXtend Revenue. eXtend revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased $11.4 million, or 109%, to\n$21.9 million compared to $10.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to\nan increase in construction projects in process or completed, partially offset by decreased equipment sales, compared to the\nsame prior-year period.\nAncillary Revenue. Ancillary revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased $0.3 million, or 9%, to\n$2.6 million compared to $2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to\ndecreased engineering and construction services.\nCost of Sales\nCharging Network. Charging network cost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased $13.3\nmillion, or 86%, to $28.9 million compared to $15.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in\ncharging network cost was primarily due to a $9.0 million increase in usage-related energy costs resulting from increased\nthroughput and a $4.3 million increase in non-energy charging costs.\nOther. Other cost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased $10.4 million, or 101%, to $20.8\nmillion compared to $10.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in other cost of sales was\nprimarily due to an increase in costs related to eXtend, partially offset by a decrease of $0.4 million in costs related to\nancillary revenue.\nDepreciation, Net of Capital-Build Amortization. Depreciation, net of capital-build amortization, for the three months\nended September 30, 2024 increased $2.9 million, or 34%, to $11.5 million compared to $8.6 million for the three months\nended September 30, 2023 due to the growth of EVgo’s charging network.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased to $6.4 million compared to $0.6 million for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to increased gross profit from charging revenues and eXtend revenue,\npartially offset by increased depreciation, net of capital-build amortization. Gross margin for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 was 9.4% compared to 1.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to\n41\nTable of Contents\nhigher margins from charging revenue resulting from improved leveraging of charging station costs, partially offset by lower\nmargins due to decreased contributions from higher margin ancillary revenues and regulatory credit sales in the three months\nended September 30, 2024 compared to the same prior-year period.\nOperating Expenses\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 increased $1.1 million, or 3%, to $33.1 million compared to $32.0 million for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by a $1.0 million increase in payroll due to an increase in the overall\nheadcount during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same prior-year period and a $0.7 million\nincrease in legal and professional services, partially offset by a $1.2 million decrease in impairment expense.\nDepreciation, Amortization and Accretion. Depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023 was $5.0 million.\nOperating Loss and Operating Margin\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, EVgo had an operating loss of $31.8 million, a decrease of $4.6\nmillion, or 13%, compared to $36.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in operating loss\nwas driven primarily by an increase in gross profit, partially offset by increased general and administrative expenses.\nOperating margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was negative 47.1% compared to negative 103.6% for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to improved leveraging of operating expenses and gross margin.\nInterest Income\nInterest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased $1.1 million, or 38%, to $1.8 million compared\nto $2.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due primarily to less cash and cash\nequivalents held in a high interest rate account by the Company and, to a lesser extent, lower interest rates during the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same prior year period.\nOther (Expense) Income, Net\nOther (expense) income, net, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was de minimis.\nChanges in Fair Values of Warrant and Earnout Liabilities\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, there was a $3.3 million loss resulting from the change in fair values of\nwarrant and earnout liabilities compared to a $5.2 million gain for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change\nbetween periods was primarily due to an increase in the fair value of the warrant and earnout liabilities during the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 compared to a decrease during the same prior-year period. See “Part I, Item 1. Financial\nStatements – Note 10 – Fair Value Measurements” for more information.\nIncome Taxes\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, EVgo’s income taxes and effective tax rates were de minimis.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and 2023, EVgo maintained a full valuation allowance on EVgo’s net deferred tax assets.\nNet Loss\nNet loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $33.3 million, compared to a net loss of $28.3 million for\nthe three months ended September 30, 2023. The change was primarily driven by an $8.5 million impact from changes in the\nfair values of the warrant and earnout liabilities and a $1.1 million increase in general and administrative expenses, partially\noffset by increased gross profit of $5.8 million.\n42\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nThe table below presents EVgo’s results of operations:\nNine Months Ended September 30, Change\n(dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 $ %\nRevenue\nCharging, retail $ 67,318 $ 29,057 $ 38,261 132 %\nCharging, commercial 21,555 8,175 13,380 164 %\nCharging, OEM 10,675 3,015 7,660 254 %\nRegulatory credit sales 5,974 4,635 1,339 29 %\nNetwork, OEM 6,328 4,555 1,773 39 %\nTotal charging network 111,850 49,437 62,413 126 %\neXtend 68,730 54,048 14,682 27 %\nAncillary 8,732 7,474 1,258 17 %\nTotal revenue 189,312 110,959 78,353 71 %\nCost of sales\nCharging network1 72,361 37,544 34,817 93 %\nOther1 64,294 44,997 19,297 43 %\nDepreciation, net of capital-build amortization 33,050 22,244 10,806 49 %\nTotal cost of sales 169,705 104,785 64,920 62 %\nGross profit 19,607 6,174 13,433 218 %\nOperating expenses\nGeneral and administrative 101,167 104,223 (3,056) (3)%\nDepreciation, amortization and accretion 14,986 14,542 444 3 %\nTotal operating expenses 116,153 118,765 (2,612) (2)%\nOperating loss (96,546) (112,591) 16,045 14 %\nInterest income 6,146 7,095 (949) (13)%\nOther (expense) income, net (18) 1 (19) *\nChange in fair value of earnout liability (65) 875 (940) (107)%\nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities (515) 5,785 (6,300) (109)%\nTotal other income, net 5,548 13,756 (8,208) (60)%\nLoss before income tax expense (90,998) (98,835) 7,837 8 %\nIncome tax expense (95) (42) (53) (126)%\nNet loss (91,093) (98,877) 7,784 8 %\nLess: net loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest (59,174) (69,054) 9,880 14 %\nNet loss attributable to Class A common stockholders $ (31,919) $ (29,823) $ (2,096) (7)%\nGross margin 10.4 % 5.6 %\nOperating margin (51.0)% (101.5)%\nNetwork throughput (GWh) on the EVgo Network 197 80\nNumber of DC Stalls on the EVgo Network (in thousands) as of 3.4 2.7\n1 In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company changed the presentation of cost of sales to disaggregate such costs between “charging network” and\n“other.” Previously reported amounts have been updated to conform to the current presentation.\n* Percentage more than 999%.\n43\nTable of Contents\nRevenue\nTotal revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased $78.4 million, or 71%, to $189.3 million\ncompared to $111.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As further discussed below, the increase in\nrevenue was primarily due to a $38.3 million increase in retail charging revenue, a $14.7 million increase in eXtend revenue, a\n$13.4 million increase in commercial charging revenue, and a $7.7 million increase in OEM charging revenue.\nCharging Revenue, Retail. Charging revenue, retail, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased $38.3\nmillion, or 132%, to $67.3 million compared to $29.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Period-over-\nperiod growth was primarily due to an overall increase in throughput driven primarily by increased charging volume from a\ngreater number of customers and more throughput per customer and, to a lesser extent, price increases.\nCharging Revenue, Commercial. Charging revenue, commercial, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased\n$13.4 million, or 164%, to $21.6 million compared to $8.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Period-\nover-period growth was primarily due to higher charging volumes by the Company’s public fleet customers and, to a lesser\nextent, price increases.\nCharging Revenue, OEM. Charging revenue, OEM, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased $7.7\nmillion, or 254%, to $10.7 million compared to $3.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Period-over-\nperiod growth was primarily due to an increased enrollment of OEM customers resulting in increased throughput.\nRegulatory Credit Sales. Regulatory credit sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased $1.3 million, or\n29%, to $6.0 million compared to $4.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to the impact of increased\nthroughput, partially offset by decreased market prices.\nNetwork Revenue, OEM. Network revenue, OEM, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased $1.8 million,\nor 39%, to $6.3 million compared to $4.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The period-over-period\nincrease was primarily due to increased marketing activities and membership fees from OEM customers, partially offset by\ndecreased breakage.\neXtend Revenue. eXtend revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased $14.7 million, or 27%, to\n$68.7 million compared to $54.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an\nincrease in construction projects in process or completed, partially offset by decreased equipment sales, compared to the same\nprior year period.\nAncillary Revenue. Ancillary revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased $1.3 million, or 17%, to\n$8.7 million compared to $7.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to\nincreased equipment sales, partially offset by decreased revenue from dedicated fleet contracts.\nCost of Sales\nCharging Network. Charging network cost of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased $34.8\nmillion, or 93%, to $72.4 million compared to $37.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in\ncharging network cost was primarily due to a $24.1 million increase in usage-related energy costs resulting from increased\nthroughput and a $10.7 million increase in non-energy charging costs.\nOther. Other cost of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased $19.3 million, or 43%, to $64.3\nmillion compared to $45.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in other cost of sales was\nprimarily due to an increase of $17.8 million in costs to support eXtend revenue and an increase of $0.8 million in costs to\nsupport ancillary revenue.\nDepreciation, Net of Capital-Build Amortization. Depreciation, net of capital-build amortization, for the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 increased $10.8 million, or 49%, to $33.1 million compared to $22.2 million for the nine months\nended September 30, 2023 due to the growth of EVgo’s charging network.\n44\nTable of Contents\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased to $19.6 million compared to $6.2 million for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to increased gross profit from charging revenues, partially offset by\ndecreased gross profit from eXtend revenues and increased depreciation, net of capital-build amortization. Gross margin for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 10.4% compared to 5.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023\nprimarily due to higher margins on charging revenue resulting from improved leveraging of charging station costs, partially\noffset by lower margins from eXtend revenues resulting from a shift of higher equipment sales in the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 to higher construction revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nOperating Expenses\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 decreased $3.1 million, or 3%, to $101.2 million compared to $104.2 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by a $3.0 million decrease in impairment expense, a $1.4 million\ndecrease in payroll expenses primarily driven by lower share-based compensation, and a $0.7 million decrease in insurance\nexpense, partially offset by a $0.8 million increase in storage and freight costs.\nDepreciation, Amortization and Accretion. Depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 increased $0.5 million, or 3% to $15.0 million compared to $14.5 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in software amortization, partially offset by a decrease\nin amortization of intangible assets.\nOperating Loss and Operating Margin\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, EVgo had an operating loss of $96.5 million, an improvement of\n$16.0 million, or 14%, compared to $112.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in operating\nloss was driven primarily by an increase in gross profit and decreased general and administrative expenses. Operating margin\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was negative 51.0% compared to negative 101.5% for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 primarily due to improved gross margin and improved leveraging of operating expenses.\nInterest Income\nInterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased $0.9 million, or 13%, to $6.1 million compared\nto $7.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the decreased cash held by\nthe Company during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same prior-year period.\nOther (Expense) Income, Net\nOther (expense) income, net, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was de minimis.\nChanges in Fair Values of Warrant and Earnout Liabilities\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was a $0.6 million loss resulting from the change in fair values of\nwarrant and earnout liabilities compared to a gain of $6.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change\nbetween periods was primarily due to an increase in the fair values of the warrant and earnout liabilities during the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, compared to a decrease in the fair values of the warrant and earnout liabilities during the\nsame prior-year period. See “Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 10 – Fair Value Measurements” for more\ninformation.\n45\nTable of Contents\nIncome Taxes\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, EVgo’s income taxes and effective tax rates were de minimis.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and 2023, EVgo maintained a full valuation allowance on EVgo’s net deferred tax assets.\nNet Loss\nNet loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $91.1 million, compared to $98.9 million for the nine months\nended September 30, 2023. The improvement was primarily driven by increased gross profit of $13.4 million and a $3.1\nmillion decrease in general and administrative expenses, partially offset by a $7.2 million decrease from changes in the fair\nvalues of the warrant and earnout liabilities.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis Quarterly Report includes the following non-GAAP financial measures, in each case as defined below: “Charging\nNetwork Margin,” “Adjusted Cost of Sales,” “Adjusted Cost of Sales as a Percentage of Revenue,” “Adjusted Gross Profit\n(Loss),” “Adjusted Gross Margin,” “Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses,” “Adjusted General and Administrative\nExpenses as a Percentage of Revenue,” “EBITDA,” “EBITDA Margin,” “Adjusted EBITDA,” “Adjusted EBITDA Margin,”\nand “Capital Expenditures, Net of Capital Offsets.” With respect to Capital Expenditures, Net of Capital Offsets, pursuant to\nthe terms of certain OEM contracts, EVgo is paid well in advance of when revenue can be recognized, and usually, the\npayment is tied to the number of stalls that commence operations under the applicable contractual arrangement while the\nrelated revenue is deferred at the time of payment and is recognized as revenue over time as EVgo provides charging and\nother services to the OEM and the OEM’s customers. EVgo management therefore uses these measures internally to establish\nforecasts, budgets, and operational goals to manage and monitor its business, including the cash used for, and the return on, its\ninvestment in its charging infrastructure. EVgo believes that these measures are useful to investors in evaluating EVgo’s\nperformance and help to depict a meaningful representation of the performance of the underlying business, enabling EVgo to\nevaluate and plan more effectively for the future.\nCharging Network Margin, Adjusted Cost of Sales, Adjusted Cost of Sales as a Percentage of Revenue, Adjusted Gross\nProfit (Loss), Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses, Adjusted General and Administrative\nExpenses as a Percentage of Revenue, EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Capital\nExpenditures, Net of Capital Offsets are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP\nfinancial measures used by other companies. These measures should not be considered as measures of financial performance\nunder GAAP and the items excluded from or included in these metrics are significant components in understanding and\nassessing EVgo’s financial performance. These metrics should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) or any\nother performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP.\nEVgo defines Charging Network Margin as total charging network revenue less charging network cost of sales divided by\ntotal charging network revenue. EVgo defines Adjusted Cost of Sales as cost of sales before: (i) depreciation, net of capital-\nbuild amortization, and (ii) share-based compensation. EVgo defines Adjusted Cost of Sales as a Percentage of Revenue as\nAdjusted Cost of Sales as a percentage of revenue. EVgo defines Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss) as revenue less Adjusted Cost\nof Sales. EVgo defines Adjusted Gross Margin as Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss) as a percentage of revenue. EVgo defines\nAdjusted General and Administrative Expenses as general and administrative expenses before (i) share-based compensation,\n(ii) loss on disposal of property and equipment, net of insurance recoveries, and impairment expense, (iii) bad debt expense\n(recoveries), and (iv) certain other items that management believes are not indicative of EVgo’s ongoing performance. EVgo\ndefines Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses as a Percentage of Revenue as Adjusted General and Administrative\nExpenses as a percentage of revenue. EVgo defines EBITDA as net income (loss) before (i) depreciation, net of capital-build\namortization, (ii) amortization, (iii) accretion, (iv) interest income, (v) interest expense, and (vi) income tax expense (benefit).\nEVgo defines EBITDA Margin as EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. EVgo defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA plus (i)\nshare-based compensation, (ii) loss on disposal of property and equipment, net of insurance recoveries, and impairment\nexpense, (iii) loss (gain) on investments, (iv) bad debt expense (recoveries), (v) change in fair value of earnout liability, (vi)\nchange in fair value of warrant liabilities, and (vii) certain other items that management believes are not indicative of EVgo’s\nongoing performance. EVgo defines Adjusted EBITDA\n46\nTable of Contents\nMargin as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. EVgo defines Capital Expenditures, Net of Capital Offsets as capital\nexpenditures adjusted for the following capital offsets: (i) all payments under OEM infrastructure agreements excluding any\namounts directly attributable to OEM customer charging credit programs and pass-through of non-capital expense\nreimbursements, (ii) proceeds from capital-build funding and (iii) proceeds from the transfer of 30C income tax credits, net of\ntransaction costs.

The Company’s net\ncash outflow for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $55.7 million. EVgo believes its cash and cash equivalents\non hand as of September 30, 2024 are sufficient to meet EVgo’s current working capital and capital expenditure requirements\nfor a period of at least twelve months from the filing date of this Quarterly Report.\nTo date, EVgo’s primary sources of liquidity have been cash flows from the CRIS Business Combination, revenues from\nits various revenue streams, government grants, proceeds from the transfer of 30C income tax credits, proceeds from sales of\nEVgo’s Class A common stock, including under the ATM Program and an underwritten equity offering, and loans and equity\ncontributions from its previous owners. EVgo’s primary cash requirements include operating expenses, satisfaction of\ncommitments to various counterparties and suppliers and capital expenditures (including property and equipment). EVgo’s\nprincipal uses of cash in recent periods have been funding its operations and investing in capital expenditures, including the\npurchase of EV chargers for installation.\nIn July 2022, EVgo entered into the Delta Charger Supply Agreement and the Purchase Order with Delta, pursuant to\nwhich EVgo will purchase and Delta will sell EV chargers manufactured by Delta from time to time in specified quantities at\ncertain delivery dates over a period of four years. EVgo is obligated to purchase at least 1,000 chargers (which will enable the\nconstruction of 2,000 stalls) pursuant to the Delta Charger Supply Agreement and the Purchase Order with the option, at\nEVgo’s election, to increase the number of chargers purchased to 1,100. Under the terms of the Purchase Order, EVgo is\nrequired to make full payment on such chargers within 60 days of receipt. EVgo’s obligations under the Purchase Order are\ntake-or-pay obligations; however, EVgo’s liability is capped at a maximum of the greater of $30.0 million or 50% of the value\nof any outstanding firm orders. EVgo entered into the Delta Charger Supply Agreement and Purchase Order in order to meet\nits obligations under the Pilot Infrastructure Agreement, other potential contractual commitments and its own needs and\nintends to fund the capital expenditure required under the Delta Charger Supply Agreement and Purchase Order with proceeds\nfrom the Pilot Infrastructure Agreement as well as cash and cash equivalents on hand.\nThe term of the Tax Receivable Agreement commenced upon the completion of the CRIS Business Combination and will\ncontinue until all tax benefits that are subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement have been utilized or expired and all required\npayments are made, unless the Tax Receivable Agreement is terminated early (including upon a change of control). The actual\ntiming and amount of any payments that may be made under the Tax Receivable Agreement are unknown at this time and will\nvary based on a number of factors. However, the Company Group expects that the payments that it will be required to make to\nTRA Holders in connection with the Tax Receivable Agreement will be substantial. Any payments made by the Company\nGroup to TRA Holders under the Tax Receivable Agreement will generally reduce the amount of cash that might have\notherwise been available to EVgo or EVgo OpCo. To the extent EVgo OpCo has available cash and subject to the terms of any\ncurrent or future debt or other agreements, the EVgo OpCo A&R LLC Agreement will require EVgo OpCo to make pro rata\ncash distributions to holders of EVgo OpCo Units, including Thunder Sub, in an amount sufficient to allow the Company\nGroup to pay its taxes and to make payments under the Tax Receivable\n50\nTable of Contents\nAgreement. EVgo generally expects EVgo OpCo to fund such distributions out of available cash. However, except in cases\nwhere the Company Group elects to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement early, the Tax Receivable Agreement is\nterminated early due to certain mergers or other changes of control, or the Company Group has available cash but fails to\nmake payments when due, generally the Company Group may elect to defer payments due under the Tax Receivable\nAgreement if it does not have available cash to satisfy its payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement or if its\ncontractual obligations limit its ability to make these payments. Any such deferred payments under the Tax Receivable\nAgreement generally will accrue interest at the rate provided for in the Tax Receivable Agreement and such interest may\nsignificantly exceed the Company Group’s other costs of capital. In certain circumstances (including an early termination of\nthe Tax Receivable Agreement due to a change of control or otherwise), payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement may\nbe accelerated and/or significantly exceed the actual benefits, if any, the Company Group realizes in respect of the tax\nattributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement. In the case of such an acceleration in connection with a change of control,\nwhere applicable, EVgo generally expects the accelerated payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement to be funded out\nof the proceeds of the change of control transaction giving rise to such acceleration, which could have a significant impact on\nEVgo’s ability to consummate a change of control or the proceeds received by EVgo’s stockholders in connection with a\nchange of control. However, the Company Group may be required to fund such payment from other sources and, as a result,\nany early termination of the Tax Receivable Agreement could have a substantial negative impact on EVgo’s liquidity or\nfinancial condition.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes EVgo’s consolidated cash flows:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023\nCash flows provided by (used in) operating activities $ 5,575 $ (29,781)\nCash flows used in investing activities (70,868) (123,843)\nCash flows provided by financing activities 9,553 135,840\nNet decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ (55,740) $ (17,784)\nOperating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $5.6\nmillion compared to cash used in operating activities of $29.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe year-over-year change primarily reflected a $18.9 million increase in cash flows from operations, an $14.1 million\nincrease in cash inflows from accounts receivable, net, and an $11.0 million increase in cash flows from other current and\nnoncurrent liabilities, partially offset by a $4.2 million decrease in cash flows from deferred revenue, a $2.6 million decrease\nin cash flows from accounts payable, and a $1.8 million decrease in cash flows from prepaid expenses, other current assets\nand other assets.\nInvesting Activities. Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $70.9 million,\ncompared to $123.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease\nin purchases of property, equipment and software.\nFinancing Activities. Cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $9.6\nmillion compared to $135.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was driven primarily by the\nproceeds from the issuance of Class A common stock in the Company’s underwritten equity offering during the nine months\nended September 30, 2023.\nWorking Capital. EVgo’s working capital as of September 30, 2024 was $121.6 million, compared to $178.1 million as of\nDecember 31, 2023. The decrease was driven primarily by a $55.7 million decrease in the Company’s cash, cash equivalents\nand restricted cash and a $10.8 million increase in other current liabilities, partially offset by a $6.5 million increase in\naccounts receivable, capital-build, and a $5.2 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments. EVgo has material cash requirements for known contractual obligations and\ncommitments in the form of operating leases, purchase commitments and certain other liabilities that are disclosed in\n51\nTable of Contents\n“Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 9 – Commitments and Contingencies.” EVgo generally expects to fund these\nobligations through its existing cash and cash equivalents and future financing or cash flows from operations.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of EVgo’s financial condition and results of operations is based upon EVgo’s condensed\nconsolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of EVgo’s financial\nstatements requires the Company to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,\nliabilities, income and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases these estimates\non its historical experience and various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual\nresults experienced may vary materially and adversely from EVgo’s estimates. Revisions to estimates are recognized\nprospectively. See “Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for additional\ndetail regarding the significant accounting policies that have been followed in preparing EVgo’s condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nThe accounting policies described below are those EVgo considers to be the most critical to an understanding of its\nfinancial condition and results of operations and that require the most complex and subjective management judgment. EVgo\nconsiders its critical accounting estimates to be those related to its revenue recognition, impairment of goodwill and intangible\nassets and warrant liabilities, which are described below.\nRevenue Recognition\nEVgo recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606. Recording revenue may require judgment, including determining\nwhether an arrangement includes multiple performance obligations, whether any of those obligations are distinct and cannot\nbe combined and allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling\nprices (“SSP”). Revenue for performance obligations can be recognized over time or at a point in time depending on the\nnature of the performance obligation. Changes to the elements in an arrangement or, in EVgo’s determination, to the relative\nSSP for these elements, could materially affect the amount of earned and unearned revenue reflected in its consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nUnderstanding the complex terms of some of EVgo’s agreements and determining the appropriate time, amount and\nmethod under which the Company should recognize revenue for the related transactions requires significant judgment. The\nCompany exercises judgment in determining which promises in a contract constitute performance obligations rather than set-\nup activities. The Company determines which activities under a contract transfer a good or service to a customer rather than\nactivities that are required to fulfill a contract but do not transfer control of a good or service to the customer. Determining\nwhether obligations in a contract are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or as\na single performance obligation requires significant judgment. In reaching its conclusion, the Company assesses the nature of\neach individual service offering and how the services are provided in the context of the contract, including whether the\nservices are significantly integrated which may require judgment based on the facts and circumstances of the contract. The\nCompany does not disclose the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations for (i) contracts for which the\nCompany recognizes revenue at the amount to which it has the right to invoice and (ii) contracts with variable consideration\nallocated entirely to a single performance obligation. The Company’s remaining performance obligations under these contracts\ninclude providing charging services, branding services, and maintenance services, which will generally be recognized over the\ncontract term. The Company’s customer contracts may include variable consideration such as that due to the unknown number\nof users that will receive charging credits or an unknown number of sites that will receive maintenance services. For such\nvariable consideration, the Company has determined it is not necessary to estimate variable consideration as the uncertainty\nresolves itself monthly in accordance with the contracts’ revenue recognition pattern. The timing and amount of revenue\nrecognition in a period could vary if different judgments were made. The Company may also estimate variable consideration\nunder the expected value method or the most likely amount method.\nAdditionally, where there are multiple performance obligations, judgment is required to determine revenue for each\ndistinct performance obligation. Determining the relative SSP for contracts that contain multiple performance obligations\nrequires significant judgment to appropriately determine the suitable method for estimating the SSP. EVgo determines\n52\nTable of Contents\nSSP using observable pricing when available, which takes into consideration market conditions and customer specific factors.\nAt contract inception, EVgo determines whether EVgo satisfies the performance obligation over time or at a point in time.\nRevenues from charging – OEM are primarily recognized ratably over time or as fee-bearing usage occurs. Revenues from\ncharging – retail, charging – commercial and LCFS are usage-based services and recognized over time or at a point in time\nupon the delivery of the charging products or services. eXtend and ancillary revenues are recognized over time based on a\ntime-based or cost-based approach or at a point in time as performance obligations are satisfied.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Other Identified Intangible Assets\nThe Company has one reporting unit and performs its annual goodwill impairment testing on October 1 each year. In\nassessing the possibility that a reporting unit’s fair value has been reduced below its carrying amount due to the occurrence of\nevents or circumstances between annual impairment testing dates, the Company considers all available evidence, including (i)\nthe results of impairment testing from the most recent testing date (in particular, the magnitude of the excess of fair value over\ncarrying value observed), (ii) downward revisions to internal forecasts, decreases in market multiples (and the magnitude\nthereof) or changes to interest rates, if any, and (iii) declines in market capitalization below book value (and the magnitude\nand duration of those declines), if any.\nThe Company determines fair value using the market approach, when available and appropriate, or the income approach,\nor a combination of both and assesses the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the\ntime the valuation is performed. If multiple valuation methodologies are used, the results are weighted appropriately.\nValuations using the market approach are derived from metrics of publicly traded companies or historically completed\ntransactions of comparable businesses. The selection of comparable businesses is based on the markets in which the Company\noperates giving consideration to risk profiles, size, geography, and diversity of products and services. A market approach is\nused if there are publicly traded companies that have characteristics similar to EVgo’s business.\nUnder the income approach, fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows,\ndiscounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate. The Company uses its internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and\nincludes an estimate of long-term future growth rates based on the most recent views of the long-term outlook for the\nbusiness. Discount rates are derived using a capital asset pricing model and analyzing published rates for relevant industries to\nestimate the cost of equity financing. The discount rates used are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in\nEVgo’s business and in its internally developed forecasts.\nEstimating the fair value of the reporting unit requires the use of significant judgments that are based on a number of\nfactors including actual operating results, internal forecasts, market observable pricing multiples of similar businesses and\ncomparable transactions, possible control premiums, determining the appropriate discount rate and long-term growth rate\nassumptions, and, if multiple approaches are being used, determining the appropriate weighting applied to each approach. It is\nreasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described above could change in future periods.\nThe Company reviews identified intangible assets with defined useful lives and subject to amortization for impairment\nwhenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Determining\nwhether an impairment loss has occurred requires the use of internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and the useful life\nover which these cash flows will occur. To determine fair value, the Company uses its internal cash flow estimates discounted\nat an appropriate discount rate.\nWarrant Liabilities\nEVgo accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the\nwarrant’s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC Topic 480, “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity”\n(“ASC 480”) and ASC Topic 815, “Derivatives and Hedging” (“ASC 815”). The assessment considers whether the warrants\nare freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC\n53\nTable of Contents\n480 and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the\nwarrants are indexed to EVgo’s common stock and whether the warrant holders could potentially require “net cash settlement”\nin a circumstance outside of EVgo’s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires\nthe use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end-\ndate while the warrants are outstanding.\nFor issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be\nrecorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet\nall the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as liabilities at their initial fair value on the\ndate of issuance and remeasured to fair value at each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the\nwarrants are recognized in “changes in fair value of warrant liabilities” in the consolidated statements of operations. The fair\nvalue of the Private Placement Warrants on the date of issuance and on each measurement date is estimated by reference to the\ntrading price of the public warrants, which is considered a Level 2 fair value measurement, or using a Monte Carlo simulation\nmethodology, which is considered a Level 3 fair value measurement and includes inputs such as EVgo’s stock price, the risk-\nfree interest rate, the expected term, the expected volatility, the dividend rate, the exercise price and the number of Private\nPlacement Warrants outstanding. Assumptions used in the Monte Carlo model are subjective and require significant judgment.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of EVgo’s new or recently adopted accounting pronouncements, see “Part I, Item 1. Financial\nStatements – Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” as of and for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023.\nJOBS Act\nOn April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act includes provisions that, among other things, relax\ncertain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. Following the CRIS Business Combination, EVgo has\nqualified as an “emerging growth company” (“EGC”) under the JOBS Act and, as a result, is permitted to comply with new or\nrevised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private (i.e., not publicly traded) companies. EVgo elected\nto delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards and as a result, EVgo may not comply with new or revised\naccounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth\ncompanies. As a result, EVgo’s financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised\naccounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates.\nAs an EGC, EVgo is not required to, among other things, (a) provide an auditor’s attestation report on EVgo’s system of\ninternal control over financial reporting, (b) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-EGC\npublic companies, (c) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\nregarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the\naudit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis) and (d) disclose comparisons of the chief executive\nofficer’s compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following\nthe completion of the Initial Public Offering or until EVgo otherwise no longer qualifies as an EGC.\nAdditionally, immediately following the CRIS Business Combination, EVgo qualified as a “smaller reporting company”\nas defined under the Exchange Act for so long as either (i) the market value of shares of its common stock held by non-\naffiliates is less than $250 million or (ii) its annual revenue was less than $100 million during the most recently completed\nfiscal year and the market value of shares of its common stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million. If EVgo is a\nsmaller reporting company at the time it ceases to be an EGC, EVgo may continue to rely on exemptions from certain\ndisclosure requirements that are available to smaller reporting companies. Specifically EVgo may choose to present only the\ntwo most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in its Annual Report on Form 10-K and has reduced disclosure\nobligations regarding executive compensation and, similar to EGCs, if EVgo is a smaller reporting company under the\nrequirements of (ii) above, EVgo would not be required to obtain an attestation report on internal control over financial\nreporting issued by its independent registered public accounting firm.\n54\nTable of Contents\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThe Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item 3.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nManagement’s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nPer Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, the term disclosure controls and procedures means controls\nand other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the\nreports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time\nperiods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and\nprocedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under\nthe Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and\nChief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required\ndisclosure.\nUnder the supervision of the Company’s Board of Directors and with the participation of management, including the\nCompany’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (the “certifying officers”), the Company conducted an\nevaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in and\npursuant to Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. The certifying officers\nconcluded that, as a result of the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described below, the\nCompany’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024; accordingly, the Company is\nimplementing additional policies and procedures to remediate these shortcomings as outlined in “Part II, Item 9A. Controls\nand Procedures” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the “Annual\nReport”).\nNotwithstanding the identified material weakness, the Company’s management believes the condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements included in this Quarterly Report present fairly, in all material respects, the Company’s financial position,\nresults of operations and cash flows as of and for the periods presented, in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOther than the continued implementation of the remediation policies and procedures described in “Part II, Item 9A.\nControls and Procedures” in the Annual Report, there were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial\nreporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially\naffect, its internal control over financial reporting.\nExisting Material Weakness in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Company’s management previously identified a material weakness in the Company’s internal control over financial\nreporting, as identified below and disclosed in “Part II, Item 9A. Controls and Procedures” in the Annual Report. A material\nweakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a\nreasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be\nprevented or detected on a timely basis.\nThe following material weakness in internal control over financial reporting was identified: due to an ineffective\ninformation and communication process to ensure the completeness and accuracy of underlying data and reports, the\nCompany did not effectively design, implement and operate process-level controls and effective general information\ntechnology (“IT”) controls relevant to its financial reporting processes.\n55\nTable of Contents\nPART II — OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, EVgo may be a party to legal proceedings or subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of\nbusiness. EVgo is not currently a party to any material legal proceedings.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nIn the course of conducting its business operations, EVgo is exposed to a variety of risks, any of which have affected or\ncould materially adversely affect EVgo’s business, financial condition, and results of operations. The market price of EVgo’s\nsecurities could decline, possibly significantly or permanently, if one or more of these risks and uncertainties occur. Before\nyou make a decision to buy EVgo’s securities, in addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed above under “Cautionary\nStatement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” you should carefully consider the specific risk factors set forth in the\n“Risk Factors” section in the Annual Report.
