(“UFG”) (Nasdaq: UFCS) today reported financial results for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, with a consolidated net income of $19.7 million ($0.76 income per diluted share) and consolidated adjusted operating income of $0.81 per diluted share.\n\n“Our third quarter results reflect our ongoing efforts to improve performance through the execution of our strategic business plan,” said UFG President and CEO Kevin Leidwinger. “This quarter, we generated the highest levels of net income and adjusted operating income in the past 10 quarters.\n\n“Net written premiums grew 23% to $305.6 million, led by continued growth in our core commercial and assumed reinsurance business units. Core commercial growth remained steady with average renewal premium increases exceeding 12%, stable retention and strong new business production. Rate increases accelerated to 11.2%, exceeding loss trends with all liability lines near or exceeding double-digit rate increases.\n\n“The third quarter GAAP combined ratio improved 3.8 points to 98.2% from ongoing actions to improve core margins, stable prior period reserve development, and catastrophe losses below prior year and historical averages.\n\n“The third quarter underlying loss ratio of 57.9% improved 2.6 points from the prior year, reflecting strong earned rate achievement exceeding loss trends, continued underwriting discipline, and lower than expected property large loss experience.\n\n“The underwriting expense ratio in the third quarter was 35.9%, slightly higher than prior year, as a result of stronger business performance during the current quarter and increased technology costs as we invest for continued growth.\n\n“Prior period reserve development was neutral overall in the third quarter. The pattern of stable to favorable loss emergence continues and we are strategically positioning reserves to better defend against the industry's troubling litigation trends.\n\n“The third quarter catastrophe loss ratio was 4.4%, below prior year and both five-year and 10-year historical averages. This quarter’s results directly reflect our ongoing efforts to optimize our property catastrophe risk profile, including targeted actions in hurricane-exposed geographies over the past year that reduced our exposure to events like Hurricanes Helene, Debby and Beryl in the third quarter and Milton in the fourth quarter. At this time, we expect Hurricane Milton to have an immaterial impact on our fourth quarter catastrophe loss ratio. We remain committed to assisting policyholders affected by these recent devastating events and are grateful for the compassionate and responsive service delivered by our UFG catastrophe claims team.\n\n“Third quarter net investment income of $24.5 million increased 49%, or $8.0 million, above prior year. Recent actions to reposition portions of our fixed income portfolio resulted in a strong and sustainable increase in fixed maturity investment income to $18.7 million in the third quarter and $78.0 million on an annualized basis going forward. New purchase yields remained strongly above total portfolio yields, creating potential for further improvement. Improved valuations on our limited partnership portfolio contributed $5.4 million of pre-tax investment income in the third quarter.\n\n“Book value per share increased to $31.01 in the third quarter as a result of the quarter's improved net income and a significant reduction in after-tax unrealized loss from $78.0 million at June 30, 2024, to $35.8 million at September 30, 2024.\n\n“We continue to make progress in resolving the rating errors in our core commercial business that were identified last quarter. We have reached a resolution with the Iowa Insurance Division, our lead regulator, resulting in no further action and no financial impact to the company. Through our lead regulator, we continue to work with regulators in other states to achieve resolution.\n\n“Finally, I am pleased with our third quarter results and the cumulative progress we have made over the past nine months. Our strategic actions continue to materialize in our results, and we remain committed to driving ongoing improvements through the strategic execution of our business plan.”\n\n(1) Underlying loss ratio, underlying combined ratio and adjusted book value per share are non-GAAP financial measures.

Commercial lines net premiums written excluding surety and specialty increased 13%, supported by increased pricing with an overall increase in average renewal premiums of 12.4%. Rate increases accounted for 11.2% while exposure increases contributed an additional 1.1%. Excluding the workers’ compensation line of business, the overall average increase in renewal premiums was 13.4%, with 12.2% from rate increases and 1.1% from exposure changes.\n\nThe GAAP combined ratio for the third quarter of 2024 was 98.2%, improving 3.8 points from 102.0% driven by improvement in all components of the loss ratio. Prior period reserve development, excluding catastrophe losses, was neutral for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 0.2% of unfavorable development in the third quarter of 2023. Pre-tax catastrophe losses added 4.4 points to the GAAP combined ratio, an improvement of 1.5 points and below both five-year and 10-year historical averages. The underlying loss ratio of 57.9% improved 2.6 points, reflecting improvement in core commercial lines from a combination of underwriting actions, increased pricing, expense management, lower claim count trends and lower large loss activity in property lines. The prior year underlying loss ratio was also impacted by elevated surety losses, which did not repeat in the current year. The underwriting expense ratio of 35.9% increased 0.5 points due to stronger business performance during the current quarter and increased technology costs as we invest for continued growth.\n\n**Investment Results**\n\n**Third quarter 2024 results:**_(All comparisons vs. third quarter 2023, unless noted otherwise)_\n\nNet investment income was $24.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $8.0 million. Income from the fixed maturity portfolio increased by $4.2 million due to portfolio management actions and investing at higher interest rates. Income on other long-term investments increased $4.3 million from increased valuation of investments in limited liability partnerships, which can vary from period to period.\n\n**Investment Results**  \n---  \n _(Unaudited)_|  Three Months Ended September 30,| Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n_(In thousands)_| **2024**|  2023| **2024**|  2023  \nInvestment income:  \nInterest on fixed maturities| **$**| **18,719**|  $| 14,472| **$**| **49,826**|  $| 41,192  \nDividends on equity securities| **—**|  639| **341**|  3,067  \nIncome (loss) on other long-term investments| **5,408**|  1,093| **5,789**| (3,491| )  \nOther| **3,173**|  2,574| **11,259**|  6,868  \nTotal investment income| **$**| **27,300**|  $| 18,778| **$**| **67,215**|  $| 47,636  \nLess investment expenses| **2,841**|  2,319| **8,385**|  7,128  \nNet investment income| **$**| **24,459**|  $| 16,459| **$**| **58,830**|  $| 40,508  \nAverage yields on fixed income securities pre-tax(1)| **3.97**| **%**|  3.35| %| **3.63**| **%**|  3.20| %  \n  \n(1) Fixed income securities yield excluding net unrealized investment gains/losses and expenses.\n\n**Balance Sheet**\n\n_(In thousands)_| **September 30, 2024**|  December 31, 2023  \n---|---|---  \n** _(unaudited)_**  \nInvested assets| **$**| **1,995,452**|  $| 1,886,494  \nCash| **197,371**|  102,046  \nTotal assets| **3,546,132**|  3,144,190  \nLosses and loss settlement expenses| **1,794,941**|  1,638,755  \nTotal liabilities| **2,760,309**|  2,410,445  \nNet unrealized investment gains (losses), after-tax| **(35,787**| **)**| (66,967| )  \nTotal stockholders’ equity| **785,823**|  733,745  \nBook value per share| **$**| **31.01**|  $| 29.04  \nAdjusted book value per share(1)| **32.42**|  31.69  \n  \n(1) Adjusted book value per share is a non-GAAP financial measure.

This increase is primarily related to an increase in net income and reduction in net unrealized losses on fixed maturity securities, slightly offset with shareholder dividends during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Capital Management**\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the company declared and paid a $0.16 per share cash dividend to shareholders of record as of August 30, 2024.

The risks identified in our 2023 Annual Report and in our other SEC filings are representative of the risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from what is expressed in the forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this release or as of the date they are made. Except as required under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the SEC, we do not have any intention or obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law. In addition, future dividend payments are within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on numerous factors, including our financial condition, our capital requirements and other factors that our Board of Directors considers relevant.\n\n**Definitions of Non-GAAP Information and Reconciliations to Comparable GAAP Measures**\n\nThe company prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). Management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate its operations and profitability. Management also believes that disclosure of certain non-GAAP financial measures enhances investor understanding of our financial performance. Non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this report include: adjusted operating income, underlying loss ratio, underlying combined ratio, and adjusted book value per share. The company has provided the following definitions and reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures:\n\n**Adjusted operating income:** Adjusted operating income is calculated by excluding net investment gains and losses, after applicable federal and state income taxes from net income (loss). Management believes adjusted operating income is a meaningful measure for evaluating insurance company performance and a useful supplement to GAAP information because it better represents the normal, ongoing performance of our business. Investors and equity analysts who invest in and report on the insurance industry and the company generally focus on this metric in their analyses.\n\n**Net Income Reconciliation**  \n---  \n _(Unaudited)_|  Three Months Ended September 30,| Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n_(In thousands)_| **2024**|  2023| **2024**|  2023  \n**Income statement data**  \nNet income (loss)| **$**| **19,748**|  $| 6,380| **$**| **30,515**|  $| (49,308| )  \nLess: after-tax net investment gains (losses)| **(1,327**| **)**| (1,547| )| **(3,249**| **)**| (2,038| )  \nAdjusted operating income (loss)| **$**| **21,075**|  $| 7,927| **$**| **33,764**|  $| (47,270| )  \n**Diluted earnings per share data**  \nNet income (loss)| **$**| **0.76**|  $| 0.25| **$**| **1.18**|  $| (1.95| )  \nLess: after-tax net investment gains (losses)| **(0.05**| **)**| (0.06| )| **(0.12**| **)**| (0.08| )  \nAdjusted operating income (loss)| **$**| **0.81**|  $| 0.31| **$**| **1.30**|  $| (1.87| )  \n  \n**Underlying loss ratio and underlying combined ratio:** Underlying loss ratio represents the net loss ratio less the impacts of catastrophes and non-catastrophe prior period reserve development. The underlying combined ratio represents the GAAP combined ratio less the impacts of catastrophes and non-catastrophe prior period reserve development. The company believes that the underlying loss ratio and underlying combined ratio are meaningful measures to understand the underlying trends in the core business in the current accident year, removing the volatility of prior period impacts and catastrophes. Management believes separate discussions on catastrophe losses and prior period reserve development are important to understanding how the company is managing catastrophe risk and in identifying developments in longer-tailed business.\n\nPrior period reserve development is the increase (unfavorable) or decrease (favorable) in incurred loss and loss adjustment expense at the valuation dates for losses which occurred in previous calendar years. This measure excludes development on catastrophe losses.\n\nCatastrophe losses is an operational measure which utilizes the designations of the Insurance Services Office (“ISO”) and is reported with losses and loss adjustment expense amounts net of reinsurance recoverables, unless specified otherwise. In addition to ISO catastrophes, we also include as catastrophes those events, which may include U.S. or international losses, that we believe are, or will be, material to our operations, either in amount or in number of claims made. Catastrophes are not predictable and are unique in terms of timing and financial impact. While management estimates catastrophe losses as incurred, due to the inherently unique nature of catastrophe losses, the impact in a reporting period is inclusive of catastrophes that occurred in the reporting period, as well as development on catastrophes that have occurred in prior periods.\n\n**Adjusted book value per share:** Adjusted book value per share is calculated by dividing shareholders' equity, excluding net unrealized investment gains and losses, net of tax, by the number of common shares outstanding. Management believes adjusted book value per share is a meaningful measure for evaluating the company's net worth that is primarily attributable to our business operations, because it removes the effect of changing prices on invested assets that can fluctuate from period to period. Book value per share is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\n\n**Book Value Per Share Reconciliation**  \n---  \n _(Unaudited)_|  As of  \n _(In thousands)_| **September 30, 2024**|  December 31, 2023  \n**Shareholders' equity**| **$**| **785,823**|  $| 733,745  \nLess: Net unrealized investment gains (losses), net of tax| **(35,787**| **)**| (66,967| )  \nShareholders' equity, excluding net unrealized investment gains (losses), net of tax| **$**| **821,610**|  $| 800,712  \nCommon shares outstanding (basic)| **25,341**|  25,270  \nBook value per share| **$**| **31.01**|  $| 29.04  \nAdjusted book value per share| **32.42**|  31.69  \n  \n**Certain Performance Measures**\n\nThe company uses the following measure to evaluate its financial performance. Management believes a discussion of this measure provides financial statement users with a better understanding of the company’s results of operations. The company has provided the following definition:\n\n**Net premiums written:** Net premiums written is frequently used by industry analysts and other recognized reporting sources to facilitate comparisons of the performance of insurance companies. Net premiums written is the amount charged for insurance policy contracts issued and recognized on an annualized basis at the effective date of the policy. Management believes net premiums written is a meaningful measure for evaluating insurance company sales performance and geographical expansion efforts. Net premiums written for an insurance company consists of direct premiums written and premiums assumed, less premiums ceded. Net premiums earned is calculated on a pro-rata basis over the terms of the respective policies. Unearned premium reserves are established for the portion of premiums written applicable to the unexpired terms of the insurance policies in force. The difference between net premiums earned and net premiums written is the change in unearned premiums and the change in prepaid reinsurance premiums.\n\n**Supplemental Tables**\n\n**Income Statement**  \n---  \n _(Unaudited)_|  Three Months Ended September 30,| Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n_(In thousands)_| **2024**|  2023| **2024**|  2023  \n**Revenues**  \nNet premiums earned| **$**| **300,185**|  $| 259,456| **$**| **868,613**|  $| 770,221  \nNet investment income| **24,459**|  16,459| **58,830**|  40,508  \nNet investment gains (losses)| **(1,680**| **)**| (1,960| )| **(4,111**| **)**| (2,581| )  \nOther income (loss)| **—**|  —| **(3,200**| **)**|  —  \n**Total revenues**| **$**| **322,964**|  $| 273,955| **$**| **920,132**|  $| 808,148  \n**Benefits, losses and expenses**  \nLosses and loss settlement expenses| **$**| **187,148**|  $| 172,798| **$**| **568,119**|  $| 598,125  \nAmortization of deferred policy acquisition costs| **71,425**|  62,709| **204,504**|  181,700  \nOther underwriting expenses| **36,454**|  29,096| **103,532**|  88,231  \nInterest expense| **2,481**|  797| **4,800**|  2,391  \nOther non-underwriting expenses| **481**|  179| **1,688**|  1,553  \n**Total benefits, losses and expenses**| **$**| **297,989**|  $| 265,579| **$**| **882,643**|  $| 872,000  \n**Income (loss) before income taxes**| **$**| **24,975**|  $| 8,376| **$**| **37,489**|  $| (63,852| )  \nFederal income tax expense (benefit)| **5,227**|  1,996| **6,974**| (14,544| )  \n**Net income (loss)**| **$**| **19,748**|  $| 6,380| **$**| **30,515**|  $| (49,308| )  \n  \n**Net Premiums Written by Line of Business**  \n---  \n _(Unaudited)_|  Three Months Ended September 30,| Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n_(In thousands)_| **2024**|  2023| **2024**|  2023  \n**Net premiums written****(1)**  \nCommercial lines:  \nOther liability(2)| **$**| **85,110**|  $| 66,733| **$**| **278,946**|  $| 246,506  \nFire and allied lines(3)| **66,219**|  64,850| **199,593**|  197,287  \nAutomobile| **61,274**|  52,731| **204,481**|  172,043  \nWorkers’ compensation| **13,925**|  11,038| **47,827**|  38,598  \nSurety(4)| **13,407**|  10,679| **42,511**|  35,600  \nMiscellaneous| **4,879**|  2,262| **9,885**|  3,420  \nTotal commercial lines| **$**| **244,814**|  $| 208,293| **$**| **783,243**|  $| 693,454  \nPersonal lines:  \nFire and allied lines(5)| **$**| **2,815**|  $| 1,779| **$**| **10,397**|  $| 4,409  \nAutomobile| **601**|  —| **1,685**|  —  \nMiscellaneous| **2**|  4| **5**|  13  \nTotal personal lines| **$**| **3,418**|  $| 1,783| **$**| **12,087**|  $| 4,422  \nAssumed reinsurance| **57,319**|  37,651| **157,611**|  122,195  \nTotal| **$**| **305,551**|  $| 247,727| **$**| **952,941**|  $| 820,071  \n  \n(1) Net premiums written is a performance measure reflecting the amount charged for insurance policy contracts issued and recognized on an annualized basis at the effective date of the policy.

Reports Third Quarter 2024 Results\nNet income of $0.76 per diluted share and adjusted operating income of $0.81 per diluted share\nThird quarter 2024 highlights compared to third quarter 2023:(1)\n• Net income increased from $6.4 million to $19.7 million.\n• Net investment income increased 49% to $24.5 million.\n• GAAP combined ratio improved 3.8 points to 98.2%; composed of an underlying loss ratio of 57.9%,\ncatastrophe loss ratio of 4.4%, no prior year reserve development, and underwriting expense ratio of\n35.9%.\n• The underlying combined ratio improved 2.1 points to 93.8%.\n• Net premiums written(2) increased 23% to $305.6 million.\n• Book value per common share increased $1.97 to $31.01 as of September 30, 2024, compared to\nDecember 31, 2023.\n• Adjusted book value per share excluding net after-tax unrealized gains and losses of $32.42 as of\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nCEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa – November 5, 2024 – United Fire Group, Inc. (“UFG”) (Nasdaq: UFCS) today\nreported financial results for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, with a consolidated net\nincome of $19.7 million ($0.76 income per diluted share) and consolidated adjusted operating income of\n$0.81 per diluted share.\n“Our third quarter results reflect our ongoing efforts to improve performance through the execution of our\nstrategic business plan,” said UFG President and CEO Kevin Leidwinger. “This quarter, we generated the\nhighest levels of net income and adjusted operating income in the past 10 quarters.\n“Net written premiums grew 23% to $305.6 million, led by continued growth in our core commercial and\nassumed reinsurance business units. Core commercial growth remained steady with average renewal\npremium increases exceeding 12%, stable retention and strong new business production. Rate increases\naccelerated to 11.2%, exceeding loss trends with all liability lines near or exceeding double-digit rate\nincreases.\n“The third quarter GAAP combined ratio improved 3.8 points to 98.2% from ongoing actions to improve core\nmargins, stable prior period reserve development, and catastrophe losses below prior year and historical\naverages.\n“The third quarter underlying loss ratio of 57.9% improved 2.6 points from the prior year, reflecting strong\nearned rate achievement exceeding loss trends, continued underwriting discipline, and lower than expected\nproperty large loss experience.\n“The underwriting expense ratio in the third quarter was 35.9%, slightly higher than prior year, as a result of\nstronger business performance during the current quarter and increased technology costs as we invest for\ncontinued growth.\n1\n“Prior period reserve development was neutral overall in the third quarter. The pattern of stable to favorable\nloss emergence continues and we are strategically positioning reserves to better defend against the industry's\ntroubling litigation trends.\n“The third quarter catastrophe loss ratio was 4.4%, below prior year and both five-year and 10-year historical\naverages. This quarter’s results directly reflect our ongoing efforts to optimize our property catastrophe risk\nprofile, including targeted actions in hurricane-exposed geographies over the past year that reduced our\nexposure to events like Hurricanes Helene, Debby and Beryl in the third quarter and Milton in the fourth\nquarter. At this time, we expect Hurricane Milton to have an immaterial impact on our fourth quarter\ncatastrophe loss ratio. We remain committed to assisting policyholders affected by these recent devastating\nevents and are grateful for the compassionate and responsive service delivered by our UFG catastrophe\nclaims team.\n“Third quarter net investment income of $24.5 million increased 49%, or $8.0 million, above prior year. Recent\nactions to reposition portions of our fixed income portfolio resulted in a strong and sustainable increase in\nfixed maturity investment income to $18.7 million in the third quarter and $78.0 million on an annualized basis\ngoing forward. New purchase yields remained strongly above total portfolio yields, creating potential for\nfurther improvement. Improved valuations on our limited partnership portfolio contributed $5.4 million of pre-\ntax investment income in the third quarter.\n“Book value per share increased to $31.01 in the third quarter as a result of the quarter's improved net income\nand a significant reduction in after-tax unrealized loss from $78.0 million at June 30, 2024, to $35.8 million at\nSeptember 30, 2024.\n“We continue to make progress in resolving the rating errors in our core commercial business that were\nidentified last quarter. We have reached a resolution with the Iowa Insurance Division, our lead regulator,\nresulting in no further action and no financial impact to the company. Through our lead regulator, we continue\nto work with regulators in other states to achieve resolution.\n“Finally, I am pleased with our third quarter results and the cumulative progress we have made over the past\nnine months. Our strategic actions continue to materialize in our results, and we remain committed to driving\nongoing improvements through the strategic execution of our business plan.”\n(1) Underlying loss ratio, underlying combined ratio and adjusted book value per share are non-GAAP financial measures.\nSee Definitions of Non-GAAP Information and Reconciliations to Comparable GAAP Measures for additional information.\n(2) Net premiums written is a performance measure reflecting the amount charged for insurance policy contracts issued\nand recognized on an annualized basis at the effective date of the policy.

Commercial lines net premiums written excluding\nsurety and specialty increased 13%, supported by increased pricing with an overall increase in average renewal\npremiums of 12.4%. Rate increases accounted for 11.2% while exposure increases contributed an additional 1.1%.\nExcluding the workers’ compensation line of business, the overall average increase in renewal premiums was\n13.4%, with 12.2% from rate increases and 1.1% from exposure changes.\nThe GAAP combined ratio for the third quarter of 2024 was 98.2%, improving 3.8 points from 102.0% driven by\nimprovement in all components of the loss ratio. Prior period reserve development, excluding catastrophe losses,\nwas neutral for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 0.2% of unfavorable development in the third quarter of 2023.\nPre-tax catastrophe losses added 4.4 points to the GAAP combined ratio, an improvement of 1.5 points and below\nboth five-year and 10-year historical averages. The underlying loss ratio of 57.9% improved 2.6 points, reflecting\nimprovement in core commercial lines from a combination of underwriting actions, increased pricing, expense\nmanagement, lower claim count trends and lower large loss activity in property lines. The prior year underlying loss\nratio was also impacted by elevated surety losses, which did not repeat in the current year. The underwriting\nexpense ratio of 35.9% increased 0.5 points due to stronger business performance during the current quarter and\nincreased technology costs as we invest for continued growth.\nInvestment Results\nThird quarter 2024 results:\n(All comparisons vs. third quarter 2023, unless noted otherwise)\nNet investment income was $24.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $8.0 million. Income from the\nfixed maturity portfolio increased by $4.2 million due to portfolio management actions and investing at higher\ninterest rates. Income on other long-term investments increased $4.3 million from increased valuation of\ninvestments in limited liability partnerships, which can vary from period to period.\nInvestment Results\n(Unaudited) Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nInvestment income:\nInterest on fixed maturities $ 18,719 $ 14,472 $ 49,826 $ 41,192\nDividends on equity securities — 639 341 3,067\nIncome (loss) on other long-term investments 5,408 1,093 5,789 (3,491)\nOther 3,173 2,574 11,259 6,868\nTotal investment income $ 27,300 $ 18,778 $ 67,215 $ 47,636\nLess investment expenses 2,841 2,319 8,385 7,128\nNet investment income $ 24,459 $ 16,459 $ 58,830 $ 40,508\nAverage yields on fixed income securities pre-tax(1) 3.97 % 3.35 % 3.63 % 3.20 %\n(1) Fixed income securities yield excluding net unrealized investment gains/losses and expenses.\n4\nBalance Sheet\n(In thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\n(unaudited)\nInvested assets $ 1,995,452 $ 1,886,494\nCash 197,371 102,046\nTotal assets 3,546,132 3,144,190\nLosses and loss settlement expenses 1,794,941 1,638,755\nTotal liabilities 2,760,309 2,410,445\nNet unrealized investment gains (losses), after-tax (35,787) (66,967)\nTotal stockholders’ equity 785,823 733,745\nBook value per share $ 31.01 $ 29.04\nAdjusted book value per share(1) 32.42 31.69\n(1) Adjusted book value per share is a non-GAAP financial measure.

The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor under the Securities Act\nof 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements\nare not historical facts and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those\nexpected and/or projected. Such forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, estimates,\nforecasts and projections about the company, the industry in which we operate, and beliefs and assumptions made\nby management. Words such as “expect(s),” “anticipate(s),” “intend(s),” “plan(s),” “believe(s),” “continue(s),”\n“seek(s),” “estimate(s),” “goal(s),” “remain(s) optimistic,” “target(s),” “forecast(s),” “project(s),” “predict(s),” “should,”\n“could,” “may,” “will,” “might,” “hope,” “can” and other words and terms of similar meaning or expression in\nconnection with a discussion of future operations, financial performance or financial condition, are intended to\nidentify forward-looking statements.

Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-\nlooking statements, which speak only as of the date of this release or as of the date they are made. Except as\nrequired under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the SEC, we do not have any intention or\nobligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events,\nor otherwise, except as required by law.

Management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate\nits operations and profitability. Management also believes that disclosure of certain non-GAAP financial\nmeasures enhances investor understanding of our financial performance. Non-GAAP financial measures\ndisclosed in this report include: adjusted operating income, underlying loss ratio, underlying combined ratio,\nand adjusted book value per share. The company has provided the following definitions and reconciliations of\nthe non-GAAP financial measures:\nAdjusted operating income: Adjusted operating income is calculated by excluding net investment gains and\nlosses, after applicable federal and state income taxes from net income (loss). Management believes\nadjusted operating income is a meaningful measure for evaluating insurance company performance and a\nuseful supplement to GAAP information because it better represents the normal, ongoing performance of our\nbusiness. Investors and equity analysts who invest in and report on the insurance industry and the company\ngenerally focus on this metric in their analyses.\nNet Income Reconciliation\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\n(Unaudited) September 30, September 30,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nIncome statement data\nNet income (loss) $ 19,748 $ 6,380 $ 30,515 $ (49,308)\nLess: after-tax net investment gains (losses) (1,327) (1,547) (3,249) (2,038)\nAdjusted operating income (loss) $ 21,075 $ 7,927 $ 33,764 $ (47,270)\nDiluted earnings per share data\nNet income (loss) $ 0.76 $ 0.25 $ 1.18 $ (1.95)\nLess: after-tax net investment gains (losses) (0.05) (0.06) (0.12) (0.08)\nAdjusted operating income (loss) $ 0.81 $ 0.31 $ 1.30 $ (1.87)\nUnderlying loss ratio and underlying combined ratio: Underlying loss ratio represents the net loss ratio\nless the impacts of catastrophes and non-catastrophe prior period reserve development. The underlying\ncombined ratio represents the GAAP combined ratio less the impacts of catastrophes and non-catastrophe\nprior period reserve development. The company believes that the underlying loss ratio and underlying\ncombined ratio are meaningful measures to understand the underlying trends in the core business in the\ncurrent accident year, removing the volatility of prior period impacts and catastrophes. Management believes\nseparate discussions on catastrophe losses and prior period reserve development are important to\nunderstanding how the company is managing catastrophe risk and in identifying developments in longer-tailed\nbusiness.\nPrior period reserve development is the increase (unfavorable) or decrease (favorable) in incurred loss and\nloss adjustment expense at the valuation dates for losses which occurred in previous calendar years. This\nmeasure excludes development on catastrophe losses.\nCatastrophe losses is an operational measure which utilizes the designations of the Insurance Services Office\n(“ISO”) and is reported with losses and loss adjustment expense amounts net of reinsurance recoverables,\nunless specified otherwise. In addition to ISO catastrophes, we also include as catastrophes those events,\nwhich may include U.S. or international losses, that we believe are, or will be, material to our operations,\neither in amount or in number of claims made. Catastrophes are not predictable and are unique in terms of\ntiming and financial impact. While management estimates catastrophe losses as incurred, due to the\ninherently unique nature of catastrophe losses, the impact in a reporting period is inclusive of catastrophes\nthat occurred in the reporting period, as well as development on catastrophes that have occurred in prior\nperiods.\n7\nAdjusted book value per share: Adjusted book value per share is calculated by dividing shareholders'\nequity, excluding net unrealized investment gains and losses, net of tax, by the number of common shares\noutstanding. Management believes adjusted book value per share is a meaningful measure for evaluating the\ncompany's net worth that is primarily attributable to our business operations, because it removes the effect of\nchanging prices on invested assets that can fluctuate from period to period. Book value per share is the most\ndirectly comparable GAAP measure.\nBook Value Per Share Reconciliation\n(Unaudited) As of\n(In thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nShareholders' equity $ 785,823 $ 733,745\nLess: Net unrealized investment gains (losses), net of tax (35,787) (66,967)\nShareholders' equity, excluding net unrealized investment gains\n(losses), net of tax $ 821,610 $ 800,712\nCommon shares outstanding (basic) 25,341 25,270\nBook value per share $ 31.01 $ 29.04\nAdjusted book value per share 32.42 31.69\nCertain Performance Measures\nThe company uses the following measure to evaluate its financial performance. Management believes a\ndiscussion of this measure provides financial statement users with a better understanding of the company’s\nresults of operations. The company has provided the following definition:\nNet premiums written: Net premiums written is frequently used by industry analysts and other recognized\nreporting sources to facilitate comparisons of the performance of insurance companies. Net premiums written\nis the amount charged for insurance policy contracts issued and recognized on an annualized basis at the\neffective date of the policy. Management believes net premiums written is a meaningful measure for\nevaluating insurance company sales performance and geographical expansion efforts. Net premiums written\nfor an insurance company consists of direct premiums written and premiums assumed, less premiums ceded.\nNet premiums earned is calculated on a pro-rata basis over the terms of the respective policies. Unearned\npremium reserves are established for the portion of premiums written applicable to the unexpired terms of the\ninsurance policies in force. The difference between net premiums earned and net premiums written is the\nchange in unearned premiums and the change in prepaid reinsurance premiums.\n8\nSupplemental Tables\nIncome Statement\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\n(Unaudited) September 30, September 30,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenues\nNet premiums earned $ 300,185 $ 259,456 $ 868,613 $ 770,221\nNet investment income 24,459 16,459 58,830 40,508\nNet investment gains (losses) (1,680) (1,960) (4,111) (2,581)\nOther income (loss) — — (3,200) —\nTotal revenues $ 322,964 $ 273,955 $ 920,132 $ 808,148\nBenefits, losses and expenses\nLosses and loss settlement expenses $ 187,148 $ 172,798 $ 568,119 $ 598,125\nAmortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 71,425 62,709 204,504 181,700\nOther underwriting expenses 36,454 29,096 103,532 88,231\nInterest expense 2,481 797 4,800 2,391\nOther non-underwriting expenses 481 179 1,688 1,553\nTotal benefits, losses and expenses $ 297,989 $ 265,579 $ 882,643 $ 872,000\nIncome (loss) before income taxes $ 24,975 $ 8,376 $ 37,489 $ (63,852)\nFederal income tax expense (benefit) 5,227 1,996 6,974 (14,544)\nNet income (loss) $ 19,748 $ 6,380 $ 30,515 $ (49,308)\n9\nNet Premiums Written by Line of Business\n(Unaudited) Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet premiums written(1)\nCommercial lines:\nOther liability(2) $ 85,110 $ 66,733 $ 278,946 $ 246,506\nFire and allied lines(3) 66,219 64,850 199,593 197,287\nAutomobile 61,274 52,731 204,481 172,043\nWorkers’ compensation 13,925 11,038 47,827 38,598\nSurety(4) 13,407 10,679 42,511 35,600\nMiscellaneous 4,879 2,262 9,885 3,420\nTotal commercial lines $ 244,814 $ 208,293 $ 783,243 $ 693,454\nPersonal lines:\nFire and allied lines(5) $ 2,815 $ 1,779 $ 10,397 $ 4,409\nAutomobile 601 — 1,685 —\nMiscellaneous 2 4 5 13\nTotal personal lines $ 3,418 $ 1,783 $ 12,087 $ 4,422\nAssumed reinsurance 57,319 37,651 157,611 122,195\nTotal $ 305,551 $ 247,727 $ 952,941 $ 820,071\n(1) Net premiums written is a performance measure reflecting the amount charged for insurance policy contracts issued and\nrecognized on an annualized basis at the effective date of the policy.

To withdraw your question, please press star then two. Please note\nthis event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Tim Borst.\nTim Borst\nGood morning and thank you for joining this call. Yesterday afternoon, we issued a press release on our\nresults. To find a copy of this document, please visit our website at UFGinsurance.com. Press releases\nand slides are located under the investors tab.\nJoining me today on the call are UFG President and Chief Executive Officer, Kevin Leidwinger, Executive\nVice President and Chief Operating Officer, Julie Stephenson and Executive Vice President and Chief\nFinancial Officer, Eric Martin.\nBefore I turn the call over to Kevin, a couple of reminders.

These forward-looking statements are\nbased on management's current expectations and the actual results may differ materially due to a variety\nof factors, which are described in our press release and SEC filings discussed specifically in our most\nrecent annual report on Form 10K.\nAlso please note that in our discussion today, we may use some non-GAAP financial measures.\nReconciliations of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are also available in our\npress release and SEC filings.\nAt this time, I will turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Leidwinger, CEO of UFG Insurance.\nKevin Leidwinger\nThank you, Tim. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our third quarter conference call. I'll begin this\nmorning by providing a high level overview of our results. Following my comments, Julie Stephenson will\ndiscuss our underwriting results and Eric Martin will discuss our financial results in more detail. But first,\nwe would like to take a moment to extend our deepest sympathies to those impacted by Hurricanes\nHelene and Milton in recent weeks. It's been a devastating hurricane season and we wish a swift recovery\nto the people and communities who were in the path of these storms.\nTurning to our results, the third quarter reflects our ongoing efforts to improve performance through the\nexecution of our strategic business plan. We generated the highest quarterly net income and operating\nUnited Fire Group, Inc.\nNovember 6, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern\n2\nincome in the past 10 quarters, demonstrating our progress in improving underwriting and investment\nreturns by engaging with distribution partners to profitably grow our business, deepening expertise across\nthe company, enhancing our capabilities and leveraging technology to improve efficiency, all while\nupholding the personal relationships and responsive service our partners and policyholders value.\nNet written premiums grew 23% at $305.6 million with growth led by our core commercial and alternative\ndistribution businesses. Core commercial growth remains steady, with average renewal premium\nincreases exceeding 12%, stable retention and strong new business production. Rate increases\naccelerated to 11.2% exceeding loss trends, with all liability lines near or above double-digit rate\nincreases.\nThe third quarter GAAP combined ratio improved 3.8 points to 98.2% from ongoing actions to improve\ncore margins, stable prior period reserve development and catastrophe losses below prior year and\nhistorical averages. The third quarter underlying loss ratio of 57.9% improved 2.6 points from prior year,\nreflecting strong earned rate achievement exceeding loss trends, continued underwriting discipline and\nlower than expected property large loss experience. The third quarter catastrophe loss ratio was 4.4%\nand below prior year, as well as both 5 year and 10 year historical averages. This quarter's results directly\nreflect our ongoing efforts to optimize our property catastrophe risk profile, including targeted actions in\nhurricane exposed geographies over the past year that reduced our exposure to events like Hurricane\nHelene, Debbie and Beryl in the third quarter and Milton in the fourth quarter. At this time, we expect\nHurricane Milton to have no material impact on the fourth quarter catastrophe loss ratio.\nPrior period reserve development was neutral overall in the third quarter. The pattern of stable to\nfavorable loss emergence allows us to continue reinforcing our position against the future inflationary\nuncertainty challenging our industry in certain liability lines. The underwriting expense ratio in the third\nquarter was 35.9%, slightly higher than prior year as a result of stronger business performance during\nthe current quarter and increase technology costs as we invest in continued growth.\nThird quarter net investment income of $24.4 million increased 49% or $8 million above prior year. Recent\nactions to reposition portions of our fixed income portfolio resulted in a strong and sustainable increase\nin fixed maturity investment income to $18.7 million in the third quarter and $78 million on an annualized\nbasis going forward.\nNew purchase yields remain strongly above total portfolio yields, creating potential for further\nimprovement. Improved valuations on our limited partnership portfolio contributed $5.4 million in pretax\ninvestment income in the third quarter. Eric will provide more color on these investment portfolio\nmanagement actions and results in his remarks.\nWe continue to make progress in resolving the rating errors in our core commercial business that were\nidentified in the last quarter. At this time, in the last quarter, we were in the early stages of investigating\nthis matter and recorded a contingent liability based on information available at the time. We have since\ncompleted our investigation and based upon an evaluation of our findings, the IO [ph 6:06] insurance\ndivision elected to take no action nor require refunds. Through the IO insurance division, we continue to\nwork with regulators in other states to achieve resolution that have not changed the amount of the pretax\ncharge reported last quarter.\nIn conclusion, I'm pleased with our third quarter results and the cumulative progress we've made over\nthe past nine months. Our strategic actions continue to materialize in our results and we remain\ncommitted to driving ongoing improvements through the strategic execution of our business plan.\nI'll now hand it over to Julie Stephenson, our Chief Operating Officer, to discuss our underwriting results\nUnited Fire Group, Inc.\nNovember 6, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern\n3\nin more detail.\nJulie Stephenson\nThank you. Kevin. Net written premium in our core commercial business, which includes small business,\nmiddle market and construction, grew 13% to $186 million in the third quarter compared to prior year.\nRenewal premium change in our core commercial business accelerated to 12.4% with rates up 11.2%\nand exceeding loss trends. Commercial property premium change remains strong at nearly 20% with\npricing accelerating from the second quarter for commercial auto and general liability. Retention remained\nconsistent and within expectations at 81%.\nLoss severity trends remain elevated but are consistent with our expectations and showing signs of\nstabilization. We continue to see ongoing frequency improvement across the portfolio. Core commercial\nnew business production was strong and well above prior for the quarter, with small business, middle\nmarketing and construction adding quality accounts delivered through improved alignment with our\ndistribution partners. Alternative distribution, surety and specialty all contributed diversifying and\nmeasured growth for the quarter,\nThe third quarter underlying loss ratio of 57.9% improved 2.6 points from third quarter of 2023 continuing\nthe momentum reflected in our first and second quarter results. We saw favorable results across all major\nlines of business this quarter. Earned rate achievement is impacting the loss ratio to a larger extent than\nprevious quarters and continues to exceed loss trends, while lower than expected large property loss\nexperience seen in the second quarter continued into the third quarter.\nPrior period reserve development was neutral overall in the third quarter. Consistent with the first two\nquarters of 2024, loss emergence was neutral to favorable across the portfolio. These positive indications\nenable us to continue to reinforce our position against the future inflationary uncertainty challenging our\nindustry in certain liability lines. We are pleased with the progress made in our reserve position and will\nprudently maintain a solid foundation for future success.\nOur third quarter catastrophe loss ratio of 4.4% was 1.5 points below prior year and below our 5-year and\n10-year historical averages by 8 points and 5.5 points, respectively. Hurricane Helene had a small impact\non our quarterly catastrophe loss ratio, while our non-hurricane catastrophe losses were well below\nexpectations. We continue to execute multi-faceted strategies to improve our property catastrophe risk\nprofile, leveraging advanced analytical tools to manage and monitor our exposure to severe convective\nstorm and hurricane risks. Specifically, we're more closely managing our geographic concentration and\nimproving risk quality by focusing our risk improvement and deductible actions on roof quality, building\nage and construction type.\nI will now turn the call over to Eric Martin to discuss the rest of our financial results.\nEric Martin\nThank you, Julie. Starting with the investment portfolio, total invested assets in cash ended the third\nquarter at $2.2 billion, a high quality portfolio with an overall credit rating of AA- and a duration of\napproximately 4 years. Total net investment income was $24.4 million in the third quarter, up $8 million\nor 49% compared to the third quarter of 2023 due to strong improvement in both fixed income and\nalternative asset portfolio returns. These third quarter results show how the actions taken since\ntransitioning management of our fixed income portfolio to our partners at New England Asset\nManagement are delivering increasing benefits. Continued repositioning out of tax exempt municipals\ninto high quality assets offering more attractive tax equivalent yields in order to take advantage of the\ncurrent elevated interest rate environment are significantly and sustainably increasing investment\nincome.\nUnited Fire Group, Inc.\nNovember 6, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern\n4\nAs you may recall, in the second quarter, we invested over 20% of the fixed income portfolio at an average\nyield of 5.6%. In the third quarter, these actions continued, but to a lesser degree, as we invested over\n10% of the portfolio at an average yield of approximately 5.2%, which continues to outpace portfolio yield\nby more than 100 basis points. The benefits of reinvesting over one-third of our fixed maturity portfolio in\nthe last 2 quarters contributed to third quarter fixed maturity income increasing 29% or $4.3 million over\nprior year to $19 million. This high volume of asset purchases at attractive yields will enhance shareholder\nreturns for years to come.\nOur third quarter fixed maturity portfolio is expected to generate $78 million of fixed maturity income on\na prospective annualized basis, with additional increases possible from future reinvestment at higher\nrates. In addition to the improvements in our fixed income portfolio, we also saw increased valuation on\nlimited partnerships and alternative assets. This part of the portfolio contributed $4.3 million of the\nincrease in investment income from prior year.\nTurning to the expense ratio, we continue to make good progress in reducing our overall cost structure\nwhile also investing in the business. We've seen some geography shifts impacting our underwriting\nexpense ratio. Since the beginning of 2023, we have made meaningful changes to the size and\ncomposition of the UFG team, with total headcount down approximately 20% in that time. A larger\nreduction in the size of the claims team, combined with significant investments and capabilities supporting\nlong term profitable growth has resulted in a shift in the geography of our overall expense. This shift has\ncontributed to an increase in underwriting expenses but a larger decrease in claims, which benefits our\nloss ratio. However, our expense ratio remains too high and we’ll continue to focus on bringing this down\nover time. This quarter was impacted by improved business performance that drove slightly higher\nexpenses, as well as an increase in technology spending compared to the same quarter last year.\nThird quarter net income was $0.76 per diluted share with the non-GAAP adjusted operating gain of\n$0.81 per diluted share. These results, along with a significant decrease in the unrealized loss position,\nresulted in book value per common share increasing to $31.01. Adjusted book value per share, which\nexcludes the impact of unrealized investment losses, increased to $32.42. From a capital management\nperspective, during the third quarter, we declared and paid a $0.16 per share cash dividend to\nshareholders of record as of August 30, 2024.\nThis concludes our prepared remarks. I will now have the operator open the line for questions.\nQUESTION AND ANSWER\nOperator\nwe will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question, you may press star then one on\nyour touchtone phone. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the\nkeys. If at any time your question has been addressed and you would like to withdraw your question,\nplease press star then two. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster.\nOur first question today comes from Paul Newsome with Piper Sandler.\nPaul Newsome\nI got a few quick questions here, I think. First, I wanted to ask you about the sustainability of the combined\nratio excluding catastrophe losses and reserve developments. It looked like you had some good guys, at\nleast in the catastrophe loss ratio. Were there any sort of good or bad guys that you would like to call out\nas we think about the current level being the proper run rate?\nUnited Fire Group, Inc.\nNovember 6, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern\n5\nJulie Stephenson\nOf course. I think we see overall improvement across all lines of business. I think as we continue to drive\nstrong rate achievement and that rate achievement earns through, we believe that the loss ratio that\nwe're seeing on these lines will continue to be favorable. We also have continued to see frequency decline\nand it looks as if severity is showing some signs of stabilization. So, all of those things suggest that the\nloss ratio improvement we've seen is sustainable over time. Of course, we are continuing to take\nmeasures to continually improve the risk profile of the business we're putting on the books.\nPaul Newsome\nThen maybe turning to top line growth, maybe some additional color on what's happening there. I was\nhoping you could kind of slice it maybe two different ways. One, looking at sort of rate versus exposure\nversus unit growth and then maybe some thoughts about sort of specifically where you're growing from\na product perspective as well and where you think the opportunities are.\nKevin Leidwinger\nWe missed the first part of the question. Could you just clarify the intro? We need the context to be able\nto answer your question.\nPaul Newsome\nI'd like you to talk about your premium revenue line, the top line and I'd like you to hopefully talk about it\nin two different ways. One would be rate versus exposure versus unit growth and the other way I was\nhoping you could talk about it would be from a product perspective and where you think the best\nadvantages are.\nJulie Stephenson\nCertainly, and I'll take that, Paul. Thank you for the clarification. I think we were really pleased this quarter\nto see growth across all of our business units. It had been a while since we were able to do that. As you\nknow, we took a chance to rebuild our surety organization, rebuild our specialty organization under a new\nleader and certainly have taken measures to bring a higher degree of specialization to core commercial.\nSo, I think all those things you're beginning to see the result of in this favorable growth.\nAs an account solution provider in core commercial, getting the business mix and line of business mix\nright is a priority. We think that we're heading in the right direction and that we're well poised to grow.\nAlso taking a lot of opportunity to reinforce our relevance with our distribution partners and as they\nunderstand more about where we're headed, we feel very confident that we'll continue to see a nice flow\nof the quality of new business that we want.\nFrom a rate perspective, as I mentioned before, we still are seeing some rate acceleration. We hope that\nwill continue. We saw the leveling off in property but acceleration well above trend in auto, which we think\nwill continue and solid rate achievement in GL. In the current conditions, we hope that that will continue\ninto future quarters.\nFrom a count perspective, policy counts are remaining relatively stable. The profile of our business is\nchanging a little bit as we are looking to write more sophisticated insureds. We may see a slight decrease\nin the number of clients that we're adding, but nothing material and it would all be based on the fact that\nwe're just writing larger accounts.\nCONCLUSION\nOperator\nThis concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Kevin\nUnited Fire Group, Inc.\nNovember 6, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern\n6\nLeidwinger for any closing remarks.\nKevin Leidwinger\nThanks for joining us this morning and we'll see you next quarter.\nOperator\nThe conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now\ndisconnect.\nUnited Fire Group, Inc.\nNovember 6, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern"
