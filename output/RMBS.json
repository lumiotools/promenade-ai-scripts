(NASDAQ:RMBS), a provider of industry-leading chips and IP making data faster and safer, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. GAAP revenue for the third quarter was $145.5 million, licensing billings were $65.4 million, product revenue was $66.4 million, and contract and other revenue was $15.0 million. The Company also generated $62.1 million in cash provided by operating activities in the third quarter. \n\n“We delivered strong sequential growth in Q3, fueled by a double-digit increase in product revenue, and generated excellent cash from operations,” said Luc Seraphin, chief executive officer of Rambus. “Building on our strong execution and strategic investment in new leadership products, we introduced the industry’s first complete chipsets for industry-standard DDR5 MRDIMM 12800 and RDIMM 8000 to address the rising performance needs of the data center and AI. These new chips represent a significant expansion of our addressable market and support the company’s long-term growth.” \n\n**Quarterly Financial Review - GAAP** |  **Three Months Ended** **September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**(In millions, except for percentages and per share amounts)** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nRevenue   \nProduct revenue  |  $  |  66.4  |  $  |  52.2   \nRoyalties  |  64.1  |  28.9   \nContract and other revenue  |  15.0  |  24.2   \nTotal revenue  |  145.5  |  105.3   \nCost of product revenue  |  24.6  |  19.4   \nCost of contract and other revenue  |  0.8  |  1.3   \nAmortization of acquired intangible assets (included in total cost of revenue)  |  2.8  |  3.3   \nTotal operating expenses (benefits) (1) |  62.7  |  (23.6  |  )   \nOperating income  |  $  |  54.6  |  $  |  104.9   \nOperating margin  |  38  |  %  |  100  |  %   \nNet income  |  $  |  48.7  |  $  |  103.2   \nDiluted net income per share  |  $  |  0.45  |  $  |  0.93   \nNet cash provided by operating activities  |  $  |  62.1  |  $  |  51.6   \n_________________________________________   \n---  \n(1) |  Includes amortization of acquired intangible assets of approximately $0.1 million and $0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.   \n**Quarterly Financial Review - Supplemental Information(1) ** |  **Three Months Ended** **September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**(In millions)** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nLicensing billings (operational metric) (2) |  $  |  65.4  |  $  |  57.9   \nProduct revenue (GAAP)  |  $  |  66.4  |  $  |  52.2   \nContract and other revenue (GAAP)  |  $  |  15.0  |  $  |  24.2   \nNon-GAAP cost of product revenue  |  $  |  24.4  |  $  |  19.2   \nCost of contract and other revenue (GAAP)  |  $  |  0.8  |  $  |  1.3   \nNon-GAAP total operating expenses  |  $  |  55.3  |  $  |  52.4   \nNon-GAAP interest and other income (expense), net  |  $  |  4.2  |  $  |  1.9   \nDiluted share count (GAAP)  |  108  |  111   \n_________________________________________   \n---  \n(1) |  See “Supplemental Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results” table included below.   \n(2) |  Licensing billings is an operational metric that reflects amounts invoiced to our licensing customers during the period, as adjusted for certain differences relating to advanced payments for variable licensing agreements.   \n  \nGAAP revenue for the quarter was $145.5 million. The Company also had licensing billings of $65.4 million, product revenue of $66.4 million, and contract and other revenue of $15.0 million. The Company had total GAAP cost of revenue of $28.1 million and operating expenses of $62.7 million. The Company also had total non-GAAP operating expenses of $80.5 million (including non-GAAP cost of revenue of $25.2 million). The Company had GAAP diluted net income per share of $0.45. The Company’s basic share count was 107 million shares and its diluted share count was 108 million shares. \n\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024 were $432.7 million, which remained flat from June 30, 2024, mainly due to $62.1 million in cash provided by operating activities, offset by $50 million paid in connection with a share repurchase program and $9.9 million paid to acquire property, plant and equipment. \n\n**2024 Fourth Quarter Outlook**\n\nThe Company will discuss its full revenue guidance for the fourth quarter of 2024 during its upcoming conference call. The following table sets forth the fourth quarter outlook for other measures. \n\n**(In millions)** |  **GAAP** |  **Non-GAAP(1) **  \n---|---|---  \nLicensing billings (operational metric) (2) |  $57 - $63  |  $57 - $63   \nProduct revenue (GAAP)  |  $72 - $78  |  $72 - $78   \nContract and other revenue (GAAP)  |  $22 - $28  |  $22 - $28   \nTotal operating costs and expenses  |  $101 - $97  |  $86 - $82   \nInterest and other income (expense), net  |  $4  |  $4   \nDiluted share count  |  108  |  108   \n_________________________________________   \n---  \n(1) |  See “Reconciliation of GAAP Forward-Looking Estimates to Non-GAAP Forward-Looking Estimates” table included below.   \n(2) |  Licensing billings is an operational metric that reflects amounts invoiced to our licensing customers during the period, as adjusted for certain differences relating to advanced payments for variable licensing agreements.   \n  \nFor the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company expects licensing billings to be between $57 million and $63 million. The Company also expects royalty revenue to be between $54 million and $60 million, product revenue to be between $72 million and $78 million, and contract and other revenue to be between $22 million and $28 million. Revenue is not without risk and achieving revenue in this range will require that the Company sign customer agreements for various product sales and solutions licensing, among other matters. \n\nThe Company also expects operating costs and expenses to be between $101 million and $97 million. Additionally, the Company expects non-GAAP operating costs and expenses to be between $86 million and $82 million. These expectations also assume a tax rate of 22% and a diluted share count of 108 million, and exclude stock-based compensation expense of $13 million and amortization of acquired intangible assets of $2 million. \n\n**Conference Call**\n\nThe Company’s management will discuss the results of the quarter during a conference call scheduled for 2:00 p.m. PT today. The call, audio and slides will be available online at investor.rambus.com and a replay will be available for the next week at the following numbers: (866) 813-9403 (domestic) or (+1) 929-458-6194 (international) with ID# 719712. \n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Information**\n\nIn the commentary set forth above and in the financial statements included in this earnings release, the Company presents the following non-GAAP financial measures: cost of product revenue, operating expenses and interest and other income (expense), net. In computing each of these non-GAAP financial measures, the following items were considered as discussed below: stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related/divestiture costs and retention bonus expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets, restructuring and other charges (benefits), expense on abandoned operating leases, facility restoration costs, gain on divestiture, change in fair value of earn-out liability, impairment of assets, and certain other one-time adjustments. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated. Management believes the non-GAAP financial measures are appropriate for both its own assessment of, and to show investors, how the Company’s performance compares to other periods. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. A reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in the financial statements contained in this release. \n\nThe Company’s non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on the following items: \n\n_Stock-based compensation expense_ . These expenses primarily relate to employee stock options, employee stock purchase plans, and employee non-vested equity stock and non-vested stock units. The Company excludes stock-based compensation expense from its non-GAAP measures primarily because such expenses are non-cash expenses that the Company does not believe are reflective of ongoing operating results. Additionally, given the fact that other companies may grant different amounts and types of equity awards and may use different option valuation assumptions, excluding stock-based compensation expense permits more accurate comparisons of the Company’s results with peer companies. \n\n_Acquisition-related/divestiture costs and retention bonus expense._ These expenses include all direct costs of certain acquisitions, divestitures and the current periods’ portion of any retention bonus expense associated with the acquisitions. The Company excludes these expenses in order to provide better comparability between periods as they are related to acquisitions and divestitures and have no direct correlation to the Company’s operations. \n\n_Amortization of acquired intangible assets_ . The Company incurs expenses for the amortization of intangible assets acquired in acquisitions. The Company excludes these items because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred. These amounts arise from the Company’s prior acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the operation of the Company’s core business. \n\n_Restructuring and other charges (recoveries)._ These charges (recoveries) may consist of severance, contractual retention payments, exit costs and other charges and are excluded because such charges (recoveries) are not directly related to ongoing business results and do not reflect expected future operating expenses. \n\n_Expense on abandoned operating leases._ Reflects the expense on building leases that were abandoned. The Company excludes these charges because such charges are not directly related to ongoing business results and do not reflect expected future operating expenses. \n\n_Facility restoration costs._ These charges consist of exit costs associated with our leased office space and are excluded because such charges are not directly related to ongoing business results and do not reflect expected future operating expenses. \n\n_Gain on divestiture._ Reflects the gain on the sale of the Company's PHY IP business. The Company excludes these charges (benefits) because such charges (benefits) are not directly related to ongoing business results and do not reflect expected future operating expenses (benefits). \n\n_Impairment of assets._ These charges primarily consist of non-cash charges to property, plant and equipment assets, which are excluded because such charges are non-recurring and do not reduce the Company’s liquidity. \n\n_Change in fair value of earn-out liability._ This change is due to adjustments to acquisition purchase consideration. The Company excludes these adjustments because such adjustments are not directly related to ongoing business results and do not reflect expected future operating expenses. \n\n_Income tax adjustments_ . For purposes of internal forecasting, planning and analyzing future periods that assume net income from operations, the Company estimates a fixed, long-term projected tax rate of approximately 22 percent and 24 percent for 2024 and 2023, respectively, which consists of estimated U.S. federal and state tax rates, and excludes tax rates associated with certain items such as withholding tax, tax credits, deferred tax asset valuation allowance and the release of any deferred tax asset valuation allowance. Accordingly, the Company has applied these tax rates to its non-GAAP financial results for all periods in the relevant years to assist the Company’s planning. \n\nOn occasion in the future, there may be other items, such as significant gains or losses from contingencies, that the Company may exclude in deriving its non-GAAP financial measures if it believes that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors and management. \n\n**About Rambus Inc.**\n\nRambus is a provider of industry-leading chips and silicon IP making data faster and safer.

These innovative new products for RDIMMs and MRDIMMs will seamlessly extend DDR5 performance with unparalleled bandwidth and memory capacity for compute-intensive data center and AI workloads. \n\n![DDR5 MRDIMM 12800 \\(Front\\) Concept Image Showing Rambus MRCD, MDB, SPD Hub and Temperature Sensor ICs \\(Graphic: Business Wire\\)](https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20241015693330/en/2272406/4/DDR5_MRDIMM12800_Concept_Image_Front_MRCDMDBsSPDHubTS_Rambus.jpg)\n\nDDR5 MRDIMM 12800 (Front) Concept Image Showing Rambus MRCD, MDB, SPD Hub and Temperature Sensor ICs (Graphic: Business Wire)\n\nThe new Rambus chips include: \n\n  * The **Gen5 Registering Clock Driver (RCD)** , enabling RDIMMs operating at 8000 megatransfers per second (MT/s). \n  * The **Multiplexed Registering Clock Driver (MRCD) and Multiplexed Data Buffer (MDB)** , enabling upcoming MRDIMMs running at speeds up to 12,800 MT/s by doubling the bandwidth of the DIMM beyond the native DRAM device speed. \n  * The **second-generation server Power Management IC (PMIC5030)** designed for both DDR5 RDIMM 8000 and MRDIMM 12800, providing ultra-high current at low voltage to support higher speeds and more DRAM and logic chips per module. \n\n\n\n“The voracious memory demands of AI and HPC require the relentless pursuit of higher performance through continued innovation and technology leadership,” said Sean Fan, chief operating officer at Rambus. “With our 30-plus years of renowned high-speed signal integrity and memory system expertise, the Rambus Gen5 RCD, and next-generation MRCD, MDB, and PMIC will be critical enabling chips in future-generation servers leveraging DDR5 RDIMM 8000 and MRDIMM 12800.” \n\nEnabling flexible and scalable end-user server configuration, the DDR5 RDIMM 8000 and industry-standard MRDIMM 12800 utilize a common architecture with compatibility across server platforms. The DDR5 RDIMM 8000 chipset includes the Gen5 RCD, PMIC5030, Serial Presence Detect (SPD) Hub and Temperature Sensor (TS) chips. The DDR5 MRDIMM 12800 chipset includes the MRCD and MDB, as well as the same PMIC5030, SPD Hub and TS chips utilized in the RDIMM 8000. \n\nThe DDR5 MRDIMM 12800 employs a novel and efficient module design that boosts data transfer rates and system performance by multiplexing two ranks of DRAM, effectively interleaving the two data streams. This allows the host memory bus to run at twice the data rate of the native DRAM devices, thus increasing bandwidth while using the same physical connections of DDR5 RDIMMs. This requires an MRCD that can address the two ranks of DRAMs on alternate clock cycles, as well as MDBs to direct the data stream to and from the correct DRAM devices. Each DDR5 MRDIMM 12800 requires one MRCD and ten MDB chips to multiplex the memory channel. The MRCD and MDB will also support a Tall MRDIMM form factor with four ranks of DDR5 DRAMs for double the capacity of a dual-rank RDIMM in a cost-effective manner. \n\nThe Gen5 RCD, MRCD, MDB and PMIC5030 are part of the growing Rambus portfolio of industry-leading memory interface and power management solutions including Gen1 to Gen4 RCD, Client Clock Driver (CKD), Server PMIC, SPD Hub, and TS chips. \n\n**More Information:**\n\nLearn more about the Rambus DDR5 memory interface and power management chips at [https://www.rambus.com/ddr5](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rambus.com%2Fddr5&esheet=54136036&newsitemid=20241015693330&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rambus.com%2Fddr5&index=3&md5=d5621bd5129e553b4c3988a44b8bfcac). \n\n**Follow Rambus:** Company website: [rambus.com ](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rambus.com%2F&esheet=54136036&newsitemid=20241015693330&lan=en-US&anchor=rambus.com&index=4&md5=f32ef9b169a08da5886a797ea72fb34d) Rambus blog: [rambus.com/blog ](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rambus.com%2Fblog&esheet=54136036&newsitemid=20241015693330&lan=en-US&anchor=rambus.com%2Fblog&index=5&md5=3004d56bf0fc071771b88484c31a506f) LinkedIn: [www.linkedin.com/company/rambus](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fcompany%2Frambus&esheet=54136036&newsitemid=20241015693330&lan=en-US&anchor=www.linkedin.com%2Fcompany%2Frambus&index=6&md5=73e547a304181e8d53c64d9c8b9caadd)\n\n**About Rambus Inc.**\n\nRambus is a provider of industry-leading chips and silicon IP making data faster and safer.

The Company’s business generally is subject to a number of risks which are described more fully in the\nCompany’s periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking\nstatements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof.\nThis presentation contains non-GAAP financial measures, including cost of product revenue, operating costs and expenses, and interest and other\nincome (expense), net. In computing these non-GAAP financial measures, stock-based compensation expenses, acquisition/divestiture-related costs\nand retention bonus expense, gain on divestiture, impairment of assets, amortization of acquired intangible assets, expense on abandoned operating\nleases, restructuring and other charges, provision for (benefit from) income taxes, change in fair value earn-out liability, gain on sale of equity\ninvestment and certain other one-time adjustments were considered.

Consolidated Financial Statements\n8\nRAMBUS INC.\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. Basis of Presentation\nThe accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Rambus Inc. (“Rambus” or the “Company”) and its\nwholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\nIn the opinion of management, the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring\nitems) necessary to state fairly the financial position and results of operations for each interim period presented. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of\nresults for a full year.\nFinancial Statement Preparation\nThe Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and\nExchange Commission (the “SEC”) applicable to interim financial information. Certain information and note disclosures included in the financial statements\nprepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) have been omitted in these interim statements pursuant to such SEC rules and\nregulations. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in Form 10-\nK for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts\nof assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and\nexpenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nReclassifications\nCertain prior-year balances were reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation. None of these reclassifications had an impact on reported net\nincome or cash flows for any of the periods presented.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nThere were no material changes to Rambus’s significant accounting policies disclosed in Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” of Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n2. Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2023-07, “Segment Reporting\n(Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.” This guidance requires disclosure of incremental segment information on an annual and\ninterim basis, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker. In\naddition, this ASU requires that all existing annual disclosures about segment profit or loss must be provided on an interim basis and clarifies that single\nreportable segment entities are subject to the disclosure requirement under Topic 280 in its entirety. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods\nbeginning after December 15, 2023, and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is\npermitted. The amendments in this ASU should be applied on a retrospective basis. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this\nguidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.” This guidance requires\nadditional disclosures related to rate reconciliation, income taxes paid and other disclosures. For each annual period presented, public business entities are\nrequired to 1) disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and 2) provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative\nthreshold. In addition, this ASU requires all reporting entities to disclose on an annual basis the amount of income taxes paid disaggregated by federal, state and\nforeign taxes, as well as the amount of income taxes paid disaggregated by individual jurisdictions which meet a quantitative threshold. This ASU is effective\nfor annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or\nmade available for issuance. The\n9\namendments in this ASU should be applied on a prospective basis, with retrospective application permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact\nthat the adoption of this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.\n3. Revenue Recognition\nContract Balances\nThe contract assets are primarily related to the Company’s fixed fee intellectual property (“IP”) licensing arrangements and rights to consideration for\nperformance obligations delivered but not billed as of September 30, 2024.\nThe Company’s contract balances were as follows:\nAs of\n(In thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nUnbilled receivables $ 34,357 $ 55,295\nDeferred revenue $ 19,346 $ 18,085\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized $16.4 million of revenue that was included in deferred revenue as of\nDecember 31, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized $19.3 million of revenue that was included in deferred\nrevenue as of December 31, 2022.\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nRevenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents the transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied, or\npartially unsatisfied, which includes unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. Contracted but\nunsatisfied performance obligations were approximately $28.2 million as of September 30, 2024, which the Company primarily expects to recognize over the\nnext 2 years.\n4. Earnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted\nearnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings by the weighted-average number of common shares and potentially dilutive securities outstanding\nduring the period. Potentially dilutive common shares consist of incremental common shares issuable upon exercise of stock options, employee stock\npurchases, and restricted stock and restricted stock units and shares issuable upon the conversion of convertible notes. The dilutive effect of outstanding shares\nis reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method, or the if-converted method for the in-the-money conversion feature of the\nCompany’s 2023 Notes (“the 2023 Notes”). This method includes consideration of the amounts to be paid by the employees, the amount of excess tax benefits\nthat would be recognized in equity if the instrument was exercised and the amount of unrecognized stock-based compensation related to future services. No\npotential dilutive common shares are included in the computation of any diluted per share amount when a net loss is reported.\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(In thousands, except per share amounts) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet income per share:\nNumerator:\nNet income $ 48,665 $ 103,198 $ 117,619 $ 275,359\nDenominator:\nWeighted-average shares outstanding - basic 107,235 108,317 107,681 108,412\nEffect of potentially dilutive common shares 1,239 2,458 1,637 2,767\nWeighted-average shares outstanding - diluted 108,474 110,775 109,318 111,179\nBasic net income per share $ 0.45 $ 0.95 $ 1.09 $ 2.54\nDiluted net income per share $ 0.45 $ 0.93 $ 1.08 $ 2.48\n10\n5.

Segments and Major Customers\nOperating segments are based upon the Company’s internal organization structure, the manner in which its operations are managed, the criteria used by its\nChief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) to evaluate segment performance and availability of separate financial information regularly reviewed for\nresource allocation and performance assessment.\nThe Company has determined its CODM to be the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”). The CEO reviews financial information presented on a consolidated\nbasis for purposes of managing the business, allocating resources, making operating decisions and assessing financial performance. On this basis, the Company\nis organized and operates as a single segment within the semiconductor space. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has a single operating and reportable\nsegment.\n11\nAccounts receivable from the Company’s major customers representing 10% or more of total accounts receivable at September 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023, respectively, was as follows:\nAs of\nCustomer September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nCustomer 1 38 % 49 %\nCustomer 2 24 % 13 %\nCustomer 3 * 12 %\n_________________________________________\n* Customer accounted for less than 10% of total accounts receivable in the period.\nRevenue from the Company’s major customers representing 10% or more of total revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023, respectively, was as follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\nCustomer 2024 2023 2024 2023\nCustomer A 21 % 29 % 23 % 26 %\nCustomer B 21 % 25 % 19 % 18 %\nCustomer C 10 % * 11 % *\nCustomer D 14 % * * *\n__________________________________________\n* Customer accounted for less than 10% of total revenue in the period.\nRevenue from customers in the geographic regions based on the location of contracting parties was as follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nUSA $ 46,315 $ 32,347 $ 153,915 $ 131,415\nSouth Korea 56,129 38,228 134,931 100,985\nSingapore 21,082 16,325 45,406 42,371\nOther 21,987 18,398 61,270 64,121\nTotal $ 145,513 $ 105,298 $ 395,522 $ 338,892\n12\n7.

The Company holds all of its marketable securities as available-for-sale,\nmarks them to market, and regularly reviews its portfolio to ensure adherence to its investment policy and to monitor individual investments for risk analysis,\nproper valuation, and impairment.\n13\nThe estimated fair value and gross unrealized losses of cash equivalents and marketable securities classified by the length of time that the securities have\nbeen in a continuous unrealized loss position at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are as follows:\nFair Value Gross Unrealized Losses\n(In thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nLess than 12 months\nU.S. Government bonds and notes $ 46,746 $ 32,454 $ (32) $ (53)\nCorporate bonds, commercial paper and notes 21,009 46,407 (11) (40)\nTotal cash equivalents and marketable securities in a continuous\nunrealized loss position for less than 12 months 67,755 78,861 (43) (93)\n12 months or greater\nU.S. Government bonds and notes — 6,841 — (159)\nCorporate bonds, commercial paper and notes — 16,619 — (365)\nTotal marketable securities in a continuous unrealized loss position for\n12 months or greater — 23,460 — (524)\nTotal cash equivalents and marketable securities in a continuous\nunrealized loss position $ 67,755 $ 102,321 $ (43) $ (617)\nThe gross unrealized losses at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were not material in relation to the Company’s total available-for-sale portfolio.\nThe gross unrealized losses can be primarily attributed to a combination of market conditions as well as the demand for and duration of the U.S. government-\nsponsored obligations and corporate bonds, commercial paper and notes. The Company reasonably believes that there is no need to sell these investments and\nthat it can recover the amortized cost of these investments. The Company has found no evidence of impairment due to credit losses in its portfolio. Therefore,\nthese unrealized losses were recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). The Company cannot provide any assurance that its portfolio of cash, cash\nequivalents and marketable securities will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets, which may require the Company in the future to\nrecord an impairment charge for credit losses which could adversely impact its financial results.\nThe contractual maturities of cash equivalents (excluding money market funds which have no maturity) and marketable securities are summarized as\nfollows:\n(In thousands) September 30, 2024\nDue in less than one year $ 282,683\nDue from one year through three years 42,815\nTotal $ 325,498\nRefer to Note 8, “Fair Value of Financial Instruments,” for a discussion regarding the fair value of the Company’s cash equivalents and marketable\nsecurities.\n8.

The following table presents additional information about liabilities measured at fair value for which the Company utilizes\nLevel 3 inputs to determine fair value, as of September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nBalance as of beginning of period $ 12,000 $ 28,600 $ 12,500 $ 14,800\nChange in fair value of earn-out liability due to remeasurement (4,544) (5,666) (5,044) 8,134\nChange in fair value of earn-out liability due to achievement of revenue\ntarget (7,456) (11,534) (7,456) (11,534)\nBalance as of end of period $ — $ 11,400 $ — $ 11,400\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the changes in the fair value of the earn-out liability related to the 2021 acquisition of\nPLDA, which was subject to certain revenue targets of the acquired business for a period of three years from the date of acquisition, and which is settled\nannually in shares of the Company’s common stock based on the fair value of that common stock fixed at the time the Company acquired PLDA. The fair value\nof the earn-out liability was remeasured each quarter, depending on the acquired business’s revenue performance relative to target over the applicable period,\nand adjusted to reflect changes in the per share value of the Company’s common stock. The Company classified its liability for the contingent earn-out liability\nrelated to the PLDA acquisition within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because the fair value calculation included significant unobservable inputs, such as\nrevenue forecast, revenue volatility, equity volatility and weighted-average cost of capital. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the\nCompany remeasured the fair value of the earn-out liability, which resulted in reductions of $4.5 million and $5.0 million, respectively, in the Company’s\nUnaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company remeasured the fair\nvalue of the earn-out liability, which resulted in a reduction of $5.7 million and additional expenses of $8.1 million, respectively, in the Company’s Unaudited\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The final earn-out was achieved as of September 30, 2024 and is expected to be fully paid during the fourth\nquarter of 2024.\nThe Company monitors its investments for impairment and records appropriate reductions in carrying value when necessary. The Company monitors its\ninvestments for impairment by considering current factors, including the economic environment, market conditions, operational performance and other specific\nfactors relating to the business underlying the investment, reductions in carrying values when necessary and the Company’s ability and intent to hold the\ninvestment for a period of time which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery in the market. Any impairment is reported under “Interest and other income\n(expense), net” in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n15\nIn 2018, the Company made an investment in a non-marketable equity security of a private company. This equity investment was accounted for under the\nequity method of accounting, and the Company accounted for its equity method share of the income (loss) on a quarterly basis. During the fourth quarter of\n2023, the Company sold its 25.0% ownership share in the equity investment for approximately $25.0 million, which represented a gross gain on this transaction\nfor the same amount. The gross gain was offset by transaction costs of approximately $1.1 million, resulting in a net gain of approximately $23.9 million,\nwhich was included in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2023. Subsequently, the Company received\nproceeds, net of tax, of approximately $22.8 million from this transaction during the first quarter of 2024.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were no transfers of financial instruments between different categories of fair\nvalue.\n9. Leases\nThe Company leases office space, domestically and internationally, under operating leases. The Company’s leases have remaining lease terms generally\nbetween one year and six years. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, operating lease liabilities and long-term operating\nlease liabilities on the Company’s Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company does not have any finance leases.\nThe table below reconciles the undiscounted cash flows for the first five years and total of the remaining years to the operating lease liabilities recorded on\nthe Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2024 (in thousands):\nYears ending December 31, Amount\n2024 (remaining three months) $ 1,723\n2025 6,939\n2026 7,209\n2027 5,661\n2028 4,549\nThereafter 8,453\nTotal minimum lease payments 34,534\nLess: amount of lease payments representing interest (4,343)\nPresent value of future minimum lease payments 30,191\nLess: current obligations under leases (5,397)\nLong-term lease obligations $ 24,794\nAs of September 30, 2024, the weighted-average remaining lease term for the Company’s operating leases was 5.4 years and the weighted-average discount\nrate used to determine the present value of the Company’s operating leases was 7.3%.\nOperating lease costs included in research and development and selling, general and administrative costs on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated\nStatements of Operations were $1.4 million and $1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Operating lease costs\nincluded in research and development and selling, general and administrative costs on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations were\n$4.0 million and $4.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities were $4.5 million and $5.2 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n10. Convertible Notes\nThe Company did not have any convertible notes outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nDuring the first quarter of 2023, the holders of the remaining $10.4 million aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes elected to convert the notes\npursuant to the original terms of the conversion feature. Accordingly, upon maturity, the Company paid $10.4 million in cash to settle the aggregate principal\namount of the 2023 Notes and delivered approximately 0.3 million shares of the Company's common stock to settle the conversion spread.\n16\nIn connection with the settlement of the conversion of the remaining 2023 Notes, the Company received 0.3 million shares of the Company’s common stock\nfor the retirement of the remaining convertible senior note hedges and paid $10.7 million in cash for the retirement of the remaining warrants during the first\nquarter of 2023. Additionally, the retirement of the remaining warrants was subject to derivative accounting, resulting in a loss on fair value adjustment of\nderivatives of $0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nInterest expense related to the convertible notes for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was immaterial.\n11. Commitments and Contingencies\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company’s material contractual obligations were as follows:\n(In thousands) Total Remainder of 2024 2025 2026\nContractual obligations (1) (2)\nSoftware licenses (3) $ 13,001 $ 4,044 $ 8,520 $ 437\nOther contractual obligations 300 31 131 138\nAcquisition retention bonuses (4) 275 — 275 —\nTotal $ 13,576 $ 4,075 $ 8,926 $ 575\n_________________________________________\n(1) The above table does not reflect possible payments in connection with unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $126.9 million, including $25.6 million\nrecorded as a reduction of long-term deferred tax assets and $101.3 million in long-term income taxes payable as of September 30, 2024. As noted below\nin Note 14, “Income Taxes,” although it is possible that some of the unrecognized tax benefits could be settled within the next 12 months, the Company\ncannot reasonably estimate the timing of the outcome at this time.\n(2) For the Company’s lease commitments as of September 30, 2024, refer to Note 9, “Leases.”\n(3) The Company has commitments with various software vendors for agreements generally having terms longer than one year.\n(4) In connection with the acquisitions of Hardent in the second quarter of 2022 and PLDA in the third quarter of 2021, the Company is obligated to pay\nretention bonuses to certain employees subject to certain eligibility and acceleration provisions, including the condition of employment.\nFrom time to time, the Company indemnifies certain customers as a necessary means of doing business. Indemnification covers customers for losses\nsuffered or incurred by them as a result of any patent, copyright, or other IP infringement or any other claim by any third party arising as a result of the\napplicable agreement with the Company. The Company generally attempts to limit the maximum amount of indemnification that the Company could be\nrequired to make under these agreements to the amount of fees received by the Company, however, this may not always be possible. The fair value of the\nliability as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, was not material.\n17\n12. Equity Incentive Plans and Stock-Based Compensation\nA summary of shares available for grant under the Company’s plans is as follows:\nShares Available\nfor Grant\nTotal shares available for grant as of December 31, 2023 11,954,150\nStock options expired 1,125\nNonvested equity stock and stock units granted (1) (2) (1,145,510)\nNonvested equity stock and stock units forfeited (1) 290,495\nTotal shares available for grant as of September 30, 2024 11,100,260\n_________________________________________\n(1) For purposes of determining the number of shares available for grant under the 2015 Plan against the maximum number of shares authorized, each\nrestricted stock unit granted prior to April 27, 2023 reduces the number of shares available for grant by 1.5 shares and each restricted stock unit forfeited\nincreases shares available for grant by 1.5 shares. Each restricted stock unit granted on or after April 27, 2023 reduces the number of shares available for\ngrant by 1.0 share and each restricted stock unit forfeited increases shares available for grant by 1.0 share.\n(2) Amount includes approximately 0.1 million shares that have been reserved for potential future issuance related to certain performance unit awards granted\nin the second quarter of 2024 and discussed under the section titled “Nonvested Equity Stock and Stock Units” below.\nGeneral Stock Option Information\nThe following table summarizes stock option activity under the Company’s equity incentive plans for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\ninformation regarding stock options outstanding, exercisable, and vested and expected to vest as of September 30, 2024.\nOptions Outstanding\nWeighted-\nWeighted- Average\nAverage Remaining Aggregate\nNumber of Exercise Price Contractual Intrinsic\n(In thousands, except shares, per share amounts and years) Shares Per Share Term (years) Value\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2023 124,732 $ 11.60\nOptions exercised (33,607) $ 9.42 $ 1,102\nOptions expired (1,125) $ 8.76\nOutstanding and vested as of September 30, 2024 90,000 $ 12.45 3.79 $ 2,679\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nUnder the 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“2015 ESPP”) the Company issued 69,828 shares at a price of $44.84 and 120,569 shares at a price of\n$27.91 per share during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 2.3 million shares under\nthe 2015 ESPP remained available for issuance.\nStock-Based Compensation\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company maintained stock plans covering a broad range of potential equity grants, including\nstock options, nonvested equity stock and equity stock units and performance-based instruments. In addition, the Company sponsors the 2015 ESPP, whereby\neligible employees are entitled to purchase common stock semi-annually, by means of limited payroll deductions, at a 15% discount from the fair market value\nof the common stock as of specific dates.\nStock Options\nThere were no stock options granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. All compensation cost net of expected\nforfeitures, related to unvested stock-based compensation arrangements granted under the stock option plans had been fully recognized as of December 31,\n2023. There was no stock-based compensation expense related to stock options for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Stock-based compensation\nexpense related to stock options was immaterial for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n18\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense related to the 2015 ESPP of\n$0.4 million and $1.4 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded stock-based compensation\nexpense related to the 2015 ESPP of $0.5 million and $1.5 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, there was $0.1 million of total unrecognized\ncompensation cost related to stock-based compensation arrangements granted under the 2015 ESPP. That cost is expected to be recognized over one month.\nNonvested Equity Stock and Stock Units\nThe Company grants nonvested equity stock units to officers, employees and directors. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the\nCompany granted nonvested equity stock units totaling approximately 0.1 million and 1.0 million shares, respectively. During the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, the Company granted an immaterial amount of nonvested equity stock units. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the\nCompany granted nonvested equity stock units totaling approximately 1.2 million shares. These awards have a service condition, generally a service period of\nfour years, except in the case of grants to directors, for which the service period is one year. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the\nnonvested equity stock units granted were valued at the date of grant giving them a fair value of approximately $4.1 million and $59.8 million, respectively.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the nonvested equity stock units granted were valued at the date of grant giving them a fair value of\napproximately $2.1 million and $57.3 million, respectively. During the second quarter of 2024, as part of its updated annual grant process, the Company\ngranted performance unit awards to certain company executive officers with vesting subject to the achievement of certain performance and/or market\nconditions. During the first quarter of 2023, as part of its previous annual grant process, the Company granted performance unit awards to certain company\nexecutive officers with vesting subject to the achievement of certain performance and/or market conditions. The ultimate number of performance units that can\nbe earned can range from 0% to 200% of target depending on performance relative to target over the applicable period. The shares earned will vest on the third\nor fourth anniversary of the date of grant. The Company’s shares available for grant have been reduced to reflect the shares that could be earned at the\nmaximum target.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of approximately $11.6 million and\n$31.8 million, respectively, related to all outstanding nonvested equity stock grants. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company\nrecorded stock-based compensation expense of approximately $9.5 million and $32.9 million, respectively, related to all outstanding nonvested equity stock\ngrants.\nUnrecognized stock-based compensation related to all nonvested equity stock grants, net of estimated forfeitures, was approximately $81.2 million as of\nSeptember 30, 2024. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.0 years.\nThe following table reflects the activity related to nonvested equity stock and stock units for the nine months ended September 30, 2024:\nWeighted-\nAverage\nGrant-Date\nNonvested Equity Stock and Stock Units Shares Fair Value\nNonvested at December 31, 2023 3,430,192 $ 32.90\nGranted 1,000,828 $ 59.76\nVested (1,226,610) $ 26.59\nForfeited (207,877) $ 36.91\nNonvested at September 30, 2024 2,996,533 $ 44.17\n13. Stockholders’ Equity\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn October 29, 2020, the Company’s board of directors (the “Board”) approved a share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to an\naggregate of 20.0 million shares (the “2020 Repurchase Program”). Share repurchases under the 2020 Repurchase Program may be made through the open\nmarket, established plans or privately negotiated transactions in accordance with all applicable securities laws, rules and regulations. There is no expiration date\napplicable to the 2020 Repurchase Program. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased shares of its common stock under\nthe 2020 Repurchase Program as discussed below.\n19\nOn February 29, 2024, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase program with Royal Bank of Canada (“RBC”) (the “2024 ASR\nProgram”). The 2024 ASR Program was part of the 2020 Repurchase Program. Under the 2024 ASR Program, the Company pre-paid to RBC the $50.0 million\npurchase price for its common stock and, in turn, the Company received an initial delivery of approximately 0.7 million shares of its common stock from RBC\non March 1, 2024, which were retired and recorded as a $40.0 million reduction to stockholders’ equity. The remaining $10.0 million of the initial payment was\nrecorded as a reduction to stockholders’ equity as an unsettled forward contract indexed to the Company’s stock. On March 18, 2024, the accelerated share\nrepurchase program was completed and the Company received an additional 0.1 million shares of its common stock, which were retired, as the final settlement\nof the 2024 ASR Program.\nOn November 2, 2023, the Company entered into a share repurchase plan (the “Buying Plan”) with RBC Capital Markets, LLC (“RBCCM”). The Buying\nPlan was part of the 2020 Repurchase Program. Under the Buying Plan, RBCCM commenced purchases for a 12-month period starting on November 2, 2023\nand ending on November 1, 2024, with a provision to terminate sooner pursuant to the Buying Plan (the “Repurchase Period”). During the first quarter of 2024,\nthe Buying Plan was amended and as a result, no purchases were made from the Buying Plan during the period from March 1, 2024 to March 28, 2024, while\nthe 2024 ASR Program was in effect. During the third quarter of 2024, the Buying Plan was further amended to allow RBCCM to purchase an aggregate\namount of $100.0 million of the Company’s common stock during the Repurchase Period, not to exceed $50.0 million in a quarter. The execution of share\nrepurchases is dependent on the Company’s stock price reaching certain levels. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased\napproximately 1.4 million shares for approximately $63.1 million as part of the Buying Plan, which were retired and recorded as a reduction to stockholders’\nequity.\nOn August 10, 2023, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase program with RBC (the “2023 ASR Program”). The 2023 ASR Program\nwas part of the 2020 Repurchase Program. Under the 2023 ASR Program, the Company pre-paid to RBC the $100.0 million purchase price for its common\nstock and, in turn, the Company received an initial delivery of approximately 1.6 million shares of its common stock from RBC on August 11, 2023, which\nwere retired and recorded as an $80.0 million reduction to stockholders’ equity. The remaining $20.0 million of the initial payment was recorded as a reduction\nto stockholders’ equity as an unsettled forward contract indexed to the Company’s stock. On September 22, 2023, the accelerated share repurchase program\nwas completed and the Company received an additional 0.2 million shares of its common stock, which were retired, as the final settlement of the 2023 ASR\nProgram.\nEffective January 1, 2023, the Company’s share repurchases are subject to a 1% excise tax as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Company recorded an immaterial excise tax liability on its accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nAs of September 30, 2024, there remained an outstanding authorization to repurchase approximately 5.7 million shares of the Company’s outstanding\ncommon stock under the 2020 Repurchase Program.\nThe Company records share repurchases as a reduction to stockholders’ equity. The Company records a portion of the purchase price of the repurchased\nshares as an increase to accumulated deficit when the price of the shares repurchased exceeds the average original proceeds per share received from the\nissuance of common stock in accordance with its accounting policy.\n14. Income Taxes\nThe Company recorded a provision for income taxes of $10.4 million and $4.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively, and a provision for (benefit from) income taxes of $20.1 million and $(151.1) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. The provision for income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by the statutory tax expense for\ndomestic and foreign jurisdictions for 2024, offset by tax benefits from excess stock-based compensation deductions. The provision for income taxes for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by foreign withholding taxes and adjustments to the valuation allowance release on U.S. deferred\ntax assets due to a change in forecasted taxable income and expense, offset by tax benefits from excess stock-based compensation deductions. The benefit from\nincome taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by the valuation allowance release on U.S. deferred tax assets, as well as tax\nbenefits from excess stock-based compensation deductions, offset by foreign withholding taxes.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company paid foreign withholding taxes of $5.1 million and $5.4 million, respectively.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company paid foreign withholding taxes of $15.5 million and $15.8 million, respectively.\nThe Company periodically evaluates the realizability of its net deferred tax assets based on all available evidence, both positive and negative. The\nrealizability of the Company’s net deferred tax assets is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient future taxable income during periods prior to the\nexpiration of tax attributes to fully utilize these assets.\nDuring the second quarter of 2023, based on all available positive and negative evidence, the Company determined that it was appropriate to release the\nvaluation allowance on the majority of the Company’s U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets.\n20\nDuring the third quarter of 2023, the Company further adjusted its valuation allowance release as a result of a change in forecasted income and tax expense,\nprimarily due to the sale of intangible assets as part of the PHY IP group divestiture. During the second quarter of 2023, the Company reached a cumulative\nincome position over the previous three years. The cumulative three-year income is considered positive evidence, which is considered objective and verifiable,\nand thus received significant weighting. Additional positive evidence considered by the Company in its assessment included recent utilization of tax attribute\ncarryforwards and future forecasts of continued profitability in the United States. Upon considering the relative impact of all evidence during the second\nquarter of 2023, both negative and positive, and the weight accorded to each, the Company concluded that it was more likely than not that the majority of its\ndeferred tax assets would be realizable, with the exception of primarily its California research and development credits that have not met the “more likely than\nnot” realization threshold criteria. As a result, the Company released the related valuation allowance against the majority of its federal and state deferred tax\nassets.\nThe Company has U.S. federal deferred tax assets related to research and development credits, foreign tax credits and other tax attributes that can be used to\noffset U.S. federal taxable income in future periods. These credit carryforwards will expire if they are not used within certain time periods. It is possible that\nsome or all of these attributes could ultimately expire unused.\nThe Company maintains liabilities for uncertain tax positions within its long-term income taxes payable accounts and as a reduction to existing deferred tax\nassets to the extent tax attributes are available to offset such liabilities. These liabilities involve judgment and estimation and are monitored by management\nbased on the best information available, including changes in tax regulations, the outcome of relevant court cases and other information.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had $185.7 million of unrecognized tax benefits, including $31.7 million recorded as a reduction of long-term\ndeferred tax assets, $75.0 million recorded as a reduction of other assets associated with refundable withholding taxes previously withheld from licensees in\nSouth Korea, and $78.9 million recorded to long-term income taxes payable. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately $201.9 million of\nunrecognized tax benefits, including $25.6 million recorded as a reduction of long-term deferred tax assets, $75.0 million recorded as a reduction of other\nassets associated with refundable withholding taxes previously withheld from licensees in South Korea, and $101.3 million recorded in long-term income taxes\npayable. As a result of recent court rulings in South Korea, the Company has determined that it may be entitled to refund claims for foreign taxes previously\nwithheld from licensees in South Korea. If the Company is successful in recovering the $177.8 million of refundable withholding taxes from South Korea, the\nrefund will result in an offsetting reduction in U.S. foreign tax credits. The Company recognizes there are numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the\nultimate collection of this refund. The Company previously maintained an offsetting reserve for the entire amount of refundable withholding taxes previously\nwithheld in South Korea. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company concluded it is more likely than not it will recover withholding taxes\nwithheld during the past five years and accordingly filed a claim in October 2023 for refund of certain refundable withholding taxes, and recorded an income\ntaxes receivable of $82.7 million with an offsetting long-term income taxes payable of $72.6 million and a reduction in long-term deferred tax assets of\n$10.1 million for the reduction in U.S. foreign tax credits. The Company has recorded a receivable for the portion of withholding taxes paid subsequent to the\nthird quarter of 2023 for which it intends to file a future refund claim. For the periods prior to the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company has not recorded a\nreceivable because the Company does not believe recovery of those taxes would be more likely than not if a refund claim were submitted. The Company\ncontinues to evaluate the potential for recovery of these taxes and has therefore established an offsetting reserve for the entire amount of potentially refundable\nwithholding taxes previously withheld in South Korea, for which a claim for refund has not been submitted.\nAlthough it is possible that some of the unrecognized tax benefits could be settled within the next 12 months, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the\noutcome at this time.\nAdditionally, the Company’s future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being higher than anticipated in countries where the\nCompany has higher statutory rates or lower than anticipated in countries where it has lower statutory rates, by changes in valuation of its deferred tax assets\nand liabilities or by changes in tax laws or interpretations of those laws.\n15. Litigation and Asserted Claims\nRambus is not currently a party to any material pending legal proceeding; however, from time to time, Rambus may become involved in legal proceedings\nor be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of its business. Although the results of such litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, the\nCompany currently believes that the final outcome of these ordinary course matters will not have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results,\nfinancial position or cash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on the Company because of defense and settlement costs,\ndiversion of management attention and resources and other factors.\nThe Company records a contingent liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable in accordance with\naccounting for contingencies.\n21\n16. Restructuring and Other Charges\n2023 Restructuring Plan\nIn June 2023, the Company initiated a restructuring program to reduce overall expenses, which was expected to improve future profitability by reducing the\nCompany’s overall spending (the “2023 Restructuring Plan”). In connection with this restructuring program, the Company initiated a plan resulting in a\nreduction of 42 employees. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded charges of approximately $9.4 million to “Restructuring\nand other charges (recoveries)” in its Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations, related to the reduction in workforce, as well as write-\ndowns of obligations related to certain IP development costs and software licenses for engineering development tools. The 2023 Restructuring Plan was\nmaterially completed in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not initiate any restructuring programs.\n17. Divestiture\n2023 Divestiture\nIn July 2023, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (the “Purchaser”),\npursuant to which the Company agreed to sell certain assets and the Purchaser agreed to assume certain liabilities from the Company, in each case with respect\nto the Company’s PHY IP group, for $110.0 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments and certain closing conditions (the “Transaction”). The decision to\nsell this portion of our business reflects the evolution of the Company’s core semiconductor business to focus on the development of digital IP and chips,\nincluding novel memory solutions for high-performance computing, to support the continued advancement of the data center and artificial intelligence.\nThe Transaction was completed on September 6, 2023 and resulted in net proceeds of approximately $106.3 million, which consisted of the initial selling\nprice of $110.0 million, offset by approximately $3.7 million related to certain purchase price adjustments. The Company recognized a net gain on divestiture\nof the PHY IP group in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations of approximately $90.8 million during the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2023. Transaction costs of approximately $1.4 million were included in the net gain of $90.8 million.\nThe divestiture of the PHY IP group did not represent a strategic shift that would have a major effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations,\nand therefore its results of operations were not reported as discontinued operations.\nConcurrent with the Transaction, the Company also recorded a charge of approximately $10.0 million in the Company’s Unaudited Condensed\nConsolidated Statements of Operations. The charge was primarily related to the accelerated amortization of software licenses that were not part of the PHY IP\ndisposal group.\n22\nItem 2.

As part of the ongoing execution of our industry-leading product roadmap, we added the DDR5 Client Clock Driver to our product portfolio.\nKey third quarter 2024 financial results included:\n• Revenue of $145.5 million;\n• Operating expenses of $62.7 million; and\n• Net cash provided by operating activities of $62.1 million.\nOperational Highlights\nRevenue Sources\nOur consolidated revenue is comprised of product revenue, royalties and contract and other revenue.\nProduct revenue consists primarily of memory interface chips. Our memory interface chips are sold directly and through distributors to major DRAM\nmanufacturers, Micron, Samsung and SK hynix, as well as to system manufacturers and cloud providers, for integration into server memory modules. Product\nrevenue accounted for 46% and 44% of our consolidated revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 50% for both the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n23\nRoyalty revenue is derived from our patent licenses, through which we provide our customers certain rights to our broad worldwide portfolio of patented\ninventions. Our patent licenses enable our customers to use a portion of our patent portfolio in their own digital electronics products. The licenses typically\nrange in term up to ten years and may define the specific field of use where our customers may utilize our inventions in their products. Royalties may be\nstructured as fixed, variable or a hybrid of fixed and variable royalty payments. Leading semiconductor and electronic system companies, such as AMD,\nBroadcom, CXMT, IBM, Infineon, Kioxia, Marvell, MediaTek, Micron, Nanya, Nuvoton, NVIDIA, Phison, Qualcomm, Samsung, SK hynix, Socionext,\nSTMicroelectronics, Toshiba, Western Digital and Winbond, have licensed our patents. The vast majority of our patents originate from our internal research and\ndevelopment efforts. Additionally, from time to time, we enter into agreements to sell certain patent assets under agreements which may also include\nsubsequent profit-sharing. The sale of these patents, as well as the subsequent profit-sharing, are included as part of our royalty revenue. Revenue from\nroyalties accounted for 44% and 42% of our consolidated revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 27% and 29% for\nthe three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nContract and other revenue consists primarily of Silicon IP, which is comprised of our high-speed interface and security IP. Revenue sources under contract\nand other revenue include our IP core licenses, software licenses and related implementation, support and maintenance fees and engineering services fees. The\ntiming and amounts invoiced to customers can vary significantly depending on specific contract terms and can therefore have a significant impact on deferred\nrevenue or accounts receivable in any given period. Contract and other revenue accounted for 10% and 14% of our consolidated revenue for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 23% and 21% of our consolidated revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The\ndecreases for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023 were primarily attributed to the sale of our\nPHY IP group in the third quarter of 2023.\nCosts and Expenses\nCost of product revenue increased approximately $5.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. Cost\nof product revenue increased approximately $2.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The increases\nin both periods were primarily due to higher sales volumes of our memory interface chips.\nCost of contract and other revenue decreased approximately $0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in\n2023. Cost of contract and other revenue decreased approximately $2.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period\nin 2023. The decreases in both periods were primarily due to lower engineering services associated with the contracts.\nTotal research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased approximately $3.9 million as compared to the same\nperiod in 2023, primarily due to increases in prototyping costs of $2.0 million, stock-based compensation expenses of $1.3 million, headcount-related expenses\nof $0.8 million and facility expenses of $0.6 million, offset by a decrease in software EDA tool subscriptions of $1.1 million. Total research and development\nexpenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased approximately $1.6 million as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to\ndecreases in software EDA tool subscriptions of $4.7 million, consulting expenses of $1.6 million, headcount-related expenses of $1.4 million, depreciation\nexpense of $0.7 million and retention bonus expense related to acquisitions of $0.6 million, offset by increases in prototyping costs of $3.4 million, lower\nengineering costs allocated to cost of revenue of $2.0 million, facility costs of $1.9 million and stock-based compensation expenses of $0.7 million. The\nfluctuations in both periods are primarily driven by growth in our research and development initiatives, offset by decreases attributable to the sale of our PHY\nIP group in the third quarter of 2023.\nTotal sales, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased approximately $0.6 million as compared to the\nsame period in 2023, primarily due to increases in consulting expenses of $0.7 million, stock-based compensation expenses of $0.7 million and headcount-\nrelated expenses of $0.5 million, offset by decreases in rent and facility expenses of $0.8 million and sales and marketing activities of $0.8 million. Total sales,\ngeneral and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased approximately $6.4 million as compared to the same period in\n2023, primarily due to decreases in rent and facility expenses of $3.3 million, stock-based compensation expenses of $1.9 million, sales and marketing\nactivities of $0.7 million and headcount-related costs of $0.5 million, offset by increases in consulting expenses of $1.0 million and acquisition-related costs of\n$0.8 million.\nIntellectual Property\nAs of September 30, 2024, our semiconductor, security and other technologies are covered by 2,241 U.S. and foreign patents. Additionally, we have\n522 patent applications pending in various countries. Some of the patents and pending patent applications are derived from a common parent patent application\nor are foreign counterpart patent applications. We file applications for and obtain patents in the United States and in selected foreign countries where we\nbelieve filing for such\n24\nprotection is appropriate and would further our overall business strategy and objectives. In some instances, obtaining appropriate levels of protection may\ninvolve prosecuting continuation and counterpart patent applications based on a common parent application. We believe our patented innovations provide our\ncustomers with the ability to achieve improved performance, lower risk, greater cost-effectiveness, and other benefits in their products and services.\nTrends\nThere are a number of trends that may have a material impact on us in the future, including but not limited to, the evolution of memory technology, adoption\nof security solutions, the use and adoption of our inventions or technologies generally, industry consolidation and global economic conditions with the resulting\nimpact on sales of consumer electronic systems.\nWe have a high degree of revenue concentration. Our top five customers represented approximately 69% and 64% of our consolidated revenue for the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 63% and 59% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The\nparticular customers which account for revenue concentration have varied from period-to-period as a result of the addition of new contracts, expiration of\nexisting contracts, renewals of existing contracts, industry consolidation and the volumes and prices at which the customers have recently sold to their\ncustomers. These variations are expected to continue in the foreseeable future.\nOur revenue from companies headquartered outside of the United States accounted for approximately 68% and 61% of our consolidated revenue for the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 69% and 61% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. We expect that\nrevenue derived from international customers will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenue in the future. Currently, our revenue from\ninternational customers is predominantly denominated in U.S. dollars. For additional information concerning international revenue, refer to Note 6, “Segments\nand Major Customers,” of Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q.\nThe royalties we receive from our semiconductor customers are partly a function of the adoption of our technologies by system companies. Many system\ncompanies purchase semiconductors containing our technologies from our customers and do not have a direct contractual relationship with us. Our customers\ngenerally do not provide us with details as to the identity or volume of licensed semiconductors purchased by particular system companies. As a result, we face\ndifficulty in analyzing the extent to which our future revenue will be dependent upon particular system companies. Several of our licensees have renewed or\nextended their license agreements with us during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, including Kioxia, Marvell and Nanya.\nAs a part of our overall business strategy, from time to time we evaluate businesses and technologies for potential acquisitions that are aligned with our core\nbusiness and designed to supplement our growth, including the acquisition of Hardent in the second quarter of 2022. Similarly, we evaluate our current\nbusinesses and technologies that are not aligned with our core business for potential divestiture, such as the sale of our PHY IP group to Cadence in the third\nquarter of 2023. We expect to continue to evaluate and potentially enter into strategic acquisitions or divestitures which will impact our business and operating\nresults.\n25\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage of total revenue represented by certain items reflected on our Unaudited Condensed\nConsolidated Statements of Operations:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenue:\nProduct revenue 45.6 % 49.6 % 43.9 % 50.5 %\nRoyalties 44.1 % 27.4 % 42.5 % 28.8 %\nContract and other revenue 10.3 % 23.0 % 13.6 % 20.7 %\nTotal revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 %\nCost of revenue:\nCost of product revenue 16.9 % 18.4 % 17.0 % 19.0 %\nCost of contract and other revenue 0.5 % 1.2 % 0.6 % 1.3 %\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets 1.9 % 3.2 % 2.3 % 3.1 %\nTotal cost of revenue 19.3 % 22.8 % 19.9 % 23.4 %\nGross profit 80.7 % 77.2 % 80.1 % 76.6 %\nOperating expenses (benefits):\nResearch and development 28.4 % 35.5 % 30.1 % 35.6 %\nSales, general and administrative 17.8 % 24.1 % 19.2 % 24.3 %\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets 0.1 % 0.3 % 0.1 % 0.3 %\nRestructuring and other charges (recoveries) — % (0.1)% — % 2.8 %\nGain on divestiture — % (86.3)% — % (26.8)%\nImpairment of assets — % 9.5 % 0.3 % 3.0 %\nChange in fair value of earn-out liability (3.1)% (5.4)% (1.3)% 2.4 %\nTotal operating expenses (benefits) 43.2 % (22.4)% 48.4 % 41.6 %\nOperating income 37.5 % 99.6 % 31.7 % 35.0 %\nInterest income and other income (expense), net 3.2 % 2.5 % 3.4 % 2.1 %\nLoss on fair value adjustment of derivatives, net — % — % — % (0.1)%\nInterest expense (0.2)% (0.3)% (0.3)% (0.3)%\nInterest and other income (expense), net 3.0 % 2.2 % 3.1 % 1.7 %\nIncome before income taxes 40.5 % 101.8 % 34.8 % 36.7 %\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes 7.1 % 3.8 % 5.1 % (44.6)%\nNet income 33.4 % 98.0 % 29.7 % 81.3 %\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, Change in September 30, Change in\n(Dollars in millions) 2024 2023 Percentage 2024 2023 Percentage\nTotal revenue:\nProduct revenue $ 66.4 $ 52.2 27.2 % $ 173.4 $ 170.9 1.5 %\nRoyalties 64.1 28.9 122.1 % 168.0 97.7 71.9 %\nContract and other revenue 15.0 24.2 (38.1)% 54.1 70.3 (23.0)%\nTotal revenue $ 145.5 $ 105.3 38.2 % $ 395.5 $ 338.9 16.7 %\nProduct Revenue\nProduct revenue consists of revenue from the sale of memory and security products.\nProduct revenue increased approximately $14.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. Product\nrevenue increased approximately $2.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The increases in both\nperiods were primarily due to higher sales of our memory interface chips.\n26\nGrowth in our product revenue is dependent on, among other things, the industry transition to a new generation of memory, as well as our ability to continue\nto obtain orders from customers, meet our customers’ demands and mitigate any supply chain and economic disruption.\nRoyalties\nRoyalty revenue, which includes patent and technology license royalties, increased approximately $35.2 million for the three months ended September 30,\n2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. Our royalty revenue increased approximately $70.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as\ncompared to the same period in 2023. The increases in both periods were primarily due to the timing and structure of license agreements and renewals.\nWe are continuously in negotiations for licenses with prospective customers. We expect royalty revenue will continue to vary from period to period based\non our success in adding new customers, renewing or extending existing agreements, as well as the level of variation in our customers’ reported shipment\nvolumes, sales price and product mix, offset in part by the proportion of customer payments that are fixed or hybrid in nature.\nContract and Other Revenue\nContract and other revenue consist of revenue from technology development projects. Contract and other revenue decreased approximately $9.2 million for\nthe three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. Contract and other revenue decreased approximately $16.2 million for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The decreases for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024\nas compared to the same periods in 2023 were primarily attributed to the sale of our PHY IP group in the third quarter of 2023.\nWe believe that contract and other revenue will fluctuate over time based on our ongoing technology development contractual requirements, the amount of\nwork performed, the timing of completing engineering deliverables and the changes to work required, as well as new technology development contracts booked\nin the future.\nCost of Product Revenue\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, Change in September 30, Change in\n(Dollars in millions) 2024 2023 Percentage 2024 2023 Percentage\nCost of product revenue $ 24.6 $ 19.4 26.6 % $ 67.4 $ 64.6 4.4 %\nCost of product revenue includes costs attributable to the sale of memory and security products.

Cost of contract and other revenue decreased approximately $2.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to\nthe same period in 2023. The decreases in both periods were primarily due to lower engineering services associated with the contracts.\nIn the near term, we expect costs of contract and other revenue to vary from period to period based on varying revenue recognized from contract and other\nrevenue.\n27\nResearch and Development Expenses\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, Change in September 30, Change in\n(Dollars in millions) 2024 2023 Percentage 2024 2023 Percentage\nResearch and development expenses:\nResearch and development expenses, excluding\nstock-based compensation $ 37.1 $ 34.5 7.5 % $ 107.3 $ 109.6 (2.1)%\nStock-based compensation 4.2 2.9 46.4 % 11.9 11.2 5.9 %\nTotal research and development expenses $ 41.3 $ 37.4 10.5 % $ 119.2 $ 120.8 (1.4)%\nResearch and development expenses are those expenses incurred for the development of applicable technologies.\nTotal research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased approximately $3.9 million as compared to the same\nperiod in 2023, primarily due to increases in prototyping costs of $2.0 million, stock-based compensation expenses of $1.3 million, headcount-related expenses\nof $0.8 million and facility expenses of $0.6 million, offset by a decrease in software EDA tool subscriptions of $1.1 million.\nTotal research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased approximately $1.6 million as compared to the same\nperiod in 2023, primarily due to decreases in software EDA tool subscriptions of $4.7 million, consulting expenses of $1.6 million, headcount-related expenses\nof $1.4 million, depreciation expense of $0.7 million and retention bonus expense related to acquisitions of $0.6 million, offset by increases in prototyping\ncosts of $3.4 million, lower engineering costs allocated to cost of revenue of $2.0 million, facility costs of $1.9 million and stock-based compensation expenses\nof $0.7 million. The fluctuations in both periods are primarily driven by growth in our research and development initiatives, offset by decreases attributable to\nthe sale of our PHY IP group in the third quarter of 2023.\nWe will continue to make investments in the infrastructure and technologies required to maintain our product innovation in semiconductor, security and\nother technologies.\nSales, General and Administrative Expenses\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, Change in September 30, Change in\n(Dollars in millions) 2024 2023 Percentage 2024 2023 Percentage\nSales, general and administrative expenses:\nSales, general and administrative expenses,\nexcluding stock-based compensation $ 18.2 $ 18.3 (0.6)% $ 55.2 $ 59.7 (7.5)%\nStock-based compensation 7.7 7.0 9.3 % 20.9 22.8 (8.5)%\nTotal sales, general and administrative expenses $ 25.9 $ 25.3 2.1 % $ 76.1 $ 82.5 (7.7)%\nSales, general and administrative expenses include expenses and costs associated with trade shows, public relations, advertising, litigation, general legal,\ninsurance and other sales, marketing and administrative efforts. Consistent with our business model, our licensing, sales, and marketing activities aim to\ndevelop or strengthen relationships with potential new and current customers. In addition, we work with current customers through marketing, sales and\ntechnical efforts to drive adoption of their products that use our innovations and solutions, by system companies. Due to the long business development cycles\nwe face and the semi-fixed nature of sales, general and administrative expenses in a given period, these expenses generally do not correlate to the level of\nrevenue in that period or in comparable recent or future periods.\nTotal sales, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased approximately $0.6 million as compared to the\nsame period in 2023, primarily due to increases in consulting expenses of $0.7 million, stock-based compensation expenses of $0.7 million and headcount-\nrelated expenses of $0.5 million, offset by decreases in rent and facility expenses of $0.8 million and sales and marketing activities of $0.8 million.\nTotal sales, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased approximately $6.4 million as compared to the\nsame period in 2023, primarily due to decreases in rent and facility expenses of $3.3 million, stock-based compensation expenses of $1.9 million, sales and\nmarketing activities of $0.7 million and headcount-related costs of $0.5 million, offset by increases in consulting expenses of $1.0 million and acquisition-\nrelated costs of $0.8 million.\n28\nIn the future, sales, general and administrative expenses will vary from period to period based on the trade shows, advertising, legal, acquisition, and other\nsales, marketing and administrative activities undertaken, and the change in sales, marketing and administrative headcount in any given period.\nAmortization of Acquired Intangible Assets\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, Change in September 30, Change in\n(Dollars in millions) 2024 2023 Percentage 2024 2023 Percentage\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets:\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets included\nin total cost of revenue $ 2.8 $ 3.3 (16.5)% $ 8.9 $ 10.5 (15.0)%\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets included\nin total operating expenses 0.1 0.3 (63.6)% 0.5 1.0 (53.4)%\nTotal amortization of acquired intangible assets $ 2.9 $ 3.6 (19.9)% $ 9.4 $ 11.5 (18.4)%\nAmortization expense is related to various acquired IP.\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets recognized in cost of revenue and operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024\ndecreased by approximately $0.7 million and $2.1 million, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. The decreases in both periods were primarily\ndue to the divestiture of our PHY IP group in the third quarter of 2023, which resulted in the disposal of approximately $7.4 million of net intangible assets, as\nwell as a reduction of our amortization expense as intangibles become fully amortized.\nRestructuring and Other Charges (Recoveries)\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, Change in September 30, Change in\n(Dollars in millions) 2024 2023 Percentage 2024 2023 Percentage\nRestructuring and other charges (recoveries) $ — $ (0.1) (100.0)% $ — $ 9.4 (100.0)%\nIn June 2023, we initiated a restructuring program to reduce overall expenses to improve future profitability by reducing our overall spending (the “2023\nRestructuring Plan”). In connection with this restructuring program, we initiated a plan resulting in a reduction of 42 employees. During the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, we recorded charges of approximately $9.4 million, which included an immaterial recovery of costs during the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, related to the reduction in workforce, as well as write-downs of obligations related to certain IP development costs and software licenses\nfor engineering development tools. The 2023 Restructuring Plan was substantially completed in the fourth quarter of 2023. Refer to Note 16, “Restructuring\nand Other Charges” of Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for additional information.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not initiate any restructuring programs.\nGain on Divestiture\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, Change in September 30, Change in\n(Dollars in millions) 2024 2023 Percentage 2024 2023 Percentage\nGain on divestiture\n$ — $ (90.8) (100.0)% $ — $ (90.8) (100.0)%\nIn July 2023, we entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (the “Purchaser”), pursuant to\nwhich we agreed to sell certain assets and the Purchaser agreed to assume certain liabilities from us, in each case with respect to our PHY IP group. The\ndecision to sell this portion of our business reflected the ongoing review of our core semiconductor business to focus on our development of digital IP and\nchips, including novel memory solutions for high-performance computing, to support the continued evolution of the data center and AI.\nConsequently, we recognized a gain of approximately $90.8 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Refer to Note 17,\n“Divestiture,” of Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for additional information.\n29\nImpairment of Assets\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, Change in September 30, Change in\n(Dollars in millions) 2024 2023 Percentage 2024 2023 Percentage\nImpairment of assets $ — $ 10.0 (100.0)% $ 1.1 $ 10.0 (89.3)%\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a charge of approximately $1.1 million in our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated\nStatement of Operations of this Form 10-Q, related to the write-off of certain fixed assets no longer in use and for which we determined they had no alternate\neconomic use.\nConcurrent with the sale of our PHY IP group to Cadence in the third quarter of 2023, we recorded a charge of approximately $10.0 million in our\nUnaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The charge was primarily related to\nthe accelerated amortization of software licenses that were not part of the PHY IP disposal group, but where acceleration was warranted due to the lower\nheadcount and corresponding excess capacity for such licenses. Refer to Note 17, “Divestiture,” of Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial\nStatements of this Form 10-Q for additional information.\nChange in Fair Value of Earn-Out Liability\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, Change in September 30, Change in\n(Dollars in millions) 2024 2023 Percentage 2024 2023 Percentage\nChange in fair value of earn-out liability $ (4.5) $ (5.7) (19.8)% $ (5.0) $ 8.1 (162.0)%\nThe changes in the fair value of the earn-out liability related to the 2021 acquisition of the PLDA Group (“PLDA”), which was subject to certain revenue\ntargets of the acquired business for a period of three years from the date of acquisition, and settled annually in shares of our common stock based on the fair\nvalue of that common stock fixed at the time we acquired PLDA. The fair value of the earn-out liability was remeasured each quarter, depending on the\nacquired business’s revenue performance relative to target over the applicable period, and adjusted to reflect changes in the per share value of our common\nstock.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we remeasured the fair value of the earn-out liability, which resulted in reductions of\n$4.5 million and $5.0 million, respectively, in our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations of this Form 10-Q. During the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, we remeasured the fair value of the earn-out liability, which resulted in a reduction of $5.7 million and additional expenses\nof $8.1 million, respectively, in our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations of this Form 10-Q. The final earn-out was achieved as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and is expected to be fully paid during the fourth quarter of 2024.\nInterest and Other Income (Expense), Net\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, Change in September 30, Change in\n(Dollars in millions) 2024 2023 Percentage 2024 2023 Percentage\nInterest income and other income (expense), net $ 4.7 $ 2.7 71.9 % $ 13.7 $ 7.1 92.0 %\nLoss on fair value adjustment of derivatives, net — — — % — (0.2) (100.0)%\nInterest expense (0.3) (0.3) (8.1)% (1.1) (1.1) (4.4)%\nInterest and other income (expense), net $ 4.4 $ 2.4 84.0 % $ 12.6 $ 5.8 118.6 %\nInterest income and other income (expense), net, includes interest income from our investment portfolio and from the significant financing component of\nlicensing agreements, as well as any gains or losses from the re-measurement of our monetary assets or liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. For the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, interest income and other income (expense), net, consisted primarily of interest income of $4.8 million and\n$2.5 million, respectively, generated from our investment portfolio. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, interest income and other income\n(expense), net, consisted primarily of interest income of $13.6 million and $6.4 million, respectively, generated from our investment portfolio. The increases in\ninterest income and other income (expense), net, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023 were\nprimarily due to higher interest rates within our investment portfolio, which generated a higher interest income.\n30\nThe $0.2 million loss on fair value adjustment of derivatives, net, related to the settlement of the remaining outstanding warrants in the first quarter of 2023.\nInterest expense consists primarily of interest expense associated with long-term software licenses. Interest expense remained flat for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, Change in September 30, Change in\n(Dollars in millions) 2024 2023 Percentage 2024 2023 Percentage\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes $ 10.4 $ 4.0 157.2% $ 20.1 $ (151.1) (113.3)%\nEffective tax rate 17.6 % 3.8 % 14.6 % (121.6)%\nOur provision for income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by the statutory tax expense for domestic and\nforeign jurisdictions for 2024, offset by tax benefits from excess stock-based compensation deductions. Our provision for income taxes for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 reflected an effective tax rate of 17.6% and 14.6%, respectively. The provision for income taxes for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 was primarily driven by foreign withholding taxes and adjustments to the valuation allowance release on our U.S. deferred tax assets due\nto a change in forecasted taxable income and expense, offset by tax benefits from excess stock-based compensation deductions. The benefit from income taxes\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by the valuation allowance release on our U.S. deferred tax assets, as well as tax benefits\nfrom excess stock-based compensation deductions, offset by foreign withholding taxes. Our income tax provision (benefit) for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 reflected an effective tax rate of 3.8% and (121.6)%, respectively. Our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2024, differed from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to tax benefits from excess stock-based compensation deductions. Our effective tax rate for the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2023, differed from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to the valuation allowance release on our U.S. deferred tax\nassets.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we paid foreign withholding taxes of $5.1 million and $5.4 million, respectively. During the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we paid foreign withholding taxes of $15.5 million and $15.8 million, respectively.\nWe periodically evaluate the realizability of our net deferred tax assets based on all available evidence, both positive and negative. The realizability of our\nnet deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income during periods prior to the expiration of tax attributes to fully\nutilize these assets.\nDuring the second quarter of 2023, based on all available positive and negative evidence, we determined that it was appropriate to release the valuation\nallowance on the majority of our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets. During the third quarter of 2023, we further adjusted our valuation allowance\nrelease as a result of a change in forecasted income and tax expense, primarily due to the sale of intangible assets as part of our PHY IP group divestiture.\nDuring the second quarter of 2023, we reached a cumulative income position over the previous three years. The cumulative three-year income is considered\npositive evidence, which is considered objective and verifiable, and thus received significant weighting. Additional positive evidence considered by us in our\nassessment included recent utilization of tax attribute carryforwards and future forecasts of continued profitability in the United States. Upon considering the\nrelative impact of all evidence during the second quarter of 2023, both negative and positive, and the weight accorded to each, we concluded that it was more\nlikely than not that the majority of our deferred tax assets would be realizable, with the exception of our California research and development credits that have\nnot met the “more likely than not” realization threshold criteria. As a result, we released the related valuation allowance against the majority of our federal and\nstate deferred tax assets.\nWe have U.S. federal deferred tax assets related to research and development credits, foreign tax credits and other tax attributes that can be used to offset\nU.S. federal taxable income in future periods. These credit carryforwards will expire if they are not used within certain time periods. It is possible that some or\nall of these attributes could ultimately expire unused.\n31\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n(In millions) 2024 2023\nCash and cash equivalents $ 114.0 $ 94.8\nMarketable securities 318.7 331.0\nTotal cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 432.7 $ 425.8\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(In millions) 2024 2023\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 171.6 $ 140.9\nNet cash provided by investing activities $ 13.0 $ 30.9\nNet cash used in financing activities $ (165.3) $ (165.4)\nLiquidity\nWe currently anticipate that existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and cash flows from operations will be adequate to meet our\ncash needs for at least the next 12 months. Additionally, the majority of our cash and cash equivalents is in the United States. Our cash needs for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, were funded primarily from cash collected from our customers.\nWe do not anticipate any liquidity constraints as a result of either the current credit environment or investment fair value fluctuations. Additionally, we have\nthe intent and we believe we have the ability to hold our debt investments that have unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) for a\nsufficient period of time to allow for recovery of the principal amounts invested. We continually monitor the credit risk in our portfolio and mitigate our credit\nrisk exposures in accordance with our policies.\nAs a part of our overall business strategy, from time to time we evaluate businesses and technologies for potential acquisitions that are aligned with our core\nbusiness and designed to supplement our growth.\nTo provide us with more flexibility in returning capital to our stockholders, on October 29, 2020, our Board approved a share repurchase program\nauthorizing the repurchase of up to an aggregate of 20.0 million shares (the “2020 Repurchase Program”). Share repurchases under the 2020 Repurchase\nProgram may be made through the open market, established plans or privately negotiated transactions in accordance with all applicable securities laws, rules\nand regulations. There is no expiration date applicable to the 2020 Repurchase Program. The 2020 Repurchase Program replaced the previous program\napproved by our Board in January 2015 and canceled the previous outstanding authorization. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we\nrepurchased shares of our common stock under the 2020 Repurchase Program as discussed in the “Share Repurchase Program” section below.\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities of $171.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily attributable to the cash generated\nfrom customer licensing, product sales and engineering services fees. Changes in operating assets and liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024\nprimarily included decreases in unbilled receivables and prepaids and other current assets and an increase in income taxes payable, offset by increases in\nincome taxes receivable, inventories and accounts receivable, and a decrease in accrued salaries and benefits.\nCash provided by operating activities of $140.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily attributable to the cash generated\nfrom customer licensing, product sales and engineering services fees. Changes in operating assets and liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023\nprimarily included a decrease in unbilled receivables and an increase in income taxes payable, offset by increases in income taxes receivable, inventories and\naccounts receivable, as well as decreases in accounts payable, accrued salaries and benefits and deferred revenue.\nInvesting Activities\nCash provided by investing activities of $13.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, consisted of proceeds from the maturities and sales of\navailable-for-sale marketable securities of $206.9 million and $85.7 million, respectively, and net proceeds from the sale of a non-marketable equity security of\n$22.8 million, offset by purchases of available-for-sale marketable securities of $278.2 million, and $24.2 million paid to acquire property, plant and\nequipment.\n32\nCash provided by investing activities of $30.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, consisted of proceeds from the maturities and sales of\navailable-for-sale marketable securities of $127.5 million and $117.8 million, respectively, and net proceeds from the sale of our PHY IP group of\n$106.3 million, offset by purchases of available-for-sale marketable securities of $298.3 million and $22.5 million paid to acquire property, plant and\nequipment.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used in financing activities of $165.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to an aggregate payment of\n$113.3 million as part of our 2024 ASR program and the Buying Plan (includes $0.2 million in fees related to the ASR program), $40.3 million in payments of\ntaxes on restricted stock units, and $12.7 million paid under installment payment arrangements to acquire fixed assets, offset by $3.4 million in proceeds from\nthe issuance of common stock under equity incentive plans.\nCash used in financing activities of $165.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to an aggregate payment of\n$100.3 million as part of our 2023 ASR program (includes $0.3 million in fees related to the ASR program), $36.7 million in payments of taxes on restricted\nstock units, $11.3 million paid under installment payment arrangements to acquire fixed assets, $10.7 million paid for the retirement of the remaining\noutstanding warrants, and $10.4 million in aggregate principal amount paid upon maturity of the remaining outstanding 2023 Notes, offset by $6.5 million in\nproceeds from the issuance of common stock under equity incentive plans.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of September 30, 2024, our material contractual obligations were as follows:\n(In thousands) Total Remainder of 2024 2025 2026\nContractual obligations (1) (2)\nSoftware licenses (3) $ 13,001 $ 4,044 $ 8,520 $ 437\nOther contractual obligations 300 31 131 138\nAcquisition retention bonuses (4) 275 — 275 —\nTotal $ 13,576 $ 4,075 $ 8,926 $ 575\n_________________________________________\n(1) The above table does not reflect possible payments in connection with unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $126.9 million, including $25.6 million\nrecorded as a reduction of long-term deferred tax assets and $101.3 million in long-term income taxes payable as of September 30, 2024. As noted in\nNote 14, “Income Taxes,” of Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q, although it is possible that some of the\nunrecognized tax benefits could be settled within the next 12 months, we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of the outcome at this time.\n(2) For our lease commitments as of September 30, 2024, refer to Note 9, “Leases,” of Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of\nthis Form 10-Q.\n(3) We have commitments with various software vendors for agreements generally having terms longer than one year.\n(4) In connection with the acquisitions of Hardent in the second quarter of 2022 and PLDA in the third quarter of 2021, we are obligated to pay retention\nbonuses to certain employees subject to certain eligibility and acceleration provisions, including the condition of employment.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn October 29, 2020, our Board approved the 2020 Repurchase Program authorizing the repurchase of up to an aggregate of 20.0 million shares. Share\nrepurchases under the 2020 Repurchase Program may be made through the open market, established plans or privately negotiated transactions in accordance\nwith all applicable securities laws, rules and regulations. There is no expiration date applicable to the 2020 Repurchase Program. The 2020 Repurchase\nProgram replaced the previous program approved by the Board in January 2015 and canceled the previous outstanding authorization. During the nine months\nended September 30, 2024, we repurchased shares of our common stock under the 2020 Repurchase Program as discussed below.\nOn February 29, 2024, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase program with Royal Bank of Canada (“RBC”) (the “2024 ASR Program”). The 2024\nASR Program was part of the 2020 Repurchase Program. Under the 2024 ASR Program, we pre-paid to RBC the $50.0 million purchase price for our common\nstock and, in turn, we received an initial delivery of approximately 0.7 million shares of our common stock from RBC on March 1, 2024, which were retired\nand recorded as a $40.0 million reduction to stockholders’ equity. The remaining $10.0 million of the initial payment was recorded as a reduction to\nstockholders’ equity as an unsettled forward contract indexed to our stock. On March 18, 2024, the accelerated share\n33\nrepurchase program was completed and we received an additional 0.1 million shares of our common stock, which were retired, as the final settlement of the\n2024 ASR Program.\nOn November 2, 2023, we entered into a share repurchase plan (the “Buying Plan”) with RBC Capital Markets, LLC (“RBCCM”). The Buying Plan was\npart of the 2020 Repurchase Program. Under the Buying Plan, RBCCM commenced purchases for a 12-month period starting on November 2, 2023 and ending\non November 1, 2024, with a provision to terminate sooner pursuant to the Buying Plan (the “Repurchase Period”). During the first quarter of 2024, the Buying\nPlan was amended and as a result, no purchases were made from the Buying Plan during the period from March 1, 2024 to March 28, 2024, while the 2024\nASR Program was in effect. During the third quarter of 2024, the Buying Plan was further amended to allow RBCCM to purchase an aggregate amount of\n$100.0 million of our common stock, not to exceed $50.0 million in a quarter. The execution of share repurchases is dependent on our stock price reaching\ncertain levels. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares for approximately $63.1 million as part of\nthe Buying Plan, which were retired and recorded as a reduction to stockholders’ equity.\nOn August 10, 2023, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase program with RBC (the “2023 ASR Program”). The 2023 ASR Program was part of\nthe 2020 Repurchase Program. Under the 2023 ASR Program, we pre-paid to RBC the $100.0 million purchase price for our common stock and, in turn, we\nreceived an initial delivery of approximately 1.6 million shares of our common stock from RBC on August 11, 2023, which were retired and recorded as an\n$80.0 million reduction to stockholders’ equity. The remaining $20.0 million of the initial payment was recorded as a reduction to stockholders’ equity as an\nunsettled forward contract indexed to our stock. On September 22, 2023, the accelerated share repurchase program was completed and we received an\nadditional 0.2 million shares of our common stock, which were retired, as the final settlement of the 2023 ASR Program.\nEffective January 1, 2023, our share repurchases are subject to a 1% excise tax as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. As of September 30, 2024,\nwe recorded an immaterial excise tax liability on our accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet of this Form 10-Q.\nAs of September 30, 2024, there remained an outstanding authorization to repurchase approximately 5.7 million shares of our outstanding common stock\nunder the 2020 Repurchase Program.\nWe record share repurchases as a reduction to stockholders’ equity. We record a portion of the purchase price of the repurchased shares as an increase to\naccumulated deficit when the price of the shares repurchased exceeds the average original proceeds per share received from the issuance of common stock in\naccordance with our accounting policy.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial\nStatements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial\nstatements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of\ncontingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, investments, income taxes,\nlitigation and other contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the\ncircumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from\nother sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our critical accounting estimates include those\nregarding (1) revenue recognition, (2) goodwill, (3) intangible assets, (4) income taxes, (5) stock-based compensation and (6) business combinations. For a\ndiscussion of our critical accounting estimates, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2, “Recent Accounting Pronouncements,” of Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for a\ndiscussion of recent accounting pronouncements, including the respective expected dates of adoption.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, primarily arising from the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our investment portfolio. Interest rate fluctuation\nmay arise from changes in the market’s view of the quality of the security issuer, the overall economic outlook and the time to maturity of our portfolio. We\nmitigate this risk by investing only in highly rated, liquid instruments. Securities with original maturities of one year or less must be rated by two of the three\nindustry standard rating agencies as follows: A1 by Standard & Poor’s, P1 by Moody’s and/or F-1 by Fitch. Securities with original maturities of greater\n34\nthan one year must be rated by two of the following industry standard rating agencies as follows: AA- by Standard & Poor’s, Aa3 by Moody’s and/or AA- by\nFitch. By corporate investment policy, we limit the amount of exposure to $15.0 million or 10% of the portfolio, whichever is lower, for any single non-U.S.\nGovernment issuer. A single U.S. Agency can represent up to 25% of the portfolio. No more than 20% of the total portfolio may be invested in the securities of\nan industry sector, with money market fund investments evaluated separately. Our policy requires that at least 10% of the portfolio be in securities with a\nmaturity of 90 days or less. We may make investments in time deposits, U.S. government-sponsored obligations and corporate bonds, commercial paper and\nnotes with maturities up to 36 months. We bias our investment portfolio to shorter maturities. The majority of our investments are U.S. dollar denominated.\nOur policy specifically prohibits trading securities for the sole purpose of realizing trading profits, however, we may liquidate a portion of our portfolio if\nwe experience unforeseen liquidity requirements. In such a case, if the environment has been one of rising interest rates, we may experience a realized loss.\nSimilarly, if the environment has been one of declining interest rates, we may experience a realized gain. As of September 30, 2024, we had an investment\nportfolio of fixed income marketable securities of $331.6 million, including cash equivalents and time deposits. If market interest rates were to increase\nimmediately and uniformly by 1.0% from the levels as of September 30, 2024, the fair value of the portfolio would decline by approximately $1.7 million.\nActual results may differ materially from this sensitivity analysis.\nWe invoice the majority of our customers in U.S. dollars. Although the fluctuation of currency exchange rates may impact our customers, and thus\nindirectly impact us, we do not attempt to hedge this indirect and speculative risk, other than as noted in the paragraph below. Our overseas operations consist\nprimarily of international business operations in France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, design centers in Bulgaria, Canada, India, and Finland and\nsmall business development offices in China, South Korea and Taiwan. We monitor our foreign currency exposure and, as disclosed below, we have entered\ninto foreign currency forward contracts to partially mitigate the exposure in currencies where we believed this was appropriate.\nWe have on occasion entered into foreign currency forward contracts (the “Contracts”) to manage our exposure related to certain foreign currency\ndenominated monetary assets (the “Hedging Program”) and to minimize the related impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our earnings. The hedged\nmonetary assets primarily consisted of certain euro-denominated cash and accounts receivable balances. Contracts are typically entered into at the end of a\nmonth, with an approximately one month duration at inception. As of September 30, 2024, no Contracts were outstanding and we have entered into no such\ncontracts during 2024.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit pursuant to the\nSecurities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in\nthe rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including\nour Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of\nour disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report.\nBased on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and\nprocedures were effective.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management’s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of\nthe Exchange Act during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or that we believe are reasonably likely to materially affect, our\ninternal control over financial reporting.\n35\nPART II—OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nWe are not currently a party to any material pending legal proceeding; however, from time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings or be\nsubject to claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we currently\nbelieve that the final outcome of these ordinary course matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial position or\ncash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management attention\nand resources and other factors.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other variables affecting our operating results, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of\nfuture performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. See also “Note Regarding Forward-Looking\nStatements” at the beginning of this report.\nSummary Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that you should consider before investing in our company, as fully described below. The\nprincipal factors and uncertainties that make investing in our company risky include, among others:\n• We have traditionally operated in, and may enter other, industries that are highly cyclical and competitive.\n• Much of our revenue is concentrated in a few customers, and if we lose any of these customers through contract terminations, acquisitions or other\nmeans, our revenue may decrease substantially.\n• Products that fail to meet their specifications or are defective could impose significant costs on us or result in loss of business.\n• If we do not keep pace with technological innovations or customers’ increasing technological requirements, we may not be able to enhance our existing\nproducts and our products may not be competitive, and our revenue and operating results may suffer.\n• If our customers do not incorporate our technologies into their products, or if our customers’ products are not commercially successful, our business\nwould suffer.\n• We may not be successful with new product introduction and/or expanding into new markets.\n• We purchase inventory in advance based on expected demand for our products, and if demand is not as expected, we may have insufficient or excess\ninventory, which could adversely impact our financial condition.\n• Our business is dependent on distributors to service our end customers.\n• A meaningful portion of our future revenue depends on sustaining or growing our licensing revenue and the failure to achieve such revenue would lead\nto a material decline in our results of operations.\n• Our licensing cycle is lengthy and costly, and our marketing and licensing efforts may be unsuccessful.\n• Some of our license agreements may convert from royalty generating to fully paid-up licenses at the expiration of their terms, or upon certain\nmilestones, and we may not receive royalties after that time.\n• Future revenue is difficult to predict for several reasons, and our failure to predict revenue or revenue trends accurately may result in our stock price\ndeclining.\n• We may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business, which would likely cause our stock price to decline.\n• A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from sources outside of the United States and this revenue and our business generally are subject to risks\nrelated to international operations that are often beyond our control.\n• Weak global economic conditions may adversely affect demand for the products and services of our customers and could otherwise harm our business.\n• Our operations are subject to the effects of inflation.\n• We rely on third parties for a variety of services, including manufacturing, and these third parties’ failure to perform these services adequately or change\nour allocation of their services/capacity due to industry or other pressures could materially and adversely affect our business.\n• Our business and operations could suffer in the event of physical and cybersecurity breaches and incidents.\n• We have in the past made and may in the future make acquisitions or enter into mergers, strategic investments, sales of assets, divestitures or other\narrangements that may not produce expected operational benefits or operating and financial results.\n• If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel globally, our business and operations could suffer.\n• Our operations are subject to risks of natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, widespread illness or security breaches or incidents at our domestic and\ninternational locations, any one of which could result in a business stoppage and negatively affect our operating results.\n36\n• In the future, we may fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting or adequate disclosure controls and procedures,\nwhich may result in material misstatements of our consolidated financial statements or cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations.\n• Unanticipated changes in our tax rates or in the tax laws, treaties and regulations could expose us to additional income tax liabilities, which could affect\nour operating results and financial condition.\n• We are subject to various government restrictions and regulations, including on the sale of products and services that use encryption and other\ntechnology and those related to privacy and other consumer protection matters.\n• Litigation and government proceedings could affect our business in materially negative ways.\n• If we are unable to protect our inventions successfully through the issuance and enforcement of patents, our operating results could be adversely\naffected.\n• Third parties may claim that our products or services infringe on their intellectual property (“IP”) rights, exposing us to litigation that, regardless of\nmerit, may be costly to defend.\n• Warranty, service level agreement and product liability claims brought against us could cause us to incur significant costs and adversely affect our\noperating results, as well as our reputation and relationships with customers.\n• Compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses.\nRisks Associated with Our Business, Industry and Market Conditions\nWe have traditionally operated in, and may enter other, industries that are highly cyclical and competitive.\nOur target customers are companies that develop and market high volume business and consumer products in semiconductors, computing, data centers,\nnetworks, tablets, handheld devices, mobile applications, gaming and graphics, high-definition televisions, cryptography and data security. The electronics\nindustry is intensely competitive and has been impacted by rapid technological change, short product life cycles, cyclical market patterns, price erosion and\nincreasing foreign and domestic competition. We are subject to many risks beyond our control that influence whether or not we are successful in winning target\ncustomers or retaining existing customers, including, primarily, competition in a particular industry, market acceptance of such customers’ products and the\nfinancial resources of such customers. In particular, DRAM manufacturers, which make up a significant part of our revenue, are prone to significant business\ncycles and have suffered material losses and other adverse effects to their businesses, leading to industry consolidation from time-to-time that may result in loss\nof revenue under our existing license agreements or loss of target customers. As a result of ongoing competition in the industries in which we operate and\nvolatility in various economies around the world, we may achieve reduced market share, a reduced number of licenses or may experience tightening of\ncustomers’ operating budgets, difficulty or inability of our customers to pay our licensing fees, reduction in downstream demand, lengthening of the approval\nprocess for new products and licenses and consolidation among our customers. All of these factors may adversely affect the demand for our products and\ntechnologies and may cause us to experience substantial fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition.\nWe face competition from semiconductor and digital electronics products and systems companies, and other semiconductor IP companies that provide\nsecurity and interface IP that are available to the market. We believe some of the competition for our technologies may come from our prospective customers,\nsome of which are internally evaluating and developing products based on technologies that they contend or may contend will not require a license from us.\nMany of these companies are larger and may have better access to financial, technical and other resources than we possess and may be able to develop and\nadvance competitive products more effectively.\nTo the extent that alternative technologies might provide comparable system performance at lower or similar cost to our technologies, or are perceived to\nrequire the payment of no or lower fees and/or royalties, or to the extent other factors influence the industry, our customers and prospective customers may\nadopt and promote such alternative technologies. Even to the extent we determine that such alternative technologies infringe our patents, there can be no\nassurance that we would be able to negotiate agreements that would result in royalties being paid to us without litigation, which could be costly and the results\nof which would be uncertain.\nIn addition, our efforts to introduce new products and/or expand into new markets subject us to additional risks. We may have limited or no experience in\nnew products and markets, and our customers may not adopt our new offerings and/or new customers may not adopt our offerings. These and other new\nofferings may present new and difficult challenges, which could negatively affect our operating results.\nMuch of our revenue is concentrated in a few customers, and if we lose any of these customers through contract terminations, acquisitions or other means,\nour revenue may decrease substantially.\nWe have a high degree of revenue concentration. Our top five customers represented approximately 64% and 59% of our consolidated revenue for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Additionally, our top five customers represented approximately 62% and 58% of our consolidated\nrevenue for the years ended December 31, 2023 and\n37\n2022, respectively. We expect to continue to experience significant revenue concentration for the foreseeable future. Our customers’ demand for our products\nmay fluctuate due to factors beyond our control. We could experience fluctuations in our customer base or the mix of revenue by customer as markets and\nstrategies evolve. A disruption in our relationship with any of our customers could adversely affect our business. In addition, any consolidation of our\ncustomers could reduce the number of customers to whom our products may be sold or the demand for our products. Our inability to meet our customers’\nrequirements or to qualify our products with them could adversely impact our revenue. The loss of, or restrictions on our ability to sell to, one or more of our\nmajor customers or any significant reduction in orders from, or a shift in product mix by customers, could have a material adverse effect on our operating\nresults and financial condition.\nIn addition, our license agreements are complex and some contain terms that require us to provide certain customers with the lowest royalty rate that we\nprovide to other customers for similar technologies, volumes and schedules. These clauses may limit our ability to effectively price differently among our\ncustomers, to respond quickly to market forces, or otherwise to compete on the basis of price. These clauses may also require us to reduce royalties payable by\nexisting customers when we enter into or amend agreements with other customers. Any adjustment that reduces royalties from current customers or licensees\nmay have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nWe continue to negotiate with customers and prospective customers to enter into license agreements. Any future agreement may trigger our obligation to\noffer comparable terms or modifications to agreements with our existing customers, which may be less favorable to us than the existing license terms. We\nexpect licensing fees will continue to vary based on our success in renewing existing license agreements and adding new customers, as well as the level of\nvariation in our customers’ reported shipment volumes, sales price and mix, offset in part by the proportion of customer payments that are fixed. In addition,\nour license agreements may contain rights by the customer to terminate for convenience, or upon certain other events, such as change of control, material\nbreach, insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. If we are unsuccessful in entering into license agreements with new customers or renewing license agreements\nwith existing customers, on favorable terms or at all, or if these agreements are terminated, our results of operations may decline significantly.\nSome of our revenue is subject to the pricing policies of our customers over which we have no control.\nWe have no control over our customers’ pricing of their products and there can be no assurance that licensed products will be competitively priced or will\nsell in significant volumes. Any premium charged by our customers in the price of memory and controller chips or other products over alternatives must be\nreasonable. If the benefits of our technology do not match the price premium charged by our customers, the resulting decline in sales of products incorporating\nour technology could harm our operating results.\nOur customers often require our products to undergo a lengthy and expensive qualification process which does not assure product sales. If we are\nunsuccessful or delayed in qualifying any of our products with a customer, our business and operating results would suffer.\nPrior to purchasing our products, our customers often require that our products undergo extensive qualification processes, which involve testing of our\nproducts in the customers’ systems, as well as testing for reliability. This qualification process may continue for several months. However, qualification of a\nproduct by a customer does not assure any sales of the product to that customer. Even after successful qualification and sales of a product to a customer, a\nsubsequent revision in third-party manufacturing processes or in customer requirements may require a new qualification process with our customers or changes\nto our yield or margin profiles, which may result in delays, our holding of excess or obsolete inventory, or other business challenges. After our products are\nqualified, it can take several months or more before the customer commences volume production of components or systems that incorporate our products.\nDespite these uncertainties, we devote substantial resources, including design, engineering, sales, marketing and management efforts, to qualify our products\nwith customers in anticipation of sales. If we are unsuccessful or delayed in qualifying any of our products with a customer, sales of those products to the\ncustomer may be precluded or delayed, which may impede our growth and cause our business to suffer.\nProducts that fail to meet their specifications or are defective could impose significant costs on us or result in loss of business.\nProducts that do not meet their specifications or that contain, or are perceived by our customers to contain, defects could impose significant costs on us or\notherwise materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. From time to time, we experience problems with nonconforming, defective,\nor incompatible products after we have shipped such products. In recent periods, we have further expanded our product offerings, which could potentially\nincrease the chance that one or more of our products could fail to meet specifications in a particular application. Our products and technologies may be deemed\nfully or partially responsible for functionality in our customers’ products and may result in sharing or shifting of product or financial liability from our\ncustomers to us for costs incurred by the end user as a result of our customers’ products failing to perform as specified. In addition, if our products and\ntechnologies perform critical functions in our customers’ products or are used in high-\n38\nrisk consumer end products, such as automotive products, our potential liability may increase. We could be adversely affected in several ways, including the\nfollowing:\n• we may be required or agree to compensate customers for costs incurred or damages caused by defective or incompatible products and to replace\nproducts;\n• we could incur a decrease in revenue or adjustment to pricing commensurate with the reimbursement of such costs or alleged damages;\n• we may encounter adverse publicity, which could cause a decrease in sales of our products or harm our reputation or relationships with existing or\npotential customers; and\n• our customers may reduce or cancel their orders with us or exclude us from further consideration as a supplier.\nAny of the foregoing items could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nIf we do not keep pace with technological innovations or customers’ increasing technological requirements, we may not be able to enhance our existing\nproducts and our products may not be competitive, and our revenue and operating results may suffer.\nWe operate in rapidly changing, highly competitive markets. Technological advances, the introduction of new products and new design techniques could\nadversely affect our business unless we are able to adapt to changing conditions. Technological advances could render our products and technologies less\ncompetitive or obsolete, and we may not be able to respond effectively to the technological requirements of evolving markets. We may therefore be required to\ncommit significant resources to enhancing and developing new technology, which may include purchasing or licensing advanced design tools and test\nequipment, hiring additional highly qualified engineering and other technical personnel, and continuing and expanding research and development activities on\nexisting and potential technologies.\nOur existing product offerings may present new and difficult challenges, and we may be subject to claims if customers of our offerings experience delays,\nfailures, non-performance or other quality issues. In particular, we may experience difficulties with product design, qualification, manufacturing, including\nsupply chain disruptions or shortages that might lead to an inability to meet customer demand, marketing or certification that could delay or prevent our\ndevelopment, introduction or marketing and sales of products. Although we intend to design our products to be fully compliant with applicable industry\nstandards, proprietary enhancements may not in the future result in full conformance with existing industry standards under all circumstances. Further, our\nproducts must be enhanced periodically to keep up with evolving system requirements. Our introduction of new products could reduce the demand and revenue\nof our older products or affect their pricing.\nOur research and development efforts with respect to new technologies may not result in customer or market acceptance. Some or all of those technologies\nmay not successfully make the transition from the research and development stage to cost-effective production as a result of technology problems, competitive\ncost issues, yield problems, and other factors. Even if we successfully complete a research and development effort with respect to a particular technology, our\ncustomers may decide not to introduce or may terminate products utilizing the technology for a variety of reasons, including difficulties with other suppliers of\ncomponents for the products, superior technologies developed by our competitors and unfavorable comparisons of our products with these technologies, price\nconsiderations and lack of anticipated or actual market demand for the products.\nOur business model continues to transform towards greater reliance on product revenue. We could experience a slowdown in our customers’ demand for our\nproducts in the near term; however, we anticipate our memory interface chips will contribute to continued long-term growth. If sales of our memory interface\nchips do not grow as anticipated, then our business could suffer as a result. Our business could be harmed if we are unable to develop and utilize new\ntechnologies that address the needs of our customers, or our competitors or customers develop and utilize new technologies more effectively or more quickly\nthan we can. A transition by our customers to different business models could also result in reduced revenue. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in\nkeeping pace with all, or any, of the customer trends. Any investments made to enhance or develop new technologies that are not successful could have an\nadverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nIf our customers do not incorporate our technologies into their products, or if our customers’ products are not commercially successful, our business would\nsuffer.\nWe sell our memory interface chips directly and indirectly to memory module manufacturers and OEMs worldwide for integration into server memory\nmodules. We cannot be assured that our customers’ products will be commercially successful over time or at all as a result of factors beyond our control. If\nproducts incorporating our technologies are not commercially successful or experience rapid decline, our revenue and business will suffer. Further, we are\ncontinuing to expand into new segments and if our memory interface chips fail to achieve acceptance by customers in such segments, then our business could\nsuffer as a result. Changes in our customers’ order patterns could result in us holding excess quantities of inventory which could\n39\nresult in us recording reserves for excess and obsolete inventory. Any such reserves would have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial\ncondition.\nWe purchase inventory in advance based on expected demand for our products, and if demand is not as expected, we may have insufficient or excess\ninventory, which could adversely impact our financial condition.\nAs a fabless semiconductor company, we purchase our inventory from third-party manufacturers in advance of selling our products. We place orders with\nour manufacturers based on existing and expected orders from our customers and distributors for particular products. We are also subject to increased inventory\nrisks and costs because we build our products based on forecasts provided by our customers and distributors before receiving purchase orders for the product.\nWhile most of our contracts with our customers and distributors include lead time requirements and cancellation penalties that are designed to protect us from\nmisalignment between orders and inventory levels, we must nonetheless make some predictions when we place orders with our manufacturers and we are not\nalways able to make adjustments to align with our inventory needs. Our customers and distributors may also fail to place orders or cancel orders for many\nreasons, including but not limited to trends in the global economy, business challenges, supply chain constraints, longer than expected inventory digestion or\nother changes in their business requirements. In the event that our predictions are inaccurate due to unexpected increases in orders or our manufacturers are\nunable to provide the inventory that we require, we may have insufficient inventory to meet our customers’ and distributors’ demands. In addition, a perceived\nnegative trend in market conditions could lead us to decrease the manufacturing volume of our products to avoid excess inventory. If we inaccurately assess\nmarket conditions for our products, we could have insufficient inventory to meet the demands of our customers and distributors, resulting in loss of revenue. In\nthe event that we order products that we are unable to sell due to a decrease in orders, unexpected order cancellations, import/export restrictions or product\nreturns, we may have excess inventory which, if not sold, may need to be written down or would result in a decrease in our revenue in future periods. If any of\nthese situations were to arise, it could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe markets for semiconductor products are cyclical, and increased levels of inventory may lead to overcapacity and lower prices, and conversely, if we do\nnot hold sufficient inventory, we may not be able to satisfy unexpected demand for our products.\nThe cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly. If we overbuild\ninventory in a period of decreased demand, or we expand our operations too rapidly or procure excessive resources in anticipation of increased demand for our\nproducts, and that demand does not materialize at the pace at which we expect, or declines, our operating results may be adversely affected as a result of\ncharges related to obsolete inventory, inventory write-downs, increased operating expenses or reduced margins.\nWe may in the future experience periods of inventory adjustments by our customers and distributors that may adversely affect our operating results. In\naddition, we may not be able to expand our operations in a sufficiently timely manner, procure adequate resources and raw materials, locate suitable third-party\nsuppliers or respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to demand for new products requested by our customers and/or distributors,\nand our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe periodically transition to newer generations of our semiconductor products as the market shifts to demand for such products. While we have managed\nprior product transitions and have previously sold multiple generations of products at the same time, these transitions are difficult to forecast and may result in\nunder-supply or over-supply of inventory by product generation, which may negatively impact revenue and inventory reserves.\nOur business is dependent on distributors to service our end customers.\nWe utilize distributors to sell primarily our memory interface chips to certain customers. We do not have long-term purchase commitments from our\ndistributors. If a key distributor were to experience financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, this could materially impact our financial results due to potential\nlosses from uncollectible receivables. Additionally, any oversupply of inventory at our distributors, whether due to an industry or economic downturn or other\ncauses, could result in reduced sales in a given period, increased order push-outs, increased inventory returns and cause us to carry higher levels of inventory.\nThis could result in us incurring charges for obsolete or excess inventory, or we may not fully recover our costs, which would reduce our gross margins.\nViolations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, export controls and sanction laws, or similar laws, by our distributors could also have a material adverse\nimpact on our business.\nWe may not be successful with new product introduction and/or expanding into new markets.\nVarious target markets for our products, such as artificial intelligence (“AI”), may develop slower than anticipated or could utilize competing technologies.\nThe markets for some of these products depend in part upon the continued development and\n40\ndeployment of various other technologies, which may or may not address the needs of the users of these products. We cannot predict the size or growth rate of\nthese markets or the market share we will achieve or maintain in these markets in the future.\nOur ability to generate significant revenue from new markets will depend on various factors, including the development and growth of these markets; the\nability of our technologies and products to address the needs of these markets; the price and performance requirements of our customers, and the preferences of\nend users; and our ability to provide our customers with products that provide advantages compared with alternative products.\nOur ongoing success in these markets will require us to offer better performance alternatives to other products at competitive costs. The failure of any of\nthese target markets to develop as we expect, or our failure to serve these markets to a significant extent, will impede the sales growth of products incorporating\nour technology, which could harm our operating results.\nA meaningful portion of our future revenue depends on sustaining or growing our licensing revenue and the failure to achieve such revenue would lead to\na material decline in our results of operations.\nWhile our business model continues to transform towards greater reliance on product revenue, a large portion of our revenue still consists of fees paid for\naccess to our patented technologies, existing technology and other development and support services we provide to our customers. Our ability to secure and\nrenew the licenses from which that revenue is derived depends on our customers adopting our technology and using it in the products they sell. If customers do\nnot upgrade or enhance their product offerings to include such technologies, our revenue and operating results may be adversely affected. Once secured, license\nrevenue may be negatively affected by factors within and outside our control, including reductions in our customers’ sales prices, sales volumes, our failure to\ntimely complete engineering deliverables and the actual terms of such licenses themselves. In addition, our licensing cycle for new licensees, as well as for\nrenewals for existing licensees is lengthy, costly and unpredictable. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in signing new license\nagreements or renewing existing license agreements on equal or favorable terms or at all. If we do not achieve our revenue goals, our results of operations\ncould decline.\nOur licensing cycle is lengthy and costly, and our marketing and licensing efforts may be unsuccessful.\nThe process of persuading customers to adopt and license our chip interface, data security IP and other technologies can be lengthy. Even if successful, there\ncan be no assurance that our technologies will be used in a product that is ultimately brought to market, achieves commercial acceptance or results in\nsignificant royalties to us. We generally incur significant marketing and sales expenses prior to entering into our license agreements, generating a license fee\nand establishing a royalty stream from each customer. The length of time it takes to establish a new licensing relationship can take many months or even years.\nWe may incur costs in any particular period before any associated revenue stream begins, if at all. If our marketing and sales efforts are very lengthy or\nunsuccessful, then we may face a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations as a result of failure to obtain, or an undue delay in\nobtaining, royalties.\nSome of our license agreements may convert from royalty generating to fully paid-up licenses at the expiration of their terms, or upon certain milestones,\nand we may not receive royalties after that time.\nFrom time to time, we enter into license agreements that automatically convert from royalty generating arrangements to fully paid-up licenses under which\nthe customer is no longer required to make payments for all or certain components of the licensed technology or IP upon expiration or upon reaching certain\nmilestones. We may not receive further royalties from customers for any licensed technology under those agreements if they convert to fully paid-up licenses\nbecause such customers will be entitled to continue using some, if not all, of the relevant IP or technology under the terms of the license agreements without\nfurther payment, even if relevant patents or technologies are still in effect. If we cannot find another source of royalties to replace the royalties from those\nlicense agreements that convert to fully paid-up licenses, our results of operations following such conversion could be adversely affected.\nFuture revenue is difficult to predict for several reasons, and our failure to predict revenue or revenue trends accurately may result in our stock price\ndeclining.\nAs we commercially launch each of our products, the sales volume of and resulting revenue from such products in any given period will be difficult to\npredict. Our lengthy license negotiation cycles could make a considerable portion of our future revenue difficult to predict because we may not be successful in\nentering into or renewing licenses with our customers on our anticipated timelines.\nIn addition, while some of our license agreements provide for fixed, quarterly royalty payments, many of our license agreements provide for volume-based\nroyalties and may also be subject to caps on royalties in a given period. The sales volume and prices of our customers’ products in any given period can be\ndifficult to predict.\n41\nBecause we provide memory interface chips, among others, that are used in end products and systems, demand for our products is influenced by the demand\nfor end products sold by our customers or via distributors. As a result, we may have difficulty in accurately forecasting our product revenue. Our product\nrevenue depends on the timing, scale, and speed of introductions of new end products and systems, as well as the ongoing demand for existing end products\nand systems, that incorporate our products, all of which are intrinsically difficult to forecast. In addition, demand for our products is influenced by the ability of\nour customers and distributors to manage their inventory. If our customers and distributors do not manage their inventory correctly or misjudge their customers’\ndemand, our shipments to and orders from our customers and distributors may vary significantly, and we may have difficulty forecasting our inventory levels,\nwhich could reduce our product revenue, result in inventory write offs, and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. For these reasons,\nour actual results may differ substantially from analyst estimates or our forecasts in any given quarter.\nWe may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business, which would likely cause our stock price to decline.\nWe provide guidance regarding our expected financial and business performance, including our anticipated future revenue, operating expenses and other\nfinancial and operation metrics. Correctly identifying the key factors affecting business conditions and predicting future events is an inherently uncertain\nprocess. Any guidance that we provide may not always be accurate, or may vary from actual results, due to our inability to correctly identify and quantify risks\nand uncertainties to our business and to quantify their impact on our financial performance. We offer no assurance that such guidance will ultimately be\naccurate, and investors should treat any such guidance with appropriate caution. If we fail to meet our guidance or if we find it necessary to revise such\nguidance, even if such failure or revision is seemingly insignificant, investors and analysts may lose confidence in us and the market value of our common\nstock could be materially adversely affected.\nA substantial portion of our revenue is derived from sources outside of the United States and this revenue and our business generally are subject to risks\nrelated to international operations that are often beyond our control.\nFor both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, revenue from our international customers constituted approximately 61% of our total\nconsolidated revenue. Additionally, for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, revenue from our international customers constituted approximately 62%\nand 39%, respectively, of our total consolidated revenue. We expect that future revenue derived from international sources will continue to represent a\nsignificant portion of our total revenue.\nTo the extent that customer sales are not denominated in U.S. dollars, any royalties that are based on a percentage of the customers’ sales and which we\nreceive as a result of such sales could be subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. In addition, if the effective price of licensed products sold by our\nforeign customers were to increase as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of the relevant currencies, demand for licensed products could fall, which in\nturn would reduce our royalties. From time to time, we use limited financial instruments to hedge foreign exchange rate risk, however such instruments may\nnot be sufficient to cover such risk.\nTrade-related government actions, whether implemented by the United States, China, the European Union or other countries, that impose barriers or\nrestrictions impacting our ability to sell or ship products to certain customers may have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe cannot predict the actions government entities may take in this context and may be unable to quickly offset or effectively react to government actions that\nrestrict our ability to sell to certain customers or in certain jurisdictions. Government actions that affect our customers’ ability to sell products or access critical\nelements of their supply chains may result in a decreased demand for their products, which may consequently reduce their demand for our products.\nIn addition, the U.S. government has announced controls affecting the ability to send certain products and technology related to semiconductors,\nsemiconductor manufacturing and supercomputing to China without an export license and added additional entities to restricted party lists. While the Company\ncurrently has not been materially adversely impacted by these new restrictions, we may be impacted in the future if such controls are expanded to cover our key\nproducts/markets.\nWe currently have international business, business development, and design operations in Bulgaria, Canada, China, Finland, France, India, the Netherlands,\nSouth Korea, and Taiwan. Our international operations and revenue are subject to a variety of risks that are beyond our control, including:\n• hiring, maintaining and managing a workforce and facilities remotely and under various legal systems, including compliance with local labor and\nemployment laws;\n• non-compliance with our code of conduct or other corporate policies;\n• compliance with and international laws involving international operations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, sanctions\nand anti-corruption laws, export and import laws and similar rules and regulations;\n42\n• natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, widespread global pandemics or illness, such as COVID-19 and its variants, or security breaches or incidents;\n• export controls, tariffs, import and licensing restrictions, climate-change regulations and other trade barriers;\n• profits, if any, earned abroad being subject to local tax laws and not being repatriated to the United States or, if repatriation is possible, limited in\namount;\n• adverse tax treatment of revenue from international sources and changes to tax laws and regulations, including being subject to foreign tax laws and\nbeing liable for paying withholding, income or other taxes in foreign jurisdictions;\n• longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable;\n• unanticipated changes in foreign government laws and regulations, including imposition of bans on sales of goods or services to one or more of our\nsignificant foreign customers;\n• increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n• lack of protection of our IP and other contract rights by jurisdictions in which we may do business to the same extent as the laws of the United States;\n• potential vulnerability to computer system, internet or other systemic attacks, such as denial of service, viruses or other malware which may be caused\nby criminals, terrorists or other groups or sophisticated organizations;\n• social, political and economic instability;\n• geopolitical instability, including changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, in particular with China and Taiwan, and potentially in Israel and the\nMiddle East;\n• disruptions in global logistics, including air, waterway and other delivery methods; and\n• cultural differences in the conduct of business both with customers and in conducting business in our international facilities and international sales\noffices.\nWe and our customers are subject to many of the risks described above with respect to companies which are located in different countries. There can be no\nassurance that one or more of the risks associated with our international operations will not result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition or results of operations.\nWeak global economic conditions may adversely affect demand for the products and services of our customers and could otherwise harm our business.\nOur operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions. Current and future uncertainty in the worldwide economy due to\ninflation, geopolitics, major central bank policies, including interest rate increases or related changes, public health crises or other global factors, could\nadversely affect our business. Adverse economic conditions could also affect demand for our products and our customers’ products. If our customers\nexperience reduced demand or excess inventory as a result of global or regional economic conditions or otherwise, this could result in reduced royalty revenue\nand/or product sales and our business and results of operations could be harmed. Inflationary pressures and shortages have in the past increased, and may\nincrease in the future, costs for materials, supplies and labor, which could cause our expenses to increase at a rate faster than our product pricing to recover\nsuch increases, which may further result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAdditionally, deterioration of conditions in worldwide credit markets could limit our ability to obtain external financing, if needed, to fund our operations\nand capital expenditures. In addition, we may experience losses on our holdings of cash and investments due to failures of financial institutions and other\nparties. Difficult economic conditions may also result in a higher rate of losses on our accounts receivable due to credit defaults. As a result, downturns in the\nworldwide economy could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAny failure in our delivery of high-quality technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results.\nOur customers depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues and provide ongoing maintenance relating to our products and services. We\nmay be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support services. Increased customer demand for these\nservices, without corresponding revenue, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, our sales process is highly dependent on\nour offerings and business reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing customers. Any failure to maintain high-quality technical support, or\na market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to sell our solutions to existing and\nprospective customers and our business, operating results and financial position.\n43\nOur operations are subject to the effects of inflation.\nThe United States has recently experienced historically high levels of inflation. While inflation rates have moderated in recent quarters, if the inflation rate\nincreases again as a result of increases in the costs of labor and supplies, it will affect our expenses, such as employee compensation and research and\ndevelopment charges. Research and development expenses account for a significant portion of our operating expenses. Additionally, the United States has\nrecently experienced an acute workforce shortage of qualified applicable talent, which in turn has created a competitive wage environment that may increase\nour operating costs. To the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects on the market, it may adversely affect our consolidated\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Associated with Our Supply and Third Party Manufacturing\nWe rely on third parties for a variety of services, including manufacturing, and these third parties’ failure to perform these services adequately or change\nour allocation of their services/capacity due to industry or other pressures could materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on third parties for a variety of services, including our manufacturing supply chain partners and third parties within our sales and distribution\nchannels. Some of these third parties are, and may be, our sole manufacturer or sole source of certain production materials and may be located in regions\nsubject to geopolitical uncertainty (e.g., tensions between China and Taiwan and evolving export/import restrictions). If we fail to manage our relationships\nwith these manufacturers and suppliers effectively, or if they experience delays, disruptions, geopolitical changes, capacity constraints/allocation pressures or\nquality control problems in their operations, our ability to ship products to our customers could be impaired and our competitive position and reputation could\nbe harmed. In addition, any adverse change in any of our manufacturers and suppliers’ financial or business condition could disrupt our ability to supply quality\nproducts to our customers. If we are required to change our manufacturers, we may lose revenue, incur increased costs and damage our end-customer\nrelationships. In addition, porting to and qualifying a new manufacturer and commencing production can be an expensive and lengthy process. If our third-\nparty manufacturers or suppliers are unable to provide us with adequate supplies of high-quality products for any other reason, we could experience a delay in\nour order fulfillment, and our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected. In the event these and other third parties we rely\non fail to provide their services adequately, including as a result of errors in their systems, industry pressures or events beyond their control, or refuse to\nprovide these services on terms acceptable to us, and we are not able to find suitable alternatives, our business may be materially and adversely affected. In\naddition, our orders may represent a relatively small percentage of the overall orders received by our manufacturers from their customers. As a result, fulfilling\nour orders may not be considered a priority in the event our manufacturers are constrained in their ability to fulfill all of their customer obligations in a timely\nmanner. If our manufacturers are unable to provide us with adequate supplies of high-quality products, or if we or our manufacturers are unable to obtain\nadequate quantities of components, it could cause a delay in our order fulfillment, in which case our business, operating results and financial condition could be\nadversely affected.\nSemiconductor supply chain disruptions have been well publicized in the recent past. We believe that we could experience various supply constraints related\nto our memory interface chip business in the future. For example, to the extent we do not have sufficient wafer and packaging substrate firm commitments from\nour third-party suppliers or they are otherwise unable to provide such services and materials, we may not obtain the materials needed on our desired timelines\nor at reasonable prices. Large swings in demand could exceed our contracted supply and/or our suppliers’ capacity to meet those demand changes resulting in a\nshortage of parts, materials or capacity needed to manufacture our products. While we continually work with our suppliers to mitigate the impact of the supply\nconstraints to our customer deliveries, in the event of a shortage or supply interruption from suppliers of our components, we may not be able to develop\nalternate sources quickly, cost-effectively or at all. An extended period of global supply chain and economic disruption could have a material negative impact\non our business, results of operations, access to sources of liquidity and financial condition, though the full extent and duration is uncertain.\nAdditionally, various sources of supply-chain risk, including strikes or shutdowns at delivery ports or loss of or damage to our products while they are in\ntransit or storage, IP theft, losses due to tampering, third-party vendor issues with quality or sourcing control, failure by our suppliers to comply with applicable\nlaws and regulations, potential tariffs or other trade restrictions, geopolitical uncertainty and related military actions or other similar problems could limit or\ndelay the supply of our products. Any interruption or delay in manufacturing or component supply, any increases in manufacturing or component costs, or the\ninability to obtain these services or components from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable amount of time would harm our ability to\nprovide our products to customers on a timely basis. This could harm our relationships with our customers, prevent us from acquiring new customers and\nmaterially and adversely affect our business.\n44\nIf the manufacturing and/or packaging process for our products is disrupted by operational issues, natural disasters or other events, our business, results\nof operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe rely on subcontractors to manufacture and package our products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and\ncontinuous modification. Our subcontractors maintain operations and continuously implement new product and process technology at facilities which are\ndispersed in multiple locations in Asia. As a result of the necessary interdependence within our network of manufacturing and packaging facilities, an\noperational disruption at one of our or a subcontractor’s facilities may have a disproportionate impact on our ability to produce many of our products.\nFrom time to time, there have been disruptions in our subcontractors’ operations as a result of power outages, improperly functioning equipment,\ndisruptions in supply of raw materials or components or equipment failures. Our subcontractors have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to\nnatural disasters and possible climate changes, such as severe and variable weather and geological events resulting in increased costs, or disruptions to our\nmanufacturing operations or those of our suppliers or customers. In addition, climate change may pose physical risks to our manufacturing facilities or our\nsuppliers’ facilities, including increased extreme weather events that could result in supply delays or disruptions. Other events, including political or public\nhealth crises, such as an outbreak of contagious diseases like COVID-19, may also affect our subcontractors’ production capabilities.\nIf production is disrupted for any reason, manufacturing yields may be adversely affected, or we may be unable to meet our customers’ requirements and\nthey may purchase products from other suppliers. This could result in a significant increase in manufacturing costs, loss of revenue or damage to customer\nrelationships, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on a number of third-party providers for data center hosting facilities, equipment, maintenance and other services, and the loss of, or problems\nwith, one or more of these providers may impede our growth or cause us to lose customers.\nWe rely on third-party providers to supply data center hosting facilities, equipment, maintenance and other services in order to enable us to provide some of\nour services and have entered into various agreements for such services. The continuous availability of our services depends on the operations of those\nfacilities, on a variety of network service providers and on third-party vendors. In addition, we depend on our third-party facility providers’ ability to protect\nthese facilities against damage or interruption from natural disasters, power or telecommunications failures, criminal acts, cyber-attacks and similar events. If\nthere are any lapses of service or damage to a facility, we could experience lengthy interruptions in our service, as well as delays and additional expenses in\narranging new facilities and services. Even with current and planned disaster recovery arrangements, our business could be harmed. Any interruptions or delays\nin our service, whether as a result of third-party error, our own error, natural disasters, criminal acts, security breaches or other causes, whether accidental or\nwillful, could harm our relationships with customers, harm our reputation and cause our revenue to decrease and/or our expenses to increase. Also, in the event\nof damage or interruption, our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that we may incur. These factors in turn could further reduce\nour revenue, subject us to liability and cause us to issue credits or cause us to lose customers, any of which could materially adversely affect our business.\nCertain software and/or IP blocks that we use in or with some of our products is licensed from third parties and, for that reason, may not be available to us\nin the future, which has the potential to delay product development and production or cause us to incur additional expense, which could materially\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow.\nSome of our products and services contain or function with software and/or IP blocks licensed from third parties. Some of these licenses may not be\navailable to us in the future on terms that are acceptable to us or allow our products to remain competitive. The loss of these licenses or the inability to maintain\nany of them on commercially acceptable terms could delay development of future offerings or the enhancement of existing products and services. We may also\nchoose to pay a premium price for such a license in certain circumstances where continuity of the licensed product would outweigh the premium cost of the\nlicense. The unavailability of these licenses or the necessity of agreeing to commercially unreasonable terms for such licenses could materially adversely affect\nour business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow.\nRisks Associated with Our Business Operations\nOur business and operations could suffer in the event of physical and cybersecurity breaches and incidents.\nAttempts by others to gain unauthorized access to and disrupt our information technology systems are becoming more sophisticated. These attempts, which\nmight be related to industrial or other espionage, may include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks (or those of our customers) and\nimpersonating authorized users, phishing attempts and other forms of social engineering, employee or contractor malfeasance, denial of service attacks and\nransomware attacks, among others. We seek to detect and investigate all security incidents impacting our systems and to prevent their recurrence, but\n45\nin some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. We also utilize third-party service providers to host, transmit or otherwise\nprocess electronic data in connection with our business activities, including our supply chain processes, operations and communications. Our customers also\noften have access to and host our confidential IP and business information on their own internal and directed third-party systems. We, our customers, and/or our\nthird-party service providers have faced and may continue to face security threats and attacks from a variety of sources. Our data, corporate systems, third-party\nsystems and security measures and those of our customers or the third parties that support us or our services may be subject to breaches or intrusions due to the\nactions of outside parties, employee error, malfeasance, a combination of these or otherwise, including social engineering and employee and contractor error or\nmalfeasance, especially as certain of our employees engage in work from home arrangements, and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our\nsystems, networks or data, including IP and confidential business information of ourselves and our customers. There have been and may continue to be\nsignificant supply chain attacks, and we cannot guarantee that our or our third-party service providers’ systems and networks have not been breached or that\nthey do not contain exploitable defects or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our systems and networks or the systems and networks of our\ncustomers or of third parties that support us and our services. Geopolitical tensions, instability and conflicts may increase the cybersecurity risks that we, our\ncustomers, and the third parties that support us face. We and our service providers may face difficulties or delays in identifying or responding to any actual or\nperceived security breach or incident. The theft or other unauthorized acquisition of, unauthorized use, publication or other processing of or access to our IP\nand/or confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reputation, reduce the value of our investment in research and development\nand other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business. In the event of any security breach or incident, including any breach or incident that\nresults in inappropriate access to, or loss, corruption, unavailability or unauthorized acquisition, disclosure or other processing of our or our customers’\nconfidential information or any personal information we or our third-party service providers maintain, including that of our employees, we could suffer a loss\nof IP or loss of data, may be subject to claims, liability and proceedings and may incur liability and otherwise suffer financial harm.\nAny actual, alleged or perceived breach of security in our systems or networks, or any other actual, alleged or perceived data security incident we or our\nthird-party service providers or customers suffer, could result in damage to our reputation, negative publicity, loss of customers and sales, harm to our market\nposition, increased costs to remedy any problems and otherwise respond to any incident, regulatory investigations and enforcement actions, claims, litigation,\nproceedings and other liability. In addition, we may incur significant costs and operational consequences of investigating, remediating, eliminating and putting\nin place additional tools and devices designed to prevent actual or perceived security breaches and other security incidents, as well as the costs to comply with\nany notification or other legal obligations resulting from any security incidents. Any of these negative outcomes could result in substantial costs and diversion\nof resources, distract management and technical personnel, adversely impact our sales and reputation and seriously harm our business or operating results.\nAlthough we maintain insurance coverage that may cover certain liabilities in connection with some security breaches and other security incidents, we\ncannot be certain our insurance coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on commercially\nreasonable terms (if at all) or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that\nexceed available insurance coverage, the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or\nco-insurance requirements, or denials of coverage, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition, results of operations\nand reputation.\nFailures in our products and services or in the products of our customers, including those resulting from security vulnerabilities, defects, bugs or errors,\ncould harm our business.\nOur products and services are highly technical and complex, and among our various businesses our products and services are crucial to providing security\nand other critical functions for our customers’ operations. Our products and services have from time to time contained and may in the future contain undetected\nerrors, bugs, defects or other security vulnerabilities. Some errors in our products and services may only be discovered after a product or service has been\ndeployed and used by customers and may in some cases only be detected under certain circumstances or after extended use. In addition, because the techniques\nused by hackers to access or sabotage our products and services and other technologies change and evolve frequently and generally are not recognized until\nlaunched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate, detect or prevent these techniques and may not address them in our data security technologies. Any\nerrors, bugs, defects or security vulnerabilities discovered in our solutions after commercial release could adversely affect our revenue, our customer\nrelationships and the market’s perception of our products and services. We may not be able to correct any errors, bugs, defects, security flaws or vulnerabilities\npromptly or at all. Any breaches, defects, errors or vulnerabilities in our products and services could result in:\n• expenditure of significant financial and research and development resources in efforts to analyze, correct, eliminate or work around breaches, errors,\nbugs or defects or to address and eliminate vulnerabilities;\n• financial liability to customers for breach of certain contract provisions, including indemnification obligations;\n46\n• loss of existing or potential customers;\n• product shipment restrictions or prohibitions to certain customers;\n• delayed or lost revenue;\n• delay or failure to attain market acceptance;\n• negative publicity, which would harm our reputation; and\n• litigation, regulatory inquiries or investigations that would be costly and harm our reputation.\nChanges in accounting principles and guidance could result in unfavorable accounting charges or effects.\nWe prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and these principles are subject to\ninterpretation by the SEC, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting\nprinciples and guidance. A change in these principles or application guidance, or in their interpretations, may have a material effect on our reported results, as\nwell as our processes and related controls, and may retroactively affect previously reported results.\nWe have in the past made and may in the future make acquisitions or enter into mergers, strategic investments, sales of assets, divestitures or other\narrangements that may not produce expected operational benefits or operating and financial results.\nFrom time to time, we engage in acquisitions, strategic transactions, strategic investments, divestitures and potential discussions with respect thereto. For\nexample, we acquired Hardent, Inc. in May 2022. We also divested our PHY IP group in September 2023. Many of our acquisitions or strategic investments\nentail a high degree of risk, including those involving new areas of technology and such investments may not become accretive for several years after the date\nof the investment, if at all. Our acquisitions or strategic investments may not provide the advantages that we anticipated or generate the financial returns we\nexpect, including if we are unable to close any pending acquisitions. For example, for any pending or completed acquisitions, we may discover unidentified\nissues not discovered in due diligence, and we may be subject to regulatory approvals or liabilities that are not covered by indemnification protection or\nbecome subject to litigation.\nAchieving the anticipated benefits of business acquisitions depends in part upon our ability to integrate the acquired businesses in an efficient and effective\nmanner and achieve anticipated synergies, and we may not be successful in these efforts. The integration of companies that have previously operated\nindependently is complex and time consuming and may result in significant challenges, including, among others: retaining key employees; successfully\nintegrating new employees, facilities, products, processes, operations, business models and systems, technology and sales and distribution channels; retaining\ncustomers and suppliers of the acquired business; minimizing the diversion of management’s and other employees’ attention from ongoing business matters;\ncoordinating geographically separate organizations; consolidating research and development operations; consolidating corporate and administrative\ninfrastructures; implementing controls, processes and policies appropriate for a public company at acquired companies that may have previously lacked such\ncontrols, processes and policies; and managing the increased scale, complexity and globalization of our business, operations and employee base.\nAdditional risks related to our acquisitions or strategic investments include, but are not limited to:\n• difficulty in combining the technology, products or operations of the acquired business with our business;\n• difficulty in integrating and retaining the acquired workforce, including key employees;\n• diversion of capital and other resources, including management’s attention;\n• assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of acquired assets;\n• integrating financial forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;\n• coordinating and integrating operations in countries in which we have not previously operated;\n• acquiring business challenges and risks, including, but not limited to, disputes with management and integrating international operations and joint\nventures;\n• difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return, if any return at all;\n• difficulty in obtaining or inability to obtain governmental and regulatory consents and approvals, other approvals or financing;\n• the potential impact of complying with governmental or other regulatory restrictions placed on an acquisition;\n• the potential impact on our stock price and financial results if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for an acquisition, are required to pay reverse\nbreakup fees or are otherwise unable to close an acquisition;\n• failure and costs associated with the failure to consummate a proposed acquisition or other strategic investment;\n47\n• legal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition or investment;\n• the potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities;\n• the potential variability of the amount and form of any performance-based consideration;\n• uncertainties and time needed to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment, if at all;\n• negative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our acquired business operate;\n• the need to determine an alternative strategy if an acquisition or strategic investment does not meet our expectations;\n• potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the acquired assets or company; and\n• impairment of relationships with, or loss of our acquired business’ employees, vendors and customers, as a result of our acquisition or investment.\nOur strategic investments in new areas of technology may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current\noperations, greater than expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not discovered in due diligence. These\ninvestments are inherently risky and may not be successful.\nIn addition, we may record impairment charges related to our acquisitions or strategic investments. Any losses or impairment charges that we incur related\nto acquisitions, strategic investments or sales of assets will have a negative impact on our financial results and the market value of our common stock, and we\nmay continue to incur new or additional losses related to acquisitions or strategic investments.\nWe may have to incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions, which debt could involve restrictive covenants or which equity\nsecurity issuance could be dilutive to our existing stockholders. We may also use cash to pay for any future acquisitions which will reduce our cash balance.\nFrom time to time, we may also divest certain assets. These divestitures or proposed divestitures may involve the loss of revenue and/or potential customers,\nand the market for the associated assets may dictate that we sell such assets for less than what we paid. In addition, in connection with any asset sales or\ndivestitures, we may be required to provide certain representations, warranties, licenses and/or covenants to buyers. While we would seek to ensure the\naccuracy of such representations and warranties and fulfillment of any ongoing obligations, we may not be completely successful and consequently may be\nsubject to claims by a purchaser of such assets or related erosion of revenue or loss of customers.\nIf our counterparties are unable to fulfill their financial and other obligations to us, our business and results of operations may be affected adversely.\nAny downturn in economic conditions or other business factors could threaten the financial health of our counterparties, including companies with which\nwe have entered into licensing, asset/product sale and/or settlement agreements, and their ability to fulfill their financial and other obligations to us. Such\nfinancial pressures on our counterparties may eventually lead to bankruptcy proceedings or other attempts to avoid financial obligations that are due to us.\nBecause bankruptcy courts have the power to modify or cancel contracts of the petitioner which remain subject to future performance and alter or discharge\npayment obligations related to pre-petition debts, we may receive less than all of the payments that we would otherwise be entitled to receive from any such\ncounterparty as a result of bankruptcy proceedings.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel globally, our business and operations could suffer.\nOur success is dependent upon our ability to identify, attract, compensate, motivate and retain qualified personnel, especially engineers, senior management\nand other key personnel. The loss of the services of any key employees could be disruptive to our development efforts, business relationships and strategy and\ncould cause our business and operations to suffer.\nAll of our officers and other U.S. employees are at-will employees, which means they may terminate their employment relationship with us at any time, and\ntheir knowledge of our business and industry would be extremely difficult to replace. Any changes in our senior management team in particular, even in the\nordinary course of business, may be disruptive to our business. While we seek to manage these transitions carefully, including by establishing strong processes\nand procedures and succession planning, such changes may result in a loss of institutional knowledge and cause disruptions to our business. If our senior\nmanagement team fails to work together effectively or execute our plans and strategies on a timely basis as a result of management turnover or otherwise, our\nbusiness could be harmed.\nOur future success depends in large part upon the continued service and enhancement of our management team and our employees. If there are unexpected\nchanges in management, such changes could be disruptive and could negatively affect our sales, operations, culture, future recruiting efforts and strategic\ndirection. Competition for qualified executives is intense, and if we are unable to compensate our key talent appropriately and continue expanding our\nmanagement team, or successfully\n48\nintegrate new additions to our management team in a manner that enables us to scale our business and operations effectively, our ability to operate effectively\nand efficiently could be limited or negatively impacted. In addition, changes in key management positions may temporarily affect our financial performance\nand results of operations as new management becomes familiar with our business, processes and strategy. The loss of any of our key personnel, or our inability\nto attract, integrate and retain qualified employees who join us organically and through acquisitions, could require us to dedicate significant financial and other\nresources to such personnel matters, disrupt our operations and seriously harm our operations and business.\nOur operations are subject to risks of natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, widespread illness or security breaches or incidents at our domestic and\ninternational locations, any one of which could result in a business stoppage and negatively affect our operating results.\nOur business operations depend on our ability to maintain and protect our facilities, computer systems and personnel, which are primarily located in the San\nFrancisco Bay Area in the United States, Bulgaria, Canada, France, India, the Netherlands, South Korea, and Taiwan. The San Francisco Bay Area is in close\nproximity to known earthquake fault zones and sites of recent historic wildfires. Our facilities and transportation for our employees are susceptible to damage\nfrom earthquakes and other natural disasters such as fires, floods, droughts, extreme temperatures and similar events. Should a catastrophe disable our facilities,\nwe do not have readily available alternative facilities from which we could conduct our business, so any resultant work stoppage could have a negative effect\non our operating results. We also rely on our network infrastructure and technology systems for operational support and business activities which are subject to\nphysical and cyber damage, and also susceptible to other related vulnerabilities common to networks and computer systems.\nNew epidemics, pandemics or outbreaks of novel diseases may arise at any time, and may adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many\ncountries, resulting in an economic downturn that may impact overall technology spending, demand for our products and our operating results. Furthermore,\nsuch disruption in the global financial markets may reduce our ability to access capital or our customers’ ability to pay us for past or future purchases, which\ncould negatively affect our liquidity.\nWe and our suppliers could be affected by laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change, conflict minerals, responsible\nsourcing practices, public health crises, contagious disease outbreaks or other matters, which could limit the supply of our materials and/or increase the cost.\nEnvironmental regulations could limit our ability to procure or use certain chemicals or materials in our operations or products. In addition, disruptions in\ntransportation lines could delay our receipt of materials.\nActs of terrorism, climate-change related risk, widespread illness or global pandemics, international conflict, war and any event that causes failures or\ninterruption in our network infrastructure and technology systems could have a negative effect at our international and domestic facilities and could harm our\nbusiness, financial condition and operating results.\nWe rely upon the accuracy of our customers’ recordkeeping, and any inaccuracies or payment disputes for amounts owed to us under our licensing\nagreements may harm our results of operations.\nMany of our license agreements require our customers to document the manufacture and sale of products that incorporate our technology and report this\ndata to us on a quarterly basis. While licenses with such terms give us the right to audit books and records of our customers to verify this information, audits\nrarely are undertaken because they can be expensive, time consuming and potentially detrimental to our ongoing business relationship with our customers.\nTherefore, we typically rely on the accuracy of the reports from customers without independently verifying the information in them. Our failure to audit our\ncustomers’ books and records may result in our receiving more or less royalty revenue than we are entitled to under the terms of our license agreements. If we\nconduct royalty audits in the future, such audits may trigger disagreements over contract terms with our customers and such disagreements could hamper\ncustomer relations, divert the efforts and attention of our management from normal operations and impact our business operations and financial condition.\nOur business and operating results could be harmed if we undertake any restructuring activities.\nFrom time to time, we may undertake restructurings of our business, including discontinuing certain products, services and technologies and planned\nreductions in force. There are several factors that could cause restructurings to have adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations. These include potential disruption of our operations, the development of our technology, the deliveries to our customers and other aspects of our\nbusiness. Loss of sales, service and engineering talent, in particular, could damage our business. Any restructuring would require substantial management time\nand attention and may divert management from other important work. Employee reductions or other restructuring activities also would cause us to incur\nrestructuring and related expenses such as severance expenses. Moreover, we could encounter delays in executing any restructuring plans, which could cause\nfurther disruption and additional unanticipated expense.\n49\nProblems with our information systems could interfere with our business and could adversely impact our operations.\nWe rely on our information systems and those of third parties for fulfilling licensing and contractual obligations, processing customer orders, delivering\nproducts, providing services and support to our customers, billing and tracking our customer orders, performing accounting operations and otherwise running\nour business. If our systems fail, our disaster and data recovery planning and capacity may prove insufficient to enable timely recovery of important functions\nand business records. Any disruption in our information systems and those of the third parties upon whom we rely could have a significant impact on our\nbusiness. Additionally, our information systems may not support new business models and initiatives and significant investments could be required in order to\nupgrade them. Delays in adapting our information systems to address new business models and accounting standards could limit the success or result in the\nfailure of such initiatives and impair the effectiveness of our internal controls. Even if we do not encounter these adverse effects, the implementation of these\nenhancements may be much more costly than we anticipated. If we are unable to successfully implement the information systems enhancements as planned,\nour operating results could be negatively impacted.\nCertain software we use is from open source code sources, which, under certain circumstances, may lead to unintended consequences and, therefore, could\nmaterially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow.\nWe use open source software in our services and we intend to continue to use open source software in the future. From time to time, there have been claims\nchallenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate open source software into their products or alleging that these\ncompanies have violated the terms of an open source license. As a result, we could be subject to lawsuits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to\nbe open source software or alleging that we have violated the terms of an open source license. Litigation could be costly for us to defend, have a negative effect\non our operating results and financial condition or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our solutions. In addition, if\nwe were to combine our proprietary software solutions with open source software in certain manners, we could, under certain open source licenses, be required\nto publicly release the source code of our proprietary software solutions. If we inappropriately use open source software, we may be required to re-engineer our\nsolutions, discontinue the sale of our solutions, release the source code of our proprietary software to the public at no cost or take other remedial actions. There\nis a risk that open source licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our\nsolutions, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIn the future, we may fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting or adequate disclosure controls and procedures,\nwhich may result in material misstatements of our consolidated financial statements or cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations.\nIf we are not able to comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or if we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial\nreporting and disclosure controls and procedures, we may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements or guarantee that information\nrequired to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in\nSEC rules and forms. Any failure of our internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures could result in material misstatements of\nour consolidated financial statements, which could cause our investors to lose confidence in our publicly reported information, cause the market price of our\nstock to decline, expose us to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, or impact our results of operations.\nUnanticipated changes in our tax rates or in the tax laws, treaties and regulations could expose us to additional income tax liabilities, which could affect\nour operating results and financial condition.\nWe are subject to income taxes in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide\nprovision for income taxes and, in the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is\nuncertain. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several factors, many of which are outside of our control, including changes in the mix of\nearnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, rates,\ntreaties and regulations or the interpretation of the same, changes to the financial accounting rules for income taxes, the outcome of current and future tax\naudits, examinations or administrative appeals and certain non-deductible expenses. Our tax determinations are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities and\ndevelopments in those audits could adversely affect our income tax provision, and we are currently undergoing such audits of certain of our tax returns.\nAlthough we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes may be different from what is reflected in our\nhistorical income tax provisions, which could affect our operating results.\n50\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has proposed imposing a 15% global minimum tax, and this proposal has been adopted or is\nbeing considered by a number of countries. The Inflation Reduction Act, among other changes, imposes a 1% excise tax on certain stock repurchases and a\n15% alternative minimum tax on adjusted financial statement income. If we are subject to additional tax liabilities, our financial performance may be adversely\naffected. In addition, many jurisdictions are actively considering changes to existing tax laws or have proposed or enacted new laws that could increase our tax\nobligations in countries where we do business or cause us to change the way we operate our business. Any of these developments or changes in federal, state or\ninternational tax laws or tax rulings could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our operating results.\nRisks Associated with Litigation, Regulation and Our Intellectual Property\nWe are subject to various government restrictions and regulations, including on the sale of products and services that use encryption and other technology\nand those related to privacy and other consumer protection matters.\nVarious countries have adopted controls, license requirements and restrictions on the export, import and use of products or services that contain encryption\ntechnology. In addition, governmental agencies have proposed additional requirements for encryption technology, such as requiring the escrow and\ngovernmental recovery of private encryption keys. Restrictions on the sale or distribution of products or services containing encryption technology may impact\nour ability to license data security technologies to the manufacturers and providers of such products and services in certain markets or may require us or our\ncustomers to make changes to the licensed data security technology that is embedded in such products to comply with such restrictions. Government\nrestrictions, or changes to the products or services of our customers to comply with such restrictions, could delay or prevent the acceptance and use of such\ncustomers’ products and services. In addition, the United States and other countries have imposed export controls that prohibit the export of encryption and\nother technology to certain countries, entities and individuals. Our failure to comply with export and use regulations concerning encryption technology could\nsubject us to sanctions and penalties, including fines, and suspension or revocation of export or import privileges. Additionally, climate change concerns and\nthe potential resulting environmental impact may result in new environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that may affect us, our suppliers and our\ncustomers. Such laws or regulations could cause us to incur additional direct costs for compliance, as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our\ncustomers, suppliers or both incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. These costs may adversely impact our results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States, the European Union and other countries that involve, for example, user privacy, data\nprotection and security, content and consumer protection. Privacy and data protection regimes implemented in the European Union, the United Kingdom,\nCalifornia and other jurisdictions have been enacted that include penalties for noncompliance that potentially could run into the tens of millions of dollars.\nOther jurisdictions, including numerous states, countries and the U.S. federal government, are also contemplating such legislation. Existing and potential future\nlaws and regulations relating to these matters may require us to modify our practices with respect to the collection, use, disclosure and other processing of data.\nExisting and proposed laws and regulations relating to these matters can be costly and challenging to comply with and can delay or impede the development of\nnew products, result in negative publicity, increase our operating costs and subject us to claims or other remedies.\nWe are subject to disclosure and reporting requirements for companies that use “conflict” minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and\nadjoining countries in their products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. These requirements could affect the sourcing and\navailability of minerals that are used in the manufacture of our products. We have to date incurred costs and expect to incur significant additional costs\nassociated with complying with the disclosure requirements, including for example, due diligence in regard to the sources of any conflict minerals used in our\nproducts, in addition to the cost of remediation and other changes to products, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities.\nAdditionally, we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of all minerals\nused in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement. We may also face challenges with government regulators and our customers and\nsuppliers if we are unable to sufficiently verify that the metals used in our products are conflict free.\nLitigation and government proceedings could affect our business in materially negative ways.\nWe may be subject to legal claims or regulatory matters involving consumer, stockholder, employment, competition, IP and other issues on a global basis.\nLitigation can be lengthy, expensive and disruptive to our operations, and results cannot be predicted with certainty. An adverse decision could include\nmonetary damages or, in cases for which injunctive relief is sought, an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more of our products or\ntechnologies. If we were to receive an unfavorable ruling on a matter, our business, operating results or financial condition could be materially harmed.\n51\nWe have in the past, and may in the future, become engaged in litigation stemming from our efforts to protect and enforce our patents and IP and make\nother claims, which could adversely affect our IP rights, distract our management and cause substantial expenses and declines in our revenue and stock\nprice.\nWe seek to diligently protect our IP rights and will continue to do so. While we are not currently involved in IP litigation, any future litigation, whether or\nnot determined in our favor or settled by us, would be expected to be costly, may cause delays applicable to our business (including delays in negotiating\nlicenses with other actual or potential customers), would be expected to discourage future design partners, would tend to impair adoption of our existing\ntechnologies and would divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from other business operations. In addition, we may be\nunsuccessful in any litigation if we have difficulty obtaining the cooperation of former employees and agents who were involved in our business during the\nrelevant periods related to our litigation and are now needed to assist in cases or testify on our behalf. Furthermore, any adverse determination or other\nresolution in litigation could result in our losing certain rights beyond the rights at issue in a particular case, including, among other things: our being\neffectively barred from suing others for violating certain or all of our IP rights; our patents being held invalid or unenforceable or not infringed; our being\nsubjected to significant liabilities; our being required to seek licenses from third parties; our being prevented from licensing our patented technology; or our\nbeing required to renegotiate with current customers on a temporary or permanent basis.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to proceedings by government agencies that may result in adverse determinations against us and could cause our revenue\nto decline substantially.\nAn adverse resolution by or with a governmental agency could result in severe limitations on our ability to protect and license our IP and could cause our\nrevenue to decline substantially. Third parties have and may attempt to use adverse findings by a government agency to limit our ability to enforce or license\nour patents in private litigation, to challenge or otherwise act against us with respect to such government agency proceedings.\nFurther, third parties have sought and may seek review and reconsideration of the patentability of inventions claimed in certain of our patents by the U.S.\nPatent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) and/or the European Patent Office (the “EPO”). Any re-examination or inter partes review proceedings may be\ninitiated by the USPTO’s Patent Trial and Appeal Board (“PTAB”). The PTAB and the related former Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences have\npreviously issued decisions in a few cases, finding some challenged claims of our patents to be valid and others to be invalid. Decisions of the PTAB are\nsubject to further USPTO proceedings and/or appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. A final adverse decision, not subject to further review\nand/or appeal, could invalidate some or all of the challenged patent claims and could also result in additional adverse consequences affecting other related U.S.\nor European patents, including in any IP litigation. If a significant number of such patents are impaired, our ability to enforce or license our IP would be\nsignificantly weakened and could cause our revenue to decline substantially.\nThe pendency of any governmental agency acting as described above may impair our ability to enforce or license our patents or collect royalties from\nexisting or potential customers, as any litigation opponents may attempt to use such proceedings to delay or otherwise impair any pending cases and our\nexisting or potential customers may await the final outcome of any proceedings before agreeing to new licenses or to paying royalties.\nLitigation or other third-party claims of IP infringement could require us to expend substantial resources and could prevent us from developing or\nlicensing our technology on a cost-effective basis.\nOur research and development and product programs are in highly competitive fields in which numerous third parties have issued patents and patent\napplications with claims closely related to the subject matter of our programs. We and/or our customers may be named as a defendant in lawsuits claiming that\nour technology infringes upon the IP rights of third parties. As we develop additional products and technology, we may face claims of infringement of various\npatents and other IP rights by third parties. In the event of a third-party claim or a successful infringement action against us, we may be required to pay\nsubstantial damages, to stop developing and licensing our infringing technology, to develop non-infringing technology and to obtain licenses, which could\nresult in our paying substantial royalties or our granting of cross licenses to our technologies. We may not be able to obtain licenses from other parties at a\nreasonable cost, or at all, which could cause us to expend substantial resources, or result in delays in, or the cancellation of, new products. Moreover, customers\nand/or suppliers of our products may seek indemnification for alleged infringement of IP rights. We could be liable for direct and consequential damages and\nexpenses, including attorneys’ fees. A future obligation to indemnify our customers and/or suppliers may harm our business, financial condition and operating\nresults.\n52\nIf we are unable to protect our inventions successfully through the issuance and enforcement of patents, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe have an active program to protect our proprietary inventions through the filing of patents. There can be no assurance, however, that:\n• any current or future U.S. or foreign patent applications will be approved and not be challenged by third parties;\n• our issued patents will protect our IP and not be challenged by third parties;\n• the validity of our patents will be upheld;\n• our patents will not be declared unenforceable;\n• the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to do business;\n• Congress or the U.S. courts or foreign countries will not change the nature or scope of rights afforded patents or patent owners or alter in an adverse way\nthe process for seeking or enforcing patents;\n• changes in law will not be implemented, or changes in interpretation of such laws will occur, that will affect our ability to license, protect and/or enforce\nour patents and other IP;\n• new legal theories and strategies utilized by our competitors will not be successful;\n• others will not independently develop similar or competing chip interfaces or design around any patents that may be issued to us; or\n• factors such as difficulty in obtaining cooperation from inventors, pre-existing challenges or litigation or license or other contract issues will not present\nadditional challenges in securing protection with respect to patents and other IP that we acquire.\nIf any of the above were to occur, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nFurthermore, patent reform legislation, such as the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the\nprosecution of any patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our licensed patents. The federal courts, the USPTO, the Federal Trade Commission,\nand the U.S. International Trade Commission have also recently taken certain actions and issued rulings that have been viewed as unfavorable to patentees.\nWhile we cannot predict what form any new patent reform laws or regulations may ultimately take, or what impact recent or future reforms may have on our\nbusiness, any laws or regulations that restrict or negatively impact our ability to enforce our patent rights against third parties could have a material adverse\neffect on our business.\nIn addition, our patents will continue to expire according to their terms, with expected expiration dates ranging from 2024 to 2043. Our failure to\ncontinuously develop or acquire successful innovations and obtain patents on those innovations could significantly harm our business, financial condition,\nresults of operations, or cash flows.\nOur inability to protect the IP we create and own would cause our business to suffer.\nWe rely primarily on a combination of license, development and nondisclosure agreements, trademark, trade secret and copyright law and contractual\nprovisions to protect our non-patentable IP rights. If we fail to protect these IP rights, our customers and others may seek to use our technology without the\npayment of license fees and royalties, which could weaken our competitive position, reduce our operating results and increase the likelihood of costly\nlitigation. The growth of our business depends in part on the use of our IP in the products of third-party manufacturers, and our ability to enforce IP rights\nagainst them to obtain appropriate compensation. In addition, effective trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries.\nAlthough we intend to protect our rights vigorously, if we fail or are otherwise unable to do so, our business will suffer.\nEffective protection of trademarks, copyrights, domain names, patent rights and other IP rights is expensive and difficult to maintain, both in terms of\napplication and maintenance costs, as well as the costs of defending and enforcing those rights. The efforts we have taken to protect our IP rights may not be\nsufficient or effective. Our IP rights may be infringed, misappropriated or challenged, which could result in them being narrowed in scope or declared invalid\nor unenforceable. In addition, the laws or practices of certain countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United\nStates. Significant impairments of our IP rights, and limitations on our ability to assert our IP rights against others, could have a material and adverse effect on\nour business.\nThird parties may claim that our products or services infringe on their IP rights, exposing us to litigation that, regardless of merit, may be costly to defend.\nOur success and ability to compete are also dependent upon our ability to operate without infringing upon the patent, trademark and other IP rights of\nothers. Third parties may claim that our current or future products or services infringe upon\n53\ntheir IP rights. Defense of any such claim, with or without merit, could be time consuming, divert management’s attention from our business operations and\nresult in significant expenses. We cannot assure you that we would be successful in defending against any such claims. In addition, parties making these claims\nmay be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief affecting our ability to commercialize the products that incorporate the challenged IP. As a result of\nsuch claims, we may be required to obtain licenses from third parties, develop alternative technology or redesign our products. We cannot be sure that such\nlicenses would be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. We also may not have sufficient indemnification from our applicable vendors, if any. If a\nsuccessful claim is made against us and we are unable to develop or license alternative technology, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash\nflows could be materially adversely affected.\nAny dispute regarding our products or services may require us to indemnify certain customers, the cost of which could severely hamper our business\noperations and financial condition.\nIn any potential dispute involving our products, our customers could also become the target of litigation. Some of our agreements provide for\nindemnification, and some require us to provide technical support and information to a customer that is involved in litigation involving use of our technology.\nIn addition, we may be exposed to indemnification obligations, risks and liabilities that were unknown at the time that we acquired assets or businesses for our\noperations. Any of these indemnification and support obligations could result in substantial and material expenses. In addition to the time and expense required\nfor us to indemnify or supply such support to our customers, a customer’s development, marketing and sales of licensed semiconductors, mobile\ncommunications and data security technologies could be severely disrupted or shut down as a result of litigation, which in turn could severely hamper our\nbusiness operations and financial condition as a result of lower or no royalty payments.\nWarranty, service level agreement and product liability claims brought against us could cause us to incur significant costs and adversely affect our\noperating results, as well as our reputation and relationships with customers.\nWe may from time to time be subject to warranty, service level agreement and product liability claims with regard to product performance and our services.\nWe could incur material losses as a result of warranty, support, repair or replacement costs in response to customer complaints or in connection with the\nresolution of contemplated or actual legal proceedings relating to such claims. In addition to potential losses arising from claims and related legal proceedings,\nwarranty and product liability claims could affect our reputation and our relationship with customers. We also may not have sufficient indemnification from our\napplicable vendors, if any. We generally attempt to limit the maximum amount of indemnification or liability that we could be exposed to under our contracts,\nhowever, this is not always possible.\nWe have been party to, and may in the future be subject to, lawsuits relating to securities law matters which may result in unfavorable outcomes and\nsignificant judgments, settlements and legal expenses which could cause our business, financial condition and results of operations to suffer.\nWe and certain of our current and former officers and directors have been subject to several stockholder derivative actions, securities fraud class actions\nand/or individual lawsuits filed in federal court. The complaints generally alleged that the defendants violated the federal and state securities laws and stated\nstate law claims for fraud and breach of fiduciary duty. Although to date these complaints have either been settled or dismissed, the amount of time to resolve\nany future lawsuits is uncertain, and these matters could require significant management and financial resources. Unfavorable outcomes and significant\njudgments, settlements and legal expenses in litigation related to any future securities law claims could have material adverse impacts on our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our common stock.\nParticipation in standards setting organizations may subject us to IP licensing requirements or limitations that could adversely affect our business and\nprospects.\nIn the course of our participation in the development of emerging standards for some of our present and future products, we may be obligated to grant to all\nother participants a license to our patents that are essential to the practice of those standards on reasonable and non-discriminatory, or RAND, terms, or on a\nroyalty-free basis. As a result of such obligations, we may be required to license our patents or other IP to others in the future, which could limit the value of\nthe patents and effectiveness of our patents against competitors.\n54\nRisks Associated with Capitalization Matters\nThe price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate.\nOur common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “RMBS.” The trading price of our common stock has at times\nexperienced price volatility and may continue to fluctuate significantly in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Some of these\nfactors include:\n• any progress, or lack of progress, real or perceived, in the development of products that incorporate our innovations and technology companies’\nacceptance of our products, including the results of our efforts to expand into new target markets;\n• our signing or not signing new licenses or renewing existing licenses, and the loss of strategic relationships with any customer;\n• announcements of technological innovations or new products by us, our customers or our competitors;\n• changes in our strategies, including changes in our licensing focus and/or acquisitions or dispositions of companies or businesses with business models\nor target markets different from our core;\n• changes in macroeconomic conditions, increased risk of recession and geopolitical issues, including the effects of tensions between China and Taiwan,\nand potentially in Israel and the Middle East;\n• positive or negative reports by securities analysts as to our expected financial results and business developments;\n• developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights and other events or factors;\n• new litigation and the unpredictability of litigation results or settlements;\n• repurchases of our common stock on the open market;\n• issuance of additional securities by us, including in acquisitions, or large cash payments, including in acquisitions; and\n• changes in accounting pronouncements.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and prices for companies in our industry in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that often has been\nunrelated to the operating performance of such companies. The trading price of our common stock may fluctuate widely due to various factors, including, but\nnot limited to, actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results, changes in financial forecasts or estimates by us or financial or\nother market estimates and ratings by securities and other analysts, changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the\npublic, interest rate changes, regulatory changes, news regarding our products or products of our competitors and broad market and industry fluctuations.\nInvestors in our common stock may not realize any return on their investment in us and may lose some or all of their investment. Volatility in the trading\nprice of our common stock could also result in the filing of securities class action litigation matters, which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of\nmanagement time and resources.\nCompliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses.\nChanging laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure have historically created uncertainty for companies such as\nours. Any new or changed laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations due to their lack of specificity, and as a result, their application\nin practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding\ncompliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, Delaware law, and certain other agreements contain provisions\nthat could discourage transactions resulting in a change in control, which may negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that might enable our\nmanagement to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control. In addition, these provisions could limit the price that investors would be willing to pay in the\nfuture for shares of our common stock. Pursuant to such provisions:\n• our board of directors is authorized, without prior stockholder approval, to create and issue preferred stock, commonly referred to as “blank check”\npreferred stock, with rights senior to those of common stock, which means that a stockholder rights plan could be implemented by our board;\n• our board of directors is staggered into two classes, only one of which is elected at each annual meeting;\n• stockholder action by written consent is prohibited;\n55\n• nominations for election to our board of directors and the submission of matters to be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting are subject to advance\nnotice requirements, including compliance with the “universal proxy rules” under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange\nAct”), for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings;\n• certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, such as notice to stockholders, the ability\nto call a stockholder meeting, advance notice requirements and action of stockholders by written consent may only be amended with the approval of\nstockholders holding 66 2/3% of our outstanding voting stock;\n• our stockholders have no authority to call special meetings of stockholders; and\n• our board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws.\nWe are also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which provides, subject to enumerated exceptions, that if a person acquires\n15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, the person is an “interested stockholder” and may not engage in any “business combination” with us for a period\nof three years from the time the person acquired 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States will be the\nexclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial\nforum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction,\nanother state court in Delaware or the federal district court for the District of Delaware) is the exclusive forum for the following (except for any claim as to\nwhich such court determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of such court (and the indispensable party does not consent to the\npersonal jurisdiction of such court within ten days following such determination), which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than\nsuch court or for which such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction):\n• any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of us;\n• any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty;\n• any action asserting a claim against us arising under the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our\namended and restated bylaws (as either may be amended from time to time); and\n• any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nThis provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the U.S. federal\ncourts have exclusive jurisdiction.\nOur amended and restated bylaws further provide that the federal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint\nasserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nThese exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our\ndirectors, officers or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. Any person or entity\npurchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to these provisions. There is uncertainty\nas to whether a court would enforce such provisions, and the enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies’ charter documents has\nbeen challenged in legal proceedings. It is possible that a court could find these types of provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable, and if a court were to\nfind either exclusive-forum provision in our amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs\nassociated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could seriously harm our business.\n56\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn October 29, 2020, our Board approved a share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to an aggregate of 20.0 million shares (the “2020\nRepurchase Program”). Share repurchases under the 2020 Repurchase Program may be made through the open market, established plans or privately negotiated\ntransactions in accordance with all applicable securities laws, rules and regulations. There is no expiration date applicable to the 2020 Repurchase Program.\nAs part of the 2020 Repurchase Program, in the third quarter of 2023, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase program with Royal Bank of Canada\n(“RBC”) on August 10, 2023, (the “2023 ASR Program”), which was also completed in the third quarter of 2023. In the first quarter of 2024, we entered into\nan accelerated share repurchase program with RBC on February 29, 2024 (the “2024 ASR Program”), which was also completed in the first quarter of 2024.\nOn November 2, 2023, we entered into a share repurchase plan (the “Buying Plan”) with RBC Capital Markets, LLC (“RBCCM”) as part of the broader\nshare repurchase program authorized by our Board on October 29, 2020.\nAfter giving effect to the ASR programs and the Buying Plan, detailed in the table below, there remained an outstanding authorization to repurchase\napproximately 5.7 million shares of our outstanding common stock under the 2020 Repurchase Program.\nWe record stock repurchases as a reduction to stockholders’ equity. We record a portion of the purchase price of the repurchased shares as an increase to\naccumulated deficit when the price of the shares repurchased exceeds the average original proceeds per share received from the issuance of common stock.\nMaximum Number\nTotal Number of Shares of Shares that May\nPurchased as Part of Yet be Purchased\nTotal Number of Average Price Paid Publicly Announced Under the\nPeriod Shares Purchased per Share Program Program\nCumulative shares repurchased as of December 31, 2023 12,120,419 $ 28.89 12,120,419 7,879,581\nFebruary 1, 2024 - February 29, 2024(1) 11,284 $ 54.73 11,284 7,868,297\nMarch 1, 2024 - March 31, 2024(2) 805,340 $ 62.09 805,340 7,062,957\nApril 1, 2024 - April 30, 2024(1) 94,431 $ 49.86 94,431 6,968,526\nMay 1, 2024 - May 31, 2024(1) 126,305 $ 61.69 126,305 6,842,221\nJuly 1, 2024 - July 31, 2024(1) 10,328 $ 58.09 10,328 6,831,893\nAugust 1, 2024 - August 31, 2024(1) 700,694 $ 44.37 700,694 6,131,199\nSeptember 1, 2024 - September 30, 2024(1) 461,632 $ 39.67 461,632 5,669,567\nCumulative shares repurchased as of September 30, 2024 14,330,433 14,330,433\n(1) In November 2023, we entered into a share repurchase plan (the “Buying Plan”) with RBC Capital Markets, LLC (“RBCCM”). The Buying Plan was part\nof the 2020 Repurchase Program. During the fourth quarter of 2023, an immaterial amount of shares was repurchased, retired and recorded as a reduction to\nstockholders’ equity. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased approximately $1.4 million shares for approximately $63.1 million\nas part of the Buying Plan, which were retired and recorded as a reduction to stockholders’ equity.\n(2) In February 2024, we entered into the 2024 ASR Program with RBC to repurchase an aggregate of $50.0 million of our common stock. We made an upfront\npayment of $50.0 million pursuant to the accelerated share repurchase program and received an initial delivery of approximately 0.7 million shares, which\nwere retired and recorded as a $40.0 million reduction to stockholders’ equity. The remaining $10.0 million of the initial payment was recorded as a\nreduction to stockholders’ equity as an unsettled forward contract indexed to our stock. On March 18, 2024, the accelerated share repurchase program was\ncompleted and we received an additional 0.1 million shares of our common stock, which were retired, as the final settlement of the accelerated share\nrepurchase program. The total shares of our common stock received and retired under the terms of the accelerated share repurchase program were\n0.8 million, with an average price paid per share of $62.09.\nItem 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities\nNone.\n57\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\nItem 5. Other Information\nSecurities Trading Plans of Directors and Executive Officers\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, no directors or officers, as defined in Rule 16a-1(f), adopted, modified and/or terminated a “Rule 10b5-1 trading\narrangement,” and no directors or officers, as defined in Rule 16a-1(f), adopted, modified and/or terminated a “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement,” each as\ndefined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K.\nItem 6.
