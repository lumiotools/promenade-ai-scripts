The FDA assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date of April 2, 2025. In conjunction with the acceptance of the NDA for review, Aldeyra announced the expansion of its exclusive option agreement with AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie). \n\n“Based on the FDA’s acceptance of the NDA resubmission of reproxalap for dry eye disease for review, we are pleased to announce an expansion of our option agreement with AbbVie, highlighting the commitment of both companies to accelerating the potential availability of a novel dry eye disease therapy to patients and physicians,” stated Todd C. Brady, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Aldeyra. \n\nOn October 31, 2023, Aldeyra entered into an option agreement with AbbVie. Under the terms of the agreement, AbbVie has the option to obtain a co-exclusive license to develop, manufacture, and commercialize reproxalap in the United States. Upon exercise of the option, AbbVie would pay Aldeyra a $100 million upfront cash payment, less previously paid option fees of $6 million. In addition, Aldeyra would be eligible to receive up to $300 million in regulatory and commercial milestone payments, inclusive of a $100 million milestone payment payable if the FDA approval for reproxalap for dry eye disease is received. In the United States, Aldeyra would share profits and losses with AbbVie from the commercialization of reproxalap according to a split of 60% for AbbVie and 40% for Aldeyra. \n\nPer the expansion of the option agreement, Aldeyra will initiate certain pre-commercial activities, 60% of which will be paid by AbbVie and 40% of which will be paid by Aldeyra if the option is exercised. AbbVie has also independently initiated certain pre-commercial planning activities. The parties have also agreed to amend the expiration of the option to 10 business days from the date of FDA approval, if any, of reproxalap for dry eye disease. \n\n**About Reproxalap**\n\nReproxalap is an investigational new drug candidate in development for the treatment of dry eye disease and allergic conjunctivitis, two of the largest markets in ophthalmology. Reproxalap is a first-in-class small-molecule modulator of RASP, which are elevated in ocular and systemic inflammatory diseases. The mechanism of action of reproxalap has been supported by the demonstration of statistically significant and clinically relevant activity in multiple physiologically distinct late-phase clinical indications. Reproxalap has been studied in more than 2,500 patients with no observed safety concerns; mild and transient instillation site irritation is the most commonly reported adverse event in clinical trials. \n\n**About Aldeyra**\n\nAldeyra Therapeutics is a biotechnology company devoted to discovering innovative therapies designed to treat immune-mediated and metabolic diseases. Aldeyra’s approach is to develop pharmaceuticals that modulate protein systems, instead of directly inhibiting or activating single protein targets, with the goal of optimizing multiple pathways at once while minimizing toxicity. Aldeyra’s product candidates include RASP (reactive aldehyde species) modulators ADX-629, ADX-248, ADX-743, ADX-631, and chemically related molecules for the potential treatment of systemic and retinal immune-mediated and metabolic diseases. Aldeyra’s late-stage product candidates are reproxalap, a RASP modulator for the potential treatment of dry eye disease and allergic conjunctivitis, and ADX-2191, a novel formulation of intravitreal methotrexate for the potential treatment of retinitis pigmentosa.
