(NASDAQ: CDMO) (“Avid” or the “Company”), a dedicated biologics contract development and manufacturing organization (“CDMO”) working to improve patient lives by providing high quality development and manufacturing services to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, GHO Capital Partners LLP (\"GHO\") and Ampersand Capital Partners (“Ampersand”) today announced they have entered into a definitive merger agreement for Avid to be acquired by funds managed by GHO and Ampersand in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $1.1 billion.\n\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement, GHO and Ampersand would acquire all the outstanding shares held by Avid’s stockholders for $12.50 per share in cash. The per share purchase price represents a 13.8% premium to Avid’s closing share price of $10.98 on November 6, 2024, the last full trading day prior to the transaction announcement, and a 21.9% premium to the Company's 20-day volume-weighted average share price for the period ended November 6, 2024. This transaction equates to an enterprise value of approximately $1.1 billion, a 6.3x multiple to consensus FY2025E revenue.\n\n“Since our founding, Avid Bioservices’ business has grown by evolving to meet our customers' broad range of development and manufacturing needs. After years of investment and expansion, now is the right time to move forward as a private company with new owners that will support our next phase,” stated Nick Green, president and CEO of Avid Bioservices. “In evaluating this transaction, our Board considered a range of alternatives and determined that it provides our stockholders significant, immediate and certain cash value for their shares. Partnering with GHO Capital and Ampersand Capital Partners allows us to build on our strong foundation by accessing their significant knowledge base, network and capital to position the business for the future with our customers.”\n\n“We are excited to announce this recommended cash acquisition of Avid,” said Alan MacKay and Mike Mortimer, Managing Partners of GHO. “As experienced CDMO industry investors, GHO brings deep expertise and experience to support Avid's management team going forward. Our mission at GHO is to make healthcare better, faster, and more accessible and at the heart of this is enabling efficient, high-quality manufacturing of innovative treatments. Avid exemplifies this perfectly – the Company operates in high-growth markets, producing complex biologics for leading pharmaceutical and biotech innovators at both the clinical and commercial stages. Avid’s recent investments, both in capacity and its exemplary team, position it strongly for future growth. We look forward to working with the Avid team to unlock the Company’s full potential through our established playbook of expanded offerings, talent investment and greater geographic reach.”\n\n“Avid has long been a trusted provider of biopharmaceutical development and manufacturing services, and we have tremendous respect for its team’s expertise, its broad spectrum of customized services and its strong regulatory track record. We look forward to leveraging our deep industry experience, focused strategy, and collaborative approach to drive growth,” said, David Anderson, General Partner of Ampersand.\n\n**Transaction Details**\n\nThe transaction, which was unanimously approved by the Avid Board of Directors, is currently expected to close in the first quarter of 2025, subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by Avid’s stockholders and receipt of required regulatory approvals. The transaction is not subject to a financing condition. The companies will continue to operate independently until the proposed transaction is finalized.\n\nUpon completion of the transaction, Avid common stock will no longer be listed on any public stock exchange. The Company will continue to operate under the Avid name and brand.\n\n**Advisors**\n\nMoelis & Company LLC is serving as exclusive financial advisor to Avid, and Cooley LLP is serving as legal counsel to Avid.

(NASDAQ: CDMO), a dedicated biologics contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) working to improve patient lives by providing high quality development and manufacturing services to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended July 31, 2024.\n\n**Highlights from the Quarter Ended July 31, 2024, and Other Events:**\n\n“Our first quarter continued the strong momentum we have seen since the completion of our expansion program. We are encouraged by the strong revenues and new business signings, which continue to build our backlog and improve margins,” stated Nick Green, president and CEO of Avid Bioservices.\n\n“In addition to the strong overall bookings during the quarter, it was encouraging to see the composition of signings, which included a significant number of new customers, a number of early-phase programs, and multiple late-stage programs, including two PPQ campaigns, one of which is a Phase 3 program advancing toward commercialization, and the other is a commercial product. During the quarter, we continued to record strong revenues from process development as we onboarded new business.\n\n“The investments of the last few years in infrastructure, facilities, and capacity, and the expansion of our capabilities continue to attract new business and a wider range of opportunities. Our new infrastructure and organization are now better equipped to support the needs of large pharma with the same excellence and agility that we provide smaller biotech companies. We look forward to the continued diversification of our customer base and our project pipeline with key programs from early stage to commercialization.\n\n“Looking ahead, our story remains unchanged with our primary focus on filling our remaining capacity. As we continue to sign new business, execute on our backlog and leverage our sterling reputation in the industry, we expect revenues and capacity utilization to increase, generating higher margins, and positioning Avid to achieve strong growth going forward.”\n\n**Financial Highlights and Guidance**\n\n  * The company is reiterating revenue guidance for fiscal 2025 of $160 million to $168 million.\n\n\n  * Revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 were $40.2 million, representing a 6% increase as compared to revenues of $37.7 million recorded in the same prior year period. The increase was primarily attributed to an increase in process development revenues during the period.\n\n\n  * As of July 31, 2024, the company’s backlog was $219 million, representing an increase of 16% compared to $189 million at the end of the same quarter last year. The company anticipates a significant amount of its backlog will be recognized as revenue over the next five fiscal quarters.\n\n\n  * Gross profit for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was $5.7 million (14% gross margin), compared to $4.1 million (11% gross margin) in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The increase in gross profit for the first quarter ended July 31, 2024, compared to the same prior year period was primarily driven by increased revenues and lower material costs used for customer programs, partially offset by increases in compensation and benefit related expenses, facility, manufacturing and other related expenses, and depreciation expense.\n\n\n  * SG&A expenses for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 were $8.2 million, an increase of 30% compared to $6.3 million recorded for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The increase in SG&A for the first quarter ended July 31, 2024, compared to the same prior year period was primarily due to increases in compensation and benefit related expenses and audit, legal and other consulting fees.\n\n\n  * During the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the company’s net loss was $5.5 million or $0.09 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $2.1 million or $0.03 per basic and diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\n\n  * On July 31, 2024, Avid reported cash and cash equivalents of $33.4 million, compared to $38.1 million on April 30, 2024.\n\n\n\nMore detailed financial information and analysis may be found in Avid Bioservices’ Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which is being filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission today.\n\n**Recent Corporate Developments**\n\n  * The company’s commercial team signed $66 million of net new orders during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 resulting in a backlog of $219 million and our highest net new orders signed since the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The current backlog of $219 million represents a 13% increase over fiscal 2024 year-end backlog of $193 million. These orders span a broad range of the company’s capabilities, with the significant majority representing new projects with new customers including the addition of another large pharma customer. Building a larger revenue base with larger pharma companies is one of the company’s strategic growth initiatives.\n\n\n\n**Statement Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThe company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures such as non-GAAP adjusted net income, free cash flow, as well as adjusted EBITDA. The company uses these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. The company believes that they provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of its operating performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude amounts that the company does not consider part of ongoing operating results when planning and forecasting and when assessing the performance of the organization and its senior management. The company computes non-GAAP financial measures primarily using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year, and may consider whether other significant items that arise in the future should be excluded from its non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nThe company reports non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles, differ from GAAP measures with the same names, and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar names that are used by other companies. The company believes that non-GAAP financial measures should only be used to evaluate its results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP financial measures and encourages investors to carefully consider its results under GAAP, as well as the supplemental non-GAAP information and the reconciliations between these presentations, to more fully understand its business.\n\nNon-GAAP net income (loss) excludes stock-based compensation; business transition and related costs including, but not limited to, corporate initiatives into new business activities such as severance and related expenses; non-cash interest expense on debt; and other income or expense items and is adjusted for income taxes. Adjusted EBITDA excludes non-cash operating charges for stock-based compensation, depreciation, and amortization as well as non-operating items such as interest income, interest expense, and income tax expense or benefit and is adjusted for income taxes. For the reasons explained above, adjusted EBITDA also excludes certain business transition and related costs. The company also uses measures such as free cash flow, which represents cash flow provided by or (used in) operations less cash used in the acquisition and disposition of capital.\n\nAdditionally, non-GAAP net income (loss) and adjusted EBITDA are key components of the financial metrics utilized by the company’s compensation committee to measure, in part, management’s performance and determine significant elements of management’s compensation. The company encourages investors to carefully consider its results under GAAP, as well as its supplemental non-GAAP information and the reconciliation between these presentations, to more fully understand its business. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures are included at the end of this press release.\n\n**Webcast**\n\nAvid will host a webcast on Monday, September 9, 2024, at 4:30 PM Eastern (1:30 PM Pacific).
