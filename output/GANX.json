(Nasdaq: GANX) (“Gain”, or the “Company”), a clinical-stage biotechnology company leading the discovery and development of the next generation of allosteric small molecule therapies, today reports financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, and provides a corporate update.\n\n“The third quarter of 2024 marked substantial progress for Gain and the development of GT-02287, our lead candidate for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease in patients with or without the GBA1 mutation. Data from our Phase 1 study for GT-02287 presented recently at both the [International Congress of Parkinson’s Disease and Movement Disorders](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=yEI_JG36cdPCsUB_HyDXhwuAM4pHVslKoXQ3rK-6DmLR8A26KvxePLMgbrmShDeGuRSjwaMxT4iyLCNTSUZRli1QF5IaGgVQeMZwbf-duTmgHIJrY4yrYLUIgbbbr2SvCWQFSBuj2upTa60fiHkyvQEJHSOaRCVDEkOY6jnwL-Th3AYHI6dqw62ehqAQV8HM \"International Congress of Parkinson’s Disease and Movement Disorders\") and the Michael J Fox Foundation Annual Parkinson’s Disease Therapeutics Conference demonstrated target engagement with a 53% increase in GCase activity along with favorable safety and tolerability in healthy volunteers. We believe these outcomes derisk the upcoming Phase 1b study in patients with Parkinson’s disease, which remains on track to initiate before year end 2024. We also submitted the pre-IND package for our upcoming meeting with the FDA scheduled before year end to facilitate the Phase 2 expansion of our clinical development plans for GT-02287 in 2025, moving us significantly closer to developing the first disease-modifying therapy for patients with Parkinson’s disease,” said Gene Mack, Interim CEO and CFO of Gain Therapeutics.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 and Recent Corporate Highlights**\n\n_Pipeline Updates_\n\nAnnounced positive results from the Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) part of the Phase 1 study of GT-02287, the Company’s lead candidate being evaluated for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease with or without a GBA1 mutation. Results from the study demonstrated the safety and tolerability of GT-02287 along with an increase in GCase activity of 53% in healthy volunteers. The positive results from the Phase 1 study and design of the upcoming Phase 1b clinical trial were featured at the following conferences: A late-breaker poster and oral presentation at the International Congress of Parkinson’s Disease and Movement Disorders in September 2024 in Philadelphia, PA. The poster is available [here](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=hwRQYHE1xcIEAxocqqY5r-y0DsRAEEbx3oGLVka_jbWu6TgUrccfuN_FaLeh5F9aruCjXmJFBZ_q1TUz2uLj6c_wK0oH1Zz0d-9yE76KAsWb2fDzNG4TK2guKy7N85BMBBtKA92Wl3tj5cIAFq9EKw== \"here\").An oral presentation at the Michael J.

Presented preclinical data at the Neuroscience 2024 conference in October 2024 in Chicago, IL that the Company believes further elucidates the disease modifying potential of GT-02287 by evaluating the effect of withdrawing treatment in animal models and the improvement in mitochondrial health related to administration of GT-02287. GT-02287 was shown to rescue deficits in neuromuscular function and motor coordination in animal models of GBA1 and idiopathic Parkinson’s disease models and to prevent the development of deficits in cognition and activities of daily living. Notably, withdrawal of GT-02287 for more than one week did not significantly affect performance in any of the tests, suggesting a disease-modifying effect.GT-02287 reduced the level of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as ameliorating lysosomal pathology, reducing α-synuclein aggregation, and providing a neuroprotective effect. In an  _in vivo_ model in which mice were subjected to toxic insult by CBE and injection of α-synuclein preformed fibrils (PFFs) into the striatum – delayed administration of GT-02287 reduced levels of mitochondrial protein Miro1, an important maker for mitophagy; aggregated α-synuclein and plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL), a marker of neurodegeneration; as well as completely restoring motor function to control levels. Presented poster in October 2024 in Barcelona, Spain highlighting the Company’s Magellan™ drug discovery platform to identify allosteric inhibitors targeting discoidin domain receptor 2 at the 36th EORTC-NCI-AACR Symposium. \n\n**Upcoming Milestones**\n\nInitiation of Phase 1b trial evaluating GT-02287 in Parkinson’s disease patients expected in Q4 2024Pre-IND meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) anticipated by the end of 2024 \n\n**Q3 2024 Financial Results**\n\nResearch and development expenses increased by $0.3 million to $2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $2.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily related to costs associated with the Clinical Phase 1 trial of our lead program GT-02287 for the treatment of Parkinson’s Disease.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by $0.7 million to $1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in general and administrative expenses for the period was primarily attributable to a decrease in legal and professional fees relating to general corporate matters and a decrease in stock-based compensation expenses.\n\nNet loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was $0.17 per share, basic and diluted, compared to $0.37 per share, basic and diluted, for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nCash, cash equivalent and marketable securities were $12 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $16.8 million as of December 31, 2023.\n\n**About Gain Therapeutics, Inc.** Gain Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company leading the discovery and development of next generation allosteric therapies.

ENA 2024 is being held October 23-25 in Barcelona, Spain.\n\n“We believe the identification of allosteric small molecule inhibitors targeting DDR2 validates the Company’s Magellan platform. Our belief is strengthened that this innovative approach can one day result in much-needed novel therapeutics for people with DDR2-driven malignancies,” commented Joanne Taylor, Ph.D., Senior Vice President of Research at Gain.\n\nThe poster, “Identification of allosteric inhibitors targeting Discoidin Domain Receptor 2 (DDR2),” which was presented on-site on October 23 by Sara Cano-Crespo, Ph.D., Senior Scientist of Biology at Gain, detailed how the 3D structure of DDR2 guided a high-throughput virtual screening and subsequent experimental validation that resulted in GT-03842 and additional analogue compounds. Upon binding to collagen, DDR2 undergoes autophosphorylation, triggering its activation and initiating downstream signaling cascades. After conducting a phosphorylation assay based on AlphaLISA with HEK293 cells overexpressing DDR2, GT-03842 and its analogues were found to inhibit DDR2 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner.\n\nAberrant DDR2 phosphorylation is associated with various cancer types and is involved in critical processes in tumor progression, including proliferation, migration, invasion, metastasis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and immunotherapy resistance. In a metastatic breast cancer model, GT-03842 also reduced DDR2 phosphorylation. Additionally, GT-03842 inhibits DDR2 activity without targeting the kinase domain, showing the potential to overcome resistance and offer enhanced selectivity and safety compared to traditional kinase inhibitors.\n\nA PDF of the poster presented at the 36th ENA Symposium on molecular targets and cancer therapeutics is available on the Science and Technology section of the Company’s website at [https://gaintherapeutics.com/science-and-technology/posters](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=YTNu7UPN2TpuwHuBUFxARTBef9XaUL7IvCnzh2cbKg52CER12fRkxYLBsMSpharGhHBxd3XAnw1CzjHvTGdfU2GYX88OqEkG0-YRBoW3QNra9i7LOOMmvmrSknfNLznlIIm4Y7cqCOYZMw_X-hgjdh6ANc5HXn6O3ksxO4GhD9YJYD9M2wVdUMwLSXwwje7KJFrX1F2sXs4TaeCvIt7P1dYRNtUccDgjgexd0MOKRAIeFRvqAG-3cYaszNNli9NyHdmqdfESP_rYgoCfRsZ4qwZTh1PFL6PRH5Kc8BOEWizakLzbK6q9zUTC1kGMTwVg965ydwkGQTXMoAVNkxbE8Ea16EA8irI_VjFTgee_ASvC1RXJYNc4tjAxJ3utKzNgjbVdQZYoADqz8DmVCk3BwVGMjKgiSb8VcAtddvDJjAY=).\n\n**About Gain Therapeutics, Inc.** Gain Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company leading the discovery and development of next generation allosteric therapies.
